With the assistance of heat, almost all coloured bodies are decomposed by means of oxygen.\n\nAt the temperature of 448°, wheat flour is deprived of its white colour, becomes first brown, and then changes to black. The oxygen enters into combination with the hydrogen, one of the component parts of the vegetable matter, and in this state it is driven off.\n\nThe action of light produces effects similar to those of heat. A decomposition of the colouring matter takes place by means of the light to which the body is exposed; and one of its component parts combines with oxygen. The effects of light on the colour of wood have been long observed. Wood kept in the dark retains its natural appearance; but when it is exposed to the light it becomes yellow, brown, or of some other shade. This effect is found to be subject to considerable variations in different kinds of wood, and bears some proportion to the intensity of the light. If the solution of the green part of vegetables in alcohol, which is of a fine green colour, be exposed to the light of the sun, it very soon assumes an olive hue, and in the course of a few minutes it is entirely deprived of its colour. When the light is weak the change proceeds more slowly; and if it be kept in the dark no change whatever takes place; at least it requires a great length of time. Light seems to favour the tendency to decomposition in many bodies, by producing combinations of some of their constituent principles, as when water is formed by the union of oxygen and hydrogen, or carbonic acid by the union of carbure and oxygen. Some bodies even are deprived of the whole or part of their oxygen by the action of light. Oxymuriatic acid exposed to the light, becomes common muriatic acid by losing its oxygen; and the nitrate of silver becomes black by a partial decomposition and loss of its oxygen.\n\n55. Such then seem to be the most general causes, the action of which produces changes in the colour of coloured bodies. It is either by the decomposition of the substances, in consequence of new compounds formed by the combination of some of the constituent parts; by some of these parts combining with oxygen; or by the addition or abstraction of oxygen. And to such changes colouring matters must be subjected from their compound nature; since they are most generally derived from animal or vegetable substances. The selection of such substances as resist the action of these causes, must therefore be an object of the greatest importance in the art of dyeing. A colour too which is sufficiently permanent ought to be such as will resist the action of acids, alkalies, soap, and other substances to which dyed cloth may be exposed.\n\n56. There is a great difference in colours with regard to their power of resisting the action of air and light; and as it is in this that their permanency chiefly consists, independent of their lustre, it becomes an object of great importance, to be able to ascertain by easy tests the durability or goodness of any colour. In France, where the art of dyeing was more under the regulation of government than in other countries, and a distinction was established by law between dyers of durable and fading colours, the means of ascertaining the permanency of colours became of still greater consequence. For the dyer of fading colours was subject to punishment if he produced colours which were too of colours, permanent; so rigorous and capricious were the laws, which regulated these matters. The observations of Mr Dufay on this subject laid the foundation of the regulations which were made to ascertain this point. For this purpose he made experiments by dyeing wool of all colours, with all kinds of colouring matters; and setting entirely aside the prejudices of the dyers, he collected most of the substances which he supposed might be employed in the art, and tried a great number of them, investigating their good or bad qualities with great care.\n\n57. His first experiments were made on woollen yarn; Dufay's, but finding afterwards that pieces of white cloth were more suitable to the purpose, he employed them. And that he might distinguish between permanent and fading colours, he exposed to the action of the sun and air for the space of twelve days, patterns of all colours which he had dyed with known substances. In this time durable colours were little injured, but those which were of a fading nature were almost entirely obliterated. But as the action of the sun might be less intense in cloudy weather, and thus the test would be less severe when that happened than during twelve days of bright sunshine; to obviate this inconvenience and uncertainty, he selected one of the worst colours, that is, one on which the sun had the greatest effect in the same time. This colour served as a standard in his experiments; and whenever he exposed stuffs to the air to prove the colour, he exposed a piece of this stuff along with them. He did not calculate by the number of days, but by the change on the colour of the standard stuff. For he kept the pattern exposed to the air till it had lost as much as the standard would have done by the action of the sun during twelve days in summer. He found from these experiments that it required four or five days longer in winter than in summer to produce the same effect.\n\n58. But by this method of exposure to the air he had another object in view. This was to discover the proper proof for each colour. By the application of this proof a stuff is tried whether its colour be permanent or not. The pattern for instance is boiled with alum, tartar, soap, vinegar, &c., and by the effect of these substances its quality is ascertained. But from the component parts of the substances employed being then unknown, and the imperfect state of chemical science, these proofs must appear now to have been extremely precarious and insufficient. Some which were applied, from their natural effects, destroyed good colours, and produced no effect whatever on bad colours.\n\n59. As the method he employed may suggest the means of discovering others founded on more correct principles and more accurate knowledge of the substances whose action is investigated, we shall mention the ingenious process which he followed. Having observed the effects of air and light on each colour, whether it were a good or bad colour; he tried the same stuff with different proofs, and stopped as soon as he discovered one which produced the same effects as the air. He then noted the weight of the ingredients, the quantity of water, and the length of time; and thus he was certain of producing on a colour an effect similar to that which the air would have produced, on the supposition...\nOf Colours, supposition that it was dyed in the same way with his, as was the case in France where all the processes were then regulated by law. In this way he was enabled to ascertain the qualities of any colour, by making an analysis of the ingredients of which it was composed. By means of the proofs which were invented by this ingenious chemist, as much of a colour which was not of a durable nature, could be discharged in a few minutes, as would be lost by the action of the air and light in twelve or fifteen days. But as general rules framed for such trials are liable to many exceptions, from different unavoidable causes, their application in many cases may be considered as too severe. For instance, light colours require less active proofs than those which are of a deeper dye, and are more loaded with colouring matter; in the latter case, a considerable proportion of colouring substance may be carried off without much visible change on the colour; but in the former, by means of the same active test, the colour would be entirely obliterated. Every variety of shade, therefore, would have required a separate proof. The sun and the air must always be considered as the true tests; and those colours which undergo no change in a certain time by this exposure, may be considered permanent colours, although they may be greatly changed by the application of proofs. Scarlet, which is dyed with cochineal alone, assumes a purple colour when tried by means of alum: but if scarlet be exposed to the sun, it loses some of its brightness, and becomes of a deeper shade; but this shade is different from that which is produced by alum. In certain cases then the same effect is not to be expected from the action of proofs and that of air and light.\n\n60. An experiment by Hellot is added as a farther illustration of a colour resisting the effects of exposure to the air, and yet being destroyed by the action of other substances. Brazil wood, he mentions, like other woods loaded with colour, produces a fading dye. With this he prepared a red, much finer than madder reds, and as bright as those made with kermes. This red was exposed to the air for the two last months of the year 1740, in which much rain fell, and for the two first of 1741; and notwithstanding the rain and bad weather, it was far from losing, that it gained body. Yet this red, so durable in the air, is incapable of resisting the trial by tartar. Colours then may be reckoned sufficiently durable when they resist the effects of the air, although they are decomposed or destroyed by means of powerful chemical agents. From these observations, it is therefore obvious, that the only sure mode of ascertaining the permanency of colours, is by exposing the dyed stuffs for a certain length of time to the action of light and air.\n\n61. Berthollet * proposes to employ the oxygenated muriatic acid as a quick and easy method of ascertaining the degree of durability which a colour may possess; because it acts like the air itself. When a trial is to be made on any piece of stuff, all that is necessary is to put a pattern of it into the acid, along with one of a stuff which is known to have been dyed properly. The relative power of resisting its action, which appears in the two patterns, becomes the test or measure of the quality of the colour. This liquor having a very powerful action on the colouring particles, must be employed in a very diluted state. In the use of this proof, it is attended with the advantage of exhibiting nearly the shades and changes through which a stuff must pass when it comes to be acted on by the air. Still, however, the same philosopher adds, the oxygenated muriatic acid is not to be considered as an infallible test; entire confidence can only be placed in the results obtained by the action of the air and light.\n\n62. To prove the colours of silk, it has been thought best for sufficient to expose them to heat in acetic acid or lemon juice; and those colours which stand this test are considered as permanent. When the colours have been obtained from the woods or archil alone, they are reddened by means of a vegetable acid; but if the solution of tin has been used to dye with those substances, the colour which has been prepared in an acid liquor suffers no change from vegetable acids. Thus the colour which is the least expensive in the preparation may be reckoned good by the test, although it will prove the least permanent. For silk therefore, the oxygenated muriatic acid should be employed; but more especially exposure to the air.\n\n63. It must appear an object of much importance for the dyer to be able to estimate the relative qualities of colouring substances of the same kind. The oxygenated muriatic acid may also be employed as a test for this purpose. By its use we may ascertain the proportional quantity of colouring matter in those substances, the nature of whose colouring particles is the same; as, for instance, when different parcels of indigo are to be compared together. In this case no foreign affinity can interrupt the action of the acid. And even if it should happen, that any considerable difference exists in the nature of colouring particles supposed to be the same, the action of this acid, it is probable, would still be a measure of their comparative goodness. If then it is proposed to compare together two or more colouring substances of the same nature, and to ascertain the relative quantity and quality of the colouring particles in each, all that is necessary is to compare the quantities of the same oxygenated muriatic acid which is required to produce the same degree of change in equal weights of each. For the qualities of these substances, or the quantities of colouring particles they contain, are directly proportional to the quantities of liquor required to produce the same effect on each. In conducting this experiment it is scarcely necessary to observe, that the colouring matter of each substance should be dissolved in a proper liquor, and that all the circumstances attending the comparison should be as nearly as possible the same.\n\n64. If different kinds of indigo are to be compared together, let an equal weight of each be carefully powdered, and introduced into separate matrasses with eight times their weight of concentrated sulphuric acid, and let them remain for 24 hours in a heat of from 105° to 120° Fahrenheit. Each solution is then to be diluted with water, and filtered. What remains on the filter is to be collected, ground in a glass mortar, and again digested with a little more sulphuric acid. These last solutions are then to be diluted with equal quantities of water, filtered and added to its corresponding liquor. As much oxygenated muriatic acid is then to be added to each solution as will discharge the colour, or bring them to a shade of yellow.\nThus the qualities of the different kinds of indigo may be ascertained by the quantity of oxygenated muriatic acid which is required to discharge their colour.\n\n65. The process is more simple to compare the qualities of those colouring matters which are soluble in water. To equal bulks of the decoction, containing the same weight of each substance, the oxygenated muriatic acid is added till they are all brought to the same shade; and the quality of the substance is proportionate to the quantity of acid required.\n\nCHAP. II. Of Mordants.\n\n66. The term mordant, derived from the French word *mordre*, to bite or corrode, is applied to those substances which are employed in dyeing, to facilitate or modify the combination of the colouring particles with the stuff. This name was given to these substances, from a supposed mechanical action which they produced on the substance to which the colour was communicated; and as no equivalent word has yet been proposed, the original is retained in the English language.\n\nImportance of mordants.\n\n67. The knowledge of this class of substances is not less important in the art of dyeing than that of colouring matters themselves, because on their action depend the variety, brightness, and durability of colours. The action of mordants is undoubtedly owing to chemical changes, so that more extensive observation and a complete knowledge of their effects, must greatly contribute to the improvement and perfection of the art of dyeing. It is by a new series of attractions which are introduced by their action, that the colouring particles are combined with the stuff, and the qualities and degrees of the colours are affected.\n\n68. A mordant is not always to be considered as a simple agent; for, of the different ingredients which enter into its composition, new combinations are sometimes formed, so that the substances which are immediately employed, are not the direct agents in effecting the changes, but the new compounds which are produced.\n\nMode of application.\n\n69. Mordants are applied in different ways, according to their nature, according to the nature of the colouring matter, and that of the stuff to be dyed. Sometimes they are mixed with the colouring particles, and sometimes the stuffs to which the colour is to be communicated, are impregnated with them; and sometimes both these processes are combined. In some of the more complicated operations of dyeing, substances are successively applied to stuffs in which the action of the last only produces the effect. In such cases, there is a gradual progress of combination; but it is only by the effect of the last compound which is formed, that the colour is evolved.\n\nIllustrated.\n\n70. The effects of mordants are well illustrated in many of the processes which are followed in the art of printing linen; and for the illustration of these effects, we shall extract from Berthollet a short account of some of these processes. For linens to which it is proposed to give different shades of red, the mordant employed is prepared by dissolving in eight pounds of hot water, three pounds of alum, and one pound of acetate of lead, or sugar of lead. To this solution two ounces of potash, and afterwards two ounces of powdered chalk, are to be added. Our chemical readers will readily perceive, that the first change which takes place is the decomposition of the alum, by means of the acetate of lead. The oxide of lead combines with the acid of the alum, and forms an insoluble salt, which is precipitated. The alumina which constitutes the base of the alum, unites with the acetic acid, and forms an acetate of alumina. The chalk and potash, according to Berthollet, serve to saturate the excess of acid; but it seems more probable that the addition of these substances is found necessary, on account of new decompositions which are effected by their action. Several advantages arise from the formation of the acetate of alumina, in the future changes which are to be effected. The alumina, or earthy basis of this salt, is retained in combination with the acid, by a much weaker affinity than when combined with sulphuric acid in the state of alum. Its affinity being thus weakened, it is more easily decomposed, and unites more readily with the stuff and colouring particles. Another advantage not less important is, that the effect of the acetic acid on the colouring matter being less powerful than the sulphuric acid, the acid liquor which remains after the separation of the alumina, does not produce such hurtful effects. And besides, as the acetate of alumina does not crystallize, the mordant which is thickened with starch or gum, to prepare it for being applied to the block on which the design is engraved, retains the same uniform consistence, which would not be the case if it contained alum, the latter being disposed to crystallize.\n\n71. Let us now trace the different steps of the operation in printing a piece of cloth. When it has been impregnated with the mordant, in the manner determined by the design, it is immersed into a madder bath. Thus the whole of the cloth is coloured; but the colours are deeper on those parts to which the mordant has been communicated; because in those parts the colouring particles of the madder have entered into combination with the alumina and the stuff forming a triple compound. The acetic acid separated from its earthy basis remains in the bath.\n\n72. The effect of external agents on the colouring particles in this state of combination is much less considerable than when they are in a separate state, or only combined with the stuff, without the intermediate action of another substance. It is on this property that the subsequent operations depend. Having been immersed in the madder-bath, the cloth is afterwards boiled with bran, and exposed to the open air by spreading it out on the grass; and the ultimate repetition of these operations is continued till the ground is whitened. The colouring particles of the madder which have not come in contact with the alumina are completely changed by entering into new combinations; while those which have united with it remain unaltered in consequence of the stronger affinity, so that those parts of the cloth which have been impregnated with the mordant, retain the colour and exhibit the design.\n\n73. The decomposition of the colouring particles by boiling the stuff with bran, and exposure to the air, seems to be effected in a manner similar to the destruction of the colouring matter of flax, and is to be accounted\ncounted for in the same way. In the process of bleaching, indeed, alkaline substances are employed. But for the purpose of discharging the superfluous colouring-matter from printed cloths, bran is preferred as a substitute; because part of the colouring-matter, even when fixed by alumina, would be destroyed by the stronger action of alkalis; but as the action of the bran is much weaker, it affects only the colouring particles which have not come into contact with the alumina, and which by the action of the air are disposed to undergo a more easy solution.\n\n74. Let us take another example with a different mordant. If, instead of alum, a solution of iron, as the acetate of iron, be employed, similar phenomena are exhibited. The solution of iron is decomposed by the particles of colouring-matter, and a triple compound is thus formed of the colouring-matter, the oxide of iron, and the stuff. But when this mordant is employed, a great variety of shades from brown to a deep black are obtained by the use of madder; and by a combination of alum and iron, the colours produced are of a mixed nature, inclining on the one hand to red, and to black on the other. And if another substance, as dyers-weed, be substituted for the madder, other colours are obtained. Indeed the great variety of shades which are communicated to printed stuffs are derived from the colouring-matter of madder, dyers-weed, and indigo, fixed by alumina or the oxide of iron as mordants.\n\n75. The different substances which enter into the composition of a mordant remain in combination till a new action is induced by the application of another substance. Thus, the affinity of the stuff for one of their constituent parts produces a decomposition and new combinations. But even this effect is sometimes incomplete, or does not at all take place without the action of another affinity, namely, that of the colouring-particles. We have an example of this in the mixture of alum and tartar, which is one of the most common mordants in the dyeing of wool.\n\n76. The following experiments were made by Berthollet, to ascertain the effects of these substances as mordants. He dissolved equal weights of alum and of tartar; and he found that the solubility of the tartar was increased by the mixture. By evaporation and a second crystallization, the two salts were separated, so that no decomposition had taken place. Half an ounce of alum and one ounce of wool were boiled together for an hour, a precipitate was formed, which being carefully washed, was found to consist of filaments of wool incrusted with earth. To this sulphuric acid was added, and the solution being evaporated to dryness, crystals of alum were obtained, with the separation of some particles of carbonaceous matter. The liquid in which the wool had been boiled being evaporated, yielded only a few grains of alum; what remained would not crystallize. This being redissolved and precipitated by means of an alkali, the alumina which was thrown down was of a flake colour, became black when placed on red-hot coals, and emitted alkaline vapours. In this experiment it appears that the alum was decomposed by the wool, and part of the alumina had combined with its most detached filaments which were least retained by the force of aggregation; that part of its animal substance had been dissolved and precipitated by the alkali from the triple compound.\n\n77. The same experiment was repeated with half an ounce of alum and two drams of tartar; but no precipitation followed. A small portion of the tartar, and some irregular crystals of alum were obtained by crystallization: the remainder refused to crystallize; but being diluted with water, precipitated by potash, and evaporated, it yielded a salt which burned like tartar. The wool which was boiled with the alum had a harsh feel; but the other retained all its softness. The first, after being subjected to the process of mading, had a duller and lighter tint; but the colour of the latter was fuller and brighter.\n\n78. In the first of these experiments the wool had effected a decomposition of the alum, had united with part of the alumina; and even part of the alum which retained its alumina had dissolved some portion of the animal matter. In the second experiment it appears, that the tartar and alum, between which there seems to exist a balance of affinities, can only act on each other by the intermediate action of the wool. The principal use of the tartar seems to be to moderate the action of the alum on the wool, by which it is injured. In the aluming of silk and thread, whose action on alum is less powerful than that of wool, tartar is not found requisite.\n\n79. Whatever be the mode adopted in aluming, or whatever be the chemical changes which are produced, its final effect is the union of the alumina with the stuff. At first this combination has probably been incomplete, and a partial separation only of the acids has taken place; but it is perfected after the cloth has been boiled with the madder, as appeared in the case of printed stuffs.*\n\n80. The principal substances which are employed for the purposes of mordants in the processes of dyeing, substances are earths, metallic oxides, and some astringent matters. Alumina, which is now one of the most important, and, in most general use, was very early employed as a mordant. This earth, as has been proved by direct experiment, and which is still farther confirmed by daily practice and observation, is useful in the art of dyeing, in consequence of the affinity which exists between it, the stuffs to be dyed, and the colouring matter. The affinity of alumina for animal matters, as wool and silk, is much stronger than that for vegetable productions, as cotton and linen; and hence the difference in the facility of fixing the colours on these different substances, and in their durability.\n\n81. When alumina is employed as a mordant, it is always in a state of combination, either in that of alum, which is the sulphate of alumina and potash, or united with the acetic acid, forming the acetate of alumina. Alum was employed at a very early period as a mordant. It was used by the ancients as it was found native, and therefore far from being in a state of purity. But as the nature of the constituent parts of alum was long unknown, its use in dyeing, as well as that of mordants in general, can only be ranked among the discoveries of modern chemistry. Alumina is also employed for a similar purpose, in combination with the acetic acid. This combination of alumina seems to have been first introduced about the beginning of the 18th century, and its introduction, like other valuable improvements,\n\n* Elem. of Dyeing.\nimprovements, was owing to accident. It was first employed by the calico-printers; but at what time, or by whom it was first used, is not exactly known. In one of the earliest recipes for preparing the mixtures employed as mordants in calico-printing, which Dr Bancroft, in his investigation of this subject, informs us he examined, the substances directed to be used are alum, sal ammoniac, sal petre, red orpiment, and kelp; and these were to be mixed with water. In another, which he observes probably followed this, these ingredients were to be dissolved in vinegar. Sugar-of-lead was afterwards added in small quantity, and among a great variety of other substances which were employed at different times, litharge and white-lead came into use. In cases where vinegar was employed as the solvent, after different decompositions had taken place, a portion of acetate of alumina was formed, and the use of it was found to be followed with good effects. The quantity of sugar-of-lead, from observing the advantages derived from it, was gradually increased, and the employment of many of the other substances which were found by experience to be useless, was omitted. As the introduction of acetate of alumina was at first owing to chance, and as the changes and decompositions which took place in its formation were entirely unknown, it is not to be wondered at that the discovery or invention of this substance as a mordant, should not be distinctly ascertained.\n\n82. The usual method of preparing the acetate of alumina is by pouring acetate of lead into a solution of alum. Both the salts are decomposed, by an exchange of their constituent parts. The sulphuric acid and the lead having a stronger affinity than the sulphuric acid and the alumina, combine together, and fall to the bottom in the form of an insoluble powder. The alumina at the same time enters into combination with the acetic acid, and remains dissolved in the liquid. But the application and effects of this substance in dyeing have been fully illustrated in treating of mordants in general.\n\n83. Lime is the only earth, besides alumina, which is employed in dyeing. The affinity of lime for cloth is sufficiently strong; it is, however, found to answer the purpose of a mordant less perfectly than alumina, on account of the colour, which is not so good. It is employed, either in the state of lime water, or in that of sulphate of lime dissolved in water.\n\n84. Metallic oxides have a strong affinity for animal substances. They have also so great an attraction for many colouring matters, that they separate from the acids with which they are combined, and are precipitated in combination with the colouring matters. In consequence of these different affinities, metallic oxides are of great importance in dyeing, and hence they were early applied in that art, and are now extensively used. But besides the affinity of these oxides for the colouring particles, and for animal substances, their solutions in acids possess properties by which they are more or less fit to be employed as mordants. Thus, those oxides which easily part with their acids, such as that of tin, are capable of entering into combination with animal substances, without the aid of colouring particles. All that is necessary is to impregnate the wool or the silk with a solution of tin. Some metallic substances yield only in combination, a white and colourless basis; but there are others which, by means of their own colour, produce modifications on the peculiar colour of the colouring particles. But the effects of many metallic oxides are extremely different, according to the proportion of oxygen with which they are combined; and this proportion is variable.\n\n85. The affinity of metallic oxides for vegetable matters is considerably weaker than that which they have for animal substances. Metallic solutions, therefore, are found not to answer so well as mordants for colours in dyeing cotton or linen. Iron, indeed, is an exception, the oxide of which, it is well known, has a strong affinity for vegetable substances. Iron moulds on cotton or linen are owing to a combination of the oxide of iron with the vegetable matter.\n\n86. Although almost all metallic oxides have an affinity for animal and vegetable matters, and might therefore be employed as mordants, yet two only, either because they are found to answer the purpose better, or because they are cheaper, are used to any extent. These are the oxides of tin and of iron.\n\n87. The use of the oxide of tin seems to have been oxide of first discovered by a German chemist of the name of tin. Kuster or Kuster. Observing the effects of a solution of tin in nitric acid, in giving a more vivid colour to stuffs dyed with cochineal, he was led to the discovery of the method of producing what has since been denominated cochineal scarlet. This discovery has been ascribed by others to Drebel, a Dutch chemist; and Macquer, who is of this opinion, supposes that the first solutions of tin were made with nitro-muriatic acid; but Dr Bancroft thinks that there is good reason to believe, that nitric acid only was used for some years for this purpose. According to Mr Delaval, the use of tin in dyeing was known to the ancients; and he supposes that the tin which the Phoenicians carried from Britain, was employed in this way, because he thinks that it is necessary to the production of red colours, whether from animal or vegetable matter. Dr Bancroft, however, has proved, that this opinion is founded in mistake.\n\n88. About the year 1543, Kuster brought his secret to London, and it appears that it was first employed for this purpose at Bow. Hence the scarlet colour thus produced was denominated in this country the Bow dye. It seems too, that this mode of dyeing scarlet was very early introduced into Holland. A Frenchman of the name of Gobelin, received an account of the process from a Flemish painter called Kloek, to whom it had been communicated by Kuster himself, and established it in France. Hence the Bow dye of England was known in other parts of Europe under the names of Dutch scarlet, scarlet of the Gobelins.\n\n89. We have mentioned above, that the effects of metallic oxides as mordants in dyeing, depend on the different proportions of oxygen with which they may be combined. Thus, there are two oxides of tin containing different proportions of oxygen; the one contains 30 parts of oxygen in the 100, and the other contains 40. The oxide having the smaller proportion of oxygen, by being exposed to the air combines with a new portion of oxygen, and is soon converted into the oxide with the greater proportion, or the white oxide. It is\nthis last which is the mordant, for if the other were applied to the stuff, it would soon be converted into the white oxide, by combining with an additional portion of oxygen.\n\n90. Tin was first used as a mordant dissolved in nitric acid; but this preparation was found not to answer well, because the nitric acid readily converted the tin to the state of white oxide, in which state it is incapable of dissolving it. A precipitation of the tin took place, to prevent which, different substances were added, as common salt, or sal ammoniac; and thus a nitro-muriatic acid was produced, by which means the white oxide of tin was held in solution. It appears, however, that it was a considerable time before this method came into general use. Hellot, in an account of the process employed in his time for dyeing lcearlet at Carcassonne, mentions that the tin was dissolved only in diluted nitric acid, adding that a Mr Baron was the first in that city who employed nitro-muriatic acid for the solution of tin, to prevent the precipitation of the oxide.\n\n91. The ordinary solution of tin is made with that species of nitric acid called single aquafortis, and as it is usually prepared, it is found capable of dissolving about \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) part of its weight of granulated tin. To each pound of aquafortis from one to two ounces of sea salt, or, what is deemed preferable by some, of sal ammoniac, are added. The acid is commonly diluted with a little water. The solutions which are made most slowly, and with the least separation of vapours, are found to succeed best. Two ounces of granulated tin are usually allowed for each pound of aquafortis; and the metal should be added at different times, to moderate the rapidity of the solution. The water added to the acid should be weighed or measured, that a solution of the same strength may be always obtained. Eighteen or 20 pounds of this solution (A) are required to give a full cochineal scarlet to 100 pounds of woollen cloth.\n\n92. But in the dyeing of scarlet, according to the ordinary process, a quantity of tartar is dissolved in the water, along with the nitromuriate of tin; and if the tartar be employed in sufficient quantity, the mordant is not to be considered as a nitromuriate of tin, but a tartrate or combination of tin with tartaric acid, in consequence of the decomposition which takes place, when these substances are brought to act on each other; for the nitromuriatic acid enters into combination with the potash or the tartar, while the acid of the tartar forms a compound with the oxide of tin.\n\n93. It has been proposed by Hauffman to employ the acetate of tin as a mordant for cotton and linen, instead of the nitromuriate. The acetate of tin is prepared by mixing together acetate of lead and nitromuriate of tin; and as the affinity between metallic oxides and vegetable substances is less powerful than the affinity between these oxides and animal matters, this mordant has been found preferable for cotton and linen stuffs; for the affinity of the oxide of tin for the acetic acid being weaker than for the nitromuriatic acid, it is more easily decomposed.\n\n94. Dr Bancroft tried the solution of tin in sulphuric acid, but found that it would not answer, on account of its destructive action on the cochineal colour; but he found afterwards, that, by the use of muriatic of perm. acid combined with \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) its weight of sulphuric acid, good effects were obtained. The proportions which he employed were about 14 ounces of tin in a mixture of 2 pounds of sulphuric acid of the ordinary strength, with about 3 pounds of muriatic acid. This preparation may be made in the cold; but the solution is very rapidly promoted with a sand heat. The solution of tin made in these proportions, Dr Bancroft observes, is perfectly transparent and colourless; and in the space of three years, during which time he kept a solution of it, no precipitation had taken place. It produces, he adds, full twice as much effect as the dyer's spirit, or nitromuriatic solution of tin, and at less than one-third of the expense.\n\n95. Iron exists in two states of combination with oxide of oxygen. In the state of green oxide it contains the iron smaller proportion of oxygen, and in that of red oxide the greater proportion. In the last state it can only be employed as a mordant in dyeing; for if it be applied in the state of green oxide, in consequence of its strong affinity for oxygen, it attracts it from the atmosphere, and is soon converted into red oxide. The difficulty of removing iron spots or mould from cotton or linen shows with what force of affinity the red oxide of iron adheres to cloth. Iron is employed as a mordant in two states of combination, either in that of phosphate or acetate of iron. The sulphate of iron is generally employed for wool. The stuff is immersed in the solution of the salt in water. In this state it may be also used for cotton; but it is more commonly preferred in the state of acetate of iron. This is the combination of iron with the acetic acid, and it is usually prepared by dissolving iron in vinegar or sour beer; and the longer it is retained in the solution, it is found to act more powerfully as a mordant, because it is then in a state of more complete oxidation.\n\n96. Some other saline bodies are also employed as mordants, to facilitate the combination of the colouring matter with the cloth, or to produce greater variety of shades of colour. Among these substances may be mentioned common salt, sal ammoniac, acetate of lead, sulphate and acetate of copper, sulphate of zinc.\n\n97. Besides the mordants obtained from the clats of Animal salts, vegetable and animal substances also serve a similar and vegetable purpose. In the process for dyeing the Turkey red, which will be afterwards described, the cotton stuffs should be impregnated with an animal substance, as oil; and the astringent principle is often employed as a medium of combination between colouring particles and stuffs. Tan, or the astringent principle, having a strong affinity for cloth, is found extremely useful as a mordant. It is commonly prepared by infusing nut-galls in water. The cloth is immersed in this solution, and allowed to remain till it is sufficiently impregnated with the tan. Sumach, which is the shoots of the Rhus coriaria Lin. a shrub, which grows in the southern parts of\n\n(a) This solution is called spirit by the dyers in this country.\nof Europe, is often used and prepared in the same way as the nut-galls.\n\n98. Mordants have a very considerable effect on the colour; and, by varying the mordant, very different colours, and a great variety of shades, may be obtained from the same colouring matter. Some mordants themselves may be considered as communicating a colour without the addition of any colouring substance; and although, when the latter is added, a new set of affinities is brought into action, yet there is little doubt that the mordant also has a considerable share in fixing the shades of colour. Let us take an example in dyeing with cochineal. When the aluminous mordant is employed, the colour produced is crimson; but when the oxide of iron is substituted for the alumina, the colour obtained is black. This effect is obviously produced by a change in the action of the affinities between the colouring matter and the mordant, and the colouring matter and light. In the use of mordants, therefore, it is necessary to attend to their combined effects with the colouring matter employed, and to be able to communicate particular colours to stuffs with any degree of certainty, to know the amount of that effect.\n\n99. Even in the mode of applying mordants, the variety of shades may be greatly multiplied. Different effects, for instance, are produced by previously impregnating the stuff with the mordant, or by mixing it with the bath. Different effects also arise from using heat, or, as the stuff is more or less rapidly dried; and this must appear to be the case, if we consider the different affinities which are in action, and the change on the action of these affinities in these different circumstances, as well as in others which can scarcely be appreciated. The combination of these substances which have an affinity for the stuff, and the decompositions which are the result of that combination, are greatly facilitated by the evaporation of the water or other liquid which held these substances in solution; because by its affinity, which is opposed to the action of the affinity between these substances and the stuff, the affinity of the latter produces a more limited effect. But in dyeing, the process should proceed slowly, that the substances may not be separated before their mutual affinities have begun to operate.\n\n100. Considerable differences must be observed in the mode of employing the mordant, as the force of affinity between the stuff and the colouring matter is greater or less. When this affinity is strong, the mordant and the colouring substance may be mixed together; the compound thus formed, immediately enters into combination with the stuff. But if the affinity between the stuff and the colouring particles be weak, the compound formed of the latter and the mordant may separate, and a precipitation take place, before it can be attached to the stuff; and hence it is in these cases, that the mordant which is to serve as the medium of union between the stuff and the colouring matter, must be combined with the former, before the application of the latter. It is from these differences that different processes must be followed in fixing colouring matters on animal and vegetable productions; as for instance, in dyeing wool or silk black, or with cochineal.\n\n101. In estimating the effects of mordants, and in judging of the most advantageous manner of applying them, it is necessary to attend to the combinations which may be formed, either by the action of the ingredients of which they are composed, or, by that of the colouring matter and the fluff. It is necessary also, to take into consideration the circumstances which may tend to bring about these combinations with more or less rapidity, or that may render them more or less perfect. The action which the liquor in which the stuff is immersed may have, either on its colour or texture, must also be considered; and to be able accurately to judge of the extent of this action, we must know the proportions of the principles of which the mordant is composed; which of these principles remains in an uncombined state in the liquor, and the proportion or quantity which is thus separated.\n\nCHAP. III. Of the Nature and Properties of the Substances to which Colours are communicated in the Processes of Dyeing.\n\n102. In the more limited sense to which we have here restricted the art of dyeing, the substances to which colours are usually communicated by means of this art, are wool, silk, cotton, flax, and hemp. Of these, the two first are animal substances, and the three latter are derived from the vegetable kingdom. These two classes of bodies present striking differences, not only in structure, but also in their composition and chemical properties.\n\n103. Animal substances are distinguished from those which have a vegetable origin, by the nature of their constituent parts. The former contain a large proportion of azote, which exists sparingly in the latter. Hydrogen, or the base of hydrogen gas or inflammable air, is found in greater abundance in animal matters, than in vegetable productions. In the distillation of animal and vegetable substances, the difference of their constituent parts is not less remarkable. The former afford a large proportion of ammonia, or volatile alkali; the latter yield very little, and sometimes give out an acid substance. Animal matters afford much oil, while vegetable substances sometimes do not afford it in any perceptible quantity. From the nature of their component parts, animal substances produce a bright flame in burning; and their combustion is accompanied with a penetrating odour, which is owing to the formation and emission of ammonia and oil. Animal matters run rapidly into the putrefactive process, while vegetable substances more slowly undergo the changes which are induced by the vinous or acetous fermentation.\n\n104. The constituent principles of animal substances have a stronger tendency than those which enter into the composition of vegetable matters, to assume the elastic form. On this account the cohesive force existing between the particles of the former is inferior to that of the particles of the latter. Hence animal matters are more disposed to combine with other substances, more liable to be destroyed by different agents, and to enter into combination with colouring particles. Thus, animal substances are destroyed by the caustic fixed alkalies, and they are decomposed by the nitric and fulphuric...\nphoric acids. The action of acids and alkalies on silk is less powerful than upon wool, and it is less disposed to combine with the particles of colouring matter. In this respect it bears some resemblance to vegetable substances; but on vegetable matters, the action of alkalies and acids is less powerful than on animal substances; and the action of acids is more feeble on cotton than on flax or hemp. It is even decomposed with considerable difficulty by means of nitric acid.\n\nIn the four following sections, we shall consider the peculiarities of these substances at greater length.\n\nSect. I. Of Wool.\n\nStructure.\n\n105. Wool, which is well known as the covering of sheep, derives its value from the length and fineness of its filaments. The filaments of wool are considerably elastic, for they may be drawn out beyond their usual length, and when the force is removed, they recover it again. The surface of the filaments of wool or hair is not perfectly smooth; for although no roughness or inequality can be discovered by the microscope, yet they seem to be formed of small laminae placed over each other, in a slanting direction, from the root of the filament towards its point, resembling the arrangement of the scales of a fish, which cover each other from the head of the animal to its tail; or perhaps they consist of zones placed over each other, as is observed in the horns of animals. This peculiarity of structure of the filaments of hair and wool is proved by a simple experiment. If a hair be laid hold of by the root in one hand, and drawn between the fingers of the other hand, from the root towards the point, scarcely any friction or resistance is perceived, and no noise is heard; but if it be grasped by the point, and passed in the same manner between the fingers from the point towards the root, a resistance is felt, and a tremulous motion is perceptible to the touch, while the ear is sensible to a slight noise. Thus it appears, that the texture of the surface of hair or wool is not the same from the root towards the point, as it is from the point towards the root. This is farther confirmed by another experiment. If a hair be held between the thumb and forefinger, and they are rubbed against each other in the longitudinal direction of the hair, it acquires a progressive motion towards the root. This effect depends not on the nature of the skin of the finger, or on its texture, for if the hair be turned, and the point placed where the root formerly was, the motion is reversed, that is, it will still be towards the root.\n\nFelting.\n\n106. On this peculiarity of structure, which was observed by M. Monge, depend the processes of felting and fulling, to which hair and wool are subjected, for different purposes. In the process of felting the flocculi of wool are struck with the string of the bow, by which the filaments are separately detached, and dispersed in the air. These filaments fall back on each other in all directions on the table, and when a layer of a certain thickness is formed, they are covered with a cloth, on which the workman presses with his hands in all parts. By this pressure the filaments of wool are brought nearer to each other; the points of contact are multiplied; the progressive motion towards the root is produced by the agitation; the filaments entangle each other; and the laminae of each filament, taking hold of those of the other filaments, which are in an opposite direction, the whole is retained in the state of close contexture.\n\n107. Connected with this operation is that of fulling. The roughness on the surface of the filaments of wool, and their tendency to acquire a progressive motion towards the root, produce considerable inconvenience in the operations of spinning and weaving. These inconveniences are obviated by covering the filaments with a coat of oil, which fills up the cavities, and renders the apertures less sensible. When these operations are finished, the stuff must be freed from the oil, which would prevent it from taking the colour with which it is to be dyed. For this purpose it is taken to the fulling-mill, where it is beaten with large beetles, in a trough of water, through which clay has been diffused. The clay unites with the oil, which being thus rendered soluble in the water, is carried off by fresh portions of water, conveyed to it by proper apparatus. In this way the stuff is loured; but this is not the sole object of the operation. By the alternate pressure of the beetles, an effect similar to that of the hands in the operation of felting, is produced. The filaments composing a thread of warp or woof, acquire a progressive motion, are entangled with the filaments of the adjoining threads; those of the latter into the next, and so on, till the whole threads are felted together. The stuff is now contracted in all its dimensions, and participating both of the nature of cloth and of felt, may be cut without being subjected to ravel; and when employed to make a garment, requires no hemming. In a common woollen stocking web, after this operation, the stitches, when one happens to slip, are now no longer subject to run, and the threads of the warp and woof being less distant from each other, the whole stuff is thickened, and forms a warmer clothing.\n\n108. The various manufactures, of which wool constitutes the basis, are justly regarded among the most important to man in civilized society. Accordingly, the production of fine wool, and the causes which retard or improve the breed of sheep from which it is obtained, have greatly occupied the attention of economists and philosophers in our own, as well as in other countries. The wool of different breeds of sheep, in different countries, it is well known, possesses very different qualities, both with regard to the fineness of the filament, and the colour. Some is of a white, or yellow, and some of a reddish, and black colour. Excepting the wool of the breed of sheep in Andalusia, the Spanish wool was formerly all of a brownish black colour. This was preferred by the native Spaniards; and even at this day, the dress of some religious orders in Roman Catholic countries, consists of cloth manufactured from this wool, and retaining its natural colour. But for the purposes of dyeing, white wool is now always preferred, because it is found susceptible of receiving better and more durable colours.\n\n109. Wool is naturally covered with a kind of grease Scouring, or oil, which is found to preserve it from insects or moths, and on this account this greasy matter is not removed, or the wool is not scoured till it is to be dyed.\nThe process for scouring wool is the following. It is put for about a quarter of an hour into a kettle, with a sufficient quantity of water, to which a fourth part of putrid urine has been added. It is then heated to such a degree as the hand can bear, occasionally stirred, and after being taken out, is allowed to drain. It is then put into a basket, and exposed to a stream of running water, and moved about till the grease is so completely separated, that it no longer renders the water turbid. After being drained, it is sometimes found to lose by this operation above one-fifth of its weight. It is almost unnecessary to observe, that the more carefully and completely this process is performed, the better the wool is fitted to receive the colouring matter. Our chemical readers will readily perceive the nature of the changes which are effected in this process of scouring. The ammonia, or volatile alkali, which exists in the urine, combines with the oil of the wool, and forms a soap, which being soluble in water, is dissolved, and carried off.\n\nWool is either dyed in the fleece, or after it is spun into threads, or when it has been manufactured into cloth. For the purpose of forming cloths of mixed colours, it is dyed before it is spun; for the purposes of tapestry, it is dyed in the state of thread; but most commonly it is subjected to this process after it has been manufactured into cloth. In these different states, the quantity of colouring matter which is taken up is very different. The proportion is largest when it is dyed in the fleece, because then the filaments being more separated, a greater surface is exposed to the action of the colouring particles. For a similar reason, the quantity of colouring matter taken up is greater when in the state of thread or yarn, than when it is formed into cloth. But cloths themselves must vary greatly in this respect, according to their different qualities. Their different degrees of fineness, or closeness of texture, will produce considerable variations; and besides, the difference in the quantity and dimensions of the substances to be dyed, the different qualities of the ingredients employed in the process, and the different circumstances in which it is performed, should be a caution against trifling to precise quantities, regulated by weight or measure, which are recommended according to general rules. According to the fineness of the texture of the wool, and the nature of the colouring matter employed, it is found to be more or less penetrated with this matter. The coarse wool from the thighs and tails of some sheep, receives colours with difficulty, and the finest cloth is never completely penetrated with the scarlet dye. The interior of the cloth appears always when cut, of a lighter shade, and sometimes even white.\n\nSect. II. Of Silk.\n\nSilk, which forms the basis of one of the richest and most splendid parts of dress, among the wealthy and luxurious, in civilized society, is the production of different species of insects. The phalena bombyx, or silk-worm, which is a native of China, attracted the attention of mankind in that country, from the earliest ages. The honour of having first collected and prepared silk from the cocoons or balls in which it is wound up by the insect, during its metamorphosis, is ascribed by the Chinese historians, to the wife of an emperor. The phalena atlas, Lin., which is also a native of China, is said to form larger cocoons, and to yield a stronger silk. The silk-worm was first carried from China to Hindostan, and afterwards to Persia. Silk seems not to have been known to the Greeks or Romans till the time of Augustus. Its nature and origin were little understood, and for many ages it was so scarce, that it could only be purchased at a price which was equal to its weight in gold. The emperor Aurelian, it is said, from a principle of economy, refused the urgent solicitations of his empress, who wished to have a silken robe, alleging the extravagance of the expense. About the middle of the fifth century, two monks returned from India to Constantinople, and brought with them a considerable number of silk-worms, with instructions for managing and breeding them, as well as for collecting, preparing, and manufacturing the silk. Establishments were thus formed at Corinth, Athens, and other parts of Greece. The crusades, which greatly contributed to the diffusion of different kinds of knowledge, by the intercourse which took place between different countries, proved useful in disseminating the knowledge of rearing the silk-worm, and preparing and manufacturing its valuable productions. Roger, king of Sicily, about the year 1130, returning from one of these frantic expeditions, brought with him from Athens and Corinth, several prisoners, who were acquainted with the management of silk-worms, and the manufacturing of silk. Under their superintendence, manufactories were established at Palermo and Calabria in Sicily. This example was soon adopted, and followed in different parts of Italy and Spain. In the time of James I., an attempt was made to establish the silk-worm in England. For this purpose the culture of the mulberry-tree on which the insects feed, was strongly recommended by that prince to his subjects; but the attempts which were made have been hitherto unsuccessful.\n\nThe fibres of silk are covered with a coating or scouring, natural varnish of a gummy nature. To this are ascribed its fineness and elasticity. Besides this varnish, the silk which is usually met with in Europe is impregnated with a substance of a yellow colour, and for most of the purposes to which silk is applied, it is necessary that it should be deprived, both of the varnish and of the colouring-matter. On this account it must be subjected to the operation of scouring; but for silks which are to be dyed, this process should not be carried so far as for those which are merely to be whitened; and different colours, it is observed, require different degrees of this operation. The quantity of soap constitutes the chief difference. A hundred pounds of silk boiled in a solution of 20 lbs. of soap for three or four hours, adding new portions of water during the evaporation, are sufficiently prepared for receiving common colours.\n\n(a) According to an observation of Reaumur, rubbing any stuff with greasy wool, is sufficient to preserve it from moths.\nOf substances to be coloured.\n\nDyeing.\n\n113. Silk which is to be employed white, must undergo three operations. In the first the hanks are immersed in a hot but not boiling solution of 50 lbs. of soap to 100 lbs. of silk. When the immersed part is freed from its gum, which is known by its whiteness, the hanks are shaken over, as the workmen term it, so that the part which was not previously immersed may undergo the same operation. They are then wrung out as the process is completed. In the second operation the silk is put into bags of coarse cloth, each bag containing 20 or 30 lbs. These bags are boiled for an hour and a half, in a solution of soap prepared as before, but with a smaller proportion of soap; and that they may not receive too much heat, by touching the bottom of the kettle, they must be constantly stirred during the operation. The object of the third operation is to communicate to the silk different shades, to render the white more agreeable. These are known by different names, as China-white, silver-white, azure-white, or thread-white. For this purpose a solution of soap is also prepared, of which the proper degree of strength is ascertained by its manner of frothing by agitation. For the China-white, which is required to have a slight tinge of red, a small quantity of anatto is added, and the silk is shaken over in it till it has acquired the shade which is wanted. In other whites, a blue tinge is given by adding a little blue to the solution of soap. The azure-white is communicated by means of indigo. To prepare the azure, fine indigo is well washed two or three times in moderately warm water, ground fine in a mortar, and boiling water poured upon it. It is then left to settle, and the liquid part only, which contains the finer and more soluble parts, is employed.\n\n114. Somefeno soapin the third operation; but when the second is completed, they wash the silks, fumigate with sulphur, and azure them with river water, which should be very pure. But all these operations are not sufficient to give silk that degree of brightness which is necessary, when it is to be employed in the manufacture of white stuffs. For this purpose it must undergo the process of sulphuration, in which the silk is exposed to the vapour of sulphur, for an account of which see Bleaching. But before the silk which has been treated in this way is fit for receiving colours, and retaining them in their full lustre, the sulphur which adheres to it must be separated by immersion and agitation for some time in warm water, otherwise the colours are tarnished and greatly injured.\n\n115. It has long been an object of considerable importance, to deprive silk of its colouring matter, without destroying the gum, on which its stiffness and elasticity depend. A process for this purpose was discovered by Beaumé, but as it was not made public, others have been led to it by conjecture and experiment. The following account, given by Berthollet, is all that has transpired concerning this process. A mixture is made with a small quantity of muriatic acid and alcohol. The muriatic acid should be in a state of purity, and particularly should be entirely free from nitric acid, which would give the silk a yellow colour. In the mixture thus prepared, the silk is to be immersed, One of the most difficult parts of the process, especially when large quantities are operated upon, is to produce a uniform whiteness. In dyeing the whitened silk, there is also considerable difficulty, to prevent its curling, so that it is recommended to keep it constantly stretched during the drying. The muriatic acid seems to be useful in this process, by softening the gum, and afflicting the alcohol to dissolve the colouring particles which are combined with it. The alcohol which has been impregnated with the colouring matter may be again separated from it and purified, that it may serve for future operations, and thus render the process more economical. This may be done by means of distillation with a moderate heat, in glass or stone-ware vessels.\n\n116. The preparation with alum is a very important preliminary operation in the dyeing of silk. Without this process, few colours would have either beauty or durability. Forty or fifty pounds of alum, previously dissolved in warm water, are mixed in a vat, with forty or fifty pailfuls of water; and to prevent the crystallization of the salt, the solution must be carefully stirred during the mixture. The silk being previously washed and beetleed, to separate any remains of soap, is immersed in this alum liquor, and at the end of eight or nine hours is wrung out, and washed in a stream of water. A hundred and fifty pounds of silk may be prepared in the above quantity of liquor; but when it begins to grow weak, which may be known by the taste, 20 or 25 lbs. of dissolved alum are to be added, and the addition repeated till the liquor acquires a disagreeable smell. It may then be employed in the preparation of silk intended for darker colours, till its whole strength is dissipated. This preparation of silk with alum must be made in the cold; for when the liquor is employed hot, the lustre is apt to be impaired.\n\nSect. III. Of Cotton.\n\n117. Cotton is the down or wool contained in the pods of a shrubby plant, which is a native of warm climates. Of this genus of plants (Gossypium Linn.) there are four species, one of which only is perennial; the other three are annual plants; but of these there are many varieties, occasioned by the difference of soil or temperature in which they are produced. The principal differences among cottons consist in the length and fineness of the filaments, and in their strength and colour.\n\n118. The peculiar structure of the fibres of cotton is not well known. According to the microscopic observations of Leeuwenhoek, they have two sharp sides, to which are ascribed the irritation and inflammation of wounds and ulcers, when they are dressed with cotton instead of lint. This peculiarity of structure, it is also supposed, may occasion some difference in the conformation, and number of the pores, on which alone the disposition of cotton to admit and retain colours better than linen, seems to depend. In this respect, however, it is inferior to wool and silk, because on account of its vegetable nature, its affinity for colouring matter is less powerful.\n\n119. It is well known that silk, cotton, and linen have a weaker affinity for colouring matter than wool. Le Pileur d'Aigny attempts to explain this by supposing that matter...\nthat the pores of these substances are smaller than those of wool, and that the colouring particles enter them less easily and freely. But according to the observation of Dr Bancroft, the reverse of this seems to be the fact; for there is little difficulty in making silk, cotton, and linen, imbibe colouring matter, even when it is applied cold without any artificial dilatation of the pores, which is always necessary in the dyeing of wool. The only real difficulty is to make them retain the colours after the matter has been imbibed; because being admitted so readily into their undilated pores, the particles cannot be afterwards compressed and retained by the contraction of these pores, as is the case with wool. It requires double the quantity of cochineal which is necessary for wool to communicate a crimson colour to silk; a certain proof that it can take up a greater quantity, and consequently that the pores are sufficiently large and accessible. Unbleached cotton is always preferred for dyeing Turkey red; because in this state the colour is found to be most permanent; and this is ascribed to the pores or interstices being less open than after it has undergone the process of bleaching. The same thing is observed of raw or unscoured silk. It is found to combine more easily with the colouring matter, and to receive a more permanent colour in this state than after it has been scoured and whitened. \"The openness of cotton and linen,\" says Dr Bancroft, \"and their consequent readiness to imbibe, both colouring particles, and the earthy or metallic bases employed to fix most of them, are circumstances upon which the art of dyeing and calico-printing is in a great degree founded.\"*\n\nBut is not this too mechanical an explanation of the phenomenon? Might it not rather be alleged that it is owing to a difference of affinities which exists between the particles of colouring matter and the substance which is separated from the silk or cotton by the processes of bleaching or scouring. This substance probably acts as the part of a mordant; and having a stronger affinity for the stuff and for the colouring matter than the stuff has for the latter, the colour communicated is more durable when silk or cotton is dyed in the unbleached or unscoured state.\n\n120. To prepare cotton stuffs for receiving the dye, several operations are necessary. It must first undergo the process of scouring. By some it is boiled in four water, or in alkaline ley. It should be kept boiling for two hours, then wrung out, and rinsed in a stream of water till the water comes off clear. The stuffs to be prepared should be soaked for some time in water, mixed with not more than \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) part of sulphuric acid, and then carefully washed in a stream of water, and dried. In this operation the acid combines with a portion of calcareous earth and iron, which would have interrupted the full effect of the colouring matter in the process of dyeing.\n\n121. Aluming is another preliminary process in the dyeing of cotton. The alum is to be dissolved in the manner already described, in preparing silk. Each pound of cotton stuff requires four ounces of alum. By some a solution of soda, about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th part of the alum, and by others, a small quantity of tartar and arsenic are added. The thread is to be impregnated by working it in small quantities with this solution. The whole is then put into a vessel, and the remaining part of the liquor is poured upon it. In this state it is left for 24 hours, after which it is removed to a stream of water, and allowed to remain for an hour and a half, or two hours, to extract part of the alum. It is then to be washed. By this operation, cotton is found to gain an addition of about \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\)th part of its weight.\n\n122. The operation of galling is another preparatory process in the dyeing of cotton stuffs. The quantity of astringent matter employed must be proportioned to its quality, and the amount of the effect required. Powdered galls are boiled for two hours in a proportion of water, regulated by the quantity of thread to be galled. This solution being reduced to such a temperature as the hand can bear, is divided into a number of equal parts, that the thread may be wrought pound by pound. The whole stuff is then put into a vessel, and the remaining liquor poured upon it, as in the former process. It is then left for 24 hours, if it is to be dyed black, but for other colours, 12 or 15 hours are found sufficient. It is then wrung out and dried.\n\nIn the galling of cotton stuffs, which have already received a colour, the precaution should be observed of performing this operation in the cold, otherwise the colour is subject to injury.\n\n123. Berthollet informs us, that cotton which has been alummed acquired more weight in the galling than that which had not previously undergone that process; for although alum adheres but in small quantities to cotton, it communicates to it a greater power of combining, both with the astringent principle, and with the colouring particles. This, we may add, may be considered as a good instance of the action of intermediate affinities, and of the advantage to be derived to the art of dyeing, from investigating and observing this action.\n\nSec. IV. Of Flax.\n\n124. Flax and hemp nearly resemble each other in origin, their general properties; and so far as relates to the processes of dyeing, what is said of the one may be applied to the other. Flax or lint is obtained from the bark of Linum usitatissimum, and hemp from that of Cannabis sativa.\n\n125. Before flax is properly prepared to receive the Watering dye, it must be subjected to several processes. One of the most important is that of watering, by which the fibrous parts of the plant are separated, and brought to that state in which they can be spun into threads. As the quantity and quality of the product depend much on this preliminary operation, it becomes of the greatest consequence that it be properly conducted. During this process, carbonic acid and hydrogen gas are given out. The extraction of these gases is owing to a glutinous juice which holds the green colouring part of the plant in solution, and which is the medium of union between its cortical and ligneous parts, undergoing a certain degree of putrefaction. This substance seems to resemble the glutinous part which is held dissolved in the juice obtained from plants by pressure; is separated from the colouring particles by means of heat; readily becomes putrid, and by distillation affords ammonia. But although it is held in solution with the expressed juice, it would appear that it cannot be separated from the cortical parts completely, by means of water; and hence it happens, that hemp or flax watered\nOperations watered in too strong a current, has not the requisite of Dyeing, softness and flexibility. But on the other hand, if the water employed in this operation be stagnant and in a putrid state, the hemp or flax becomes of a brown colour, and loses its firmness. In the one case, the putrefactive process is interrupted; in the other it is continued too long, and carried too far. This process, therefore, is performed with the greatest advantage in places near the banks of rivers, where the water may be changed so frequently as to prevent such a degree of putrefaction as would be injurious to the flax, as well as prejudicial to the workmen, from noxious exhalations; and, at the same time, not so frequently as to retard or interrupt those changes which are necessary for rendering the glutinous substance soluble in water.\n\n126. By the process of watering flax, and by drying before and after that process, the green coloured particles undergo a similar change to that which is observed in the green substance of the plants exposed to the action of air and light. The next part of the process, therefore, after watering, is to spread it out upon the grass, and thus expose it for some time to the air and sun. By this means the colour of the lint is improved, and the ligneous part becomes so brittle, that it is easily separated from the fibrous part. This operation, as is well known, is usually performed by machinery.\n\n127. The fibres of lint possess no perceptible degree of elasticity, and they appear to be perfectly smooth. No roughness or inequality can be detected by the feel, and no asperities can be perceived, even with the assistance of the microscope. Experience shows, that it produces no irritation on wounds or sores which are dressed with it, as is known to happen from a similar application of cotton stuffs.\n\n128. Flax which is intended for dyeing must be subjected to a similar series of operations with cotton in the different processes of scouring, alumining and galling. A repetition of the mode of performing these operations is therefore unnecessary.\n\n**CHAP. IV. Of the Operations of Dyeing.**\n\n129. Before we proceed to the detail of the processes of dyeing, we shall throw out a few hints on the operations in general, some of which may perhaps be useful to the practical dyer.\n\n130. The works which are carried on in extensive manufactories, it has been observed, are followed with advantages which are unknown to those which are conducted on a limited scale or in a detached manner. By the subdivision of labour each workman directing his attention to one or a few objects, acquires a great facility and perfection of execution, by which means the saving of time and labour becomes considerable. This principle is particularly applicable to the art of dyeing, because the preparation which remains after one operation may often be advantageously employed in another. A bath from which the colouring matter has been in a great measure extracted in the first operation, may be useful as a ground for other stuffs, or with the addition of a fresh portion of ingredients may form a new bath. The galls which have been applied to the galling of silk may answer a similar purpose for cotton or wool. From this it must appear that the limitations and restrictions under which the art of dyeing labours in some countries must tend to obstruct its progress and improvement. An extensive plan of operations, by which the different branches of the art are connected together, would effectually prevent the loss of ingredients, time, fuel, and labour.\n\n131. A dye-house, which should be set down as near Dye-houses, as possible to a stream of water, should be spacious and well lighted. It should be floored with lime and plaster; and proper means should be adopted to carry off water or spent baths by forming channels or gutters, so that every operation may be conducted with the utmost attention to cleanliness.\n\n132. The size and position of the caldrons are to be regulated by the nature and extent of the operations for which they are designed. Excepting for scarlet and other delicate colours, in which the tin is used as a mordant, in which case tin vessels are preferable, the caldrons should be of brass or copper. Brass, being less apt than copper to be acted on by means of chemical agents, and to communicate spots to the stuffs, is fitter for the purpose of a dyeing vessel. It is scarcely necessary to say that it is of the greatest consequence that the coppers or caldrons be well cleaned for every operation; and that vessels of a large size should be furnished at the bottom with a pipe and stop-cock for the greater convenience of emptying them; and there must be a hole in the wall or chimney above each copper to admit poles for the purpose of draining the stuffs which are immersed, so that the liquor may fall back into the vessel, and no part may be lost.\n\n133. Dyes for silk where a boiling heat is not found Apparatus necessary, are prepared in troughs or backs, which are for silk long copper or wooden vessels. The colours which are used for silk are extremely delicate. They must therefore be dried quickly, that they may not be long exposed to the action of the air, and there may be no risk of change. For this purpose, it is necessary to have a drying room heated with a stove. The silk is stretched on a moveable pole, which by the dyers is called a shaker. This is hung up in the heated chamber, and kept in constant motion to promote the evaporation.\n\n134. For pieces of stuffs, a winch or reel must be constructed; the ends of which are supported by two of cloth iron forks which may be put up at pleasure in holes made in the curb on which the edges of the copper rest. The manipulations in dyeing are neither difficult nor complicated. Their object is to impregnate the stuff to be dyed with the colouring particles, which are dissolved in the bath. For this purpose, the action of the air is necessary, not only in fixing the colouring particles, but also in rendering them more vivid; while those which have not been fixed in the stuff are to be carefully removed. In dyeing whole pieces of stuff, or a number of pieces at once, the winch or reel mentioned above, must be employed. One end of the stuff is first laid across it, and by turning it quickly round, the whole passes successively over it. By turning it afterwards the contrary way, that part of the stuff which was first immersed, will be the last in the second immersion, and thus the colouring matter will be communicated as equally as possible.\n\n135. In dyeing wool in the fleece, a kind of broad ladder\nOperations ladder with very close rounds, called by the dyers of this country, a ferrow, or ferrow, is used. This is placed over the copper, and the wool is put upon it, for the purpose of draining and exposure to the air, or when the bath is to be changed. If wool is dyed in the state of thread, or in skeins, rods are to be passed through them, and the hanks turned upon the skein sticks in the liquor. This is called shaking over. When silk or thread is in the same state, it undergoes a similar operation.\n\nWringing out.\n\n136. To separate the superabundant colouring particles, or those which have not been fixed in the fluff, silk or thread, after being dyed, it must be wrung out. This operation is performed with a cylindrical piece of wood, one end of which is fixed in the wall, or in a post. This operation is often repeated a number of times successively, for the purpose of drying the fluffs more rapidly, and communicating a brighter lustre.\n\nRaking.\n\n137. When, after a certain quantity of fresh ingredients is added to a liquor, and it is stirred about, it is said to be raked, because it is mixed with the rake.\n\nGiving a ground.\n\n138. In dyeing, one colour is frequently communicated to stuffs, with the intention of applying another upon it, and thus a compound colour is produced. The first of these operations is called giving a ground.\n\nDipping.\n\n139. When it is found necessary to pass stuffs several times through the same liquor, each particular operation is called a dip.\n\nTerms for different shades.\n\n140. A colour is said to be red, when a red colour having a yellow tinge, is changed to a shade inclining to a crimson or ruby colour; and the conversion of a yellow red to a more complete red, is called brightening the colour.\n\n141. In addition to these general remarks, we might give more minute details of the different operations which are employed in dyeing; but as we cannot presume that they would be of much advantage to the practical dyer, we shall not indulge ourselves in useless description. \"Although the manipulations of dyeing,\" says Berthoulet, are not very various, and appear extremely simple, they require very particular attention, and an experienced eye, in order to judge of the qualities of the bath, to produce and sustain the degree of heat suited to each operation; to avoid all circumstances that might occasion inequalities of colour, to judge accurately whether the shade of what comes out of the bath suits the pattern, and to establish the proper gradations in a series of shades.\"\n\n142. We shall conclude this chapter with a few observations on the qualities and effects of different kinds of water, which may be considered as one of the most essential agents in the art of dyeing. It is almost unnecessary to say, that water which is muddy, or contains putrid substances, should not be employed; and indeed no kind of water which possesses qualities distinguished by the taste, ought to be used. Water which holds in solution earthy salts, has a very considerable action on colouring matters, and it is chiefly by means of these salts. Such, for instance, are the nitrates of lime and magnesia, muriate of lime and magnesia, sulphate of lime, and carbonate of lime and of magnesia.\n\n143. These salts which have earthy bases, oppose the solution of the colouring particles, and by entering into combination with many of them, cause a precipitation, by which means the colour is at one time deeper, and at other times duller and more faint than would otherwise be the case. Water impregnated with the carbonates of lime and magnesia, yield a precipitate when they are boiled; for the excess of carbonic acid which held them in solution is driven off by the heat; the earths are thus precipitated, and adhering to the stuffs to be dyed, render them dirty, and prevent the colouring matter from combining with them.\n\n144. It is of much consequence to be able to distinguish the different kinds of water which come under the denomination of hard water, that they may be avoided in the essential operations of dyeing; but to detect different principles contained in such waters, and to ascertain their quantity with precision, require great skill, and very delicate management of chemical operations, which the experienced chemist only can be supposed to possess. For the methods to be followed when such accuracy is required, we must refer to the analysis of mineral waters, of which a full view is given in the treatise on chemistry, and content ourselves with mentioning some simple tests which are of easy application.\n\n145. One of these tests is the solution of soap, by which it may be discovered whether water contains so large a portion of any of these saline matters as may be injurious to the processes. Salts which have earthy bases, have the property of decomposing soap by the action of double affinity. The acid of the salt combines with the alkali of the soap, and remains in solution, while the earth of the salt and the oil of the soap enter into combination, and form an earthy soap which is insoluble in water, and produces the curdling appearance which is the consequence of this new combination. Water, then, which is limpid and not stagnant, which has no perceptible taste or smell, and has the property of dissolving soap without decomposition, may be considered as sufficiently pure for the processes of dyeing. All waters which possess these qualities will be found equally proper for these purposes.\n\n146. But, as it is not always in the power of the method of dyer to choose pure water, means of correcting the water purifying, which would be injurious to his processes, and particularly for the dyeing of delicate colours, have been proposed. Water in which bran has been allowed to become four, is most commonly employed for this purpose. This is known by the name of fours, or four water. The method of preparing four water is the following. Twenty four bushels of bran are put into a vessel that will contain about ten hogsheads. A large boiler is filled with water, and when it is just ready to boil, it is poured into the vessel. Soon after the acid fermentation commences, and in about twenty-four hours the liquor is fit to be applied to use. Water which is impregnated with earthy salts, after being treated in this way, forms no precipitate by boiling. It is probable that the four water decomposes the carbonate of lime and magnesia, because the vegetable acid which is formed during the fermentation, combines with the earthy bases, and sets the carbonic acid at liberty.\n\n147. Some of the substances with which waters are impregnated, or those which are merely diffused in them in a state of very minute division, may be separated by means of mucilaginous matters. The mucilage coagulates\nPractice of coagulates by means of heat, and carrying with it the earth separated by boiling, as well as those substances which are simply mixed with the water, and render it turbid, rises to the surface, and forming a scum, may be easily removed.\n\n148. Saline matters having earthy bases, which in general are injurious in dyeing, may in some cases be useful, because by their action, modifications of different colours may be produced. A water of this kind, for instance, would have the effect of communicating to the colour of cochineal a crimson shade.\n\n149. River water, which is apt to be impregnated with earthy salts, may, at different times contain very different proportions of these salts; and although the dyer may follow exactly the same process, he may be surprised to find considerable variations in the shades of his colours. This arises from the different degrees of impregnation with these saline matters which the water undergoes, as the bed of the river is of greater or less extent, or the waters flow over those places from which they derive these earthy salts. To obtain the same result in the process, therefore, it would be necessary to make certain variations according to the state of impregnation of the water.\n\nPART II. OF THE PRACTICE OF DYEING.\n\n150. In the preceding part, we have endeavoured to give a general view of the principles on which the art of dyeing depends. We have considered the physical and chemical properties of colours and colouring matters; the nature of the substances to which colours are communicated, and the agents or means by which this is effected; and from the experiments and observations of philosophers, whose investigations have been directed to this subject, it appears that these changes are entirely owing to chemical affinities, by which decompositions are effected, and new combinations formed, among the constituent parts of the substances employed. A precise and full knowledge of the effects of these chemical agents would render the theory of dyeing complete; and although much has been already done by the chemical philosophers whom we have had occasion frequently to quote, yet experiments and observations are still wanting to form a theory of this art on fixed and rational principles. This, it is obvious, can only be done by chemical investigations. To the practical dyer, therefore, the study of chemical science must be essentially requisite, as this only can be his true guide in estimating and managing the complicated changes in the different processes of his art. It is only by the application of the principles of chemistry that this art can be improved and perfected. But the application of these principles must be made by the practical dyer himself, not by the chemist in his laboratory, or during an occasional visit to the manufactory. For in the complicated processes of dyeing conducted on an extensive scale, a thousand circumstances will be overlooked by the most acute and discerning chemist, which will not escape the habitual observation of the philosophical artist. Convinced ourselves of the incalculable advantages which the art of dyeing may derive from chemical science, and the innumerable resources which ingenuity and address may discover in the proper application of its principles towards the improvement of the different processes of this art, we shall not be thought, we hope, too sanguine in looking forward to a degree of perfection which is little to be expected from its present state.\n\nThe processes of the art of dyeing form the subject of the second part of this treatise, the consideration of which we are now to enter upon.\n\n151. Colours have been usually distributed by dyers into two classes. These have been denominated simple and compound colours. Simple colours, which are commonly reckoned four in number, are such as cannot be produced by the mixing together different colours. Colours denominated compound may be produced by the mixture of any two of the simple colours in different proportions. Thus red, yellow, and blue are incapable of being produced by any combination of others, and are therefore considered as simple colours. Blue and red, which compose a purple, blue and yellow, a green, and red and yellow, an orange, are compound colours; but none of these, by any composition whatever, will afford a red, yellow, or blue.\n\n152. Dr Bancroft in his elaborate treatise on the philosophy of permanent colours, divides colouring matters into two classes. The first includes those colouring substances which, being in a state of solution, may be permanently fixed on any stuff without any mordant, or the intermediate action of earthy or metallic bases. In the second class are comprehended those matters which cannot be fixed without the action of mordants. The first he has denominated substantive colours; because the colour is fixed without the aid of any other body; and the second adjective, because they become permanent only with the addition of a mordant. The celebrated purple produced by the liquor obtained from shell-fish and indigo, are examples of substantive colours. Prussian blue and cochineal are adjective colours.\n\nThe usual division of colours into simple and compound seems to form an arrangement equally convenient and perspicuous. We shall therefore adopt it in the following chapters. In the first we shall treat of simple colours; in the second of compound colours; and to these we shall add a third chapter on topical dyeing, or calico printing.\n\nCHAP. I. Of Simple Colours.\n\n153. Simple colours, we have already observed, are such as cannot be produced by the mixture of other colours. They are the foundation of all other colours, and therefore come naturally to be first treated of. The simple colours are four, viz. 1. Red. 2. Yellow. 3. Blue. 4. Black. To these a fifth is added by some; namely, brown, or fawn colour; although it may be produced by the combination of other colours. The nature of the colouring substances which are employed\nOf Simple to produce these colours, and the processes by which they are fixed on the several stuffs, will form the subjects of the four following sections.\n\nSect. I. Of Red.\n\n154. Red colours, from different degrees of intensity, have received different names, as crimson, flearlet, besides a great variety of shades which are less striking, and come under no particular denomination. In this section we shall treat of the nature and properties of the substances which are employed in dyeing red, and then give an account of the different processes which are followed in fixing these colouring matters on animal and vegetable productions.\n\n1. Of the Substances employed in Dyeing Red.\n\nThe colouring matters which are principally employed in dyeing red, are madder, cochineal, kermes, lac, arcelil, carthamus, braf wood, and logwood.\n\nMadder.\n\n155. Madder is very extensively employed in dyeing. It is the root of a plant (rubiainborum, Lin.) of which there are two varieties. It is cultivated in different parts of Europe, and the best, it is said, is brought from Zeeland. Madder, as it is prepared for dyeing, is distinguished into different kinds. What is called grape madder, is obtained from the principal roots; the none grape is produced from the stalks, which by being buried in the earth, are converted into roots, and are called layers. When the roots are gathered, these layers are separated, with such of the fibres of the roots as do not exceed a certain degree of thickness, as well as those which are too thick; the latter containing a great deal of woody matter. The best roots are about the thickness of a goose quill, they have some degree of transparency; are of a reddish colour, and have a strong smell, and a smooth bark. When the madder is gathered, it must be dried, to render it fit for being reduced to powder, and being preserved. This operation is performed in warm climates in the open air. In Holland, stoves are employed for the same purpose; but when treated in this way, it is often injured, from too great a degree of heat, and being mixed with particles of soil. The superiority of madder from the Levant is ascribed to its having been dried in the open air.\n\n156. The roots being dried, and the earthy matters which adhere to them being separated, by flaking them in a bag, or beating them lightly on a wooden hurdle, they are reduced to powder, by means of manual labour, or with the aid of machinery. All the parts of madder do not yield the same colouring matter. The outer bark, and the ligneous part within, give a yellowish dye, which injures the red. These parts may be separated in consequence of the different degrees of facility with which they are reduced to powder. The outer bark and woody parts are more easily powdered than the parenchymatous parts, which contain the fine red dye. To effect the separation of these different parts, three operations are performed. After the first, the madder is passed through a sieve, by which, what is called the short madder, (courte of the French), intended for tan, and inferior colours, is obtained. What remains is again ground and fitted. What the French call mirabe, is obtained by this operation. A third operation of the same kind affords the robbe, or finer kind of madder.\n\n157. The result of the experiments of D'Amboynery shew, that the fresh root of madder may be used with as much advantage in dyeing, as when it is dried and powdered. Four pounds of fresh madder, he observed, are equal to one of the dry, although in drying it loses seven-eighths of its weight. When the fresh roots are to be used, they are to be well washed in a current of water, immediately after they are taken out of the ground, and afterwards cut into pieces and bruised. In dyeing with the fresh roots, allowance should be made for the quantity of water which they contain, so that a smaller proportion should be put into the bath. Beckmann seems to be of the same opinion with regard to the use of the fresh roots of madder, and yet he has frequently observed that it is more fit for dyeing after it has been preserved for two or three years.\n\n158. The madder which is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Smyrna, and in the island of Cyprus, affords a brighter red than the European madder, and therefore it is preferred in the preparation of the Adrianople red. This is known by the name lizar. Berthollet informs us that it is cultivated in Provence in France, and Beckmann has been very successful in raising it at Gottingen.\n\n159. The colouring matter of madder is soluble in alcohol, and by evaporation a deep-red residuum is formed. In this solution sulphuric acid produces a fawn-coloured precipitate; fixed alkali, one of a violet colour, and the sulphate of potash, a precipitate of a fine red. Alum, nitre, chalk, acetate of lead, and muriate of tin, afford precipitates in the solution of madder in alcohol, of various shades. The colouring matter of madder is also soluble in water. By maceration in several portions of cold water successively, the last receives only a fawn colour, which appears entirely different from the peculiar colouring particles of this substance. It resembles what is extracted from woods and other roots, and perhaps exists only in the ligneous and cortical parts. By repeated boiling, Berthollet exhausted the madder of all its colouring particles which are soluble in water. It still retained, however, a deep colour, and yielded a considerable quantity of colouring matter to an alkali. There was an inconsiderable residuum, which still remained coloured. The pulp, therefore, appears entirely composed of colouring matter, part of which is insoluble in simple water. When oxymuriatic acid is employed in sufficient quantity, to change an infusion of madder from red to yellow, it produces a small portion of a pale-yellow precipitate; the supernatant liquor is transparent, and retains more or less of a deep yellow colour, according to the proportion and strength of the acid. Double the quantity of acid is required to discharge the colour of a decoction of madder of what is necessary to destroy that of the same weight of Brazil wood. This shews that the colouring matter of madder is more durable than that of Brazil wood. The infusion of madder in water is of a brownish orange colour. The colouring matter may be extracted, either by hot or cold water; in the latter the colour is most beautiful. The decoction is of a brownish colour. The colouring matter of mad-\nTwo ounces of madder require three quarts of water. Alum forms, in the infusion of madder, a deep brownish red precipitate; the supernatant liquor is yellowish, inclining to brown. Alkaline carbonates precipitate from this last liquor a lake of a blood-red colour; with the addition of more alkali, the precipitate is redfolved, and the liquor becomes red. Calcareous earth precipitates a darker and browner coloured lake than alkalies. Carbonate of magnesia forms a clear blood-red precipitate, which by evaporation produces a blood-red extract, soluble in water. The solution of this extract is employed as a red ink, but it becomes yellow by exposure to the sun. Metallic salts also form precipitates in a solution of madder. The precipitate with acetate of lead is of a brownish red colour; with nitrate of mercury and sulphate of manganese, a purplish brown; with sulphate of iron, a fine bright brown.\n\nCochineal.\n\n162. Cochineal, which furnishes a valuable dye stuff, and about the nature of which there was at first a good deal of uncertainty, is an insect. It is produced on different species of the cactus, or Indian fig. The most perfect variety of the cochineal insect is that which breeds on the cactus coccinillifer, Lin. To this plant the Mexican Spaniards give the name of nopal. When the Spaniards first arrived in Mexico, they saw the cochineal employed by the native inhabitants, in communicating colours to some part of their habitations, ornaments, and in dyeing cotton. Struck with its beautiful colour, they transmitted accounts of it to the Spanish ministry, who about the year 1523, ordered Cortes to direct his attention to the propagation of this substance. The inhabitants of Europe were long mistaken concerning the nature and origin of cochineal, by supposing it to be the grain or seed of a plant. This opinion was first contradicted in a paper published in the third volume of the Philosophical Transactions, in 1668, and four years afterwards, Dr Lister, in the seventh volume of the same work, throws out a conjecture, that cochineal may be a sort of kernels. Different opinions concerning the origin of this substance were entertained, till about the beginning of the year 1757, Mr Ellis obtained some of the joints of the plant on which the insects breed, from South Carolina, and presented them the same year to the Royal Society. These specimens, Mr Ellis observes, were full of the nests of this insect, in which it appeared in its various states, in the most minute when it walks about, to the state when it becomes fixed, and wrapt up in a fine web, which it spins about itself. With the assistance of the microscope, Mr Ellis discovered the true male insect in the parcels which had been sent to him from America; and in August 1759, in consequence of Mr Ellis's discovery, Dr Garden caught a male cochineal fly, which he observes is rarely to be met with.\n\nHe supposes that there may be 150 or 200 females for one male. These discoveries proved indisputably, that the cochineal is an animal production.\n\n161. The body of the female insect is flat on the breast, belly, and hemispherical on the back, and transversely wrinkled. The skin is dark brown; it has no wings, but is furnished with six short brown legs. The body of the male, which is of a deep red colour, is rather long, and covered with two wings, extending horizontally, and crossing a little upon the back. It has two small antennae, and six legs, which are larger than those of the female. It has a fluttering kind of motion. The life of the male is only of a month duration, but the fecundated female lives a month longer. The female is sometimes oviparous and sometimes viviparous; but this is not a peculiarity confined to this insect. It belongs to some others, and seems to be regulated by the temperature and season of the year. The female cochineal insect adheres to the same spot of the tree on which it is produced during her whole life. As soon as the female is delivered of its numerous progeny, it becomes a mere husk and dies. In Mexico it is therefore an object of great importance to prevent this, and to collect them in the fecundated state. For this purpose they are picked from the plants, put into a linen bag, which is immersed in hot water, to destroy the life of the young insects, and then carefully dried. In this state they are imported into Europe.\n\n162. There are two kinds of cochineal. The best, Varieties, or domesticated kind, is called by the Spaniards, grana fina. This variety breeds upon the cactus coccinillifer, or nopal; and being of a larger size, and containing a greater proportion of colouring matter, it is always preferred. The other variety is the grana silvestra of the Spaniards, or wild cochineal. It is produced from other species of the cactus. It is smaller than the other, and as it is covered with a downy matter, produced by the insect to defend itself against the cold, this increases the weight, but is of no use in dyeing. An equal weight of the wild cochineal yields a smaller quantity of colouring matter, and is therefore less valuable. It ought, however, to be observed, that it can be reared with greater facility, and at much less expense; and when it is bred upon the nopal, it acquires double the size, and has a smaller quantity of downy matter for its covering, so that it approaches, by this management, to the nature of fine cochineal.\n\n163. As the quantity of cochineal consumed in Europe is very great (p), and as the Spaniards have hitherto enjoyed the exclusive advantages of rearing and supplying the market with this valuable substance, it has become an object with other nations to share them. Attempts have therefore been made to form establishments for rearing these insects in those colonies whose soil and climate seem suitable for the purpose.\n\n---\n\n(d) The average quantity, says Dr Bancroft, of fine cochineal annually consumed in Europe, amounts to about 3000 bags, or 600,000 lbs. weight, of which about 1200 bags, or 240,000 lbs. weight may be considered as the present annual consumption of Great Britain. A greater quantity comes into the kingdom, but the surplus is again exported to other countries. These 1200 bags may be supposed to cost 180,000l. sterling, valued at 15s. per lb. which has been about the average price for some years past. Philosophy of Permanent Colours, p. 258.\nOne of the most successful of these attempts was made by M. Thiery de Menonville, in 1777. He exposed himself to great danger, by going to Mexico, that he might observe the mode of rearing the cochineal insect, and procure that valuable production, to plant it in St Domingo. He proceeded by the Havana to La Vera Cruz, where he was informed that the finest cochineal insects were reared at Guaxaca, 70 leagues distant. On the pretence of ill health, he received permission to use the baths of the river Magdalena; but instead of accepting this privilege, which was not his object, he directed his course, not without much difficulty and danger, to Guaxaca; where having obtained the information he wanted, and having purchased a quantity of nopalos, covered with the insects of the fine or domestic breed, which he pretended were of great use in preparing an ointment for his feigned disorder, the gout, he put them into boxes along with other plants, and succeeded in bringing them away without notice or suspicion. On his return, he was driven by a storm to the bay of Campeachy, where he found a living cactus of a species which was fit for the nourishment of the fine cochineal. He returned in safety towards the end of the same year, to St Domingo, with his prize, and immediately formed a plantation of nopalos, with the view of propagating both varieties of the cochineal. Soon after his return, he found the wild kind living naturally on the caactus peregrina, a native of that island. Unfortunately, however, for the establishment, Thiery de Menonville died in the year 1780, through disappointment and vexation, it is said, at seeing his patriotic endeavours so little assisted, and his services so sparingly rewarded by government; and soon after his death, the fine cochineal perished. But the discovery of the wild kind in St Domingo was not neglected. M. Bruley succeeded in his attempts to rear this species of cochineal. A posthumous work of Thiery de Menonville was published by the Royal Society of arts and sciences at Cape François, containing minute instructions with regard to every thing respecting the cultivation of the nopal, and the other species of caactus, which may be more or less successfully substituted for breeding or rearing the cochineal. Of this Berthollet has given an extract in the 5th volume of the Annales de Chimie. Some of our own countrymen, a few years ago, succeeded in procuring some of the fine cochineal insects; and attempts have been made, with what success we know not, to rear them in the East Indies.\n\nFine cochineal, if it has been properly prepared and kept, ought to be of a gray colour, with a shade of purple. The gray colour is owing to a powder with which it is naturally covered, and part of which it still retains. The colouring matter extracted by the water in which the insect has been killed, produces the purple shade. In a dry place, cochineal may be kept for a long time, without losing any of its properties. Hellot made experiments on cochineal 150 years old, and found that it produced the same effect as if it had been quite new. Cochineal yields its colouring matter to water; and the decoction, which is of a crimson colour, inclining to violet, may be kept for a long time, without losing its transparency, or becoming putrid. If this decoction be evaporated, and the residuum or extract be digested in alcohol, the colouring part dissolves, and leaves a residuum of the colour of wine lees, of which fresh alcohol cannot deprive it. The alcohol of cochineal affords, by evaporation, a transparent residuum of a deep red, which being dried, has the appearance of a resin. A small quantity of sulphuric acid added to the decoction of cochineal, produces a red colour, inclining to yellow, and a small quantity of a beautiful red precipitate. With muriatic acid the same change is produced, but there is no precipitate. A solution of tartar converts the decoction to a yellowish red colour. A precipitate of a pale red colour is slowly formed, and the supernatant liquor remains yellow; but with the addition of an alkali becomes purple. With the yellow liquor, solution of tin forms a rose-coloured precipitate; solution of alum brightens the colour of the infusion, gives it a redder hue, and produces a crimson precipitate. With a mixture of alum and tartar the colour is brighter, more lively, and inclines to a yellowish red. Muriate of tin occasions a copious sediment of a beautiful red. The supernatant liquor is colourless and transparent, and no change is produced on it by adding an alkali. Sulphate of iron forms a brown violet precipitate, and the supernatant liquor remains clear, with a slight darkish hue. Sulphate of zinc gives a deep violet precipitate; the supernatant liquor remains colourless and transparent. The precipitate with sulphate of copper is of a violet colour, and forms slowly; the supernatant liquor is also violet and transparent. Acetate of lead gives a purple violet precipitate, and the supernatant liquor remains limpid.\n\nThe experiments of Berthollet and Bancroft show, that the colouring matter of cochineal is not entirely extracted by means of water. Dr Bancroft found, that after the whole of it which could be extracted by water was obtained, by adding a little potash to the seemingly exhausted sediment, and pouring on it fresh boiling water, it yielded a new quantity of colouring matter, equal to one-eighth of what had been given out to the water; and Berthollet found the same effect produced with the addition of tartar; from which he concludes, that tartar favours the solution of the colouring part of the cochineal.\n\nKermes (κερμης), another animal substance, which Kermes is extensively employed in dyeing, is an insect, (coccus ilicius, Lin.) which breeds on a species of oak, (quercus coccifera, Lin.) which grows in most of the southern parts of Europe, and in many parts of Asia. Kermes was known to the ancients, under the names of coccus fearlatinum, coccus bapticus, coccus infestarius, granum tinctorium. Kermes is chiefly obtained from Languedoc, Spain, and Portugal. The insects are collected in the month of May or June, when the female, which alone\n\n(g) This word is supposed to have been derived from the Arabic language, and signifies a little worm, vermiculus; and from this we have the word vermilion, the pigment in the manufacture of which it is the principal ingredient.\nOf Simple alone is useful, is distended with eggs. To destroy the young insects, the kermes is exposed to the steam of vinegar for about half an hour, or steeped in vinegar for 10 or 12 hours. They are afterwards dried on linen cloths, and brought to market.\n\nProperties.\n\n168. When the living insect is bruised, it gives out a red colour. The smell is somewhat pleasant; the taste is bitter and pungent. It gives out its colouring matter both to water and alcohol, to which also it imparts its smell and taste. The colour is also retained in the extract which is obtained, both from the tincture, and from the infusion. Kermes is one of the most ancient dyeing drugs; and although the colours which it communicates to cloth are less bright and vivid than those of cochineal, and on that account it has been less extensively employed in dyeing since the latter was known, yet they have been found to be exceedingly permanent. The fine blood-red colour which is to be seen on old tapestries in different parts of Europe, was produced from kermes, with an alumimous mordant, and seems to have suffered no change, though some of them are 200 or 300 years old. The colour obtained from kermes was formerly called scarlet in grain, because it was supposed that the insect was a grain; and from the chief manufactory having been at one time in Venice, it was called Venetian scarlet.\n\n169. Lac is an animal production which has been long known in India, and used for dyeing silk and other purposes. It is the nidus of the coccus lacca, Lin., and is generally produced on the small branches of the croton lacciferum. Three kinds of lac are well known in commerce: 1. Stick lac is the substance or comb, in its natural state, forming a crust on the small branches or twigs. 2. Seed lac is said to be only the above, separated from the twigs, and reduced into small fragments. Mr Hatchett, who has examined this substance with his usual skill and precision, found the best specimens considerably deprived of their colouring matter*. According to the information which he received from Mr Wilkins, the silk dyers in Bengal produce the seed lac by pounding crude lac into small fragments, and extracting part of the colouring matter by boiling. 3. Shell lac is prepared from the cells, liquefied, strained, and formed into thin transparent laminae. There is also a fourth kind called lump lac, which is obtained from the seed lac by liquefaction, and afterwards formed into cakes. The best lac is of a deep red colour; when it is pale, and pierced at the top, the value is greatly diminished, for then the insects have left their cells, and it can no longer be of use as a dye stuff.\n\nProperties.\n\n170. The decoction of powdered stick lac in water, gives a deep crimson colour. With one-fifth of borax, lac becomes more soluble in water. Pure soda, and carbonate of soda, completely dissolve the different kinds of lac, and produce a deeper colour than that which is obtained by means of borax. Pure potash speedily dissolves all the varieties of lac; the colour approaches to purple. Pure ammonia and carbonate of ammonia readily act on the colouring matter of lac. Alcohol dissolves a considerable portion of the lac; and, according to Geoffroy, yields a fine red colour. When the solution is heated it becomes turbid. Sulphuric acid dissolves the colouring matter of lac, as well as muriatic and acetic acids. In the use of lac in dyeing, it has been considered superior to kermes, because it is able to bear the action of a solution of tin, without the colour being changed to yellow.\n\n171. Archil is a vegetable substance of great use in dyeing. It is employed in the form of a paste, which is of a red violet colour. It is chiefly obtained from two species of lichen, roccella and parellus, Lin. The first, which is called Canary archil, because the lichen from which it is prepared grows abundantly in the Canary islands, is most valued. It is prepared by reducing the plant to a fine powder, which is afterwards passed through a sieve, and slightly moistened with stale urine. The mixture is daily stirred, each time adding a certain proportion of soda in powder, till it acquire a clove colour. It is then put into a wooden cask, and urine, lime-water, or a solution of sulphate of lime, (gypsum,) is added in sufficient quantity to cover the mixture. In this state it is kept; but to preserve it any length of time, it is necessary to moisten it occasionally with urine. By a similar preparation, other species of lichen may be used in dyeing. In this country the lichen ombrophilus and tartareus are frequently employed for dyeing coarse cloths.\n\n172. Archil gives out its colouring matter to water, ammonia, and alcohol. The infusion of archil is of a crimson colour, with a shade of violet. The addition of an acid converts it to a red colour. Fixed alkalies only render it of a deeper shade; because its natural colour has been already modified by the ammonia with which it is combined in the preparation. Alum produces in the solution of archil a dark-red precipitate; the supernatant liquor is of a yellowish red colour. With solution of tin a reddish precipitate is formed, which subsides slowly; and the liquor retains a slight tinge of red. This infusion loses its colour in a few days if it be entirely excluded from the air. To cold marble the aqueous infusion of archil communicates a fine violet colour, or blue inclining to purple. The affinity between the stone and the colouring matter is so strong, that it resists the action of the air longer than colours which it gives to other substances. The colour thus communicated to marble, has remained for two years unchanged.\n\n173. Archil is also soluble in alcohol. This tincture is employed for making spirit of wine thermometers. A singular phenomenon was observed by the Abbé Nollet when the tincture was excluded from the air. In a few years it was entirely deprived of its colour. The contact of air restored the colour; but it was again destroyed when deprived of it.\n\n174. Carthamus, or bastard saffron, a vegetable substance used in dyeing, is the flower of an annual plant which is cultivated in Spain, Egypt, and the Levant. There are two varieties of this plant, the one with larger, the other with smaller leaves. The variety with larger leaves is cultivated in Egypt.\n\n175. The method of preparing the flowers of carthamus in Egypt, as it is described by Hafsloult, is the following. After being pressed between two stones, to squeeze out the juice, they are washed several times with salt water, pressed between the hands, and spread out on mats in the open air, to dry. In the daytime they are covered, that they may not dry too fast with the heat of the sun, but they are left exposed to the dew of the night. When they are sufficiently dry, they are put\nOf Simple put up, and kept for sale, under the name of saffronon. Colours. Care should be taken afterwards, not to keep it in too dry a place; for unless it is a little moist, its properties are considerably impaired.\n\nProperties. Carthamus contains two colouring substances, a yellow substance, which is soluble in water, and as it is of no use, it is extracted by the process mentioned above, by squeezing the flowers between stones till no more colour can be pressed out. The flowers become reddish in this operation, and lose nearly one half of their weight. The other colouring matter, which is red, is soluble in alkaline carbonates, and it is precipitated by means of an acid. A vegetable acid, as lemon juice, has been found to produce the finest colour. Next to this, sulphuric acid produces the best effect, provided too great a quantity, which would alter and destroy the colour, be not employed. The juice of the berries of the mountain ash, or rowan tree, (Sorbus aucuparia, Lin.) is recommended by Scheffer as a substitute for lemon juice, and it is thus prepared. The berries are bruised in a mortar with a wooden pestle, and the expressed juice, after it has been allowed to ferment, is bottled up. The clear part, which is most acid, becomes fitter for use the longer it is kept; but this operation requires a period of some months, and can only be conducted in summer.\n\nPreparation of rouge. From the colouring matter extracted by means of an alkali, and precipitated with an acid, is procured the substance called rouge, which is employed as a paint for the skin. The solution of carthamus is prepared with crystals of soda, and precipitated with lemon juice which has stood some days to settle. After being dried on delft plates with a gentle heat, the precipitate is separated, and ground accurately with talc which has been previously reduced to a very subtile powder; and on the fineness of the talc depends the difference between the cheaper and dearer kinds of rouge.\n\nBrazil wood. Brazil wood is of very extensive use in dyeing. It is the wood of the ceiba speciosa criolla, Lin. and is a native of America and the West Indies. It is known under different names, according to the place where it is produced; as, Fernambouc, Braziletto, wood of St Martha, and of Sapan. It is a very hard wood, and has so much density as to sink in water. When fresh cut, it is of a pale colour, but becomes reddish by exposure to the air, and it has a sweetish taste.\n\nThe colouring matter of Brazil wood is soluble in water, and the whole of it may be extracted by continuing the boiling for a sufficient length of time. The decoction is of a fine red colour. The residuum, which is black, yields a considerable portion of colouring matter to alkalis. This colouring matter is also soluble in alcohol, and in ammonia, and the colour is deeper than that of the aqueous solution. The tincture of Brazil wood in alcohol gives to hot marble a red colour, which afterwards changes to violet. The fresh decoction yields, with sulphuric acid, a small portion of a red precipitate, inclining to fawn colour. Nitric acid first produces a yellow colour, but by adding more, a deep orange. Oxalic acid produces a precipitate of an orange red. Tartar furnishes a small precipitate; with the addition of fixed alkali, the decoction becomes of a deep crimson or violet colour. Ammonia gives a brighter purple; alum produces a copious red precipitate, inclining to crimson. Sulphate of iron occasions a black colour in the tincture, with a copious precipitate of the same colour. Sulphate of copper also produces an abundant precipitate, the liquor remaining transparent, and of a brownish red. A copious precipitate of a fine deep red, is produced with acetate of lead, and that obtained with muriate of tin is abundant, and of a fine rose colour. With the addition of corrosive sublimate, a light precipitate, which is of a brown colour, is obtained. The liquor remains transparent, and of a fine yellow colour. Brazil wood which has been changed to a yellow colour by means of tartar and acetic acid, with a solution of nitro-muriate of tin, yields a copious rose-coloured precipitate; and if to the solution, rendered yellow by an acid, a greater quantity of the same acid, or a stronger acid, as the sulphuric, be added, the red colour is restored. Some salts also possess the property of restoring the red colour of Brazil wood, which has been destroyed by means of acids*. The decoction of Brazil wood,* four de which is called juice of Brazil, is found to answer better for the processes of dyeing, when it has been kept some time, and has even undergone some degree of fermentation, than when it has been freshly prepared. The colour, by keeping, becomes of a yellowish red.\n\nLogwood, sometimes called India or Campeachian wood, peachy wood, (Hematoxylon Campechianum, Lin.) is a tree which grows to a considerable size in Jamaica, and the eastern shore of the bay of Campeachy. Its specific gravity is greater than that of water; it has a fine grain, and is susceptible of a fine polish. Logwood yields its colouring matter, which is a fine red, readily and copiously to alcohol. It is more sparingly soluble in water, and the decoction inclines a little to violet or purple. When it is left some time to itself, it becomes yellowish, and at length black. It becomes yellow also by the action of acids; alkalis produce a deeper colour, and convert it to a purple or violet. Sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids form a small proportion of precipitate, which separates slowly: the precipitate formed with sulphuric acid is of a dark red; with muriatic, a lighter red, and with the nitric, feuille morte. With sulphuric and muriatic acids, the supernatant liquor is of a deep red colour; with nitric it is yellowish, and in all transparent. Oxalic acid produces a precipitate of a light maroon colour; the liquor remains transparent, and is yellowish red. Acetic acid produces a similar effect, but the colour of the precipitate is somewhat deeper. A similar precipitate is obtained by means of tartar; but the liquor, which is more inclined to yellow, remains turbid. No precipitate is produced by means of fixed alkali; the decoction becomes of a deep violet, which is afterwards converted to a brown colour. Alum yields a copious precipitate, of a lightish violet colour; the colour of the liquor remains the same, and it is nearly transparent. A copious, dark red precipitate is produced with alum and tartar; the liquor is yellowish red and transparent. Sulphate of iron occasions a bluish black colour; a copious precipitate of the same colour is formed, and the liquor remains long turbid. With sulphate of copper, a very copious precipitate, of a deep brown colour, is obtained; the liquor, which is also of a deep brown, or yellowish red, remains transparent. Acetate of lead yields a black precipitate,\nOf Simple with a slight tinge of red; the colour of the liquor is like that of pale beer, and it remains transparent. Nitro-muriate of tin gives a precipitate of a fine violet or purple colour; the liquor remains clear and colourless.\n\n2. Of the Processes for Dyeing Wool Red.\n\n181. All red colouring matters with which we are acquainted, come under that class of colours to which Dr Bancroft has given the name of adjective colours; that is, such colours as require the aid of mordants to render them permanent. Red colours, we have already observed, are of various shades, according to the nature and proportion of the colouring matters employed. Hence we have madder red, flearlet, crimson, and other shades.\n\nMadder red.\n\n182. Madder Red.—Madder is only employed for dyeing coarse woollen stuffs, and the following is the process. The stuffs are first boiled for two or three hours with alum and tartar; they are then left to drain, slightly wrung out, put into a linen bag, and carried into a cool place, where they are to remain for some days. The quantities and proportions of the alum and tartar are varied according to the views of the dyer, and the shade of colour which is wanted. Some recommend five ounces of alum and one ounce of tartar to each pound of wool. By increasing the proportion of tartar to a certain degree, a deep and permanent cinnamon colour, instead of a red, is produced. This arises from the yellow tinge which is induced by means of the acid on the colouring particles of the madder. Others propose to diminish the proportion of tartar, and to employ only a seventh part. In conducting the process of dyeing with madder, the bath should not be brought to the boiling point, because at that temperature the fawn-coloured particles would be dissolved, and a different shade obtained from that which is desired. When the water is at that degree of temperature which the hand can bear, Hellot recommends the addition of half a pound of grape madder for every pound of wool to be dyed. It is then to be well stirred before the wool is introduced, which must remain for an hour without boiling, excepting for a few minutes towards the end of the process, that the combination of the colouring particles with the stuff may be more certain.\n\nRising.\n\n183. Madder reds are sometimes rofed, as it is called, with archil and Brazil wood. In this way they become more beautiful and velvety, but this brightness is not permanent. But madder reds, even when they are most perfect, are far inferior to those obtained from lac and cochineal, and even to that produced by kermes; but as the expense of the materials is comparatively small, they are employed, as we have already observed, for coarse stuffs.\n\nProportion of madder.\n\n184. Different authors recommend different proportions of madder. Poerner proposes to employ one-third of the weight of the wool, while Scheffer limits the quantity to one-fourth. In one process, Poerner added to the alum and tartar, a quantity of solution of tin, equal in weight to the tartar, and after two hours boiling, allowed the cloth to remain in the bath, which had been left to cool for three or four days. He then dyed it in the usual way, and thus obtained a fine red. According to another process, he prepared the cloth by the common boiling, and dyed it in a bath slightly heated, with a larger proportion of madder, tartar, and solution of tin. The cloth remained 24 hours in the bath, and when it had become cold, he put it into another bath, made with madder only, where it remained for 24 hours. By this process he got a fine red, somewhat brighter than the common, but inclining a little to yellow. Scheffer informs us that he obtained an orange red by boiling wool with a solution of tin, and one-fourth of alum, and then by dyeing with one-fourth of madder. A cherry colour is obtained, according to Bergman, by dyeing with one part of a solution of tin, and two of madder, without previously boiling the wool. By exposure to the air, this colour becomes deeper. By boiling the wool for two hours with one-fourth of sulphate of iron, then washing it, and afterwards immerging it in cold water with one-fourth of madder, and then boiling for an hour, the result is a coffee colour. But if the wool has not been soaked, and if it be dyed with one part of sulphate of iron and two of madder, the colour is a brown approaching to red.\n\n185. When sulphate of copper is employed as the different mordant, the madder dye yields a clear brown, inclining somewhat to yellow; and a similar colour may be produced by dyeing the wool simply soaked in hot water, with one part of sulphate of copper, and two of madder. But when this mordant and dye-stuff are used in equal proportions, the yellow is somewhat more obscure, approaching to green; and in both these instances, exposure to the air does not produce a darker colour. Berthollet informs us that he employed a solution of tin in various ways, both in the preparation and in the application of the madder; and by the use of different solutions of tin, he found, that although the tint was somewhat brighter than what is obtained by the common process, it was always more inclined to yellow or fawn colour.\n\n186. Scarlet.—The finest and most splendid of all scarlet colours is scarlet. This, like other colours, is of various shades, according to the quality and proportion of the colouring matter employed. The scarlet dye is communicated to woollen stuffs by means of cochineal, the history and properties of which we have already detailed. The Mexicans, as appears from their history, employed alumina as the basis or mordant, to fix the colour of cochineal; and previous to the discovery of the solution of tin, the use of the same substance seems to have prevailed in Europe. The fine colour obtained from the latter, received, as we have already mentioned, different names in different places; as that of bow dye in England, scarlet of the Gobelins in France, and in Holland Dutch scarlet.\n\n187. In the process for dyeing scarlet, two operations are necessary. The first is denominated the boiling, and the second is distinguished by the name of finishing or reddening. The operation of boiling, which is the first part of the process, is conducted in the following manner. For 100 pounds of cloth, 6 pounds of pure tartar are added to the water, which is made pretty warm. The bath is then to be briskly stirred, and when the heat has increased a little more, half a pound of powdered cochineal is to be added, and the whole is then to be well mixed. The next moment five pounds of a very clear solution of tin are to be poured...\nOf Simple Colours.\n\npoured in, and carefully mixed. When the bath begins to boil, the cloth is introduced, and briskly moved for two or three turns; after which it is moved more slowly. The boiling having continued for two hours, the cloth is taken out, exposed to the air, and carried to the river to be well washed.\n\nReddening.\n\n188. In the preparation of the second bath, which is for the reddening, the boiler is to be emptied, and when the bath has just reached the boiling point, five pounds and three quarters of cochineal, previously powdered and sifted, are to be added. These are to be carefully mixed; and after having ceased stirring, when a crust has formed on the surface, and opened of itself in several places, 13 or 14 pounds of solution of tin are poured in. Should the bath, during the boiling, rise above the edge of the boiler, it may be cooled with a little cold water. This solution being well mixed, the cloth is put in, and two or three times quickly turned. It is then boiled in the bath for an hour, taking care to keep it under the surface. It is afterwards taken out, exposed to the air, and when it has cooled, washed in the river and dried.\n\nThere are no determinate proportions of cochineal and solution of tin in either of these operations. Hellot informs us, that some dyers employ two-thirds of solution of tin, and one-fourth of cochineal, in the boiling or first operation, and the other one-third of the solution of tin with the remaining three-fourths of the cochineal in the second operation, or the reddening. He adds farther, that the use of tartar gives a greater degree of permanency to the colour, provided the proportion do not exceed one-half the weight of the cochineal employed. According to Berthollet, several dyers at present adopt this practice. Tartar, he observes, promotes the solution of the colouring matter, and this effect is greater when it is ground with the cochineal, after which it is found that the residuum is more completely exhausted. But this consideration is of inferior consequence, when the operations are successively performed, because any colouring matter that may remain in the residuum, is employed in the next operation. It ought not, however, to be overlooked, that the tartar communicates to the colour a rosy hue.\n\nIt is the practice of some dyers not to remove the cloth out of the boiling. They merely refresh it, and perform the operation of reddening in the same bath. When this is done, the infusion of cochineal, made in a separate vessel, and mixed with the proper proportion of solution of tin, is added. By conducting the process in this way the scarlet is supposed to be equally fine, and there is a considerable saving of time and fuel.\n\nTo give scarlet the bright lively red which, as it approaches to the colour of fire, has been distinguished by the name of fiery scarlet, a yellow tinge is communicated by boiling fustic in the first bath, or by adding a little turmeric to the cochineal. A larger proportion of the solution of tin also produces this yellow shade, but it renders the cloth harsh, and limits the action of the colouring matter. The use of fustic or turmeric, therefore, although the colour obtained from them is not permanent, is preferable to an excess of the solution of tin. When these substances are used, the inside of the cloth, when it is cut, appears yellow; but in the ordinary processes, the cochineal, it is found, does not penetrate the cloth, for when no other substance is employed, the cloth is internally white.\n\nThe use of tin boilers is recommended in dyeing. Tin and copper boilers, when copper boilers are employed, the acid acts on the metal, and thus forming a solution, injures the beauty of the colour. Tin boilers, however, are attended with several inconveniences. It is difficult to procure them of sufficient size, and they are apt to be melted by the incautious continuance of the fire, after they have been emptied. In the use of copper boilers, there are several necessary precautions. They must be kept very clean; the acid liquor should not be allowed to remain in them for any length of time, and some contrivance should be adopted to prevent the cloth from touching the metal, either by using a net, or a wicker basket.\n\nDifferent proportions of materials, we have observed, are recommended by different authors. For proportion of the boiling, Scheffer directs an ounce and a half of solution of tin, with an equal quantity of starch, and as much tartar, to every pound of cloth. The effect of the starch is to give more uniformity to the colour. When the water boils, a dram of cochineal is to be added; it is then to be well stirred, and after the wool is introduced, to be boiled an hour, taken out, and washed. The proportions for the reddening bath, in which the wool is to be boiled half an hour, are half an ounce of starch, three-fourths of an ounce of solution of tin, half an ounce of tartar, and 7 drams of cochineal. In Scheffer's process, it may be observed, the proportion of solution of tin is smaller than in that of Hellot, but the quantity of tin in the solution of the former is greater than in that of the latter.\n\nPoerner has described three principal processes, according to the variety of the shade of the scarlet. He uses no cochineal in the boiling; the materials of which are one ounce and six drams of tartar, and an equal weight of solution of tin, the latter being added after the tartar is dissolved, for every pound of cloth. As soon as the boiling has commenced, the cloth is introduced, and it is boiled for two hours. For the reddening of the first process he employs two drams of tartar and one ounce of cochineal, adding gradually afterwards two ounces of solution of tin. For the reddening of the second process, the same quantity of cochineal and solution of tin, without any tartar, is employed. In the reddening of the third process, two drams of tartar, with one ounce of solution of tin, one ounce of cochineal, and two ounces of common salt, are directed to be used. The colour produced in the first process has the deepest shade; that of the second is more lively, while that of the third is paler and brighter.\n\nBy the use of tartar in the reddening in different proportions, various shades of scarlet may be obtained. When it is employed, the shade is deeper and fuller, but when it is entirely omitted, the scarlet approaches to an orange colour. The shade of colour also is subject to considerable variety, from the different degrees of strength of the solution of tin. To ascertain this effect, Berthollet made a number of experiments. He found that a solution of tin composed of sixteen parts of nitric acid, two of muriate of ammonia,\nOf Simple monia, and three of tin, produced a deeper shade than Colours when the proportions of the acid and muriate of ammonia were equal, with only two parts of tin. The last proportions, he observes, succeeded best. Four parts of water were mixed with the solution. When the proportion of muriate of ammonia amounted only to half a part, the colour was brighter, and inclining to orange.\n\n196. Common salt has the effect of increasing the brightness of scarlet, while it is also attended with the advantage of causing the colour to penetrate deeper into the cloth. It seems difficult to explain why common salt, which gives a deeper shade to the colour of the infusion of cochineal, and indeed produces a similar effect on colours in general, should diminish the intensity of the colour of scarlet. The proportion of common salt mentioned above (194) is, according to Poerner, the greatest that can be employed. When less is used, the shade, though lighter, is more agreeable. By adding five ounces of white sugar to the ingredients of the second process, a finer colour, which is always lighter than that of the first process, will be obtained. The colour, it is said, is more permanent, and the shade more agreeable, when the cloth is left 24 hours in the boiler after it has cooled.\n\n197. It has been generally supposed, Dr Bancroft observes, that after the discovery of the effects of tin scarlet with the cochineal colour, to produce a scarlet, it was only necessary to apply the colour so produced as a dye to wool; or that a nitric or nitro-muriatic solution of tin might change the natural crimson of cochineal to a scarlet. This opinion, however, he considers to be quite erroneous; for the nitric solution of tin invariably produces with cochineal a crimson or rose colour, and not a scarlet, unless other means are employed to incline the cochineal colour to a yellow shade. This effect is produced by means of the tartar, which seems to have been accidentally stumbled upon, and has been for many ages used, without knowing its true effect. Tartar was long employed with the aluminoous mordant, in the preparation of the ordinary boiling liquor for woollen cloths; and it is probable that its good effects being observed in this combination, the use of it was continued after the introduction of the solution of tin; and the more so, after the result of the combination was observed in the brilliancy of the colour which was produced. Dr Bancroft has particularly directed his attention to the process for dyeing scarlet; and in the progress of his investigations, he has found that it is by no means absolutely necessary to follow the usual process which we have described above. He has often, he says, produced that colour very well at a single boiling, by mixing the whole quantity of tartar, solution of tin, and cochineal together; the affinity of the wool for the colouring matter, and for the oxide of tin, being sufficiently strong to combine with them readily, and to retain them permanently. The only objection to simplifying the process in this manner is, that the colouring matter of the dyeing liquor is less perfectly exhausted than when two operations are performed. He farther adds, that he has often produced a beautiful scarlet, by preparing and boiling the cloth with the whole quantity of solution of tin and tartar at once, and afterwards dyeing it unrifled, with the whole of the cochineal, dissolved only in pure water. In this way he found the colouring particles completely taken up; that the liquor had become quite colourless, and that the cloth had received a durable dye.\n\n198. \"It is remarkable,\" says Dr Bancroft, \"that during the 18th century, no considerable improvement has been made in the process for dyeing scarlet; a circumstance which is the more extraordinary, since the pre-eminent lustre and costly nature of this dye, have rendered it an object of particular attention, not only to dyers, but to eminent chemists, by whose researches we might have expected that at least every obvious improvement therein would have been long since attained.\" To attain this object, this ingenious philosopher instituted a set of experiments, about the year 1786. Having, by repeated affusions of boiling water, extracted the whole of the colouring matter from powdered croft's extract of cochineal, he found that the addition of a little potash to the seemingly exhausted sediment, and a fresh quantity of boiling water, extracted a new portion of colouring matter, equal to about one-eighth of what had been given out to the pure water. He repeatedly extracted this colouring matter by means of potash, and afterwards dyed small pieces of cloth scarlet with it, which he found similar to other pieces dyed with the more soluble colouring matter of cochineal. It was in the course of these inquiries that he perceived scarlet to be a compound colour, consisting of about three-fourths of pure crimson or rose colour, and one-fourth of pure bright yellow. He conceived, therefore, that Scarlet a when the natural crimson of the cochineal is made compound scarlet, by the usual process, there must be a change colour produced, equivalent to a conversion of one-fourth of the colouring matter of cochineal from its natural crimson to a yellow colour. From this he concludes that there might be a great saving of cochineal, by substituting a cheaper substance, which at the same time might yield a better yellow colour. It was therefore his object to combine with this crimson or rose colour, a suitable portion of a lively golden yellow, capable of being permanently fixed, and reflected by the same basis. Such a yellow he had discovered in quercitron bark, (quercus nigra, Lin.) which will be afterwards described; and it had the advantage, not only of being the brightest, but also the cheapest of all the yellows, which he had tried.\n\n199. With the view of diminishing the quantity of cochineal employed, in producing a scarlet dye, Dr Bancroft made a number of experiments under the authority of government. In these experiments, the mordant used was the ordinary dyer's spirit, or the nitro-muriate of tin; but he found that they were not attended with the advantages which he expected. In some of his earliest experiments, he observes, that the solution of tin by means of sulphuric acid destroyed the cochineal colour; and this naturally led him to reject the use of this acid, till accident brought him to dissolve a quantity of tin in muriatic acid, combined with one-fourth of sulphuric acid. The application of this solution in dyeing, was not accompanied with the corrosive effects of the muriate and nitro-muriate which he had employed in the experiments above alluded to, and which proved unsuccessful. After trying different proportions of these acids, he found the following to answer best. In a mixture of 2lbs. of sulphuric acid of the ordinary strength, and about 3lbs. of muriatic acid,\nOf Simple acid, he dissolved about 14 oz. of tin. The muriatic acid is first poured on a large quantity of granulated tin, in a large glass receiver, and the sulphuric acid is then slowly added. The solution is more rapidly promoted by means of a sand heat, but it will take place in the cold, requiring only a greater length of time. This muri-o-sulphate of tin is transparent and colourless, and may be kept for several years without any precipitation. It produces twice the effect of the dyers spirit, at less than one-third of the expense, and raises the colours not only more than the dyers spirit, but also full as much as the tartarate of tin, without converting the crimson of cochineal to a yellowish shade.\n\n200. In the use of this solution of tin as a mordant, to produce the compound scarlet colour with the cochineal crimson and quercitron yellow, Dr Bancroft recommends the following process. \"Nothing,\" says he, \"is necessary but to put the cloth, suppose 100lb. weight, into a proper tin vessel, nearly filled with water, in which about eight pounds of the muri-o-sulphuric solution of tin have been previously mixed, to make the liquor boil, turning the cloth as usual through it, by the winch, for a quarter of an hour; then turning the cloth out of the liquor, to put it into about four pounds of cochineal, and two pounds and a half of quercitron bark in powder, and having mixed them well, to return the cloth again into the liquor, making it boil, and continue the operation as usual until the colour be duly raised, and the dyeing liquor exhausted, which will be the case in about fifteen or twenty minutes; after which the cloth may be taken out and rinsed as usual. In this way the time, labour, and fuel, necessary for filling and heating the dyeing vessel a second time, will be saved; the operation finished much more speedily than in the common way; and there will be a saving of all the tartar, as well as of two-thirds of the cost of spirit, or nitro-muriatic solution of tin, which for dyeing 100lb. of wool, commonly amounts to 10s.; whereas, 8lb. of the muri-o-sulphuric solution will only cost about 3s. There will be moreover a saving of at least one-fourth of the cochineal usually employed, (which is generally computed at the rate of one ounce for every pound of cloth,) and the colour produced will certainly not prove inferior in any respect to that dyed with much more expense and trouble in the ordinary way. When a rose-colour is wanted, it may be readily and cheaply dyed in this way, only omitting the quercitron bark, instead of the complex method now practised of first producing a scarlet, and then changing it to a rose by the volatile alkali contained in stale urine, set free or decomposed by potash or by lime: and even if any one should still unwisely choose to continue the practice of dyeing scarlet without quercitron bark, he need only employ the usual proportions of tartar and cochineal, with a suitable quantity of the muri-o-sulphate of tin, which, whilst it costs so much less, will be more effectual than the dyers spirit.\n\n201. \"Several hundreds of experiments warrant my assertion, that at least a fourth part of the cochineal cochineal, generally employed in dyeing scarlet, may be saved by obtaining so much yellow as is necessary to compose this colour from the quercitron bark; and indeed nothing can be more self-evident, than that such an effect, ceteris paribus, ought necessarily to result from this combination of different colouring matters, suited to produce the compound colour in question. Let it be recollected that the cochineal crimson, though capable of being changed by tartar towards the yellow hue on one hand, is also capable by other means of being changed towards a blue on the other, and of thereby producing a purple without indigo or any other blue colouring matter: yet I am confident that nobody would believe a pound of cochineal so employed capable alone of dyeing as much cloth, of any particular shade of purple, as might be dyed with it, if the whole of its colouring matter were employed solely in furnishing the crimson part of the purple, whilst the other (blue) part thereof was obtained from indigo. To say that a pound of cochineal alone could produce as much effect or colour as a pound of cochineal and a pound of indigo together, would be an improbability much too obvious and palpable for human belief; and there certainly would be a similar improbability in alleging, that a pound of cochineal, employed in giving another compound colour (scarlet), could alone produce as much effect as a pound of cochineal and a pound of quercitron bark, when the colour of this last was employed only in furnishing one of the component parts of the scarlet, for which a considerable portion of the colouring matter of the cochineal must otherwise have been expended, which certainly happens in the new mode of dyeing scarlet, because the colour produced with an addition of the quercitron yellow inclines no more towards a yellow, than the scarlet produced by yellowing a part of the cochineal colour in the usual method with tartar. I retain, therefore, at this moment, as much confidence as I ever had in the reality and importance of my proposed improvements in this respect (n.)\"\n\n202. \"The scarlet composed of cochineal crimson Advantages and quercitron yellow, is moreover attended with this advantage, that it may be dyed upon wool and wool. Process. len yarn without any danger of its being changed to a rose or crimson, by the process of fulling, as always happens to scarlet dyed by the usual means. This last being in fact nothing but a crimson or rose colour, yellowed by some particular action or effect of the tartar, is liable to be made crimson again by the application of many\n\n(n) \"Of the benefit which I formerly expected to obtain by employing potash to extract a part of the cochineal colour, which water alone did not appear capable of extracting, it must be remarked that I have sometime since convinced myself of its being an illusion; for, by repeated trials, I have found that the solid parts of powdered cochineal remaining after it has been boiled with the solution of tin, as in the common dyeing process, yield no colour worth notice, upon the application of potash, the solution of tin enabling the water to extract the colour sufficiently; so that in truth there is no such waste of cochineal colour as I had supposed in the usual way of employing that drug.\"\nOf simple many chemical agents, (which readily overcome the changeable yellow produced by the tartar,) and particularly by calcareous earths, soap, alkaline salts, &c. But where the cochineal colouring matter is applied and fixed merely as a crimson or rose colour, and is rendered scarlet by superadding a very permanent quercitron yellow, capable of resisting the strongest acids and alkalis, (which it does when dyed with solutions of tin,) no such change can take place, because the cochineal colour having never ceased to be crimson, cannot be rendered more so, and therefore cannot suffer by those impressions or applications which frequently change or spot scarlet dyed according to the present practice.\"\n\n203. \"There is also a singular property attending the compound scarlet dyed with cochineal and quercitron bark; which is, that if it be compared with another piece of scarlet dyed in the usual way, and both appear by day-light exactly of the same shade, the former, if they be afterwards compared by candle-light, will appear to be at least several shades higher and fuller than the latter; a circumstance of some importance, when it is considered how much this and other gay colours are generally worn and exhibited by candle-light during a considerable part of the year.\"\n\n204. \"To illustrate more clearly the effects of the murio-sulphuric solution of tin with cochineal in dyeing, I shall state a very few of my numerous experiments therewith; observing, however, that they were all several times repeated, and always with similar effects.\n\n\"1st, I boiled one hundred parts of woollen cloth in water, with eight parts of the murio-sulphuric solution of tin, during the space of ten or fifteen minutes; I then added to the same water four parts of cochineal, and two parts and a half of quercitron bark in powder, and boiled the cloth fifteen or twenty minutes longer; at the end of which it had nearly imbibed all the colour of the dyeing liquor, and received a very good, even, and bright scarlet. Similar cloth dyed of that colour at the same time in the usual way, and with a fourth part more of cochineal, was found upon comparison to have somewhat less body than the former; the effect of the quercitron bark in the first case having been more than equal to the additional portion of cochineal employed in the latter, and made yellow by the action of tartar.\"\n\n\"2d, To see whether the tartrite of tin would, besides yellowing the cochineal crimson, contribute to raise and exalt its colour more than the murio-sulphate of that metal, I boiled one hundred parts of cloth with eight parts of the murio-sulphuric solution, and six parts of tartar, for the space of one hour; I then dyed the cloth, unrinsed, in clean water, with four parts of cochineal, and two parts and a half of quercitron bark, which produced a bright aurora colour, because a double portion of yellow had been here produced, first by the quercitron bark, and then by the action of tartar upon the cochineal colouring matter. To bring back this aurora to the scarlet colour, by taking away or changing the yellow produced by the tartar, I divided the cloth whilst unrinsed into three equal parts, and boiled one of them a few minutes in water slightly impregnated with potash; another in water with a little powdered chalk, by which all the pieces became scarlet; but the two last appeared somewhat brighter than the first, the ammoniac and chalk having each rofed the cochineal colour rather more advantageously than the potash. The best of these, however, by comparison, did not seem preferable to the compound scarlet dyed without tartar, as in the preceding experiment; consequently this did not seem to exalt the cochineal colour more than the murio-sulphate of tin; had it done so, the use of it in this way would have been easy, without relinquishing the advantages of the quercitron yellow.\"\n\n\"3d, I boiled one hundred parts of woollen cloth with eight parts of the murio-sulphuric solution of tin, for about ten minutes, when I added four parts of cochineal in powder, which by ten or fifteen minutes more of boiling, produced a fine crimson. This I divided into two equal parts, one of which I yellowed or made scarlet by boiling it for fifteen minutes with a tenth of its weight of tartar in clean water; and the other, by boiling it with a fortieth of its weight of quercitron bark, and the same weight of murio-sulphuric solution of tin; so that in this last case there was an addition of yellow colouring matter from the bark, whilst in the former no such addition took place, the yellow necessary for producing the scarlet having been wholly gained by a change and diminution of the cochineal crimson; and the two pieces being compared with each other, that which had been rendered scarlet by an addition of quercitron yellow, was, as might have been expected, several shades fuller than the other.\"\n\n\"4th, I dyed one hundred parts of woollen cloth scarlet, by boiling it first in water with eight parts of murio-sulphate of tin, and twelve parts of tartar, for ten minutes, and then adding five parts of cochineal, and continuing the boiling for fifteen minutes. This scarlet cloth I divided equally, and made one part crimson, by boiling it with a little ammoniac in clean water; after which I again rendered it scarlet, by boiling it in clean water, with a fortieth of its weight of quercitron bark, and the same weight of murio-sulphate of tin; and this last, being compared with the other half, to which no quercitron yellow had been applied, was found to possess much more colour, as might have been expected. A piece of the cloth, which had been dyed scarlet by cochineal and quercitron bark, as in the first experiment, being at the same time boiled in the same water with ammoniac, did not become crimson, like that dyed scarlet without the bark.\n\n205. \"In this way of compounding a scarlet from cochineal and quercitron bark, the dyer will at all times be able, with the utmost certainty, to produce every possible shade between the crimson and yellow colours, by only increasing or diminishing the proportion of bark. It has indeed been usual at times, when scarlets approaching nearly to the aurora colour were in fashion, to superadd a fugitive yellow either from turmeric, or from what is called young fullic (Rhus Corinna); but this was only when the cochineal colour had been previously yellowed as much as possible by the use of tartar, as in the common way of dyeing scarlet; and therefore that practice ought not to be confounded...\"\nOf Simple confounded with my improvement, which has for its object to preclude the loss of any part of the cochineal crimson, by its conversion towards yellow colour, which may be so much more cheaply obtained than the quercitron bark. By sufficient trials, I have satisfied myself that the cochineal colours, dyed with the muri-fulphuric solution of tin, are in every respect at least as durable as any which can be dyed with any other preparation of that metal; and they even seem to withstand the action of boiling soap fuds somewhat longer, and therefore I cannot avoid earnestly recommending its use for dyeing rofe and other cochineal colours, as well as for compounding a fleart with the quercitron bark.\"\n\n206. Dr Bancroft afterwards tried a great variety of earthy and metallic salts, as mordants, for the purpose of fixing the colour of cochineal on wool; and he found that, besides the metallic oxides and solutions, the aluminous, calcareous and siliceous earths, as well as magnesia and barytes, might be employed with different success in dyeing with the colouring matter of cochineal: but for the detail of these experiments which he has given, we refer our readers to the treatise itself.*\n\n207. To produce different shades of scarlet, and the other colours which are derived from it, all that is necessary, is to vary the proportions of cochineal, tartar, and solution of tin; and for the shades which incline most to yellow, the addition of quercitron bark, or fulvic, is requisite. The use of the tartar is to deepen the colour, and the solution of tin produces a shade of orange. When the shade of colour required to be communicated to the stuff is light, the time of conducting the process must be shortened†.\n\n208. Crimson.—The processes which are employed to dye wool a crimson colour, are two. The stuff is either dyed crimson at once, or the crimson shade is communicated to it, after being previously dyed of a fleart colour. To dye crimson by a single process, a solution of two ounces and a half of alum, and an ounce and a half of tartar for every pound of stuff, is employed for the boiling, and the stuff is afterwards to be dyed with an ounce of cochineal. It is usual also to employ solution of tin, but in smaller proportion than for dyeing fleart. The processes employed, it is scarcely necessary to observe, must vary, according as the shade wanted is deeper or lighter, or more or less distant from fleart. Common salt is also employed by some in the boiling. To render the crimson deeper, and to give it more bloom, archil and potash are frequently used; but this bloom, it ought to be observed, is extremely fugacious. By adding tartar and alum, the boiling for crimson is sometimes prepared after a fleart reddening, and it is said that the colour possesses more bloom, when both the boiling and reddening are made after fleart, than when the crimson is dyed in a fresh bath prepared on purpose. In dyeing these colours, the wild cochineal may be employed, but as it contains a smaller proportion of colouring matter, the quantity must be greater.\n\n209. Different substances, as the alkalies, alum, and earthy salts in general, convert the colour of fleart to crimson, which is the natural colour of cochineal. To effect this, the stuff previously dyed fleart is boiled for an hour in a solution of alum, the strength of which is to be regulated by the depth of shade required. In conducting this process, it is necessary to observe, that water impregnated with earthy salts has a considerable effect in varying the shade; so that the quantity of alum employed must be proportioned to the purity of the water. Hellot tried soap, soda, potash, and some other substances, and although they produced the crimson, yet it was of a deeper shade, and had less lustre, than what was produced by means of alum. Ammonia produced a good effect; but from its great volatility, a considerable proportion must be put into the bath, moderately heated, with a little sal ammoniac, and an equal quantity of potash. By this process the stuff became of a bright rosy colour, and thus rendered a smaller quantity of cochineal necessary. Poerner directs the stuff previously dyed fleart, to remain 24 hours in a cold solution of sal ammoniac and potash.\n\n210. To produce crimsons, as well as flearts, in half-grain, madder is to be substituted for half the crimson, quantity of the cochineal; or in other proportions, according to the shade desired. The same boiling is given as for fleart in grain, and the other parts of the process are to be conducted as for reddening the fleart or crimson. Even the common madder red affumes a greater degree of lustre, when the boiling is made after a reddening for fleart †.\n\n3. Of the Processes for dyeing Silk Red.\n\n211. Madder red.—The colour which is obtained from madder does not possess sufficient brightness for processes dyeing silk. We shall here, however, describe some of the processes which are employed for this purpose. That of De la Folie, is the following. Half a pound of alum is to be dissolved in each quart of hot water, and two ounces of potash are afterwards to be added. When the effervescence has ceased, and the liquor has become clear, the silk must be kept in it for two hours, after which it is to be washed, and put into the madder bath. The silk which is dyed in this way becomes more beautiful by means of the soap proof. The process of Scheffer is somewhat different. For each pound of scoured silk, he directs a solution of four ounces of alum, and five drams of chalk to be prepared. When the sediment has formed, the solution is to be decanted, and having become quite cold, the silk is immersed in it, and left for 18 hours. It is then taken out, and dried, and afterwards dyed with an equal weight of madder. The colour thus obtained is of a dark shade. Mr Guiche describes another process. For every pound of silk he proposes a bath of four ounces of alum and one ounce of solution of tin. When the liquor has become clear, it is decanted, and the silk carefully soaked in it for 12 hours, after which it is to be immersed in a bath with half a pound of madder softened by boiling, with an infusion of galls in white wine. The bath is to be kept moderately hot for an hour, and then made to boil for two minutes. The silk being taken from the bath, is to be washed in a stream of water, and dried in the sun. The colour thus obtained is very permanent. By leaving out the galls it is clearer. The brightness of the first colour may be considerably increased, by passing the stuff through a bath of brazilwood, to which one ounce of solution of tin is added.\nOf Simple In this way the colour becomes extremely beautiful and durable.\n\n212. Silk is sometimes dyed with brazil wood, and with Brazil the colour thus obtained has been distinguished by the name of false crimson, to distinguish it from the more durable colour which is produced by cochineal. The silk, after being boiled with soap, is to be alummed. It is then to be refreshed at the river, and dipped in a bath more or less charged with brazil juice, according to the depth of shade required. If pure water be employed, the colour will be too red for crimson; but to remedy this, the stuff may be passed through a weak alkaline solution, or a little alkali may be added to the bath, or the stuff may be washed in hard water till it has acquired the proper shade. To deepen the shade of false crimsons, or dark reds, the solution of logwood is added to the brazil bath, the silk being previously impregnated with the latter; or a little alkali may be added, according to the shade required.\n\n213. The crimson produced by cochineal is called grain crimson, to distinguish it from false crimson. The silk, being well cleaned from the soap at the river, is to be immersed in an alum liquor of the full strength, and to remain for a night. It is then to be washed, and twice beatled at the river. The bath is prepared by filling a long boiler two-thirds with water, to which are added, when it boils, from half an ounce to two ounces of powdered white galls for every pound of silk. When it has boiled for a few moments, from two to three ounces of cochineal also powdered and fitted, for every pound of silk, are put in, and afterwards one ounce of tartar to every pound of cochineal. When the tartar is dissolved, one ounce of solution of tin is added for every ounce of tartar. In the preparation of this solution of tin the following proportions are recommended by Macquer. For every pound of nitric acid two ounces of sal ammoniac, six ounces of fine grain tin, and twelve ounces of water are employed. When these ingredients are mixed together, the boiler is to be filled up with cold water, and the proportion of the bath for every pound of silk is about eight or ten quarts of water. In this the silk is immediately immersed, and turned on the winch, till it appear to be of a uniform colour. The fire is then increased, and the bath is kept boiling for two hours, taking care to turn the silk occasionally. The fire is afterwards put out, and the silk put into the bath, where it is allowed to remain for a few hours longer. It is then taken out, washed at the river, twice beatled, wrung, and dried. Two processes are recommended by Scheffer and Macquer. In that of the former, a greater proportion of cochineal is employed in the dye-bath; but, in that of the latter, a yellow ground is previously communicated to the silk. The colour which is thus obtained resists the action of soap, and is more durable than that which is produced by means of carthamus.\n\n214. To obtain other shades of red, the above processes must be varied. If, after the silk has been wrung out of the solution of tin, it is steeped for a night in a cold solution of alum, in the proportion of one ounce to a quart of water, wrung and dried, then washed and boiled with cochineal, it will only appear of a pale poppy-colour; but a fine poppy-red may be produced by steeping it twelve hours in the solution of tin, diluted with eight parts of water, then left all night in the solution of alum, washed, dried, and passed through two baths of cochineal, taking care to add to the second bath a small quantity of sulphuric acid. The same colour may be produced by dyeing the silk previously with annatto, and then passing it successively through a number of baths prepared with an alkaline solution of carthamus, to which lemon juice has been added, till it acquire a fine cherry-colour. To brighten the colour, the silk, after being dyed, may be immersed in hot water acidulated with lemon juice.\n\n215. Other shades of red, as a cherry-red, and flesh-cherry red, are also produced by means of carthamus. For a cherry-red, it is not necessary that the stuff be previously dyed with annatto, and the proportion of colouring matter is smaller. A flesh-red colour is obtained by adding a little soap to the bath, which has the effect of softening the colour, and of retarding the action of the colouring matter on the stuff. To produce dark shades, it is sometimes usual to mix archil, and by this means the expense is diminished.\n\n216. Those who have produced a colour on silk Scarlet, which comes nearest to scarlet, Berthollet observes, begin with dyeing the silk crimson. It is then dyed with carthamus, and lastly it is dyed yellow without heat. By this process a fine colour is obtained; but the dye of the carthamus is not permanent, as it is destroyed by the action of the air, and the colour becomes deeper. The following is Dr Bancroft's process. In a solution of muriatic acid of tin, diluted with five times its weight of water, the silk is to be soaked for two hours; and after being taken out, it is to be wrung and partially dried. It is then to be dyed in a bath prepared with four parts of cochineal, and three of quercitron bark. In this way a colour approaching to scarlet is obtained. To give the colour more body, the immersion may be repeated both in the solution of tin, and in the dyeing bath; and the brightness of the scarlet is increased by means of the addition of carthamus. A lively rose colour is produced by omitting the quercitron bark, and dyeing the silk with cochineal only; and by adding a large proportion of water to the cochineal, a yellow shade is obtained, which changes the cochineal to the compound fuscet colour.\n\n4. Of the Processes for dyeing Cotton and Linen Red.\n\n217. Madder is most commonly employed for dyeing cotton and linen a red colour; and indeed in this kind of dyeing it is the most useful of all colouring matters. The affinity of the colouring matter of madder for cotton is stronger than for linen; but it has been found that the processes which are most successful in dyeing the one are the most preferable for the other. There are two kinds of madder reds: the one is called simple madder red; and the other, which is much brighter, has been distinguished by the name of Turkey or Adrianople red, because it comes from the Levant, and has rarely been equalled in brightness and permanency. In communicating this beautiful red colour to cotton, by means of madder, a great many useless and ridiculous directions have been given. According to some processes, the period of a month is scarcely sufficient to finish all the operations which are considered as indispensably necessary for obtaining this dye.\n218. The principal mordants which are employed in dyeing cotton with madder, are oil, gall-nuts, and alum. The colouring matter of madder cannot be fixed on cotton till the latter has been impregnated with oil. A cold soapy liquor is formed by a combination of oil and a weak solution of soda. By the use of this alkaline ley the oil is diluted and divided, and can be easily and equally applied to all the parts of the cotton. According to Chaptal, potash produces the same effect as soda; and attention to this is of some importance, from the difference of price of the two substances. All kinds of soda or oil are not fit for this preliminary preparation. The soda must be in the caustic state, and its causticity must be the effect of calcination; because if it has been rendered caustic by means of lime, it becomes of a brown colour. The soda also should contain little muriate, for when this neutral salt prevails, the combination of the oil and the soda is greatly retarded. The most proper oil is not of a fine kind, but that which contains a large portion of the extractive principle. As the ley of soda is only employed for the purpose of diluting and conveying the oil equally to all the parts of the cotton, there must be a perfect combination of the oil and the soda. Indeed this is of so much importance, that many place the whole secret of a strong colour in the choice of good oil and soda. From this it follows, that the oil should be in excess, otherwise it would abandon the stuff in washing, and the colour would remain dry.\n\n219. The cotton, being impregnated with oil, is subjected to the operation of galling. The use of gall-nuts is attended with several advantages. 1. The gallic acid which they contain decomposes the saponaceous liquor with which the cotton is impregnated, and fixes the oil on the stuff. 2. The other properties which the galls possess, predispose the cotton to receive the colouring matter. 3. The astringent principle unites with the oil, and forms with it a compound, which on drying becomes black, is not very soluble in water, and has a strong affinity with the colouring matter of madder.\n\n220. From these principles some practical observations may be deduced. 1. Gall nuts furnish the most proper astringent matter for this kind of dye. 2. To effect a speedy and perfect decomposition, the galls ought to be strained as hot as possible. 3. The galled cotton should be speedily dried, for otherwise it might assume a black colour, which would injure the brightness of the red. 4. The process of galling should be performed in dry weather, because when the weather is moist, the astringent principle produces a black colour, and dries slowly. 5. The cotton should be pressed together with great care, that the decomposition may be equally effected at every point of the surface. 6. It is necessary to attend to the proportion between the gall nuts and the soap, for if the former predominate, the colour is black, and if the soap is in excess, the portion of oil uncombined with the astringent principle escapes in the washings, and impoverishes the colour.\n\n221. Alum is also employed as a mordant in dyeing cotton red. This substance not only heightens the red of madder, but contributes also, by its decomposition, and the fixation of its alumina, to give solidity to the colour. When cotton, after it has been galled, is immersed in a solution of alum, it immediately changes its colour, and becomes gray. No precipitate appears in the bath, because the operation takes place in the tissue of the cloth itself. But if the solution of alum be employed at too high a temperature, part of the galls escape from the stuff, and the decomposition of the alum is then effected in the bath. This, which should be guarded against, must obviously diminish the proportion of the mordant, and render the colour poorer.\n\n222. This mordant, which is the most complicated known in dyeing, requires great attention in its application. In this, indeed, consists the whole difficulty of dyeing cotton a madder or Turkey red. In this mordant there is a combination of three principles, oil, the astringent principle, and alumina; and on their proper combination, the perfection of the colour depends. When any one of them is employed separately, the colour is neither so bright, nor so completely fixed.\n\n223. After these preliminary observations, we shall now give a fuller detail of some of the processes which are followed in dyeing cotton Turkey red. The following is that which is practised at Astracan, of which dyeing red an account has been given by Professor Pallas.\n\n\"The cotton to be dyed red is first washed exceedingly clean in running water, and, when the weather is clear, hung up on poles to dry. If it does not dry before the evening, it is taken into the house, on account of the saline dews so remarkable in the country around Astracan, and again exposed to the air next morning. When it is thoroughly dry it is laid in a tub, and fish-oil is poured over it till it is entirely covered. In this state it must stand all night, but in the morning it is hung up on poles, and left there the whole day; and this process is repeated for a week, so that the cotton lies seven nights in oil, and is exposed seven days to the atmosphere, that it may imbibe the oil and free itself from all air. The yarn is then again carried to a stream, cleaned as much as possible, and hung up on poles to dry.\n\n224. \"After this preparation a mordant is made of the three materials, which must give the grounds of the red colour. The pulverized leaves of the sumach are first boiled in copper kettles; and when their colouring matter has been sufficiently extracted, some powdered galls are added, with which the liquor must be again boiled; and by these means it acquires a dark dirty colour. After it has been sufficiently boiled the fire is taken from under the kettle, and alum put into the liquor yet hot, where it is soon dissolved. The proportion of these three ingredients I cannot determine with sufficient accuracy, because the dyers make use of different quantities at pleasure. The powder of the sumach leaves is measured into the kettle with ladles; the water is poured in according to a gauge, on which marks are made to show how high the water must stand in the kettle to soak six, eight, ten, &c., puds of cotton yarn. The galls and alum are added in the quantity of five pounds to each pud of cotton. In a word, the whole mordant must be sufficiently yellow, strong, and of an astringent taste.\n\n225. \"As soon as the alum is dissolved, no time must be lost in order that the mordant may not be suffered...\"\nOf Simple colours.\n\nThe yarn is then put into hollow blocks of wood shaped like a mortar, into each of which such a quantity of the mordant has been poured as may be sufficient to moisten the yarn without any of it being left. As soon as the workman throws the mordant into the mortar, he puts a quantity of the yarn into it, and presses it down with his hand till it becomes uniformly moistened, and the whole cotton yarn has struck. By this it acquires only a pale yellow colour, which however is durable. It is then hung up on poles in the sun to dry, again washed in the stream, and afterwards dried once more.\n\n226. \"By the yellow dye of the sumach leaves, the madder dye becomes brighter and more agreeable; but the galls damp the superfluous yellow, and together with the alum prepare the yarn for its colour. Some dyers however omit the use of these leaves altogether, and prepare their mordant from galls and alum only, by first boiling the galls in due proportion with the requisite quantity of water, then dissolving the alum with boiling water in a separate vessel, afterwards pouring both liquors together into a tub, and suffering the cotton to remain in them an hour, or an hour and a half; after which it is dried gradually, then washed, and again dried once more. By this process the yarn acquires a dirty reddish colour.\n\n227. \"The next part of the process is to prepare the madder dye. The madder, ground to a fine powder, is spread out in large troughs, and into each trough is poured a large cup full of sheep's blood, which is the kind that can be procured with the greatest facility by the dyers. The madder must be strongly mixed in it by means of the hand, and then stand some hours in order to be thoroughly soaked by it. The liquor then assumes a dark red appearance, and the madder in boiling yields more dye.\n\n228. \"After this process water is made hot in large kettles, fixed in brick-work; and as soon as it is warm the prepared red dye is put into it, in the proportion of a pound to every pound of cotton. The dye is then suffered to boil strongly; and when it is boiled enough, which may be tried on cotton threads, the fire is removed from under the kettle, and the prepared cotton is deposited near it. The dyer places himself on the edge of the brick-work that encloses the kettle, dips the cotton yarn, piece by piece, into the dye; turns it round, backwards and forwards; presses it a little with his hands; and lays each piece, one after the other, in pails standing ready for the purpose. As soon as all the cotton has received the first tint, it is hung up to dry; as the red, however, is still too dull, the yarn which has been already dyed once, and become dry, is put once more into the dyeing-kettle, and must be left there to settle for three hours over a strong fire, by which it acquires that beautiful dark red colour which is so much esteemed in the Turkey yarn. The yarn is now taken from the dye with sticks; the superfluous dye which adheres to it is shaken off; the hanks are put in order, and hung up, one after another, to dry. When it is thoroughly dry, it is washed in the pure stream and again dried. The only fault of the Altra-\n\ncan dyers is, that the colour is sometimes brighter and sometimes darker, probably because they do not pay sufficient attention to the proportions, or because the madder is not always of the same goodness.\n\n229. \"In the last place, the above-mentioned soda Boiling in (kalakar) is dissolved with boiling water in tubs destined for that purpose, and it is usual here to allow twenty pounds of soda to forty pounds of cotton, or half the weight. Large earthen jars, which are made in Perlia of very strong clay, a yard and a half in height, almost five spans wide in the belly, and ending in a neck a span and a half in diameter, enclosed by means of cement in brick-work over a fire-place, in such a manner that the necks only appear, are filled with the dyed cotton yarn. The ley of dissolved soda, which is blackish and very sharp, is then poured over it till the jars be filled; and some clean rags are pressed into their mouths, that the uppermost skeins of yarn may not lie uncovered. A fire is then made in the fire-place below, and continued for 24 hours; and in the meantime the steam which arises from the jars is seen collected among the rags in red drops. By this boiling the dye is still more heightened, and is made to strike completely; every thing superfluous is removed, and all the fat matter which still adheres to the yarn is washed out; nothing more is then necessary for completing the dye of the yarn but to rinse it well several times in running water, and then to dry it.\n\n230. \"That the dye of madder might be made very penetrating by other methods, and through the means of other oily and resinous substances, is shewn by the other processes of the Tungufians to dye horse, goat's and reindeer's hair, which they use for ornamenting their dresses, of a beautiful red colour, with the roots of the crocus-wort, or northern madder (galium), and narrow-leaved woodroot (aperula tinctoria), which have a resemblance to those of madder. They boil the fresh or dried roots with about the same quantity of agaric (agaricus officinarum), which, as is well known, is abundant in resinous gummy particles, and is used by the people of Jakut instead of soap; they then lay in it the white hair which they wish to dye, and suffer it to settle slowly until it be sufficiently red. Cotton cloth is dyed with madder at Afracan in the same manner; but many pursue a fraudulent process, by dyeing with red wood, and then sell their cloth as that which has been dyed in the proper manner.\"\n\n231. The processes which are employed in the Greek manufactories for dyeing Turkey red, as they have been described by C. Felix, in a memoir in the French annals of chemistry, are somewhat different from the above. \"In these manufactories,\" he observes, \"the workmen dye at one time a mass of skeins weighing thirty-five ounces (k); each ounce being equal to about fifty ounces. The first process is that of cleaning the cotton, for which purpose three leys are employed; one of soda, another of ashes, and a third of lime. The cotton is thrown into a tub, and moistened with the liquor of the three leys in equal quantities; it is then boiled in pure water, and washed in running water.\n\n(k) Equal to 109lb. 6oz.\n232. \"The second bath given to the cotton is composed of soda and sheep's dung dissolved in water. To facilitate the solution, the soda and dung are pounded in a mortar. The proportions of these ingredients employed, are, one occa of dung, five of soda, and forty of water. When the ingredients are well mixed, the liquor expressed from them is strained, and being poured into a tub, six occas of olive oil are added to it, and the whole is well stirred till it becomes of a whitish colour, like milk. The cotton is then beprinkled with this water, and when the skins are thoroughly moistened, they are wrung, pressed, and exposed to dry. The same bath must be repeated three or four times, because it is this liquor which renders the cotton more or less fit for receiving the dye. Each bath is given with the same liquor, and ought to continue five or six hours. It is to be observed that the cotton, after each bath, must be dried without being washed, as it ought not to be rinsed till after the last bath. The cotton is then as white as if it had been bleached in the fields.\n\n233. \"The bath of sheep's dung is not used in our manufactories (1); it is a practice peculiar to the Levant. It may be believed that the dung is of no utility for fixing the colours; but it is known that this substance contains a great quantity of volatile alkali, in a disengaged state, which has the property of giving a rosy hue to the red. It is therefore probable that it is to this ingredient that the red dyes of the Levant are indebted for their splendour and vivacity. This much, at any rate, is certain, that the Morocco leather of the Levant is prepared with dog's dung; because it has been found that this dung is proper for heightening the colour of the black. The bath of dung is followed by the process of galling.\n\n234. \"The galling is performed by immersing the cotton in a bath of warm water, in which five occas of pulverised gall-nuts have been boiled. This operation renders the cotton more fit for being saturated with the colour, and gives to the dye more body and strength. After the galling comes aluming, which is performed twice, with an interval of two days, and which consists in dipping the cotton into a bath of water in which five occas of alum have been infused, mixed with five occas of water alkalized by a ley of soda. The aluming must be performed with care, as it is this operation which makes the colouring particles combine best with the cotton, and which secures them in part from the destructive action of the air. When the second aluming is finished, the cotton is wrung; it is then pressed, and put to soak in running water, after being inclosed in a bag of thin cloth.\n\n235. \"The workmen then proceed to the dyeing.—To compose the colours they put in a kettle five occas of water and thirty-five occas of a root which the Greeks call alizarin, or painting colour, and which in Europe is known under the name of madder. The madder, after being pulverized, is moistened with one occa of ox or sheep's blood. The blood strengthens the colour, and the dose is increased or lessened according to the shade of colour required. An equal heat is maintained below the kettle, but not too violent; and when the liquor ferments, and begins to grow warm, the skins are then gradually immersed, before the liquor becomes too hot. They are then tied with pack-thread to small rods, placed crosswise above the kettle for that purpose, and when the liquor boils well, and in an uniform manner, the rods from which the skins were suspended are removed, and the cotton is suffered to fall into the kettle, where it must remain till two-thirds of the water is evaporated. When one-third only of the liquor remains, the cotton is taken out and washed in pure water.\n\n236. \"The dye is afterwards brought to perfection by means of a bath alkalized with soda. This manipulation is the most difficult and the most delicate of the whole, because it is that which gives the colour its tone. The cotton is thrown into this new bath, and made to boil over a steady fire till the colour attains the required tint. The whole art consists in catching the proper degree: a careful workman, therefore, must watch with the utmost attention for the moment when it is necessary to take out the cotton, and he will rather burn his hand than miss that opportunity. It appears that this bath, which the Greeks think of so much importance, might be supplied by a ley of soap; and it is probable that saponaceous water would give the colour more brightness and purity.\n\n237. \"When the colour is too weak, the Levantines know how to strengthen it by increasing the dose of improving the colouring substances; and when they wish to give the colour it brightness and splendour, they employ different roots of the country, and, in particular, one named saffron; specimens of which I have sent to France. The alizarin, which is the principal colouring matter employed in the Greek dye-houses, is collected in Natolia, and is brought to Greece from Smyrna: some of it comes also from Cyprus and Mesopotamia. The superiority of this Levantine plant to the European madder is acknowledged by all those acquainted with the art of dyeing, and may arise from two causes; the manner in which it is cultivated, and the method employed for its decalcification (m)\".\n\n(1) The French manufactories.\n\n(m) \"The chief manufactories,\" continues our author, \"for dyeing spun cotton red, established in Greece, are in Thessaly. There are some at Baba, Raptani, Tournavos, Larilla, Pharafia, and in all the villages situated on the sides of Ossa and Pelion. These two mountains may be considered as the alembics that distil the eternal vapours with which Olympus is crowned, and which distribute them throughout the beautiful valleys situated around them. Of these valleys, that of Tempe has at all times been distinguished by the beauty of its shady groves and of its streams. These streams, on account of their limpidness, are very proper for dyeing, and supply water to a great number of manufactories, the most celebrated of which are those of Ambelakia.\n\n\"Ambelakia, on account of the activity which prevails in it, has a greater resemblance to a town of Holland than a village of Turkey. This village, by its industry, communicates life and activity to all the neighbouring country, and gives birth to an immense trade, which connects Germany with Greece in a thousand ways. Its population...\"\n239. To these processes we shall add the account of another, which was long successfully practised at Glasgow by Mr Papillon, a native of France, and was communicated by him, for a suitable premium, to the commissioners and trustees for manufactures in Scotland, to be by them published for the benefit of the public, at the end of a certain term of years. This transaction took place in 1790, and the period having expired, the trustees announced it to the public in 1803. The process, which consists of nine different steps, is the following.\n\n**Step I.**\n\nFor 100 lb. cotton you must have\n- 100 lb. of Alicante barilla,\n- 20 lb. of pearl ashes,\n- 100 lb. quicklime.\n\nThe barilla is mixed with soft water in a deep tub, which has a small hole near the bottom of it, stopped at first with a peg.—This hole is covered in the inside with a cloth supported by two bricks, that the ashes may be prevented from running out at it, or stopping it up while the ley filters through it.\n\nUnder this tub is another to receive the ley; and pure water is repeatedly passed through the first tub to form lees of different strength, which are kept separate at first until their strength is examined. The strongest required for use must swim or float an egg, and is called the ley of six degrees of the French Hydrometer, or Pelliculeur. The weaker are afterwards brought to this strength, by passing them through fresh barilla. But a certain quantity of the weak, which is of 2 degrees of the above hydrometer, is reserved for dissolving the oil, and gum, and the salt, which are used in subsequent parts of the process. This ley of 2 degrees is called the weak barilla liquor, the other is called the strong.\n\nDissolve the pearl-ashes in 10 pails, of 4 gallons each, of soft water, and the lime in 14 pails.\n\nLet all the liquors stand till they become quite clear, and then mix 10 pails of each.\n\nBoil the cotton in the mixture five hours, then wash it in running water and dry it.\n\n**Step II. Bainlie, or Gray Steep.**\n\nTake a sufficient quantity (20 pails) of the strong barilla water in a tub, and dissolve or dilute in t 2 pails of oil of vitriol, and 1 lb. of gum arabic, and 1 lb. of sal ammoniac, both previously dissolved in a sufficient quantity of the weak barilla water, and lastly, 25 lb. of olive oil, which has been previously dissolved or well mixed with 2 pails of the weak barilla water.\n\nThe materials of this steep being well mixed, tramp or tread down the cotton into it, until it is well soaked; let it steep 24 hours, and then wring it hard and dry it.\n\nSteep it again 24 hours, and again wring and dry it.\n\nSteep it a third time 24 hours, after which wring and dry it, and lastly wash it well and dry it.\n\n**Step III. The White Steep.**\n\nThis part of the process is precisely the same with the last, in every particular, except that the sheep's dung is omitted in the composition of the steep.\n\n**Step IV. Gall Steep.**\n\nBoil 25 lb. of galls bruised in 10 pails of river water, until 4 or 5 are boiled away; strain the liquor into a tub, and pour cold water on the galls in the strainer, to wash out of them all their tincture.\n\nAs soon as the liquor is become milk warm, dip your cotton hank by hank, handling it carefully all the time, and let it steep 24 hours.\n\nThen wring it carefully and equally, and dry it well without washing.\n\n**Step V. First Alum Steep.**\n\nDissolve 25 lb. of Roman alum in 14 pails of warm water, without making it boil, skim the liquor well, and add 2 pails of strong barilla water, and then let it cool until it be lukewarm.\n\nDip your cotton and handle it hank by hank, and let it steep 24 hours, and wring it equally and dry it well without washing.\n\n**Step VI. Second Alum Steep.**\n\nIs performed in every particular like the last, but after the cotton is dry, you steep it 6 hours in the river, and wash and dry it.\n\n---\n\npopulation, which has been tripled within these fifteen years, amounts at present to 4000, and all these people exist by dyeing. None of those vices or cares produced by idleness are known here. The hearts of the inhabitants are pure, and their countenances unclouded. Servitude, which degrades the countries watered by the Peneus, has not yet ascended to these hills; no Turk can reside or live among these people; and they govern themselves, like their ancestors, by their protogoras and their own magistrates. Twice have the savage mufhumans of Larissa, envious of their ease and happiness, attempted to scale their mountains in order to plunder their houses; and twice have they been repulsed by hands which suddenly quitted the shuttle to affume the musket.\n\n\"All hands, and even those of the children, are employed in the dye-houses of Ambelakia; and while the men dye the cotton, the women are spinning and preparing it. The use of wheels is not known in this part of Greece; all the cotton is spun on a distaff: the thread, indeed, is certainly not so round or equal, but it is softer, more silky, and more tenacious; it is less apt to break, and lasts longer; it is also more easily whitened, and more proper for being dyed. It is a pleasing spectacle to see the women of Ambelakia, each spinning from a distaff, and sitting conversing together on the threshold of their doors; but as soon as a stranger appears, they instantly retire and conceal themselves in their houses, manifesting, like Galatea, in their precipitate retreat, a desire of flying and of shewing themselves:\n\n*Et fugit ad salices, et se cupit ante videre.*\n**STEP VII. Dyeing Step.**\n\nThe cotton is dyed by about 10 lb. at once, for which take 2½ gallons of ox blood, and mix it in the copper with 28 pails of milk warm water, and stir it well; then add 25 lb. of madder, and stir all well together. Then having beforehand put the 17 lb. of cotton on sticks, dip it into the liquor, and move and turn it constantly one hour, during which you gradually increase the heat, until the liquor begin to boil at the end of the hour. Then sink the cotton, and boil it gently one hour longer; and, lastly, wash it and dry it.\n\nTake out so much of the boiling liquor, that what remains may produce a milk-warm heat with the fresh water with which the copper is again filled up, and then proceed to make up a dyeing liquor as above, for the next 10 lb. of cotton.\n\n**STEP VIII. The Fixing Step.**\n\nMix equal parts of the gray steep liquor, and of the white steep liquor, taking 5 or 6 pails of each. Tread down the cotton into this mixture, and let it steep six hours, then wring it moderately and equally, and dry it without washing.\n\n**STEP IX. Brightening Step.**\n\nTen lb. of white soap must be dissolved most carefully and completely in 16 or 18 pails of warm water; if any little bits of the soap remain undissolved, they will make spots in the cotton. Add four pails of strong barilla water, and stir it well. Sink your cotton in this liquor, keeping it down with crofs sticks, and cover it up and boil it gently two hours, then wash and dry it, and it is finished.\n\n**VESSELS.**\n\nThe number of vessels necessary for this business is greater in proportion to the extent of the manufactory; but, in the smallest work, it is necessary to have four coppers of a round form.\n\n1/4. The largest, for boiling and for finishing, is 28 inches deep by 38 or 39 wide in the mouth, and 18 inches wider in the widest part.\n\n2/4. The second, for dyeing, is 28 deep, by 23 or 24 in the mouth.\n\n3/4. The third, for the alum steep, is like the second.\n\n4/4. The fourth, for boiling the galls, is 20 deep, by 28 wide.\n\nA number of tubs or larger wooden vessels are necessary, which must all be of fir, and hooped with wood or with copper.\n\nIron must not be employed in their construction, not even a nail; but where nails are necessary, they must be of copper.\n\nBy the pail is always understood a wooden vessel, which holds four English gallons, and is hooped with copper.\n\nIn some parts of the above process, the strength of the barilla liquor or liquors is determined, by telling to what degree a pelliclequeur or hydrometer sunk in them.\n\nThe pelliclequeur is of French construction. It is similar to the glass hydrometer used by the spirit dealers in this country; and any artist who makes these instruments, will find no difficulty in constructing one with a scale similar to that employed by M. Papillon, when he is informed of the following circumstances:\n\n1/4. The instrument, when plunged in good soft water, such as Edinburgh pipe water, at temperature 60 degrees sinks to the 0, or beginning of the scale, which stands near the top of the stem.\n\n2/4. When it is immersed in a saturated solution of common salt, at the same temperature of 60 degrees it sinks to the 26th degree of the scale only, and this falls at some distance from the top of the ball.\n\nThis saturated solution is made by boiling in pure water, refined sea or common salt, till no more is dissolved, and by filtering the liquor when cold through blotting paper.\n\nIt should also be observed, that whenever directions are given to dry yarn, to prepare it for a succeeding operation, that this drying should be performed with particular care, and more perfectly than our dryest weather is in general able to effect. It is done therefore in a room heated by a stove to a great degree.\n\n230. There is still another process, which is recommended by Hauffmann, this process, (says he) obtains a beautiful and durable red. He makes a caustic ley of one part of common potash dissolved in four of boiling water, and a half part of quicklime, which is afterwards flaked in it. He then dissolved one part of powdered alum in two of boiling water, and to this solution while it was yet warm, he added that of the caustic ley. The solution of alumina being left at rest, formed, on cooling, a precipitate of sulphate of potash. A 33rd part of linseed oil was then mixed with the alkaline solution of alumina, which then formed a milky saponaceous liquid. When the mixture is to be used, it ought to be well shaken, because the oil separates. The fluffs of cotton or linen must be successively immersed in it, and equally pressed, and must be dried under shelter from rain in summer, and in a warm place in winter; and being left in that state for 24 hours, are then washed in pure running water, and again dried. The same process in the immersion in alkaline ley is again to be repeated, taking care to introduce first those fluffs which were laid in the first solution. The whole of the mixture should be consumed each time, as it would attract carbonic acid from the air, and suffer the alumina to be precipitated.\n\n240. Two immersions in the alkaline solution of alumina mixed with linseed oil, afford a beautiful red; but by impregnating the fluffs a third, or even a fourth time, in the same manner, the most brilliant colours are obtained. The intensity of the colour is in proportion to the quantity of madder. A quantity of madder equal in weight to the fluffs, will yield a red, which, by clearing becomes of a rosy shade; and shades of crimson of different degrees of brightness are obtained, by using two, three, or four times the weight of madder; but unless the water employed in the processes contains some portion of lime, the addition of the chalk should never be omitted.\n\n241. The scarlet colour communicated to cotton by scarlet means of cochineal, is far from being permanent; but with cochineal, if this colour is wished to be communicated to cotton, Dr Bancroft recommends to steep the cotton, previously moistened, for half an hour in a diluted solution of...\nDYEING.\n\nOf Simple Colours.\n\n242. With the aluminous mordant, as it is usually applied by calico printers for madder reds, cotton dyed with cochineal receives a beautiful crimson colour, which will bear several washings, and resist the weather for some time. It is not, however, to be considered as a fixed colour. Dr Bancroft is of opinion, that the addition of a small portion of cochineal in dyeing madder reds upon the finer cottons, would be highly advantageous to the calico printers. By this addition the madder reds are rendered more beautiful, and the fawn colour, or brownish yellow hue, which injures these reds, would be thus overcome.\n\nSect. II. Of Yellow.\n\n243. In dyeing yellow, it is necessary to employ mordants, because the affinity of yellow colouring matters for either animal or vegetable stuffs is not sufficiently strong to produce durable colours. Yellow colours, therefore, belong to that class which Dr Bancroft has denominated adjective colours. As in the former section, we shall first give a short description of the nature and properties of the substances employed in dyeing yellow, and then point out the most approved modes of communicating their colours to woollen, silk, cotton, and linen stuffs.\n\nThe substances capable of giving a yellow colour to different stuffs are very numerous; they do not all produce similar quantities of colouring matter; their dye is not equally free; the colours they impart incline more or less to orange or green; they possess various degrees of brightness and permanency, and differ considerably in price; circumstances by which the choice of the dyer ought always to be regulated. But those commonly employed in dyeing yellow, are weld, fustic, anotta, and quercitron bark.\n\nI. Of the Substances employed in dyeing Yellow.\n\n244. Weld (refedla luteola, Lin.) is a plant which grows wild in Britain, and in different European countries. Its leaves are long, narrow, and of a bright green, but the whole plant is made use of in the dyeing of yellow. There are two kinds of weld, cultivated and wild, the former of which is deemed more valuable than the latter, as it yields a much greater proportion of colouring matter. When this plant is fully ripe, it is pulled, dried, and bound up in bundles for the use of the dyer. The wild species grows higher and has a stronger stalk than that which is cultivated, by which the one may be readily distinguished from the other.\n\nProperties. 245. A strong decoction of weld is of a brownish yellow colour, and if very much diluted with water, the colour inclines to a green. An alkali gives to this decoction a deeper colour, and the precipitate it occasions is not soluble in alkalies. Most of the acids give it a paler tinge, occasioning a little precipitate which is soluble in alkalies. Alumina has so strong an affinity for the colouring matter of weld, that it can even abstract it from sulphuric acid, and the oxide of tin produces a similar effect. The greater part of metallic salts throw down similar precipitates, which vary in their shades of colour according to the metal employed. A solution of common salt renders the liquor turbid, and a solution of tin yields a copious yellow precipitate, while the liquor long continues turbid, and slightly coloured.\n\n246. Fustic (morus tinctoria, Lin.) is procured from Fustic, a tree of considerable magnitude, which grows in the West Indies. The wood is yellow, as its name imports, with orange veins. Ever since the discovery of America it has been used in dyeing, as appears from a paper in the Transactions of the Royal Society, of which Sir William Petty was the author. Its price is moderate, the colour it imparts is permanent, and it readily combines with indigo, which properties give it a claim to attention as a valuable ingredient in dyeing. Before it can be employed as a dye-stuff, it must be cut into chips and put in a bag, that it may not fix in, and tear the stuff, to which it is to impart its colouring matter.\n\n247. When a decoction of yellow wood or fustic is Properties. made very strong, the colour is of a reddish yellow, and when diluted it is of an orange yellow, which it readily yields to water. It becomes turbid by means of acids, its colour is of a pale yellow, and the greenish precipitate may be re-dissolved by alkalies. The sulphates of zinc, iron, and copper, as well as alum, throw down precipitates composed of the colouring matter and the different bases of the salts employed.\n\nIn examining the causes of the fixity of yellow colours, obtained from vegetables, Chaptal discovered that the durability of the pale yellow depended on the tanning principle, which is found united with the yellow colouring matter. He obtained by analyzing fustic, 1. A resinous or gummy matter, which can communicate a beautiful yellow colour. 2. An extractive matter, which is also yellow, and affords a beautiful colour. 3. A tanning principle of a pale yellow colour, which becomes black by boiling, or exposure to the air. This latter diminishes the brilliancy of the two former; but it may be separated by a simple process. Chaptal boiled with the wood some animal substance containing gelatinous matter, such as bits of skin, strong glue, &c. The tanning principle was thus precipitated with the gelatinous matter, and the bath held in solution only the colouring matters which yield a bright, full yellow; and by means of this process he procured colours from several vegetables, equally bright with those which are communicated by yellow wood and quercitron bark.\n\n248. Anotta is a species of paste of a red colour, obtained from the berries of the bixa orellana Lin. Ancati, which is a native of America. The anotta of commerce is imported from America to Europe in cakes of two or three lib. weight, where it is prepared from the seeds of the tree mentioned above; but the Americans are said to be in possession of a species of anotta superior to that which they export, both for the brilliancy and\nDYEING.\n\nOf Simple and permanency of the colour it imparts. They bruise the seeds with their hands moistened with oil, separating with a knife the paste as it is formed, and drying it in the sun; but the seeds are pounded with water when defined for sale, and allowed to undergo the process of fermentation.\n\nProperties. Anota yields its colouring matter more readily to alcohol than to water, on which account it is used in yellow varnishes to which an orange tinge is intended to be given. Acids form a precipitate with a decoction of anota of an orange colour, which is soluble in alkalies; but solutions of common salt produce no sensible change. It yields an orange precipitate with a solution of alum, and the sulphates of copper and iron produce effects of nearly a similar nature. With a solution of tin the precipitate is of a lemon colour, and slowly depoited.\n\nQuercitron bark.\n\nPhil. of Perm. Gel. 319.\n\nThe bark of it yields a considerable quantity of colouring matter, which was first discovered by Dr Bancroft in the year 1784, in whom the use and application of it in dyeing were exclusively vested for a certain term of years by virtue of an act of parliament. To prepare it for use, the epidermis is taken off and pounded in a mill, the result of which process is a number of filaments and a fine light powder; but as these do not contain equal quantities of colouring matter, it will be proper to employ them in their natural proportions.\n\nProperties. Quercitron bark readily imparts its colouring matter to water at 100° of Fahrenheit, which is of a yellowish brown, capable of being darkened by alkalies, and brightened by acids. With muriate of tin the precipitate is copious, and of a yellow colour; with sulphate of tin it is a dark olive; and with sulphate of copper it is yellow, but inclining to an olive. Nitro-muriate of tin yields a yellow extremely beautiful, probably owing to the oxide of tin combining with the colouring matter in a greater proportion than some other salts.\n\nOther substances. Besides the substances already mentioned as employed in the dyeing of yellow, we may add saw-wort to the number (Jerratula tinctoria, Linn.) a plant which yields a colouring matter nearly similar to that of weld, and may of consequence be used as a proper substitute. Dyers broom (Genista tinctoria) produces a yellow of very indifferent nature, and is therefore only employed in dyeing stuffs of the coarsest kind. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is a native production both of the East and West Indies, and yields a more copious quantity of colouring matter than any other yellow dye-stuff; but it will probably never be of any essential service in dyeing yellow, as no mordant has yet been discovered, capable of giving permanency to its colour.\n\nChamomile (Anthemis tinctoria) yields a faint yellow colour, the hue of which is not unpleasing, but is far from being durable, and even mordants are not capable of fixing it. Sulphate of lime, tartar and alum, bid fairest for success.\n\nFenugreek (Trigonella fenugraenum) yields seeds which, when ground, communicate to stuffs a pale yellow of tolerable durability; and the best mordants are found to be alum and muriate of soda, or common salt. American hickory (Juglans alba) is a tree, the bark of which yields a colouring matter in every respect resembling that of the quercus nigra, but in quantity greatly inferior. French berries (Rhamnus infectarius) produce a tolerable yellow colour, but it is by no means permanent. When used in the process of dyeing, they are to be employed in the same manner as weld. According to Scheffer, a fine yellow colour may be imparted to silk, thread and wool, by means of the leaves of the willow; but Bergman informs us that only the leaves of the sweet willow (Salix pentandra) are proper for producing a permanent colour, as a few weeks exposure to the sun extracts that which is produced by the colouring matter from the leaves of the common willow.\n\nIn Switzerland and in England, the seeds of purple trefoil are sometimes employed in the art of dyeing, on which Vogler made a number of experiments, in order to ascertain what colours they would produce; and he found that a fine deep yellow was afforded by a bath made of a solution of these seeds with potash; that sulphuric acid yielded a light yellow, and sulphate of copper or blue vitriol, a yellow inclining to green. M. Dize informs us, that the seeds of trefoil impart to wool a beautiful orange, and to silk a greenish yellow; and that while alumining is necessary in the process of dyeing with the seeds of trefoil, a solution of tin cannot be employed.\n\nII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Wool Yellow.\n\nIn dyeing woollen stuffs with weld, the mordants employed are alum and tartar, and by their means a pure, permanent yellow is obtained. The boiling is to be conducted in the usual way; and according to Hellot, four ounces of alum to one ounce of tartar are to be employed. Other dyers, however, employ half as much tartar as alum. The colour is rendered paler, but more lively, by means of the tartar.\n\nThe bath is prepared by boiling the plant inclosed in a thin linen bag, and keeping it from rising of the bath by means of a wooden crofs. Some boil it till it sinks to the bottom of the vessel, while others, after it is boiled, take it out, and throw it away. From three to four lbs. of weld, and sometimes less, are allowed for every lb. of stuff; but the quantity must be regulated by the intensity of the shade desired. Some dyers add a small quantity of quicklime and ashes, which are found to promote the extraction of the colouring matter. These substances at the same time heighten the colour, but render it less susceptible of resisting the action of acids.\n\nWith other additions, and different management, different shades may be obtained. Thus, lighter shades are produced by dyeing after deeper ones, adding water at each dipping, and keeping the bath at the boiling temperature. These shades, however, are less lively than when fresh baths are employed, with a suitable proportion of weld. The addition of common salt or sulphate of lime to the weld bath communicates a richer and deeper colour. With alum it is paler and more lively, with tartar still paler, and with sulphate of iron the shade inclines to brown. According to Scheffer, by boiling the stuff two hours, with one-fourth of its weight of a solution of tin, and the same proportion of tartar, and then washing and boiling it with an equal weight of weld, a fine yellow is produced; but if the stuff...\nstuff be in the state of cloth, its internal texture is not penetrated. Poerner recommends a similar preparation as for dyeing fustic, and by these means the colour is brighter, more permanent, and lighter.\n\n257. Dr Bancroft recommends the quercitron bark as one of the cheapest and best substances for dyeing wool yellow. The following is the simple process which he has proposed for its application. The bark is to be boiled up with about its weight, or one-third more, of alum, in a suitable proportion of water, for about 10 minutes. The stuff previously scoured is then to be immersed in the bath, taking care to give the higher colours first, and afterwards the paler straw colours. By this cheap and expeditious process, colours which are not wanted to be of a full or bright yellow, may be obtained. The colour may be considerably heightened by passing the unrefined stuff a few times through hot water, to which a little clean powdered chalk, in the proportion of about 1/4 lb. for each 100 lbs. of stuff has been previously added. The bark, when used in dyeing, being first reduced to powder, should be tied up in a thin linen bag, and suspended in the liquor, so that it may be occasionally moved through it, to diffuse the colouring matter more equally.\n\n258. But although the above method possesses the advantages of cheapness and expedition, and is fully sufficient for communicating pale yellows; to obtain fuller and more permanent colours, the common mode of preparation, by previously applying the alumino-mordant, ought to be preferred. The stuff, therefore, should be boiled for about one hour or one hour and a quarter, with one-sixth, or one-eighth of its weight of alum, dissolved in a proper proportion of water. The stuff is then to be immersed without being rinsed, into the dyeing bath, with clean hot water, and about the same quantity of powdered bark tied up in a bag, as that of the alum employed in the preparation. The stuff is then to be turned as usual through the boiling liquor, until the colour appears to have acquired sufficient intensity. One pound of clean powdered chalk for every 100 lbs. of stuff is then to be mixed with the dyeing bath, and the operation continued for eight or ten minutes longer. This addition of the chalk raises and brightens the colour.\n\n259. Orange Yellow.—To communicate a beautiful orange yellow to woollen stuffs, 10 lbs. of quercitron bark, tied up in a bag, for every 100 lbs. of stuff are to be put into the bath with hot water. At the end of six or eight minutes, an equal weight of muriato-fulphate of tin is to be added, and the mixture well stirred for two or three minutes. The cloth, previously scoured, and completely wetted, is then immersed in the dyeing liquor, and briskly turned for a few minutes. By this process the colouring matter fixes on the cloth so quickly and equally, that after the liquor begins to boil, the highest yellow may be produced in less than 15 minutes.\n\n260. High shades of yellow, somewhat similar to those obtained from quercitron bark by the above process, are frequently given with young fustic (Chus cotinus, Lin.) and dyers spirit, or nitro-muriate of tin; but this colour is much less beautiful and permanent, while it is more expensive than what is obtained from the bark.\n\n261. Bright golden Yellow.—This colour is produced by employing 10 pounds of bark for every 100 lbs. of cloth, the bark being first boiled a few minutes, and then adding seven or eight lbs. of muriato-fulphate of tin, with about five pounds of alum. The cloth is to be dyed in the same manner as in the process for the orange yellow.\n\n262. Bright yellows of less body are produced by employing a smaller proportion of bark, as well as by diminishing the quantity of muriato-fulphate of tin and alum. And indeed every variety of shade of pure bright yellow may be given by varying the proportions of the ingredients.\n\n263. To produce the lively delicate green shade, which, for certain purposes, is greatly admired, the addition of tartar, with the other ingredients, only is necessary, and the tartar must be added in different proportions, according to the shade which is wanted. For a full bright yellow, delicately inclining to the greenish tinge, it will be proper to employ eight pounds of bark, six of muriato-fulphate of tin, with six of alum, and four of tartar. An additional proportion of alum and tartar renders the yellow more delicate, and inclines it more to the green shade; but when this lively green shade is wanted in the greatest perfection, the ingredients must be used in equal proportions. The delicate green lemon yellows are seldom required to have much fulness or body. Ten pounds of bark, therefore, with an equal quantity of the other ingredients, are sufficient to dye three or four hundred pounds of stuffs.\n\n264. To produce the exquisitely delicate and beautiful pale green shades, the surest method, Dr Bancroft observes, is to boil the bark with a small proportion of green yellow water, in a separate tin vessel for six or eight minutes, and then to add the muriato-fulphate of tin, alum, and tartar, and to boil them together for about fifteen minutes. A small quantity of this yellow liquor is then to be put into a dyeing vessel, which has been previously supplied with water sufficiently heated. The mixture being properly stirred, the dyeing process is to be conducted in the usual way, and the yellow liquor, as it is wanted, gradually added from the first vessel. In this way, the most delicate shades of lively green lemon yellows are dyed with ease and certainty. Weld is the only dye-stuff from which similar shades of colour can be obtained; but it is four times more expensive. The yellows dyed from quercitron bark, Dr Bancroft adds, with muriato-fulphate of tin and alum as mordants, do not exceed the expense of one penny for each pound of stuff; besides a considerable saving of time, labour, and fuel.\n\n265. A greenish shade may also be produced without tartar, by substituting verdigris dissolved in vinegar, along with the bark; but it is neither so permanent, nor so bright and delicate, as that produced by means of tartar. Sulphate of indigo also, in very small proportion, communicates a similar shade, when it is employed with the bark, muriato-fulphate of tin, and alum; but it is apt to take unequally on the stuff, and besides, in the language of the dyers, the colour has a tendency to call or fly in the finishing.\n\n266. Small proportions of cochineal employed along with the bark and other ingredients, raise the colour to a madder a beautiful orange, and even to an aurora. Madder employed may be also employed with the same view, for it heightens the yellow obtained from quercitron bark, although...\nChap. I.\n\nDYEING.\n\nOf Simple Colours.\n\nAlthough the colour thus obtained is inferior in beauty to that from cochineal. The madder may also be employed with weld for the same purpose.\n\n267. The colours obtained from quercitron bark, by the processes which we have now described, are very durable. They resist the action of the air, of soap, citron bark and acids. It is by the effects of alum, but especially of tartar, that these colours become fixed as to remain permanent by exposure to the air. It is observed of the highest yellows, even when they approach to the orange, and which are best dyed, either with muriate, or muriato-fulphate of tin and bark, that although they resist the action of soap and acids, they are apt to lose their lustre and become brown by the effect of the sun and air; but this also happens to yellows dyed with nitro-muriate of tin, both with the bark and with weld, but in a still greater degree with other yellow vegetable colouring matters. In some of these this defect is less easily obviated by alum and tartar, than it is in the yellow obtained from weld and quercitron bark.\n\nIII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Silk Yellow.\n\nWith weld.\n\n268. To dye silk a plain yellow colour, the only ingredient which was formerly employed is weld. The following is the process. The silk being previously scoured in the proportion of 20 lbs. of soap to the 100 of stuff, and then alumed and washed after the aluming, or as it is called, refreshed, the bath is prepared with two pounds of weld for every pound of silk; and, having boiled for 15 minutes, it is to be passed into a vat through a sieve or cloth. When the temperature is such as the hand can bear, the silk is introduced, and turned, until it has acquired a uniform colour. While this operation is going on, the weld is to be boiled a second time in fresh water; one half of the first bath is taken out, and its place supplied with a fresh decoction. The temperature of the fresh bath may be a little higher than the former, but it is necessary to guard against too great a degree of heat, that the colouring matter already fixed may not be dissolved. The stuff is to be turned as before, and afterwards taken out of the bath. A quantity of soda is to be dissolved in a part of the second decoction, and a larger or smaller proportion of this solution is to be added to the bath, according to the intensity of the shade required. When the silk has been turned a few times, it is again rung out, that it may be examined whether the colour be sufficiently full, and have the proper golden shade. To render the colour deeper, and to give it the gold cast, an addition of the alkaline solution is to be made to the bath, and to be repeated till the shade has acquired sufficient intensity. The alkaline solution may also be added along with the second decoction of the weld, observing the precaution, that the temperature of the bath be never too great.\n\n269. To produce other shades of yellow, having more of a gold or jonquille colour, a quantity of anotta, proportioned to the shade required, is to be added to the bath, along with the alkali. Lighter shades of yellow, such as pale lemon, or Canary-bird colour, are obtained, by previously whitening the silk, and regulating the proportion of ingredients in the bath by the shade required. To communicate a yellow having a tinge of green, a little indigo is added to the bath, if the silk has not been previously azured. To prevent the intensity of the shade from being too great, the silk may be more slightly alumed than usual.\n\n270. But, according to Dr Bancroft, the different shades of yellow obtained from weld, may be given to silk with equal facility and beauty, and at a cheaper rate, by employing quercitron bark as a substitute. A quantity of bark powdered and inclosed in a bag, in proportion to the shade of colour wanted, as from one to two pounds for every twelve pounds of silk, is put into the dyeing vat while the water is cold. Heat is then applied; and when it has become rather more than blood warm, or of the temperature of 100°, the silk having previously undergone the aluming process, is to be immersed and dyed in the usual way. If a deep shade is wanted, a small quantity of chalk or pearl-ashes may be added towards the end of the operation. To produce a more lively yellow, a small proportion of muriato-fulphate of tin may be employed; but it should be cautiously used, as it is apt to diminish the lustre of the silk. To produce such a shade, the proportions of the ingredients may be four pounds of bark, three of alum, and two of muriato-fulphate of tin. These are to be boiled with a proper quantity of water for ten or fifteen minutes; and the temperature of the liquid being so much reduced as the hand can bear it, the silk is immersed and dyed as usual, till it has acquired the proper colour. Care should be taken to keep the liquor constantly agitated, that the colouring matter may be equally diffused.\n\n271. To dye silk of an aurora or orange colour, after being properly scoured, it may be immersed in an alkaline solution of anotta, the strength of which is to be regulated by the shade required; and the temperature of the bath should be between tepid and boiling water. When the desired shade has been obtained, the silks are to be washed and twice beetleed, to free them from the superfluous colouring matter, which would injure the beauty of the colour. When raw silk is to be dyed, that which is naturally white should be selected, and the bath should be nearly cold; for otherwise the alkali, by dissolving the gum of the silk, destroys its elasticity. Silk is dyed of an orange shade with anotta, but the stuff must be reddened with vinegar, alum, or lemon juice. The acid, by saturating the alkali employed to dissolve the anotta, destroys the yellow shade produced by the alkali, and restores its natural colour, which inclines to a red. But although beautiful colours are obtained by this process, they do not possess any great degree of permanency.\n\n272. Several kinds of mushrooms afford lively and durable yellow dyes. A bright shining dye of this description has been extracted from the boletus luridus, which commonly grows on walnut and apple trees. The colouring matter is contained both in the tubular part, and also in the parenchyma of the body of the mushroom. To extract the colouring matter, it is pounded in a mortar, and the liquor which is thus obtained, is boiled for a quarter of an hour in water. An ounce of liquor is sufficient to communicate colouring matter to fix pounds of water. After the liquor has been strained, the stuff to be dyed is immersed in it, and boiled for fifteen minutes. When silk is subjected to this process, after being dyed, it is made to pass through a bath of soft soap, by which it acquires a shining appearance.\nDYEING.\n\nOf Simple Colours.\n\ning golden yellow colour, which has a near resemblance to the yellow of the silk employed to imitate embroidery in gold. This has been hitherto brought from China, and bears a very high price, the method of dyeing it being unknown in Europe. All kinds of stuff receive this colour, but it is less bright on linen and cotton, and seems to have the strongest affinity for silk. The use of mordants, it is supposed, would modify and improve it greatly.\n\nIV. Of the Processes for Dyeing Cotton and Linen Yellow.\n\n273. The process which has been usually followed in dyeing cotton and linen yellow, is by scouring it in a bath prepared in a ley with the ashes of green wood. It is afterwards washed, dried, and alumed, with one-fourth of its weight of alum. After 24 hours, it is taken out of the aluming, and dried, but without being washed. The cotton is then dyed in a weld bath, in the proportion of one pound and a quarter of weld for each pound of cotton, and turned in the bath till it has acquired the proper colour. After being taken out of the bath, it is soaked for an hour and a half in a solution of blue vitriol (fulphate of copper), in the proportion of one-fourth of the weight of the cotton, and then immersed, without washing, for nearly an hour, in a boiling solution of white soap, after which it is well washed and dried.\n\n274. A deeper yellow is communicated to cotton, by omitting the process of aluming, and employing two pounds and a half of weld for each pound of cotton. To this is added a dram of verdigrise, mixed with part of the bath. The cotton is then to be dipped and worked till the colour become uniform. It is then taken out of the bath, that a little solution of soda may be added, after which it is returned, and kept for fifteen minutes. It is then wrung out and dried.\n\n275. Other shades of yellow may be obtained, by varying the proportion of ingredients. Thus, a lemon colour is dyed by using only one pound of weld for every pound of cotton, and by diminishing the proportion of verdigrise, or using alum as a substitute.\n\n276. But a better method, as it affords more permanent and more beautiful colours, and at a smaller expense, is recommended by Dr Bancroft. This is by the use of quercitron bark, and the calico printers' aluminous mordant, or the sugar of lead. The following is the process which he proposes to employ, for producing bright and durable yellow colours. One pound of sugar of lead, and three pounds of alum, are to be dissolved in a sufficient quantity of warm water. The cotton or linen, after being properly rinsed, is to be soaked in this mixture, heated to the temperature of 100°, for two hours. It is then taken out, moderately pressed over a vessel, to prevent the waste of the aluminous liquor. It is then dried in a stove heat, and after being again soaked in the aluminous solution, it is wrung out and dried a second time. Without being rinsed, it is to be barely wetted with lime water, and afterwards dried, and if a full, bright, and durable yellow is wanted, it may be necessary to soak the stuff in the diluted aluminous mordant, and after drying, to wet it a second time with lime water. After it has been soaked for the last time, it should be well rinsed in clean water, to separate the loose particles of the mordant, which might injure the application of the colouring matter. By the use of the lime water, a greater proportion of alumina combines with the stuff, besides the addition of a certain portion of lime.\n\n277. In the preparation of the dyeing bath, from 12 lbs. of powdered quercitron bark are inclosed in a bath bag, for every 100 lbs. of the stuff, varying the proportion according to the intensity of the shade desired. The bark is put into the water while it is cold; and immediately after the stuff is immersed and agitated or turned for an hour, or an hour and a half, during which the water should be gradually heated, and the temperature raised to about 120°. At the end of this time the heat is increased, and the dyeing liquor brought to a boiling temperature; but at this temperature the stuff must remain in it only for a few minutes, because otherwise the yellow assumes a brownish shade. The stuff having thus acquired a sufficient colour, is taken out, rinsed and dried.\n\n278. Dr Bancroft observes, that when the alumino-mordant is employed, without the addition of water, or a diluted tere, one soaking only, and an immersion in lime water, may be sufficient; but he thinks that greater advantage is derived from the application of a more diluted mordant at two different times, or even by the immersion of the stuff a greater number of times, alternately in the diluted aluminous mordant, and lime water, and drying it after each immersion. By this treatment he found, that the colour always acquired more body and durability.\n\n279. Chaptal has proposed a process for communicating to cotton a nankeen yellow, which at the same time that it affords a durable colour, has the advantage of being cheap and simple. When cotton is immersed in a solution of any salt of iron, it has so strong an affinity for the oxide, that it decomposes the salt, combines with the iron, and assumes a yellow colour. The process recommended by Chaptal is the following. The cotton to be dyed is put into a cold solution of copperas (fulphate of iron) of the specific gravity 1.02. It is afterwards wrung out, and immediately immersed in a ley of potash of the specific gravity 1.01. This ley must have been previously saturated with a solution of alum. When the stuff has been kept for four or five hours in this bath, it may be taken out, washed and dried. By varying the proportion of fulphate of iron, every variety of shade of nankeen yellow may be obtained.\n\n280. We shall lay before our readers another process for dyeing nankeen colour, which is proposed and followed by Mr Brewer, a practical dyer. It is as follows.\n\n\"Mix as much sheep's dung in clear water as will make it appear of the colour of grass; and dissolve in clear water one pound of best white soap for every ten pounds of cotton yarn, or in that proportion for a greater or lesser quantity.\n\n\"Observe.—The tubs, boards, and poles, that are used in the following preparations must be made of deal; the boiling pan of either iron or copper.\n\nFirst Operation.—Pour the soap liquor prepared as above into the boiling pan; strain the dung liquor through a sieve; add as much thereof to the soap liquor in the pan as will be sufficient to boil the yarn, intended to be dyed, for five hours. When the liquors are\nChap. I.\n\nDYEING.\n\nOf Simple Colours.\n\nare well mixed in the pan, enter the yarn, light the fire under the pan, and bring the liquor to boil in about two hours, observing to increase the heat regularly during that period. Continue it boiling for three hours; then take the yarn out of the pan, wash it, wring it, and hang it in a shed on poles or rings. When dry, take it into a store or other room where there is a fire; let it hang there until it be thoroughly dry.\n\nN. B. \"The cotton yarn, when in the shed, should not be exposed either to the rain or sun; if it is, it will be unequally coloured when dyed.\n\nSecond Operation.—\" In this operation use only one half of the soap that was used in the last, and as much dung liquor (strained as before directed) as will be sufficient to cover the cotton yarn, when in the pan, about two inches. When these liquors are well mixed in the pan, enter the yarn, light the fire, and bring the liquor to boil in about one hour; then take the yarn out, wring it without washing, and hang it to dry as in the former operation.\n\nThird Operation.—\" This operation the same as the second in every respect.\n\nFourth Operation.—\" For every ten pounds of yarn make a clear ley from half a pound of pot or pearl-ashes. Pour the ley into the boiling-pan, and add as much clear water as will be sufficient to boil the yarn for two hours; then enter the yarn, light the fire, and bring it to boil in about an hour. Continue it boiling about an hour, then take the yarn out, wash it very well in clear water, wring it, and hang it to dry as in former operations.\n\nN. B. \"This operation is to cleanse the yarn from any oleaginous matter that may remain in it after boiling in the soap and dung liquors.\n\nFifth Operation.—\" To every gallon of iron liquor (m) add half a pound of ruddle or red chalk (the last the best) well pulverized.\n\nMix them well together, and let the liquor stand four hours, in order that the heavy particles may subside; then pour the clear liquor into the boiling-pan, and bring it to such a degree of heat as a person can well bear his hand in it; divide the yarn into small parcels, about five hanks in each; soak each parcel or handful very well in the above liquor, wring it, and lay it down on a clean deal board. When all the yarn is handed through the liquor, the last handful must be taken up and soaked in the liquor a second time, and every other handful in succession till the whole is gone through; then lay the yarn down in a tub, wherein there must be put a sufficient quantity of ley made from pot or pearl-ashes, as will cover it about six inches. Let it lie in this state about two hours, then hang it over in the ley, wring it, and lay it down on a clean board. If it does not appear sufficiently deep in colour, this operation must be repeated till it has acquired a sufficient degree of darkness of colour; this done, it must be hung to dry as in former operations.\n\nN. B. \"Any degree of red or yellow hue may be given to the yarn by increasing or diminishing the quantity of ruddle or red chalk.\n\nSixth Operation.—\" For every ten pounds of yarn make a ley from half a pound of pot or pearl-ashes; pour the clear ley into the boiling-pan; add a sufficient quantity of water thereto that will cover the yarn about four inches; light the fire, and enter the yarn, when the liquor is a little warm; observe to keep it constantly under the liquor for two hours; increase the heat regularly till it come to a scald; then take the yarn out, wash it, and hang it to dry as in former operations.\n\nSeventh Operation.—\" Make a four liquor of oil of vitriol and water: the degree of acidity may be a little less than the juice of lemons; lay the yarn in it for about an hour, then take it out, wash it very well and wring it; give it a second washing and wringing, and lay it on a board.\n\nN. B. \"This operation is to dissolve the metallic particles, and remove the ferruginous matter that remains on the surface of the thread after the fifth operation.\n\nEighth Operation.—\" For every ten pounds of yarn dissolve one pound of best white soap in clear water, and add as much water to this liquor in your boiling-pan as will be sufficient to boil the yarn for two hours. When these liquors are well mixed, light the fire, enter the yarn, and bring the liquor to boil in about an hour. Continue it boiling slowly an hour; take it out, wash it in clear water very well, and hang it to dry as in former operations: when dry, it is ready for the weaver.\n\nN. B. \"It appears to me, from experiments that I have made, that less than four operations in the preparation of the yarn will not be sufficient to cleanse the pores of the fibres of the cotton, and render the colour permanent.\"\n\nEdin.\n\n281. A method of dyeing cotton and linen a durable yellow colour is practised in the east. The object of Proceeds following this process, which is tedious, is to increase the affinity between the alumina and the stuff, so that it may adhere with sufficient force to produce a permanent colour. For this purpose three mordants are employed: these are oil, tan and alum. The cotton is soaked in a bath of oil, mixed with a weak solution of soda. Animal oil, as it is found to answer best, is preferred. Glue has also been tried, and is found to answer very well. The soda must be in the caustic state, for in that state it combines with the oil, and produces on the cloth an equal absorption. The stuff is then to be washed, and afterwards put into an infusion of nut galls of the white kind, and the infusion should be used hot. The tan combines with the oil, while the gallic acid carries off any portion of alkali which may adhere to the cloth. When the stuff is removed from the bath, it should be quickly dried; and too great an excess of galls beyond a proper proportion with the oil should be avoided, as it is apt to darken the shade of colour. After this preparation the stuff is to be immersed in a solution of alum; and in consequence of the affinity which exists between tan and alumina, the alum is decomposed, and its earth combines with the tan. After these preliminary steps, the cotton is to be dyed with quercitron bark, according to the process which has been already described.\n\nSect. III.\n\n(m) Iron liquor is what the linen printers use.\nSect. III. Of Blue.\n\n282. The next of the simple colours is blue. We shall first treat of the substances which are employed in dyeing blue, and then describe the processes which are followed in fixing this colour.\n\nI. Of the Substances which are employed in Dyeing Blue.\n\nThe only substances which are used in dyeing blue, are indigo and woad.\n\n283. Indigo was not used for the purpose of dyeing in Europe till near the middle of the 16th century. A substance is mentioned by Pliny*, which was brought from India, and termed indicum, which seems to have been the same as the indigo of the moderns; but it does not appear that either the Greeks or the Romans knew how to dissolve indigo, or its use in dyeing, although it was applied as a paint. It was, however, long before known as a dye in India. The first indigo which was employed for the purpose of dyeing by Europeans, was brought by the Dutch from India. One of the species of the plant from which it is obtained, was discovered by the Portuguese in Brazil, where it grows spontaneously, as well as in other parts of America. Being afterwards successfully cultivated in Mexico, and some islands of the West Indies, the whole of the indigo employed in Europe was supplied from these countries. The indigo from the East Indies has, however, of late recovered its character, and is imported into Britain in considerable quantities.\n\nThere are three species of the indigo plant, which are usually cultivated in America. The first is the indigofera tinctoria, Linn. which besides being a smaller and less hardy plant, is inferior to the others on account of its pulp, but as it yields a greater proportion, it is generally preferred. The second is the indigofera difformis, Linn. or Guatemala indigo plant. This is a taller and hardier plant, and affords a pulp of a superior quality to the former. The third is the indigofera argentea, Linn. which is the hardiest of the three species; yields a pulp of the finest quality, though in smallest proportion.\n\n285. When the indigo plant has arrived at maturity, it is cut a few inches above the ground, chopped in strata in a large vessel or steamer, and being kept down with boards, is covered with water; and in this state it is left to ferment till the pulp is extracted. The process commences by the evolution of heat, and the emission of a great quantity of carbonic acid gas. When the fermentation has continued for a sufficient length of time, which is known by the tops becoming tender and pale, the liquor, which is now of a green colour, is drawn off into large flat vessels, called beaters, where it is agitated with buckets or other convenient apparatus, till blue floccules begin to appear. To promote this granulation or separation of the floccules it is usual to add clear lime water till the liquor in which they are suspended become quite colourless. The liquor being sufficiently impregnated with the lime water, is left at rest to allow the particles of the colouring matter to precipitate; after which the supernatant liquor is drawn off, and the sediment collected into linen bags, which are suspended for some time to let the water drain off. It is then put into square boxes, or formed into lumps and dried in the shade. The indigo thus prepared is in a state fit for the market.\n\n286. The indigo which is produced in this operation differs greatly, not only according to the quality of the plant from which it is obtained, but according to the mode of preparation. But the difference of quality seems to depend entirely on the heterogeneous substances with which it is mixed, and on the degree of consistence which it has acquired in drying. The lightest kind which is brought from Guatemala, is called light indigo; it is of a fine blue colour, and is the most valuable, because it is of the finest quality. Indigo exhibits various shades of colour, which is also owing to the mixture of foreign substances. The most common shades are blue, violet, and copper colour.\n\n287. Other plants have also been discovered, which is obtained by a process somewhat similar, afford indigo, and in particular the nerium tinctorium, or rose bay, an ac. plants. count of which, with the method of manufacturing indigo from its leaves, has been given by Dr Roxburgh. This tree grows in great abundance in different parts of the East Indies; and plantations of it, raised from seeds, have succeeded well in Bengal. The leaves of the nerium afford indigo, not only when they are fresh gathered, but also when they are nearly dried; but they yield the best indigo after being kept a day or two. The leaves collected the preceding day are put into a copper, so as nearly to fill it without pressing. The copper is filled with water till within three inches of the top; and hard spring water, which increases the quantity of indigo, and improves its quality, is preferred. The fire is then applied, and kept up, till the liquid becomes of a green colour in the vessel. The leaves then become of a yellowish colour, and the heat of the liquor about 150°, or 160°. The leaves should be constantly agitated, that they may be equally heated, as well as to promote the operation, by the expulsion of the carbonic acid gas. When the process exhibits the above appearances, the liquor is to be drawn off, passed through a hair-cloth, and agitated while hot, in the usual way, till granulation takes place, or the appearance of blue floccules is observed. About \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) part of strong lime water is then added, to promote the precipitation of the indigo, and the remaining part of the process is similar to that described above, for the manufacture of indigo from indigofera†.\n\n288. The object of the processes which are followed in the manufacture of indigo, is to extract from the nature of plants which yield it, a green substance, which is soluble in water. This substance, which has a strong affinity for oxygen, gradually attracts it from the air, becoming of a blue colour, and is then insoluble in water. This absorption is greatly promoted by agitation, for then a greater surface is exposed to the action of the air; and the lime water, by combining with carbonic acid, which exists in the green matter, also promotes the separation of the indigo.\n\n289. Indigo is insoluble in water, alcohol, ether, and oils, and the only acids which produce any effect of indigo upon it, are the sulphuric and nitric. By the latter it is soon changed to a dirty white colour, and is at last entirely decomposed. When the acid is concentrated, the indigo is inflamed; but when it is diluted, the indigo becomes brown, and crystals like those of oxalic and...\nOf Simple and tartarous acids make their appearance; and when the acid and crystals are washed off, there remains behind a kind of resinous matter. Sulphuric acid in the concentrated state dissolves indigo, with the evolution of a great deal of heat. The solution is opaque and black, but when diluted with water, it changes to a deep blue colour. Dr Bancroft has denominated this solution sulphate of indigo, which has been long known by the name of liquid blue. The fixed alkalies in the state of carbonate precipitate slowly from sulphate of indigo, a blue coloured powder, which has the properties of indigo, but is found to be soluble in most of the acids and alkalies. Pure alkalies destroy the colour of sulphate of indigo, as well as that which is precipitated.\n\n292. Indigo is employed in dyeing, both in the state of liquid blue, or sulphate of indigo, from which is obtained the beautiful colour called Saxon blue; and also in the state of simple indigo, or the indigo of commerce. In dyeing with indigo, it must be reduced to the state of the green matter as it exists in the plants, or when it is first extracted from them. It must be deprived of the oxygen, to the combination of which the blue colour is owing. In this state it becomes soluble in water by means of the alkalies. To effect this separation of the oxygen, the indigo must be mixed with a solution of some substance which has a stronger affinity for oxygen than the green matter of indigo. Such substances are green oxide of iron and metallic sulphurates. Lime, green sulphate of iron, and indigo, are mixed together in water, and during this mixture the indigo is deprived of its blue colour, becomes green, and is dissolved, while the green oxide of iron is converted into the red oxide. In this process, part of the lime decomposes the sulphate of iron, and as the green oxide is set at liberty, it attracts oxygen from the indigo, and reduces it to the state of green matter, which is immediately dissolved by the action of the rest of the lime. Indigo is also deprived of its oxygen, and prepared for dyeing, by another process. Some vegetable matter is added to the indigo mixed with water, with the view of exciting fermentation; and quicklime or an alkali is added to the solution, that the indigo, as it is converted into the green matter, may be dissolved.\n\n291. Another plant, known under the name of pastel or woad, (Isatis tinctoria), is employed for dyeing blue. Another species (Isatis baltica), which is a smaller plant, is also employed in dyeing. The Isatis tinctoria is cultivated in France and in England. When the plant has reached maturity, it is cut down, washed in a river, and speedily dried in the sun. It is then ground in a mill, and reduced to a paste, which is formed into heaps, covered up to protect them from the rain, and at the end of a fortnight the heap is opened, to mix the whole well together. It is afterwards formed into round balls, which are exposed to the wind and sun, that the moisture may be separated. The balls are heaped upon one another, become gradually hot, and exhale the smell of ammonia. To promote the fermentation, which is stronger in proportion to the quantity heaped up, and the temperature of the season, the heap is to be sprinkled with water till it falls down in the state of coarse powder, in which state it appears in commerce. The blue colour obtained from woad is very permanent, but has little lustre. But its colour is not only inferior in beauty to that obtained from indigo; it affords also a smaller proportion of colouring matter, so that since the discovery of indigo, the use of woad has diminished.\n\nII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Wool Blue.\n\n292. The preparation for dyeing blue is made in a large wooden vessel or vat, which should be so constructed as to retain the heat, which is a matter of considerable importance in the process. The vat is therefore set up in a separate place from the coppers, and is sunk so far in the ground as to be only breast-high above it. Before the introduction of indigo, blue was dyed with woad, which affords a permanent, but not a deep colour; but a very rich blue is obtained by mixing indigo with the woad, and these are almost the only substances which are now employed for dyeing woollen stuffs. The proportions of these substances are varied by different dyers, and according to the shade which is required. The following is the account of the preparation of a vat, as it is given by Quatremere. Into a vat of about seven and a half feet deep, and five and a half in diameter, are thrown two balls of pastel or woad, which are previously broken, and together amount to about 400 pounds weight; 30 pounds of weld are boiled in a copper for three hours, in a sufficient quantity of water, to fill the vat. To this decoction are added 20 pounds of madder, and a basket full of bran. The boiling is then continued half an hour longer. This bath is cooled with 20 buckets of water, and after it is settled, and the weld taken out, it is poured into the vat, which must be stirred with a rake all the time that it is running in, and for 15 minutes longer. The vat is then covered up very hot, and allowed to stand for six hours, when it is uncovered, and raked again for 30 minutes. The same operation must be repeated every three hours. When the appearance of blue streaks is perceived on the surface of the vat, eight or nine pounds of quicklime are added; the colour then becomes of a deeper blue, and the vat exhales more pungent vapours. Immediately after the lime, or along with it, the indigo, which has been previously ground in a mill, with the smallest possible quantity of water, is put into the vat. The quantity is to be regulated by the intensity of the shade required. From ten to thirty pounds may be put into a vat such as we have now described. If on striking the vat with the rake, a fine blue fume arises, no other previous preparation is required than to stir it with the rake twice in the space of six hours, to mix the ingredients completely. Great care should be taken not to expose the vat to the air, except during the time of stirring it. When that operation is finished, it is covered with a wooden lid, on which are spread thick cloths, to retain the heat as much as possible; but after all these precautions, at the end of eight or ten days it is greatly diminished, and is at last entirely dissipated, so that the liquor must be again heated, by pouring the greater part of the liquor of the vat into a copper under which a large fire is made. When the liquor has acquired a sufficient temperature, it is returned into the vat, and carefully covered up.\n\n293. Vats of this description are sometimes liable to accidents. A vat is said to be repelled, when having to which previously afforded fine shades of blue, it appears liable to black.\nOf Simple Black, without any blue streaks; and if it be flirred, the black colour becomes deeper; the vat at the same time exhales, instead of a sweetish smell, a pungent odour; and the stuff dyed in a vat in this state, comes out of a dirty gray colour. These effects are ascribed to an excess of lime.\n\n294. Different means are employed to recover a repelled vat. Some are satisfied with merely reheating it; while others add tartar, bran, urine, or madder. Hellot recommends bran and madder as the best remedy. If the excess of lime be not very great, it is sufficient to leave it at rest five or six hours, putting in a quantity of bran and three or four pounds of madder, which are to be sprinkled on the surface, and then it is to be covered up, and after a certain interval, to be tried again. But if the vat has been so far repelled as to afford a blue only when it is cold, it must be left at rest to recover, and sometimes must remain whole days without being flirred with the rake. When it begins to afford a tolerable pattern, the bath must be reheated. In general, this revives the fermentation. The addition of bran or madder, or a balkef or two of fresh wood, produces the same effect.\n\n295. This vat sometimes runs into the putrefactive process. When this happens, the colour of the vat becomes reddish, the paste rises from the bottom, and a fetid smell is exhaled. This accident is owing to a deficiency of lime, and it must be corrected by adding a fresh quantity. The vat is then to be raked; after two hours more lime is added, and the process of raking again performed. These operations are to be repeated till the vat is recovered.\n\n296. Nothing requires more attention in treating a vat of this kind, than the dilution of the lime, the principal use of which is to moderate the tendency to putrefaction, and to limit the fermentation to that degree which is necessary to deprive the indigo of its oxygen. If too much lime be added, the necessary fermentation is retarded, and if there be too little, the putrefactive process commences.\n\n297. Two hours previous to the dyeing operation, the vat should be raked; and to prevent the stuff coming in contact with the sediment, which would produce inequalities in the colour, a crofs of wood is introduced. The stuff is then to be completely wetted with pure water a little heated; and being wrung out, it is dipped into the vat, where it is moved about for a longer or shorter time, according to the depth of shade required. During this operation it is taken out occasionally, to be exposed to the air, the action of which is necessary to change the green colour of the bath into a blue. Stuffs dyed blue in this manner must be carefully washed, to carry off the loose particles of colouring matter; and when the shade of blue is deep, they ought even to be cleansed, by fulling with soap. This operation does not alter the colour.\n\n298. When a vat is prepared entirely of indigo, without pastel or woad, it is called an indigo vat. The vessel employed for this purpose is of copper, into which water is poured, according to its capacity, to the amount of 40 buckets, in which have been boiled six pounds of potash, twelve ounces of madder, and six pounds of bran. Six pounds of indigo ground in water are then put in, and after it has been carefully raked, the vat is to be covered. A slow fire is to be kept up, and twelve hours after it is filled, it is to be raked a second time. This operation is to be repeated every twelve hours, till it come to a blue colour, which will generally be the case in about 48 hours. If the bath is properly managed, it will be of a fine green, exhibiting on the surface coppery scales, and a blue scum or flower. In this vat the indigo is rendered soluble in water, by means of the alkali instead of lime. The dyeing operation is to be conducted in the same manner as the preceding.\n\n299. Two vats have been described by Hellot, in Hellot's which the indigo is dissolved by means of urine. Madder is added to it, and in the one vinegar, in the other alum and tartar, of each a quantity equal in weight to that of the indigo. The proportion of urine must be considerable. In considering the theory of this process, it seems probable that the indigo, deprived of its oxygen by the urine and madder during the fermentation, is dissolved by the ammonia which is formed in the urine. When the solution of alum and tartar is added, an effervescence, which Hellot observed, is produced. This, it is probable, has a tendency to retard or stop the putrefaction. But in vats of this description, operations on a large scale cannot be carried on; they seem only adapted for small dye-houses.\n\nIII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Silk Blue.\n\n300. Silk is dyed blue with indigo alone, without any proportion of woad. The proportion of indigo mentioned in the preparation of the indigo vat, and sometimes a larger proportion, is employed, with six pounds of bran, and about twelve ounces of madder. According to Macquer, half a pound of madder for each pound of potash, renders the vat greener, and produces a more fixed colour in the silk. When the vat is come to, it should be refreshed with two pounds of potash, and three or four ounces of madder; and after being raked in the course of four hours, it is fit for dyeing. The temperature should be moderated, that the hand may be held in it without uneasiness.\n\n301. The silk, after being boiled with soap, in the proportion of 30 pounds of soap to 100 of silk, and of the silk well cleaned by repeated beatings in a stream of water, must be dyed in small portions, because it is apt to take on an uneven colour. When it has been turned once or oftener in the bath, it is wrung out, and exposed to the air, that the green colour may change to a blue. When the change is complete, it is thrown into clear water, and afterwards wrung out. Silk dyed blue should be speedily dried. In damp weather and in winter, it is necessary to conduct the drying in a chamber heated by a stove. The silk should be hung on a frame kept constantly in motion. To dye light shades, some dyers employ vats that are somewhat exhausted; but it ought to be observed, that the colour thus obtained is less beautiful and less permanent than when fresh vats, containing a smaller quantity of indigo, are employed.\n\n302. Some addition is required to be made to the indigo, to give silk a deep blue. A previous preparation is necessary, by giving it another colour or ground. For the Turkey blue, which is the deepest, a strong bath of archil is first prepared. Cochineal is also sometimes used, instead of archil, for the ground, to render the colour more permanent. A blue is given to silk\nOf Simple silk by means of verdigris and logwood, but it possesses little durability. It might be rendered more permanent, by giving it a lighter shade in this bath, then dipping it in a bath of archil, and finally in the indigo vat.\n\nDyeing raw silk. 303. When raw silk is to be dyed blue, such as is naturally white should be selected. Being previously soaked in water, it is put into the bath in separate hanks, as already directed for scoured silks; and as raw silk is found to combine more readily with the colouring matter, the scoured silk, when it can be conveniently done, should be first put into the bath. If archil, or any of the other ingredients which have been already mentioned, are required, to give more intensity to the colour, the mode of application is the same as that directed for scoured silk.\n\nIV. Of the Processes for Dyeing Cotton and Linen Blue.\n\nPreparation. 304. For dyeing cotton and linen blue, Pileur of the vat. d’Aphigny recommends a vat containing about 120 gallons. From six to eight pounds of indigo reduced to powder, are boiled in a ley drawn off from a quantity of lime, equal in weight to the indigo, and a quantity of potash double its weight. During the boiling, which is to be continued till the indigo is completely penetrated with the ley, the solution must be constantly stirred, to prevent the indigo from being injured, by adhering to the bottom of the vessel.\n\n305. During this process, another quantity of quicklime, equal in weight to the indigo, is to be flaked. Twenty quarts of warm water are added, in which is to be dissolved a quantity of copperas (sulphate of iron) equal to twice the weight of the lime. The solution being completed, it is poured into the vat, which is previously half filled with water. To this the solution of indigo is added, with that part of the ley which was not employed in the boiling. The vat must now be filled up to within two or three inches of the top. It must be raked twice or thrice a day till it is completely prepared, which is generally the case in 48 hours, and sometimes sooner, as it depends on the temperature of the atmosphere. A small proportion of bran, madder, and woad, is recommended by some, to be added to such a vat as we have now described.\n\n306. The process which is followed at Rouen, and described by Quatremere, is simpler. The vats, which are constructed of a kind of flint, are coated within and without with fine cement, and are arranged in one or more parallel lines. Each vat contains four hogsheads of water. The indigo, to the amount of 18 or 20 pounds, being macerated for a week in a cauldron, strong enough to bear an egg, is ground in a mill; three hogsheads and a half of water are put into the vat, and afterwards 20 pounds of lime. The lime being thoroughly flaked, the vat is raked, and 36 pounds of copperas are added; and when the solution is complete, the ground indigo is poured in through a sieve. It is raked seven or eight times the same day, and after being left at rest for 36 hours, it is in a state fit for dyeing.\n\nProcess on a larger scale. 307. In extensive manufactories, it is necessary to have vats set at different times. In conducing the processes of dyeing, the stuffs are first dipped in the most exhausted vat, and then regularly proceeding from the weakest to the strongest, if they have not previously attained the desired shade. The stuffs should remain in the bath only about five or six minutes, for in that time they combine with all the colouring matter they can take up. After the stuffs have been dipped in a vat, it should not be used again, till it has been raked, and stood at least 24 hours, unless it has been lately set, when a shorter period is sufficient.\n\n308. After the stuffs have been dipped three or four times in a vat, it begins to change. It becomes black, and no blue or copper-coloured streaks are seen on the surface after raking it. It must then be renewed, by adding four lbs. of copperas, with two of quicklime, after which it must be raked twice. In this way, a vat may be renewed three or four times; but the additional quantity of ingredients must be diminished, as the strength of the vat is exhausted.\n\n309. A vat which is still more simple, and more easily prepared, has been recommended by Bergman. The proportion of the ingredients which he has directed to be employed, is the following. To three drachms of indigo reduced to powder, three drachms of copperas, and three of lime, add two pints of water. Let it be well raked, and in the course of a few hours it will be in a proper state for dyeing.\n\n310. Hauffman employs still a smaller proportion of Hauffman’s indigo. For 3000 lbs. of water he takes 36 lbs. of quicklime flaked in 200 lbs. of water, with which the indigo in the proportion of from 10 to 20 lbs. wellground, is to be mixed. He then dissolves 30 lbs. of copperas in 120 lbs. of hot water. The whole being left at rest for fifteen minutes, the vat is filled, and gently and constantly stirred. When a deeper shade is wanted, and particularly when linen is to be dyed, the proportion of indigo should be greater; but the shade depends very much on the time the stuffs remain in the vat, and the times it has been used. When the vat becomes turbid, the process of dyeing must be interrupted, till it has been again raked, and the supernatant liquor become transparent. If the effects of the lime fail, a new quantity fresh flaked, must be added; and if the iron cease to produce the effect on the indigo, a new portion must be also added, observing the precaution to have a greater quantity of lime than what is necessary to saturate the sulphuric acid. When the indigo seems to be exhausted, fresh portions ground in water are also to be added; the vat is to be raked several times, and allowed to settle, after which it is again fit for use. In this way Mr Hauffman informs us he preferred a vat for the space of two years; and had it not been for the accumulation of sediment, which prevented the stuffs from being immersed to a sufficient depth, it might have been continued in use for a much longer time. It is worth while to add, that Mr Hauffman found, that a pattern of cloth dipped in water, acidulated with sulphuric acid, immediately after it was taken out of the bath, became of a much deeper blue than a similar pattern exposed to the air, or another dipped in river water.\n\n311. Another convenient and expedient vat is mentioned by Bergman, and described by Scheffer. Indigo reduced to fine powder, in the proportion of three drachms to a quart, is added to the strong ley of the soap-boiler. After a few minutes, when the colouring matter is well penetrated by the ley, fix drachms of powdered orpiment are to be added. In a few minutes after the bath has been well raked, it becomes green,\nOf simple and the blue streaks appear on the surface. Heat is to be applied; when the operation of dyeing may commence.\n\n312. The preparation employed for printing cottons is similar to the above bath, excepting in the proportions of orpiment and indigo, which are greater in the former; but these proportions are very different in different manufactories.\n\n313. Saxon Blue.—The colour which is obtained by dyeing with a solution of indigo in sulphuric acid is known under the name of Saxon blue, because the process was first carried on at Großenhain in Saxony, by Counsellor Barth, who made the discovery about the year 1740. This discovery was for some time kept secret, and the method seems to have been originally very complicated. Alumina, antimony, and some other substances, were previously added to the sulphuric acid. These, however, are now omitted, and the indigo alone is dissolved in the acid.\n\n314. From a great number of experiments which were made on this process by Bergman, he concluded, that in those cases where the sulphate of indigo afforded only a fading colour, the acid employed had been too weak. Quatremere observes that, among several processes for dyeing with sulphate of indigo, he discovered only two, in which the stuffs were completely penetrated with colouring matter. To effect this, he employed an alkali, in the proportion of one ounce to an ounce of indigo, and six ounces of sulphuric acid. With these proportions of the ingredients he obtained a deep vivid blue, equally intense through every part of the stuff. Poerner, who has paid great attention to this preparation, also employs an alkali, by means of which a more pleasing colour, which penetrates deeper, is produced. The proportions which he recommends are four parts of sulphuric acid to one of indigo. The indigo is first reduced to a fine powder, and the sulphuric acid, in the concentrated state, is poured upon it. The mixture is stirred for some time, and having stood twenty-four hours, one part of dry potash in fine powder, is added; and after the whole is again stirred, it remains for twenty-four hours longer. It is then to be diluted with eight times its weight of water, which must be gradually added, or a greater or less proportion as may be wanted.\n\nDr Bancroft seems to be of opinion, that a more durable blue may be obtained by diluting the acid with an equal quantity of water, when the indigo is put in, and allowing the mixture to remain forty-eight hours; for he thinks by this slower and more moderate action, the basis of the indigo is less injured. Instead of the potash employed by Poerner, Dr Bancroft uses chalk; and even in such a quantity as to saturate the acid. In this case the indigo is precipitated along with the chalk; and, when collected into a solid mass, communicates a blue colour to wool, but more slowly than by the common method, in which the combination is very rapid and the dyeing unequal. This inconvenience he thinks might be obviated by the use of chalk.\n\n315. To produce a Saxon blue colour on woollen stuffs, they are prepared with alum and tartar. And in proportion to the shade required, the quantity of solution of indigo put into the bath must be regulated. When a deep shade of Saxon blue is wanted, the stuff must be passed different times through vessels containing such a quantity of colouring matter as is sufficient to give light colours. In this way, by repeated applications, the colour becomes more uniform.\n\n316. The sulphate of indigo is also employed to dye silk. For this purpose attempts have been made to unite the advantages of the indigo vat and its solution in sulphuric acid. A process of this kind is greatly recommended by Gublache, which produces beautiful colours, and is at the same time cheap and convenient. The bath is composed of one pound of indigo, three pounds of quicklime, three of copperas, and one and a half of orpiment. The indigo is first to be carefully ground and mixed with water, put into a wooden vat, and diluted with water, according to the shade of colour wanted. The lime is then to be added, and the mixture being well stirred, it is covered up, and allowed to remain at rest for some hours. After this the copperas in the state of powder is added, the whole well stirred, and the vat covered up. And lastly, at the end of some hours, the orpiment reduced to powder is thrown in, and the whole left at rest for several hours. The mixture is afterwards to be stirred, and then left to settle, till the liquor becomes clear; when the blue streaks or flower which covers it is removed, and the silk previously dipped in warm water, is to be dyed hank by hank. When it is removed from the bath, it is to be washed in a stream of water, and dried.\n\n317. This process is recommended as the means of obviating a greenish cast, which is sometimes observed in Saxon blue, and which is supposed to be owing to some change in the particles of indigo, by means of the sulphuric acid.\n\n318. The colour denominated English blue is produced by means of the sulphate of indigo. To give blue silk this colour, it is first to be dyed a light blue; and, when taken out of this bath, it is dipped in hot water, washed in a stream, and left in a bath composed of the sulphate of indigo, to which a little of the solution of tin has been added, until the proper shade is obtained, or the bath is exhausted. Previous to its being put into this bath, it may be dipped in a solution of alum, in which it should only remain a very short time. Silk, which has been dyed according to this process, is free from the reddish tinge which it derives from the blue vat, as well as from the greenish cast of the Saxon blue.\n\n319. The sulphate of indigo has been hitherto only applied for the purpose of dyeing wool and silk. The affinity of indigo for vegetable substances is not sufficiently strong to effect the decomposition of the sulphate. It cannot, therefore, be employed with advantage in dyeing cotton and linen.\n\n320. Attempts have been made to dye with Prussian Dyeing blue. The process which was followed by Macquer is with prussiate of iron, the following. He soaked wool, silk, cotton, and tan blue thread, in a solution of alum and sulphate of iron, and afterwards in an alkaline solution, which was partly saturated with prussic acid. He then immersed the stuffs in water, acidulated with sulphuric acid, for the purpose of dissolving that part of the oxide of iron which remained uncombined with the prussic acid, and which the uncombined alkali had precipitated. By successive repetitions of these immersions he obtained a fine blue, but very unequal. Berthollet justly remarks on this experiment.\nOf Simple experiment, that an alkali saturated with prussic acid should be employed, or lime water or magnesia, both of which have the property of combining with that acid. In a second experiment Macquer boiled the stuffs in a solution of tartar and alum, and then passed them through a bath which contained the prussian blue merely diffused in it. The colour was faint, and could not be made deeper; but it was equal, and soft to the touch.\n\n321. In the process proposed by Abbé Menon for thread and cotton, they are first dyed black, and soaked for a few minutes in prussiate of alkali, and afterwards boiled in a solution of alum. In this way they acquired a deep blue. When a lighter blue is wanted, the stuffs must be passed through a weak acid.\n\n322. Similar to the second experiment of Macquer is the process of Roland de la Platière. He takes prussian blue in the proportion of a pound to a piece of stuff, powdered, and passed through a very fine sieve, and adds muriatic acid till it is reduced to the consistence of syrup. It is to be constantly stirred for about half an hour, while it ferments. It is then well diluted, and stirred every hour for a day, till the fermentation ceases. The particles are thus in a state of minute division. Seven or eight buckets of water for one piece of velvet, are put into a trough; then add the mixture, which has been previously well diluted in a separate vessel, and poured into the bath through a very fine sieve. When the piece is placed on the winch, over the trough, let the bath be briskly stirred, and the piece speedily let down; and the same operation must be continued as quickly as possible for several hours. This colour requires great management, for as the particles of the prussian blue are only in a state of minute division, and heavy, they are quickly deposited on the stuff. Hence the colour appears very unequal and in patches, even with the utmost care; and nothing can be done to avoid it, but repeating the operations again and again. The stuff should be put into the baths thoroughly wet, for when it is dry, it penetrates with difficulty, and is always unequal. Between the dryings the stuff is always to be washed and beatled, excepting the last time, when it is not washed, but dried in the open air, either in the sun or in the shade; observing however, that it be well stretched. This beautiful colour is not changed by the air; it resists the action of acids, and is little altered by boiling with alum; but it is soon tarnished by friction, or particles of dust that adhere to it. It is scarcely necessary to add, that it is instantly decomposed by alkaline liquids. Guhlische employs a solution of tin in nitro-muriatic acid, as a substitute for muriatic acid, in the process of dyeing with prussian blue.\n\n323. Dr Bancroft made a number of experiments in dyeing both vegetable and mineral matters, with prussian blue, and particularly with the view of obviating the difficulties which had occurred to others in the use of it. He boiled up copperas with quercitron bark, fustic, and logwood, separately, in what he thought the best proportions; and in each of these mixtures he dyed a piece of woollen cloth by boiling it for 10 or 15 minutes. The stuffs were afterwards separately immersed in warm diluted prussiate of potash neutralized by sulphuric acid. They acquired an equal and beautiful blue. This however, was not the uniform result; for when too much copper as was employed in dyeing with quercitron bark, there was an excess of oxide of iron, which combining with the fibres of the wool, gave the prussian blue a greenish tinge; but this he found could be remedied, by passing the cloth through warm water, slightly acidulated with muriatic acid. The prussian colouring matter, Dr Bancroft observes, must always be applied in a moderate heat, otherwise it will be precipitated by the sulphuric acid, and rendered unfit for this purpose, till it is again dissolved by potash, lime, or some other substance.\n\n324. He then tried to fix prussian blue by means of the aluminous mordant, but at the end of 15 minutes, after being immersed in a solution of prussiate of potash, it had acquired no colour. The addition of a small proportion of a solution of iron in muriatic acid, communicated a blue colour. All parts of the cloth, as well as those to which the mordant had been applied, received the colour. The cloth being washed with soap, the whole of the colour was discharged, excepting where it had been impregnated with alumina, and even there it had become fainter. A piece of the same cotton was immersed in a solution of ammonia (volatile alkali); the pale blue was greatly heightened. Another piece was put into water slightly tinged with a solution of copper in ammonia. The blue colour became suddenly of an intensely deep garter-blue or violet, and it resisted the action of soap. Into water mixed with a little of a solution of muriate of copper, he put another piece of the same cotton, and it soon became of a deeper blue, without any of the purple or violet shade. This resisted the action of soap, and after long exposure to the weather, the colour was little diminished; and when the colour remained in any degree weakened, immersion in water slightly acidulated with fulphuric acid, completely restored it. From these facts it would appear to be advantageous to prepare woollens by the usual boiling with alum, or alum and tartar, before they are dyed with copperas and quercitron bark, fustic or logwood, for a prussian blue; but a greater proportion of sulphuric acid, in the prussiate of potash or lime, that the excess of acid may discharge the vegetable colouring matters becomes necessary.\n\n325. Dr Bancroft afterwards tried pieces of silk and cotton in the diluted prussiates of potash, soda, lime, &c., with solutions of most of the metals in different acids and alkalis; and from the different metallic solutions he obtained a very full, lively colour, which he calls the red copper colour; from the different solutions of copper in fulphuric, nitric, muriatic, and acetic acids; the same effect succeeded well from a solution in ammonia. He obtained also the same colour from the nitrates of silver and of cobalt. The prussian colouring matter fixed by these metallic mordants resisted the action of acids, washings with soap, and exposure to the weather for the greatest length of time; but in all these cases there must be a double application. The prussian colouring matter must first be applied to the linen, cotton or silk, which must be afterwards allowed to dry. It must then be immersed in the metallic solution, or the metallic solution must be applied first, and then the solution of prussiate of potash, soda, lime, &c.\n\nSect. IV. Of Dyeing Black.\n\nThe next of the simple colours is black, of which we shall treat as in the former sections; first describing the substances which are employed, and then giving an account\nOf Simple account of the processes which are followed in dyeing different stuffs of a black colour.\n\nI. Of the Substances employed in Dyeing Black.\n\n326. There are few substances which have the property of producing a permanent black colour, without any addition. The juice of some plants produces this effect on cotton and linen. A black colour is obtained from the juice of the cashew nut, which will not wash out, and even resists the process of boiling with soap or alkalies. The cashew nut of India is employed for marking linen. That of the West Indies (Anacardium occidentale, Lin.) also yields a permanent dye, but the colour has a brownish shade. The juice of some other plants, as that of the toxicodendron, or floes, affords a durable blueish black colour; but these substances cannot be obtained in sufficient quantity, even if they afforded colours equal to those produced by the common processes.\n\n327. The principal substances which are employed to give a black colour are gall nuts which contain the astringent principle, or tan, and the red oxide of iron (r). For a particular account of the nature and properties of tan, see Chemistry Index. The black colour is produced by the combination of the astringent principle with the oxide of iron, held in solution by an acid, and fixed on the stuff. When the particles are precipitated from the mixture of tan and a solution of iron, they have only a blue colour; but after they are exposed for some time to the air, and moistened with water, the colour becomes deeper, although the blue shade is still perceptible. After the particles are fixed on the stuff, the shade becomes much deeper.\n\n328. Logwood is not to be considered as affording a black dye, but is much employed to give a lustre to black colours. We have (180,) already described its nature and properties, among the substances from which red colouring matters are obtained.\n\n329. Black colours are rarely produced by a simple combination between the colouring matter and the stuff; but are usually fixed by means of mordants, as in the case of the black particles which are the result of a combination of the astringent principle and the oxide of iron, held in solution by an acid. But when the particles are precipitated from the mixture of an astringent and a solution of iron, they have only a blue colour. By being exposed to the air, and moistened with water, the colour becomes deeper, although the blue shade is still perceptible. No fine black colour is ever obtained, unless the stuffs are freely exposed to the air. In dyeing black, therefore, the operations must be conducted at different intervals. Berthollet has observed that black stuffs, when brought in contact with oxygen gas, diminish its volume, so that some portion of it is absorbed.\n\nII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Woollen Black.\n\n330. In dyeing woollen stuffs black, if a full and fine deep colour is wanted, it is necessary that they are pre-dyed blue. To remove all the particles of colouring matter which happen to be loosely attached to the stuff, it should be washed in a river as soon as it is taken out of the vat, and afterwards cleansed at the fulling mill. After these preliminary processes, the stuffs are ready to receive the black colouring matter. The process of Hellot is the following:\n\nFor every hundred pounds of stuff, ten pounds of log-Hellot's wood, and ten pounds of galls reduced to powder, are procured, put into a bag and boiled in a middle-sized copper, with a sufficient quantity of water, for 12 hours. A third of this bath is put into another copper, along with two pounds of verdigris. The stuff is immersed in this bath, and continually stirred for 2 hours. The bath should be kept hot, but it ought not to boil. At the end of two hours the stuff is taken out, and a similar portion of the bath is put into the copper, with eight pounds of copperas (sulphate of iron). During the solution of the copperas, the fire is diminished, and the bath is allowed to cool for half an hour, stirring it well the whole time. The remainder of the bath is then to be added, and after making this addition, the bag containing the astringent matters should be strongly pressed, to separate the whole. A quantity of sumach from 15 to 20 pounds, is now to be added, and the bath is just raised to the boiling temperature; and when it has given one boil, it is to be immediately dropped with a little cold water. A fresh quantity of sulphate of iron, to the amount of two pounds, is then added, and the stuff is kept in it for another hour, after which it is taken out, washed and aired; it is again put into the copper, and constantly stirred for an hour. It is then carried to the river, well washed, and fulled. To soften the black colour, and make it more firm, another bath is prepared with weld. This is made to boil for a moment, and when it has cooled, the stuff is passed through it. By this process, which is indeed somewhat complicated, a beautiful black colour is produced.\n\n331. But the processes usually followed for dyeing common black, are more simple. Cloth which has been pre-process, violently dyed blue, is merely boiled in a vat of galls for two hours. It is then kept two hours, but without boiling, in the bath of logwood and sulphate of iron, and afterwards washed and fulled. According to Hellot's process, a bath is to be prepared of a pound and a half of yellow wood, five pounds of logwood, and ten pounds of sumach, which is the proportion of the ingredients.\n\n(r) Oak bark has been recommended as a substitute for gall-nuts in dyeing black, and particularly in dyeing hats; and it is said that the colour thus obtained is fuller, more beautiful and durable, while the operation is easier and less liable to accident. It was first proposed in the year 1782 by Stephanopoli, a Corfican, and a surgeon in the French army. The examination of the process was referred by the French government to Macquer, who gave a favourable report of it; and afterwards to Berthollet, who gave a different opinion. The process has since been examined, and promises to be more economical and advantageous, especially for dyeing hats.\nOf Simple Colours.\n\n332. When fluffs are to be dyed at a less expense, instead of the blue ground, a brown or root-coloured ground may be substituted. This brown or fawn colour is communicated by means of the root of the walnut tree, or green walnut peels. The fluffs are then to be dyed black, according to some of the processes already described.\n\n333. The proportions of the ingredients employed by the English dyers are, for every hundred pounds of cloth previously dyed a deep blue, about five pounds of sulphate of iron, five pounds of galls, and 30 of logwood. The first step in the process is to gall the cloth, after which it is passed through the decoction of logwood, to which the sulphate of iron has been added.\n\n334. The leaves of the arbutus unedo have been recommended, and employed as a substitute for galls. The leaves must be carefully dried, so that the green colour may be preserved. A hundred pounds of wool are boiled with 16 pounds of sulphate of iron, and eight of tartar, for two hours. The day following the cloth is to be rinsed as after aluming. A hundred and fifty pounds of the leaves of unedo are then to be boiled for two hours in water, and after being taken out, a small quantity of madder is to be added to the liquor, putting in the cloth at the same time, which is to remain about an hour and a half. It is then taken out and rinsed in water. By this process, it is said, blue cloth receives a pretty good black, but white cloth becomes only of a deep brown. It is said, too, that the madder and tartar are useless ingredients.\n\n335. After the different operations for dyeing the cloth have been finished, it is washed in a river, and fulled, till the water comes off clear and colourless. Soap lads are recommended by some in fulling fine cloths, but it is found difficult to free the cloth entirely from the soap. After the cloth has come from the fulling mill, some propose to give it a dip in a bath of weld, by which it is said to be softened, and the colour better fixed; but according to Lewis, this operation, which in other cases is of some advantage, is useless after the cloth has been treated with the soap suds.\n\nIII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Silk Black.\n\n336. In communicating a black colour to silk, different operations are necessary, such as boiling, galling, repairing the bath, dyeing, and softening.\n\n337. To give a deeper shade to silk, it is necessary to deprive it of the gummy substance to which its stiffness and elasticity are owing. This is done by boiling the silk four or five hours with one fifth its weight of white soap, and afterwards beating and carefully washing it.\n\nGalling.\n\n338. In conducting the process of galling silk, three fourths of its weight of galls are to be boiled for three or four hours, but the proportion of galls must depend on their quality. After the boiling, the liquor is allowed to remain at rest for two hours; the silk is then put into the bath, and left there from 12 to 36 hours, when it is to be taken out, and washed in the river. But as silk is capable of combining with a great proportion of the altrigent principle, or tan, from which it receives a considerable increase of weight, it is allowed to remain for a longer or shorter time, as the silk is required to have more or less additional weight. To communicate, therefore, to silk what is called a heavy black, it is allowed to remain longer in the gall liquor; the process is repeated oftener, and the silk is also dipped in the dye a greater number of times.\n\n339. While silk is preparing for the process of dyeing, the bath is to be heated, and should be occasionally stirred, that the grounds which fall to the bottom may not acquire too much heat. It should always be kept under the boiling temperature. Gum and solution of iron are added in different proportions, according to the different processes. When the gum is dissolved, and the bath near the boiling temperature, it is left to settle for about an hour. The silk, which in general is previously divided into three parts, that each may be successively put into the bath, is immersed in it. Each part is then to be three times wrung, and after each wringing hung up to air. The silk being thus exposed to the action of the air, acquires a deeper shade. This operation being finished, the bath is again heated, with the addition of gum and sulphate of iron, and this is repeated two or three times, according as the black required is light or heavy. When the process of dyeing is finished, the silk is rinsed in a vessel with some cold water, by turning or shaking it over.\n\n340. Silk, after it has been taken out of the dye, is softened extremely harshly, to remove which it is subjected to the operation of softening. A solution of four or five pounds of soap for every hundred pounds of silk, is poured through a cloth into a vessel of water. The solution being completed, the silk is immersed, and allowed to remain in it for about 15 minutes; it is then to be wrung out and dried.\n\n341. When raw silk is to be dyed, that which has a natural yellow colour is preferred. The galling operation must be performed in the cold, if it be proposed to preserve the whole of the gum, and the elasticity which it gives to the silk; but if part only of the gum is wished to be preserved, the galling is to be performed in the warm bath.\n\n342. The dyeing operation is also performed in the cold. All that is necessary is to add the sulphate of iron to the water in which the stuff is rinsed. By this simple process the black dye is communicated. It is then washed, once or twice beetleed, and dried without wringing, that its elasticity may not be destroyed. Raw silk may be dyed by a more speedy process. After a speedier galling, it may be turned or thicken over in the cold bath; and thus by alternately dipping and airing the stuff, the operation may be completed. It is then to be washed and dried as in the former processes.\n\n343. The method of dyeing velvet at Genoa, which has been simplified and improved in France, is thus described by Macquer. For every 100 pounds of silk velvet: 20 pounds of Aleppo galls, reduced to powder, are boiled in a sufficient quantity of water for an hour. The bath is allowed to settle till the galls have fallen to the bottom; they are then taken out, and two pounds and a half of sulphuric acid, twelve pounds of iron filings, and 20 pounds of gum, are put into a copper\nThis vessel is immersed in the bath, and supported that it may not touch the bottom. The gum, which is allowed to dissolve for an hour, is to be occasionally stirred; and if it appear that the whole of the gum is dissolved, three or four pounds more are to be added. Excepting during the operation of dyeing, the cullender is to remain in the copper, which must be kept hot the whole time, but at a temperature below the boiling point. In galling the silk, one-third of Aleppo galls is employed, and the stuff should remain five hours in the liquor the first time, and twelve hours the second. By frequent additions of sulphate of iron, and repeated immersions of the stuff, a fine black, according to Lewis, has been obtained. In the above process, the proportion of sulphate of iron is too small, and the gum, according to some, being carried off in the washing, may be considered as useless. Berthollet thinks that, although the quantity be excessive, it has some effect in keeping up the bath, and he adds, if it is to be diminished, it would be useful to add the sulphate of iron in separate portions during each interval.\n\n344. To diminish the quantity of galls, which are an expensive ingredient in dyeing silk black, other substances have been proposed as substitutes. With this view the following process is recommended.\n\nThe silk being boiled and washed, is immersed in a strong decoction of green walnut peels, and allowed to remain till the colouring matter of both is exhausted. It is then to be slightly wrung out, dried and washed (m). To give the silk a blue ground, logwood and verdigris are employed, in the proportion of one ounce of the latter for every pound of silk. The verdigris is dissolved in cold water, and the silk is allowed to remain two hours in this solution. It is then immersed in a strong decoction of logwood, slightly wrung out, dried, and afterwards washed at the river. The bath is prepared by macerating two pounds of galls and three of fumach in 25 gallons of water, over a slow fire, for twelve hours. The liquid being strained, three pounds of sulphate of iron, and the same quantity of gum arabic, are to be dissolved in it. The silk is dipped in this solution at two different times; it is to remain in the bath two hours each time, and it must be aired and dried between each dip. After being twice beatled at the river, it is dipped a third time, and left in the bath four or five hours, after which it is to be dried, washed and beatled as before. The temperature of the bath should not exceed 120°. After the first dipping, it may be necessary to add half a pound of sulphate of iron, and an equal quantity of gum arabic.\n\n345. Silk which has been previously dyed blue with indigo, it is said, takes only a mealy black; but when it has been prepared with logwood and verdigris, it acquires a velvety lustre. A fine black may be obtained from green walnut peel; but the addition of logwood and verdigris renders a smaller quantity of sulphate of iron necessary, and this is of importance, because it is apt to weaken the silk. The only use of galls, according to some, is to increase the weight of the silk; for the purposes of dyeing, fumach is considered sufficient.\n\nIV. Of the Processes for Dyeing Cotton and Linen Black.\n\n246. It is more difficult to communicate a fine black stuff to linen or cotton than to silk or woollen stuffs. To previously succeed in producing a black colour of that degree of blue intensity which will resist soap, it is necessary to adopt particular processes. In dyeing animal matters black, as silk, and wool, the best colours are obtained on those which have been previously dyed blue. This also is an essential preliminary process in dyeing linen and cotton black; for it is found that the process which succeeds best, is first to give a deep blue grain to the cotton or linen.\n\n347. The first part of the process is the operation of Galling. The stuffs which have been previously dyed blue, wrung out and dried, are kept 24 hours in the gall-liquor, composed of four ounces of galls to every pound of thread. A bath is then prepared of a solution of iron in acetic acid. This solution is obtained by saturating the acid with oxide of iron. In France, vinegar, small beer, or small wine, is employed for this purpose. To promote the acid fermentation, rye meal, or some other substance, is added, and pieces of old iron are thrown into the liquid, which are allowed to remain for six weeks or two months, that the acid may be saturated with the iron. This solution, called iron liquor in this country, is prepared from fermented worts, to which old iron is added, as is described above. Five quarts of the iron-liquor for every pound of stuffs, dyeing, are put into a vessel. In this the stuffs are wrought with the hand, pound by pound, for 15 minutes: they are then wrung out and aired. This operation is to be again repeated, taking care to add a fresh quantity of the iron-liquor, which should be carefully scummed, after which the stuffs are to be wrung out, aired, and washed at the river. In the next operation, a pound of alder bark for every pound of stuff is boiled in a sufficient quantity of water for an hour. One half of the bath which was employed in the galling, and about one half the quantity of fumach as of alder bark, are then added. The whole is boiled together for two hours, and strained through a sieve. When this liquid is cold, the stuffs are immersed, wrought pound by pound, and occasionally aired. They are afterwards put into the bath, and after remaining for 24 hours, are wrung out and dried. The above is the process which, according to D'Apligny, is followed at Rouen, for dyeing cotton and linen.\n\n348. The process followed at Manchester, which is another described by Mr Wilton, is the following. For the process of operation of galling, galls or fumach are employed. The stuff is afterwards dyed in a bath consisting of a solution of iron in acetic acid. This bath is also frequently composed of alder bark and iron. After having passed through this bath, the stuff is dipped in a decoction of logwood, to which a small quantity of verdigris has been added. This process is to be repeated.\n\n(m) The decoction of walnut peels is prepared by boiling for 15 minutes, after which it is taken from the fire. After it has subsided, the silk, which has been previously immersed in warm water, is dipped in it.\nChap. I.\n\nOf Simple Colours.\n\nPreparation of solution of iron.\n\nAccording to Gubliehe, a solution of iron may be prepared by the following process. A pound of rice is to be boiled in 12 or 15 quarts of water, till the whole is dissolved. A sufficient quantity of old iron made red hot, to reach half way to the surface of the liquor, is thrown into the solution. The vessel in which the solution is kept must be under cover, but exposed to the air and light at least for a week. In another vessel, containing a quantity of warm vinegar equal to the solution of rice, an equal quantity of red-hot iron is to be put. This vessel must also be exposed in the same way to the air and light. After several days, the contents of both vessels are mixed together, and the mixture is to be exposed for a week to the open air, after which it is to be decanted and kept for use in a clothe vessel. To give a sufficient black to linen and cotton, it is only necessary, it is said, to steep them 24 hours in this solution; and if it should appear that the liquor is exhausted of colouring matter, a fresh portion is to be employed. In this way a fine permanent black is obtained. According to the same author, this solution may be advantageously employed as a substitute for sulphate of iron, in dyeing silk and wool. But to give them a fine black, silk and woollen stuffs must be dipped in a decoction of logwood after they are taken from the bath.\n\nSect. V. Of Brown.\n\n350. The last of the simple colours is brown. This is also known under the name of fawn colour, (fauve, Fr.) It is that brown colour which has a shade of yellow, and might perhaps be considered as a compound colour, although it is communicated to flax by one process.\n\nI. Of the Substances employed in Dyeing Brown.\n\n351. The vegetable substances which are capable of inducing a fawn or brown colour on different stuffs, are very numerous, but those chiefly employed for this purpose are walnut peels and sumach. The peels constitute the green covering of the nut; they are internally of a white colour, which is converted into brown or black by exposure to the air. The skin when impregnated with the juice of walnut peels, becomes of a brown or almost black colour. When the inner part of the peel, taken fresh, is put into weak oxymuriatic acid, it affumes a brown colour. If the decoction of walnut peels be filtered and exposed to the air, its colour becomes of a deep brown; the pellicles on evaporation are almost black; the liquor detached from these yields a brown extract completely soluble in water. The colouring particles are precipitated from a decoction of walnut peels, by means of alcohol, and they are soluble in water. No apparent change is at first produced by a solution of potash; but it gradually becomes turbid, and the colour is deepened. A copious precipitate of a fawn colour, approaching to an ash colour, is produced in a decoction of walnut peels by means of a solution of tin, and the remaining liquor has a slightly yellow tinge.\n\n352. A decoction of walnut peels yields a small quantity of fawn-coloured precipitate by means of a solution of alum, and the liquor remains of the same colour. Sulphate of copper renders it slowly turbid, and throws down a small quantity of precipitate of a brownish green colour, leaving the supernatant liquor of the same colour. Sulphate of iron deepens the colour; when diluted, the colour becomes brownish green, without the deposition of any sediment. Sulphate of zinc also deepens the colour, and produces no precipitate. The same properties are exhibited by a decoction of the walnut-tree wood, but the colouring matter is not obtained from it in such abundance as from the peels; and the bark may also be used with advantage in dyeing.\n\n353. The affinity of the colouring matter of walnut peels for wool is very strong; and it readily imparts to it a durable colour, which even mordants do not seem capable of increasing, but they are generally understood to give it additional brightness. A lively and very rich colour is obtained with the assistance of alum. Walnut peels afford a great variety of pleasing shades, and as they require not the intervention of mordants, the softness of the wool is preserved, and the process of dyeing becomes both cheap and simple.\n\n354. Walnut peels are not gathered till the nuts are completely ripe, when they are put into large casks, along with as much water as is sufficient to cover them. When used in dyeing at the Gobelins in Paris, Berthollet informs us, they are kept for upwards of a year, and very extensively used; but if not made use of till the end of two years, they yield a greater quantity of colouring matter, at which time their odour has become peculiarly disagreeable and fetid. The peels separated from the nuts before they arrive at maturity, may likewise be used in dyeing, but in this state they do not keep so long.\n\n355. Sumach (rhus coriaria, Linn.) is a shrub produced naturally in Palestine, Syria, Portugal, and Spain, being carefully cultivated in the two last of these countries. Its shoots are annually cut down, dried, and reduced to powder in a mill, by which process they are prepared for the purposes of dyeing.\n\n356. The infusion of sumach, which is of a fawn colour with a greenish tinge, is changed into a brown by exposure to the air. A solution of potash has little action on the recent infusion of sumach; its colour is changed to yellow by the action of acids; the liquor becomes turbid by means of alum, a small quantity of precipitate being at the same time formed, and the supernatant liquor remaining yellow. A copious precipitate of a yellowish green colour is thrown down by sulphate of copper, and the liquor remains clear. No change is speedily produced by muriate of soda (common salt), but it becomes rather turbid at the end of some hours, and its colour is rather clearer. Sulphate of copper produces a copious precipitate of a yellowish green, which after standing some hours, changes to a brownish green; the supernatant liquor, which is slightly yellow, remains clear. Sulphate of zinc renders the liquor turbid, darkens its colour, and produces a deep blue precipitate; but when the sulphate of zinc is pure, the precipitate, which is of a brownish fawn colour, is in very small quantity. Acetate of lead gives a copious precipitate, of a yellowish colour; the supernatant liquor is of a clear yellow colour. No astringent has so strong a resemblance to galls as sumach; but the precipitate...\nDYEING\n\nOf Simple precipitate thrown down from an infusion of it by a solution of iron, is not so copious as that which is yielded by an equal quantity of galls, on which account fumach may be generally employed as a substitute for galls, only its quantity will require to be increased.\n\n357. The bark of the birch-tree (Betula alba, Lin.) yields a decoction of a clear fawn colour, but it soon becomes turbid and brown. The addition of a solution of alum in the open air, produces a copious yellow precipitate; a solution of tin gives also a copious precipitate of a clear yellow colour. With solutions of iron the decoction of the birch-tree strikes a black colour, and it dissolves in considerable quantity the oxide of iron, but in smaller proportion than the decoction of walnut peels. On account of this property it is employed in the preparation of black vats for dyeing thread.\n\n358. Saunders, or fandal wood, is also employed for the purpose of giving a fawn colour. There are three kinds of fandal wood, the white, the yellow, and the red. The last only, which is a compact heavy wood, brought from the Coromandel coast, is used in dyeing. By exposure to the air it becomes of a brown colour; when employed in dyeing, it is reduced to fine powder, and it yields a fawn colour with a brownish shade, inclining to red. But the colouring matter which it yields of itself is in small quantity, and it is said that it gives hardness to woollen stuffs. When it is mixed with other substances, as fumach, walnut peels, or galls, the quantity of colouring matter is increased; it gives a more durable colour, and produces considerable modifications in the colouring matter with which it is mixed. Sandal wood yields its colouring matter to brandy, or diluted alcohol, more readily than to water.\n\n359. Soot communicates to woollen stuffs a fawn or brown colour, of a lighter or deeper shade, in proportion to the quantity employed; but the colour is fading, and its affinity for wool is not great; and besides leaving a disagreeable smell, it renders the fibres harsh. In some manufactories, it is employed for browning certain colours, and it produces shades which could not otherwise be easily obtained.\n\nII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Woollen, &c. a Fawn or Brown Colour.\n\n360. In dyeing with walnut peels, a quantity proportioned to the quantity of stuff, and the intensity of shade wanted, is boiled for fifteen minutes in a copper. All that is necessary in dyeing with this substance is, to moisten the cloth or yarn with warm water, previous to their immersion in the copper, in which they are to be carefully stirred till they have acquired the proper shade. This is the process, if the aluminoous mordant is not employed. In dyeing cloth, it is usual to give the deepest shades first, and the lighter ones afterwards; but in dyeing woollen yarn, the light shades are given first, and the deeper ones afterwards. An additional quantity of peels is joined to each parcel.\n\n361. Berthollet made a number of experiments to ascertain the difference of colour obtained from the simple decoction of walnut peels, and the addition of metallic oxides as mordants. The oxide of tin, he found, yielded a clearer and brighter fawn colour than that of the simple decoction. The oxide of zinc produced a still clearer colour, inclining to ash or gray. Compound colours from oxide of lead had an orange cast, while that from oxide of iron was of a greenish brown.\n\n362. A fawn colour, which has a shade of green, is obtained from fumach alone; but to cotton stuffs dyeing which have been impregnated with printers mordant, with fumach communicates a good wash and durable yellow. Here, however, some precaution is necessary in the use of this substance for this purpose; for as the colouring matter is of so fixed a nature, the ground of the stuff cannot be bleached by exposure on the grats. This inconvenience is avoided by impregnating the whole of the stuff with different mordants, producing in this way a variety of colours, and leaving no part white.\n\n363. Vogler employed the tincture of saunders wood with fandal for dyeing patterns of wool, silk, cotton, and linen, wood, having previously impregnated them with a solution of tin, and afterwards washing and drying them. Sometimes he used the solution unmixed, and at other times added fix or ten parts of water, and in whatever way he employed it, he obtained a poppy colour. When the mordant employed was solution of alum, the colour was a rich scarlet; with sulphate of copper it was a clear crimson, and with sulphate of iron a beautiful deep violet.\n\nCHAP. II. Of Compound Colours.\n\n364. A mixture of two colouring substances, it is Nature of well known, produces a very different shade from that compound of either of the uncombined colouring matters; hence colours, compound colours are obtained, which are merely mixtures of simple colours. It would undoubtedly be a desirable thing to ascertain with accuracy the peculiar shade produced by the combination of two colouring matters; but these results can only be certainly known by experiment, because by the action of different substances in the baths, they are subject to great variations in their effects, according to the affinities which are brought into action, and the new combinations which are formed. What is natural to colouring particles is not to be considered as a constituent part of compound colours, but only the difference of shade which they ought to assume, with a particular mordant, or in a particular bath. The effects, therefore, of the chemical agents employed in these processes, and the result of different combinations, ought to be particularly attended to. It is in dyeing compound colours that skill and ingenuity are most conspicuous, and their application of greatest utility, to enable the dyer to vary his processes, according to the shade desired, and at the same time to accomplish his operations by the shortest and cheapest means.\n\n365. As compound colours are obtained by the mixture of simple colours, very different shades will be obtained from different proportions of the simple colours; hence compound colours exhibit an indefinite variety of shade, and the processes by which they are produced are very numerous. It would extend this treatise to an unusual length, were we to attempt to describe every variety of shade which is obtained from the mixture of simple colours. We shall therefore limit our observations to some of the principal compound colours, and an\nCompounds an account of the processes by which they are obtained, leaving it to our readers, who have made themselves familiar with the principles already detailed, to vary these colours, by employing different proportions and different combinations of simple colouring matters.\n\n366. Compound colours have been usually divided into four classes, namely, green, purple, orange, and gray or drab colour. These are obtained from mixtures of the following simple colours.\n\n1. Blue and yellow produce a green.\n2. Red and blue, a purple, &c.\n3. Red and yellow, orange.\n4. Black and other colours, gray, &c.\n\nThe following sections will be occupied in a short detail of the methods which are usually employed in producing these different compound colours.\n\nSect. I. Of the Mixture of Blue and Yellow, or Green.\n\n367. Green colours, from the great variety of shades which they exhibit, have been long known by different names, by which the intensity of shade is characterized, such as sea-green, apple-green, meadow or grass green, pea-green, parrot-green, &c. Many plants afford a green colour, such as brome grass (Bromus secalinus, Lin.), green berries of Rhamnus frangula, wild chervil (Cheerophyllum fylvetra, Lin.), purple clover (Trifolium pratense), common reed (Orinus phragmites). These colours, however, do not possess sufficient permanency. According to D'Ambourney, indeed, a permanent green may be obtained from the fermented juice of the berries of the berry-bearing alder (Rhamnus frangula). Having previously prepared the cloth with tartar, solution of nitrate of alum and common salt, he added to the fermented juice of the berries, after it was warmed, a small proportion of acetate of lead; and in this bath he communicated to the cloth an intermediate shade between parrot and grass green. But it is usually from the mixture of blue and yellow that green is obtained; and it may be observed, that it requires much skill and experience, especially in giving light shades, to produce a colour which is uniform, and entirely without spots.\n\nI. Of the Processes for Dyeing Woollen Stuffs Green.\n\n368. To dye woollen green, either the yellow or the blue dye may be given to it first. But when the stuff is first dyed yellow, and in this state is introduced into the blue vat, part of the yellow colouring matter being dissolved in the vat, communicates to it a green colour, which renders it unfit for dyeing any other colour than green. To avoid this inconvenience, therefore, the blue colour is first given, and afterwards the yellow. It would be quite unnecessary to resume the account of any part of the processes for dyeing blue, which have been already detailed. It is proper, however, to add, that the intensity of the blue shade must be proportioned to the green, or to the depth of the green colour which is wished to be obtained. Thus, for instance, to produce a parrot green, a ground of sky blue is given, and for the green like that of a drake's neck, a deep blue is required. When the blue dye has been communicated, the yellow is afterwards given, according to some of the processes which have been already described for dyeing yellow. The proper ground being communicated to the cloths, they are washed in the fulling mill, and boiled as for the common process of welding; but when the shade is light, the proportion of faults should be less. Cloths which are to receive light shades are first boiled, and when they are taken out, tartar and alum are added in fresh portions, till the cloths which are intended for the darkest shades are boiled. The process of welding is conducted in the same way as for dyeing yellow, with this difference, that a larger proportion of weld is employed, excepting for lighter shades, when the proportion must be smaller. In dyeing green, it is usual to have a succession of shades at the same time; the process is begun with the deepest, and ends with the lightest. Between each dip there should be an interval of one-half or three-quarters of an hour, and at each interval water is added to the bath. It is the practice of some dyers to give each parcel two dips, beginning the first time with the deep shades, and the second with the lighter ones; but when this practice is followed, the time of immersion should be shortened. In dyeing very light shades, the bath should never be permitted to reach the boiling temperature. For deep greens, a browning is given with logwood, and a small proportion of sulphate of iron.\n\n369. For some kinds of green, sulphate of indigo is Saxon employed; and in this case either the blue and yellow green are dyed separately, or the whole of the ingredients are mixed together in the bath, and the whole process is finished at a single operation. The colour thus obtained has been distinguished by the name of Saxon green. The following is the process recommended by Dr Bancroft.\n\n370. \"The most beautiful Saxon greens (says he) may be produced very cheaply and expeditiously, by combining the lively yellow which results from quercitron bark, muriato-sulphate of tin, and alum, with the blue afforded by indigo when dissolved in sulphuric acid, as for dyeing the Saxon blue.\n\n\"To produce this combination most advantageously, the dyer, for a full-bodied green, should put into the dyeing vessel after the rate of six or eight pounds of powdered bark, in a bag, for every 100 lb. weight of cloth, with only a small proportion of water as soon as it begins to grow warm; and when it begins to boil, he should add about six pounds of muriato-sulphate of tin (with the usual precautions), and a few minutes after, about four pounds of alum; these having boiled together five or six minutes, cold water should be added, and the fire diminished so as to bring the heat of the liquor nearly down to what the hand is able to bear; and immediately after this, as much sulphate of indigo is to be added as will suffice to produce the shade of green intended to be dyed, taking care to mix it thoroughly with the first solution by stirring, &c.; and this being done, the cloth previously scoured and moistened, should be expeditiously put into the liquor, and turned very briskly through it for a quarter of an hour, in order that the colour may apply itself equally to every part, which it will certainly do in this way with proper care. By these means, very full, even, and beautiful greens may generally be dyed in half an hour; and during this space, it is best to keep the liquor at rather less than a boiling heat. Muriato-sulphate of\nCompound of tin is infinitely preferable, for this use, to the dyer's spirit; because the latter consists chiefly of nitric acid, which by its highly injurious action upon indigo, would render that part of the green colour very fugitive, as I have found by repeated trials. But no such effect can result from the muriatic acid of tin, since the muriatic acid has no action upon indigo; and the sulphuric acid is that very acid which alone is proper to dissolve it for this use.\n\nRespecting the beauty of the colour thus produced, those who are acquainted with the unequalled lustre and brightness of the quercitron yellows, dyed with the tin balsam, must necessarily conclude, that the greens composed therewith will prove infinitely superior to any which can result from the dull muddy yellow of old fustic; and in point of expense, it is certain that the bark, muriatic acid of tin, and alum necessary to dye a given quantity of cloth in this way, will cost less than the much greater quantity (six or eight times more) of fustic, with the alum necessary for dyeing it in the common way, the sulphate of indigo being the same in both cases. But in dyeing with the bark, the vessel is only to be filled and heated once; and the cloth, without any previous preparation, may be completely dyed in half an hour; whilst in the common way of producing Saxon greens, the copper is to be twice filled; and to this must be joined the fuel and labour of an hour and a half's boiling and turning the cloth, in the course of preparation, besides nearly as much boiling in another vessel to extract the colour of the fustic; and after all the dyeing process remains to be performed, which will be equal in time and trouble to the whole of the process for producing a Saxon green with the bark; so that this colour obtained from bark will not only prove superior in beauty, but in cheapness, to that dyed as usual with old fustic.*\n\nII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Silk Green.\n\n371. In giving silk a green colour, greater precaution is necessary, to preserve uniformity of colour, and to prevent spots and stripes. Silk which is intended to receive a green colour, is scoured in the same way as for other colours; but for light shades, the scouring must be as complete as for blue. Silk which is to be dyed green, is first dyed yellow, and being well alummed, it is slightly washed at the river, and divided into small parcels, that it may receive the colouring matter uniformly, and then carefully turned in the weld bath. When the ground is supposed to have acquired a sufficient degree of intensity, a pattern is put into the blue vat, to ascertain the proper shade. When this is the case, the silk is taken out of the bath, washed, and immersed in the blue vat. To produce a deeper colour, and at the same time to give variety of shade, a decoction of logwood, fustic, or annatto, is added to the yellow bath, after the weld has been taken out. For very light shades, such as apple and sea green, it is scarcely necessary to add, that a weaker ground is to be given. For all light shades except sea green, the process is found to succeed better when the yellow is communicated by baths which have been already used; but these baths should not contain any logwood or fustic.\n\n372. Saxon green is produced by means of sulphate of indigo. This is a brighter, but less durable colour than the former. This process is conducted by boiling as for welding, after which the cloth is washed. Fus- fusic in chips is enclosed in a bag, put into the same bath, and boiled for an hour and a half; when it is taken out, and the bath allowed to cool till the hand can bear it. A pound and a quarter of sulphate of indigo for each piece of cloth of eighteen yards, is added. The cloth is at first to be turned quickly, and afterwards more slowly, and it should be taken out before the bath boils. Some dyers put in only two-thirds of the solution at first; and after two or three turns, take out the cloth, and add the other one-third. By this means the colour is more uniform.\n\n373. To produce Saxon green at one operation, the following process is recommended by Dr Bancroft. A ration bath is prepared of four pounds of quercitron bark, three pounds of alum, and two pounds of muriatic acid, with a sufficient quantity of water. The bath is boiled ten or fifteen minutes, and when the liquor is so far reduced in temperature as the hand can bear it, it is fit for dyeing. By adding different proportions of sulphate of indigo, various and beautiful shades of green may be obtained, and the colour thus produced is both cheap and uniform. Care should be taken to keep the bath constantly stirred, to prevent the colouring matter from subsiding. Those shades which are intended to incline most to the yellow, should be dyed first; and by adding sulphate of indigo, the green, having a shade of blue, may be obtained. This process, Dr Bancroft observes, is the most commodious and certain for dyeing the most beautiful Saxon greens upon silk†.\n\n374. To produce English green, which is more beautiful than common green, and is said to be more durable than the Saxon green, Guhlke gives the following process. He first dyes the silk of a light-blue in the cold vat already described (316.), then soaks it in warm water, washes it in a stream, and dips it in a weak solution of alum. He then prepares a bath of sulphate of indigo, one ounce of solution of tin, with the tincture of French berries made with aceto-citric acid. The silk is kept in this bath till it has obtained the desired colour. It is then washed and dried in a shady place. Lighter shades may be dyed afterwards‡.\n\nIII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Cotton and Linen Green.\n\n375. Cotton and linen, after being scoured in the usual way, are first dyed blue; and after being cleaned, given they are dipped in the weld bath, to produce a green colour. The strength of the blue and yellow is proportioned to the shade of green which is wanted. But as it is difficult to give to cotton velvet an uniform colour in the blue vat, it is first dyed yellow with turmeric, and the process is completed by giving it a green with sulphate of indigo. The same result, however, will be obtained by commencing the process either with the yellow or the blue.\n\n376. The process which D'Apligny describes for dyeing cotton velvet, or cotton thread a sea or apple-cotton velvet green in one bath is the following. A quantity of verdigris is dissolved in vinegar, and the mixture is kept excluded from the air in the heat of a stove for fifteen days. A quantity of potash equal in weight to the verdigris employed is dissolved in water, and four hours...\nCompounds hours before dyeing it is added to the solution of verdigris. This mixture is to be kept hot. One ounce of alum in five quarts of water for each pound of stuff being prepared, the cotton thread or velvet is soaked in this solution. It is then taken out, and the verdigris mixture being added to the solution of alum, it is again introduced to be dyed.\n\n377. The different shades of olive green, and drake's neck green, are given to thread after it has received a blue ground, by galling it, and dipping it in a weaker or stronger bath of iron liquor, then in the weld bath, to which verdigris has been added, and afterwards in the bath with sulphate of copper. The colour is lastly to be brightened with soap.\n\n378. Cotton dyed with Prussian blue may be dyed green by previously aluming while it is still wet with the blue, and then dipping in a weld bath, the strength of which is proportioned to the shade required. The colour from weld is more lively than that obtained from fustic. But fustic which gives a deeper shade than weld, and diminishes the brightness of the blue, is to be preferred when a green with an olive shade is wanted.\n\n379. The shade of green given to any stuff, it is obvious, must vary according to the intensity of the blue shade, the strength of the yellow bath, and the nature of the yellow colouring matter employed. Yellow colours are rendered more intense by means of alkalies, sulphate of lime and ammoniacal salts; but become fainter by means of acids, alum, and solutions of tin. In dyeing Saxon green the result will be different according to the process which is followed. The effects will be different by adding a yellow to a Saxon blue, from the process in which the sulphate of indigo is mixed with the yellow ingredients; because in the latter case the sulphuric acid has a considerable action on the colouring matter, and thus diminishes the intensity of the yellow. As the particles of indigo have a stronger affinity for the stuff than the yellow colouring matter, in dyeing a succession of shades in a bath in which both are mixed, the bath being first exhausted of the indigo, the last shades incline more to the yellow on account of the predominance of the yellow colouring matter.\n\nSect. II. Of the Mixture of Red and Blue, or Purple, &c.\n\n380. By the mixture of red and blue, violet, purple, dove-colour, lilac, and a great variety of other shades, according to the proportions of the substances employed, or the predominance of the blue or the red, are produced. In stuffs which are to be dyed violet, a deeper blue must be given, but for purple colours, the ground requires to be of a lighter blue; but in lilac and similar light colours, it is necessary that both the blue and the red have a light shade.\n\nI. Of Dyeing Wool Violet, Purple, &c.\n\n381. In the attempts which have been made to communicate a violet or purple colour to a scarlet ground, according to the observations of Hellot, the colour is very unequal. It becomes therefore necessary to give the blue colour first; and for violets and purples, the shade of blue ought not to be deeper than that of sky blue. The stuff being dyed blue, is boiled with alum, and two fifths of tartar, and is afterwards dipped in a bath composed of nearly two thirds the quantity of cochineal required for scarlet, with the addition of tartar. The same process, indeed, as for dyeing scarlet, is followed. It is a common practice to dye these colours after the reddening for scarlet, making such additions of cochineal and tartar as the intensity of the shade may require.\n\n382. For lighter shades, as lilacs, dove-colours, &c., the stuff may be dipped in the bath which has served for violet and purple, and is now somewhat exhausted, taking care to add a quantity of alum and tartar. For reddish shades, such as peach blossom, a small proportion of solution of tin is added. It may be observed, in general, that although the proportion of cochineal is less in dyeing lighter shades, the quantity of tartar must not be diminished.\n\n383. To obtain the same colours, a shorter and less expensive process is recommended by Poerner. In this shorter process he employs sulphate of indigo. He boils the process stuff in a solution of alum, in the proportion of three ounces of the latter to one pound of the former, for an hour and a half, and afterwards allows it to remain in the liquid for a night after it has cooled. The dyeing bath is prepared with an ounce and a half of cochineal, and two ounces of tartar, which are boiled for three quarters of an hour: two ounces and a half of sulphate of indigo are then added, the whole is stirred, and boiled gently for fifteen minutes. The dyeing operation is conducted in the usual way, and a beautiful violet is thus obtained. To have all the variety of shades which are produced by the mixture of red and blue, the proportion of the sulphate of indigo is increased or diminished. It is sometimes increased to five ounces, and diminished to five drachms, for each pound of stuff. The quantity of cochineal is also varied, but when it is less than an ounce, the colour is dull. Different proportions of tartar are also employed. To produce variety of shades, the stuff is also prepared with different proportions of solution of tin.\n\n384. To communicate a purple colour to wool, as Purple from well as some other shades, logwood, with the addition logwood of galls, has been employed. The stuff is previously dyed blue, and to give a brown shade, sulphate of iron is used; but the colours thus obtained are not permanent. By the following process, described by Decroizille, a durable dye is produced, by means of this wood. He dissolved tin in sulphuric acid, to which were added common salt, red acidulous tartarite of potash, and sulphate of copper; or it may be more conveniently done by making a solution of tin in a mixture of sulphuric acid, common salt, and water, to which are to be added the tartarite and sulphate in the state of powder. Of this mordant not less than 1500 quarts were made in twenty four hours, in a leaden vessel to which a moderate heat was applied. A very lucrative trade was carried on for three years by Decroizille, who sold it at the rate of 1s. 3d. sterling per pound.\n\n385. If wool in the fleece is to be dyed, it will require a third of its weight of this mordant, while a fifth is a proportion sufficient for stuffs. A bath is prepared of such a degree of temperature as the hand can bear, with which the mordant is properly mixed, and the wool or stuff dipped in it and stirred, the same degree\nCompound of temperature being kept up for two hours, and increased a little towards the end; after which it is taken out, aired, and well washed. A fresh bath of pure water is prepared at the same temperature, to which is added a sufficient quantity of the decoction of logwood; the stuff is then immersed, stirred, and the heat increased to the boiling temperature, which is to be continued for 15 minutes, after which the stuff being taken out, aired, and carefully rinsed, the process of dyeing is completed. If for every three pounds of wool, one pound of a decoction of logwood has been used, and a proportionate quantity for stuffs which require less, a fine violet colour is produced, to which a sufficient quantity of brazil-wood imparts the shade known in France by the name of prune de Monfeur.\n\n386. Logwood and brazil, fustic and yellow wood, are colouring substances which may be fixed with advantage upon wool by means of this mordant. The colour communicated by the two first of these is liable to be changed in the fulling by the action of the soap or urine employed for that purpose; but this change, which is always produced by alkaline substances, is remedied by a slightly acid bath a little hot, called brightening, for which the sulphuric acid has the preference. The colour becomes as deep, and frequently much brighter than before the change. Wools which have been dyed by means of this mordant, are said to admit of being spun into a finer and more beautiful thread, than by the use of alum. If the use of sulphate of copper is omitted, more beautiful colours are produced by fustic and yellow wood, as well as by weld. An orange red colour is communicated by madder, but not so deep as with a similar quantity of alum. When sulphate of copper is omitted, the wool is said to become much harsher, and the mordant thus prepared yields but indifferent colours with logwood, and in particular with brazil-wood. The use and carriage of this mordant are inconvenient, on account of the heavy sediment by which the vessel is half filled under a corrosive liquor, capable only of being kept in stone ware. These inconveniences may be remedied by the omission of the water in the receipt, which leaves only a part more conveniently used, and the carriage of it two-fifths cheaper.\n\n387. The above process is thus explained by Berthollet. The decomposition of the muriate of soda is effected by the action of the sulphuric acid, and the muriatic acid being thus disengaged, dissolves the tin, part of which is precipitated by means of the tartaric acid, producing the sediment already mentioned. The oxide of copper produces the blue with the colouring particles of the logwood; the violet is formed by the oxide of tin with the same wood, and the red, with the colouring matter of the brazil-wood. The same ingenious chemist farther observes, that as an excess of acid is retained in the liquor, it might probably be of advantage to employ acetate as a substitute for sulphate of copper, in which case the action of the free acid would be moderated. He thinks it would still be more advisable to make use of verdigris; because the uncombined part of the oxide of copper would, in that case, unite with the excess of acid, on which account a smaller quantity of acid would remain in the liquor; and probably the quantity of tartar might be diminished, as a smaller quantity of tin would thus be precipitated.\n\nII. Of Dyeing Silk Violet or Purple.\n\n388. Silk is capable of receiving two kinds of violet colours, denominated the fine and the false, the latter of which is produced by means of archil or brazilwood. When the fine violet colour is required, the silk must first be paffed through cochineal, and dipped afterwards in the vat. The preparation and dyeing of the silk with cochineal are the same as for crimson, with the omission of tartar and solution of tin, by means of which the colour is heightened. The quantity of cochineal made use of is always proportioned to the required shade, whether it is more or less intense; but the usual proportion for a fine violet colour is two ounces of cochineal for each pound of silk. When the silk is dyed, it is washed at the river, twice beetleed, dipped in a vat more or less strong, in proportion to the depth of the violet shade, and then washed and dried with precautions similar to those which all colours require that are dyed in the vat. If the violet is to have greater strength and beauty, it is usual to pass it through the archil bath, a practice which, though frequently abused, is not to be dispensed with for light shades, which would otherwise be too dull.\n\n389. When silk has been dyed with cochineal according to the above directions, only a very light shade is requisite for purple; the shades which are deepest are dipped in a weak vat, while dipping them in cold water is sufficient for such as are lighter, the water having been incorporated with a small quantity of the liquor of the vat, because in the vat itself, however weak it might be, they would acquire too deep a tinge of blue. In this manner are the light shades of this colour, such as gilly-flower, peach blossom, &c., produced by diminishing the quantity of cochineal.\n\n390. There are various ways of imparting to silk whatever are denominated the false violets; but those let, which are most frequently used, and polished of greatest beauty, are prepared with archil, the bath of which is, in point of strength, to be suited to the colour required. Having been beetleed at the river after scouring, the silk is turned in the bath on the skein sticks; and when the colour is deemed sufficiently deep, a pattern is tried in the vat, to ascertain whether it takes the violet colour intended to be produced. If the shade is found to have acquired the proper depth, the silk is beetleed at the river and dipped in the vat, in the same way as for the fine violet colours; and let either of the blue or of the archil colour is given, according as it is meant that the red or blue shade of the violet colour should predominate.\n\n391. The process recommended by Guhlche for communicating a violet colour to silk is the following. A pound of silk is to be soaked in a bath of two ounces of alum, and a like quantity of solution of tin, after having carefully poured off the sediment formed in the mixture. The dye-bath is prepared with two ounces of cochineal reduced to powder with a dram of tartar, and the remaining part of the bath which has answered the purpose of a mordant, with the addition of a sufficient quantity of water. When slightly boiled, such a quantity of solution of indigo is added as may communicate\ncate to the bath a proper shade of violet; after which the silk is immersed, and boiled till it has acquired the intended shade. It is then wrung, washed in a stream, and like every other delicate colour, must be dried in the shade. The light shades exhaust the bath. But it ought to be observed, that this colour, which is said to be a beautiful violet, possesses little durability, and is apt to assume a reddish tinge, owing to the colour of the indigo fading first.\n\n392. A violet colour may be imparted to silks, by immersing them in water impregnated with verdigrise, as a substitute for aluming, and next giving them a bath of logwood, in which they assume a blue colour, which is converted to a violet, either by the addition of alum to the bath, or by dipping them in a weaker or stronger solution of that substance, which communicates a red colour to the particles of logwood. This violet possesses but a small degree of beauty, and little durability. But if alumed silk be immersed in a bath of brafil-wood, and next in a bath of archil, after washing it at the river, a colour is obtained possessing a much higher degree of beauty and intensity. The process described above (385.), for dyeing wool, succeeds equally well, according to M. Decroizille, in communicating to silk a violet colour.\n\nIII. Of Dyeing Cotton and Linen Violet.\n\n393. The most ordinary mode by which a violet colour is communicated to cotton and linen stuffs, is first to give them a blue ground in the vat, proportioned to the required shade, and to dry them. They are afterwards galled, in the proportion of three ounces of galls to a pound of stuff, and being left in this bath for 12 or 15 hours, are wrung out and dried again. They are next passed through a decoction of logwood, and when thoroughly soaked and taken out, the bath receives an addition of two drams of alum, and one of dissolved verdigrise for each pound of cotton or thread. The skeins are then dipped again on the skein sticks, and turned for about 5 minutes, when they are taken out and aired. They are next immersed in the bath for 15 minutes, taken out and wrung. To complete the process, the vat employed is emptied; half of the decoction of logwood not formerly made use of is now poured in, with the addition of two drams of alum, and the thread is again dipped in it till it has acquired the shade proposed, which must always regulate the strength or weakness of the decoction of logwood. This colour resists in a considerable degree the action of the air, but in point of permanency is much inferior to that which is obtained from the use of madder.\n\nSect. III. Of the Mixture of Yellow and Red, or Orange.\n\n394. Orange is the usual result of a composition of yellow and red colours, but an almost endless variety of shades may be produced, according as we vary the proportion of the ingredients, and the particular nature of the yellow used. It is sometimes the practice of dyers to combine blue with yellow and red, the result of which is the colour denominated olive. Many varieties may be obtained from the use of weld, saw-wort, dyers-weed, and other yellows, and by employing tartar, alum, sulphate of zinc, or sulphate of copper in the bath, or in the preparation of the Compound Colours.\n\nI. Of Dyeing Wool Orange.\n\n395. By a process exactly the same as that which is followed in communicating to stuffs a scarlet colour, an orange may be given to wool; but the quantity of red must be diminished, and that of the yellow increased. If wool is dyed a red colour by means of madder, and afterwards yellow with weld, the resulting compound is a cinnamon colour, and the most proper mordant in this case is a mixture of alum and tartar. The shades may be varied at pleasure by substituting other yellow dye stuffs instead of weld, and by varying the proportions as circumstances may require. Wool may receive a reddish yellow colour by passing it through a madder bath, after it has undergone the usual process for yellow, which has already been described. The strength of the madder bath is always to be proportioned to the shade required. Brafil-wood is sometimes employed with yellow substances, or mixed with cochineal and madder. Snuff, chestnut, mulk, and other shades are produced, by substituting walnut-tree root, walnut peels or sumach, for weld.\n\nII. Of Dyeing Silk, Orange, &c.\n\n396. Logwood, brafil-wood, and fustic, communicate to silk a maroon and cinnamon colour, together &c., with all the intermediate shades. The silk is scoured in the usual manner, alumed, and a bath is prepared, by mixing together decoctions of the three different woods mentioned above, made separately, varying the quantity of each according to the shade intended to be given; but the proportion of fustic should be greatest. The silk is turned in the bath on the skein sticks, and when it is taken out, if the colour be uniform, it is wrung and again dipped in a second bath of these three ingredients, according to the effect produced by the first, in order to obtain the shade required.\n\n397. The blue vat is not made use of, when an olive colour is to be communicated to silk. After being alumed, it is dipped in a bath of weld, which is made very strong. To this is afterwards added the juice of logwood, with a small quantity of solution of alkali when the silk is dipped. This converts it into green, and gives the olive colour. It is dipped again in this bath till it has acquired the shade wanted.\n\n398. To communicate to it the colour known by the name of rotten olive, fustic and logwood are added to the bath after welding, without any alkali. If the colour wanted is to incline more to a red, the addition of logwood alone is sufficient. A sort of reddish olive may likewise be obtained, by dyeing the silk in a fustic bath, to which a greater or lesser quantity has been added of sulphate of iron and logwood.\n\nIII. Of Dyeing Cotton and Linen Orange, &c.\n\n399. A cinnamon colour is communicated to thread cinnamon and cotton, by commencing the process for dyeing colour, them with verdigrise and weld; they are afterwards to be dipped in a solution of sulphate of iron, denominated by the French bain d'affaiblissement, and then wrung out and dried. As soon as they are dried, they are galled in\nCompound the proportion of three ounces to the pound of stuff; then dried again, alumed as for red colours, and maddered. After being washed and dried, they are put into hot soap-flids, and turned till they have acquired a sufficient degree of brightness. It is the practice of some dyers to add to the aluming a decoction of fustic.\n\n400. By boiling four parts of weld and one of potash in a sufficient quantity of water, M. d'Apligny informs us, a fine olive colour is communicated to cotton and thread. Brazil wood which has been steeped for a night, is boiled separately with a small quantity of verdigris, and these solutions are mixed together in various proportions, according to the particular shade required. The thread or cotton is dipped in the compound solution in the usual way.\n\nSect. IV. Of the Mixture of Black with other Colours.\n\nThe compound colours which are obtained from the mixture of black and other colours, are brown, gray, drab, &c., according to the nature and proportions of the simple colours employed.\n\nI. Of Dyeing Woollen Stuffs Brown, Gray, &c.\n\n401. To give a browning to cloth, as soon as it has been dyed, it is dipped in a solution of sulphate of iron, with the addition of an astringent, which makes a black bath. It is more common to mix a small quantity of solution of iron with a bath of water, adding more till the dyed stuff dipped in it has received the intended shade. Sulphate of iron is sometimes added to the dye bath; but by dipping the dyed stuff in a solution of this salt, the end is more easily attained. It is the usual practice of M. Poerner to soak the stuff in a solution of sulphate of iron, to which other ingredients are sometimes added, and after having taken it out of the mordant, it is dipped in the dye bath.\n\n402. In order to obtain coffee and damascene colours, with other shades of browns of the common dye, the first method is adopted; a colour more or less deep is communicated to them, according to the shade intended to be obtained by the browning; and a bath is made of galls, fumach, and alder bark, with the addition of sulphate of iron. Those stuffs are first dipped to which the lightest shades are to be communicated, and when these are finished, the browner ones are dipped; a quantity of sulphate of iron being added for each operation, proportioned to the effect intended to be produced.\n\n403. Blueish grays are communicated to stuffs, according to Poerner, by the solution of indigo in sulphuric acid, combined with a mixture of decoction of galls and sulphate of iron, varying the shades according to the different quantities of these ingredients made use of. If to a bath composed of cochineal, fustic and galls, sulphate of iron be added, other shades are obtained.\n\n404. For marone, and such other colours as bear a strong resemblance to it, saunders and galls are employed, and sometimes a browning, with the addition of logwood. If dyed in the remains of a cochineal bath, these colours may be made to incline to a crimson or purple, and the same effect is produced by adding a small quantity of madder or cochineal to the bath. A little tartar gives a greater degree of bright compoundness to the colour. With a mixture of galls, fustic, and logwood, and a greater or smaller quantity of madder, with the addition of a little alum, those colours may be communicated to stuffs which are known by the name of hazel.\n\n405. M. Guhliche produces what is called a puce co-puce colour, by boiling for fifteen minutes a pound of woollen stuff with two ounces of alum, a certain proportion of vinegar and solution of iron, after which he leaves it in the mordant for twelve hours. He then makes a bath with the decoction of two ounces of white galls carefully poured off from the sediment, and mixed with four ounces of madder, in which, when it grows hot, the stuff is immersed, after being taken out of the mordant, allowing it to remain there, while the temperature is gradually increased, till the colour intended has been imparted to it; after which it is boiled for two minutes, washed, and dried in the sun. The colour thus obtained possesses a great degree of durability. It is of a deeper brown by the omission of the alum and vinegar in the mordant; and after these colours the lighter shades are dyed. Sumach may be employed as a substitute for half of the madder. Different brown colours possessing considerable permanency, may likewise be produced by the use of brazil and logwood, if more or less of a solution of iron be mixed with a decoction of these substances. The wool being previously alumed and galled, is dyed in it.\n\nII. Of Dyeing Silk with Mixtures of Black, &c.\n\n406. M. Guhliche imparts to silk a purple violet purple without a blue ground, with a mixture of one part of galls dissolved in white wine, with three parts of water, in which a pound of silk is macerated for twelve hours, soaked in a mordant made up of two ounces of alum, one ounce of solution of tin, and half an ounce of muriatic acid. After wringing the stuff, it is dyed in a bath composed of two ounces of cochineal and a small quantity of solution of iron, till the intended shade has been communicated; and for shades which are lighter, the residue of these baths are sufficient, either separately or mixed together. Madder may be used in the same way, macerating a pound of silk in a solution of alum, mixed with an ounce of muriatic acid, and a quantity of solution of iron. When the stuff is wrung out, it is dyed in a bath made of eight ounces of madder. When deeper colours are wanted, some of the solution of galls in white wine is mixed with the madder and cochineal baths.\n\n407. Silk may be dyed in a bath made of equal parts of brazil and logwood juice, adding a certain quantity of solution of iron, after the stuff has been soaked in a solution of two ounces of alum, and an ounce of muriatic acid. If solution of galls be added, the colour becomes deeper.\n\nColours resembling that of brick, may be produced, by immersing silk in an annatta bath, after preparing it with a solution of galls mixed with a certain quantity of solution of iron. By the mixture of brazil, logwood, archil, and galls, and by a browning with sulphate of iron, a number of different shades are produced; but the whole of them have more or less\nIII. Of Dyeing Silk with Mixtures of Black, &c.\n\n408. A permanent violet colour may be given to thread and cotton, when scoured in the ordinary way, by preparing a mordant with two quarts of the bath of what is called the black caulk, and four quarts of water for each pound of stuff, which is made to boil, and the scum is removed which forms on the surface, till it wholly disappears. The liquor is poured into a vat, and when warm, four ounces of sulphate of copper and one ounce of nitre are dissolved in it. The skeins are left to soak in it for ten or twelve hours, wrung out, and dried. If it is required to produce a deep violet colour, two ounces of verdigris must be added to the bath; and if the nitre be omitted, the colour becomes still deeper by galling the thread more or less, prior to its being put into the mordant. If the nitre be increased, and the sulphate of copper diminished, the violet colour becomes more inclined to lilac. A number of various shades may be produced, by different modifications of the mordants employed.\n\n409. Cotton is galled, dipped, and wrought in the common way, when different shades of maroon colour are wanted. To the bath employed must be added more or less of the liquor of the black caulk. The cotton is then washed in a bath mixed with verdigris, next welded, and dyed to a fulvic bath, to which a solution of soda and alum is sometimes added. When the cotton prepared in this manner has been thoroughly washed, it is next well maddered, dipped in a weak solution of sulphate of copper, and last of all in soap suds.\n\n410. For some hazel and snuff colours, a browning is communicated to stuffs by means of root, after the welding and madder bath, to which galls and fulvic have been added; sometimes root is mixed with this bath, and a browning is likewise imparted by means of a solution of sulphate of iron; and for browning colours, walnut peels are sometimes employed as a substitute for solutions of iron. For such wools as are designed for the manufacture of tapestry, they are very advantageous, because the colour is not changed into yellow by exposure to the air, as is the case in browning which is imparted by means of iron; but remains a considerable time without any sensible change. The hue is indeed rather dull; but its goodliness and very moderate price are sufficient to recommend a more extensive use of it for grave colours, which in common stuffs are sometimes fashionable.\n\nCHAP. III. Of Calico-printing.\n\n411. This may be defined to be the art of communicating different colours to particular spots on the surface of cotton or linen cloth, while the rest of the stuff retains its original white colour.\n\nThe wonderful and truly ingenious art of calico-printing seems to have been first known in India, and for more than two centuries before the commencement of the Christian era. Although the Egyptians were well acquainted with this art in the days of Pliny, as he himself informs us, it can scarcely be doubted that they derived the knowledge of it from India, as that country rather than Egypt, produced the colouring and other materials for carrying it on. If we consider its present improved state, the elegance of different patterns, the beauty and durability of the colours which can now be imparted to cotton or linen stuffs, and the dispatch with which the various operations of this art are conducted, we must be astonished at the rapidity of its improvements, when we recollect that it has been known in Europe for little more than a century. Perhaps no other art has risen to such perfection in so short a period.\n\n412. Our readers will not expect that our account of this subject should be tedious or elaborate, since the art is presumed to be already acquainted with the different processes which are employed in calico-printing; and to such as with only for a general knowledge of the art, in a theoretical point of view, prolixity would be disagreeable.\n\n413. The art of calico-printing consists in impregnating Nature of with a mordant, such parts of cotton or linen stuffs as this art are to have particular colours communicated to them, and then dyeing them in the usual manner with some colouring substance. Those parts of the cloth only which receive the mordant are intimately united with the colouring matter, although the whole surface must be more or less tinged; but the parts which have not received the mordant are restored to their original brightness by means of washing, and afterwards bleaching it upon the grats for some days, taking care to turn the wrong side towards the sun. If red stripes are to be communicated to a piece of white cotton cloth, those parts of its surface on which the stripes are intended to appear, are marked out by a pencil dipped in acetate of alumina; after which it is dyed with madder in the usual way. When it is first taken out of the dyeing vessel, its whole surface is red, but when it is washed and bleached, it resumes its original whiteness, the stripes only excepted which, being impregnated with the acetate of alumina, remain red. By a similar process may yellow or any other stripes be fixed upon cotton or linen, by the substitution of quercitron bark, weld, &c., in the room of madder.\n\n414. When different parts of the cloth are to receive different coloured stripes at the same time, different morinate dyes must be employed. If stripes are delineated on different colours with the acetates of alumina and iron, and if it be then dyed with madder in the ordinary way, it will, after being washed and bleached as formerly directed, exhibit stripes of a red and brown colour. If the same mordants are employed, but quercitron bark used instead of madder, the stripes will then be yellow, and olive or drab.\n\n415. The mordants known by the names of acetate of alumina and acetate of iron, which are made use of in calico-printing, may either be applied to stuffs with a pencil, as already mentioned, or still more expeditiously by means of blocks, on which the intended patterns are cut. Being designed only for particular parts of the surface of the cloth, great caution is necessary to prevent them from spreading to any part of it which is to remain white, and to prevent their interference when the application of more than one is required. Such a degree of confidence must of consequence be given to the mordants employed, as will prevent this disagreeable effect, which cannot fail to destroy the beauty and...\nand elegance of the print. If blocks are to be made use of, the mordants may be brought to a proper consistence by means of tarich; but gum arabic must be mixed with them, when the pencil is to be employed. The thickness should not exceed what is absolutely necessary to prevent the mordants from spreading; because, if carried too far, the cotton is frequently not saturated with the mordant, in consequence of which the dye is but imperfectly communicated.\n\n416. To distinguish those parts of the cloth which are impregnated with mordants, it is a common practice to give the mordants some particular tinge by which they may be known; and for this purpose printers commonly make use of the decoction of brasil wood. Dr Bancroft objects to this practice, because he is of opinion that the process of dyeing is impeded by the colouring matter of brasil wood. The affinity of the dye stuff for the mordant displaces the colouring matter of the brasil wood; and without such affinity it would be impossible to strike the colour. Some of the dye-stuff to be employed afterwards is recommended by Dr Bancroft for colouring the mordant, who prohibits the use of a larger quantity than what is sufficient to render it indistinguishable when an application of it is made to the cloth. Should too large a quantity be united with the mordant, a considerable proportion of the latter would be combined with colouring matter, by which means its affinity for the cloth would be diminished, and therefore a permanent colour could not be expected to result from such a partial combination.\n\n417. It is necessary to dry the cloth completely after the application of the mordants, for which purpose artificial heat may be employed, which has a tendency to promote the separation of the acetous acid from its base, and assist its evaporation, and thus the combination of the mordant with the cloth will be facilitated.\n\n418. When the cloth is thoroughly dried, it is customary to wash it with warm water and cow-dung, till every particle of the starch or gum arabic which had been employed to give a proper consistence to the mordants, and those parts of them which do not combine with the cloth, are entirely removed. The loose particles of the mordant are entangled by means of the cow-dung, and prevented from being attached to those parts of the cloth which are to remain white. After this, it must be completely rinsed in pure water.\n\nColouring matters employed.\n\n419. Indigo, madder, quercitron bark, and weld, are the chief dying ingredients made use of by calico-printers; but the last of these is seldom used by the printers of this country, except for the purpose of communicating yellows of a delicate greenish shade. Quercitron bark, on account of its inferior price, and capacity of imparting colours equally good, as well as requiring a less degree of heat, is employed as a substitute. It is usual to apply indigo at once, either by means of the block or pencil, because it requires not the intervention of a mordant to fix it. This preparation is made by boiling together indigo, potash reduced to the caustic state by means of quicklime, and orpiment; afterwards thickening the solution with gum. Dr Bancroft recommends the use of coarse brown sugar as a substitute for orpiment, which operates as powerfully in the decomposition of the indigo, and in promoting its solubility, answering at the same time all the purposes of gum.\n\n420. When the cloth is thoroughly cleaned after it has been impregnated with the mordant, the dyeing process is conducted in the usual manner. As the whole of it receives a tinge of the dye, it must be completely washed and bleached for some days on the grats, as formerly mentioned, by which means the colour is entirely removed from those parts of the cotton not impregnated with the mordant, while all the other parts of it retain the colouring matter as powerfully as at first.\n\n421. One of the most common colours imparted to Nankeen cotton prints is a species of nankeen yellow of different shades, and for the most part in stripes or spots. It is produced by means of a block on which is cut the intended pattern, rubbed over with acetate of iron brought to a proper consistence with gum or starch, and applied to the cotton; which, being dried and cleansed in the ordinary way, is immersed in a ley of potash. It is proper to observe, that the quantity of acetate of iron must be proportioned to the particular shade required.\n\n422. In order to produce a yellow colour, the block is yellow, rubbed over with acetate of alumina; and the cloth, after being impregnated with this mordant, is dyed with quercitron bark in the common manner, and then bleached.\n\n423. If madder be substituted for the quercitron bark, Red, a red colour is given to cotton by the same process.\n\n424. To communicate to fluffs the fine light blue colours Blue, which we frequently behold upon cotton, the block is rubbed over with a composition consisting partly of wax, by means of which all those parts of its surface are to remain white. It is next dyed in a cold vat of indigo, and when it is dried, the wax composition may be removed by the use of hot water.\n\n425. Lilac and blackish brown colours are communicated by acetate of iron, proportioning the quantity to the particular shade required, and adding a little fumach for such shades as are to be very deep. The cotton is then dyed with madder and bleached in the usual manner. Dove colour and drab are produced by means of acetate of iron and quercitron bark.\n\n426. When a variety of different colours are to be made on the same print, a greater number of operations is necessary. Upon each of the blocks is cut that particular part of the pattern which is to have one appropriate colour; and when these blocks are rubbed over with their respective mordants and thus applied to the cloth, the dyeing process is afterwards conducted in the ordinary manner. If, for example, three different blocks are to be made use of, the first rubbed over with acetate of alumina brought to a proper consistence, the second with acetate of iron, and the third with a composition of these two, the colours resulting, after the dyeing and bleaching processes are finished, will be the following.\n\n- Acetate of alumina yellow,\n- Iron olive, drab, dove.\n- From the compound olive green, olive.\n\nIt is proper to observe, that these are the results when quercitron bark is employed; but by the substitution of madder the following colours will be obtained.\n\nAcetate\nAcetate of alumina red,\niron brown, black.\n\nFrom the compound purple.\n\nWhen it is required to produce at the same time both those colours which are imparted by madder, and likewise by the use of quercitron bark, mordants are first applied for one part of the pattern, after which the cotton is dyed in a bath of madder, and then bleached. The rest of the mordants are then applied in a similar manner, after which the cotton is dyed with the quercitron bark, and bleached as before. The colours which the madder communicates are very little affected by the second dyeing, because the mordants by which their permanency is secured, are previously saturated. A new mordant may be applied to some of the colours resulting from the use of madder, by which means they receive a new durable colour from the bark. And by means of the indigo liquor other new colours may still be communicated after the last bleaching.\n\n427. The following colours may be communicated to cotton, by means of the different processes which have been described.\n\nMadder Dye.\n\n| Acetate of alumina | red, |\n|-------------------|-----|\n| iron              | brown, black, lilac, purple |\n\nBark Dye.\n\n| Acetate of alumina | yellow, |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| iron              | dove, drab, olive, orange |\n\nIndigo Dye.\n\n| Indigo            | blue, |\n|------------------|-------|\n| Indigo and yellow | green |\n\nThus may twelve different colours be communicated to the same print by these different processes.\n\n428. If durable colours could be directly applied to cotton by means of the block or pencil, without the help of mordants, nothing could be conceived more simple than the art of calico-printing; but with the single exception of indigo, the communicating of permanent colours requires the process of dyeing. Yellow, indeed, which is a compound colour, and some others, may be communicated to cotton at once, by mixing together an infusion of quercitron bark and acetate of alumina, while the same mordant with a decoction of madder, imparts to it a red colour; but those which are produced in this way are far from being durable, since they are destroyed by washing, and sometimes even by exposure to the air.\n\n429. But as it is not always practicable for calico-printers to avoid the application of colours in this manner, every endeavour to give them a greater degree of permanency becomes an object of importance. The following composition has been recommended for a yellow printing colour. Three pounds of alum, and three ounces of pure chalk are to be dissolved in a gallon of hot water, to which are to be added two pounds of acetate of lead. This mixture is to be occasionally stirred for 24 or 36 hours, after which it is to remain at rest during 12 hours. The clear liquor is then to be poured off, and as much more hot water added to the residuum, as will, after being stirred and allowed to settle, amount to three quarts when added to the first quantity. Into a tinned copper vessel put five pounds, or at most a quantity not exceeding eight pounds, of quercitron bark sufficiently ground, and boil it for an hour in four or five gallons of clean soft water, adding afterwards a little more water if the bark is not properly covered. When the liquor is thoroughly boiled, let it be removed from the fire, and left to settle for half an hour, when the clear decoction is to be poured off through a fine sieve. Six quarts more of pure water are then to be put upon the same bark, and boiled for a quarter of an hour, being previously well stirred. When it has stood a sufficient time to settle, the clear liquor is to be strained off, and being mixed with the former, both are put into a shallow wide vessel to be evaporated by boiling, till the whole, in addition to the mordant already mentioned, and the gum or paste for bringing it to a proper consistence, does not exceed three gallons. It will be proper not to add the three quarts of aluminous mordant till the decoction has been cooled down almost to the natural heat of blood. Let gum arabic or gum fenegal be taken for thickening, if the pencil is to be used, and starch or flour when blocks are to be employed.\n\n430. If a pound of muriatic sulphate of tin be used as for bright a substitute for the aluminous mordant in the composition described above, a mixture will be produced which is capable of imparting to cotton a very bright yellow, and considerably permanent.\n\n431. A cinnamon colour possessed also of a sufficient degree of permanency may be given to cotton, by means of a mixture of sulphate of tin and a decoction of the quercitron bark.\n\n432. If the decoctions of this bark and of logwood Green are boiled together, and proper quantities of sulphate of copper and verdigris added to them, together with a small proportion of carbonate of potash, there results a compound which communicates to cotton a green colour. Although the expectations of Dr Bancroft were not fully answered by the trials which he made of this substance, he deemed his success sufficient to encourage him to a farther investigation of it.\n\n433. A permanent drab colour may be given to cotton by means of acetate of iron mixed with a decoction of quercitron bark, and reduced to a proper consistence. This mixture will also produce an olive, if added to the olive colouring liquor already mentioned; and the colours may be made still more permanent, if a solution of iron in diluted nitric or muriatic acid be used as a substitute for iron liquor. They ought, however, to be used sparingly and with caution, that the texture of the cotton or linen to which they are applied may not be injured.\n\n434. Dr Bancroft made a number of experiments with the decoction of quercitron bark, to ascertain its effects when combined with different metallic salts as mordants. The sulphate, nitrate, and muriate of zinc, the quercitron decoction, yielded brownish yellow colours of different shades; but none of them were found sufficiently permanent when they were applied topically to linen or cotton. Mercury in the different acids produced\nDYEING.\n\nIndian Method of Dyeing Red.\n\nduced with the decoction of bark different shades of brown or yellowish brown colours; but they did not prove more durable than the former. The nitro-muriate of platinum with a proper proportion of decoction of quercitron bark, afforded, when topically applied to linen or cotton, strong full-bodied fluff colours, which were found sufficiently permanent, and capable of resisting the action of acids, and of the sun and air. Nitrate of silver with a decoction of the bark, when applied topically to linen or cotton, produced strong dark brown and cinnamon colours of considerable durability. Nitrate of lead with the same decoction gave by topical application a drab colour which was not less durable than the former. Nitrate of bismuth produced with the decoction of bark a very full and strong brownish yellow. This colour, however, is attended with the inconvenience of becoming almost black when exposed to the action of the alkaline sulphurates, sulphurated hydrogen gas, or even by the action of common soap. Muriate of bismuth with the decoction gives a drab colour; sulphate of the same metal affords a yellow; but these colours when applied to cotton or linen are not durable. Nitro-muriate of antimony produced with the decoction of bark something of a fluff colour, which applied to linen and cotton possesses some degree of durability. Nitrate and muriate of cobalt with the quercitron bark gave different shades of brown; but these colours were extremely fugitive; they soon faded by exposure to the sun and air.\n\n435. The art of calico-printing has been hitherto almost solely limited to linens and cottons. Many colouring matters have such an affinity for these stuffs that they readily enter into combination with them at the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere. This is also the case with silk, so that colouring matters might be applied topically to the latter by means of similar operations as to linen and cotton. Attempts, however, woollen have been made to extend the process of topical dyeing stuffs printing to woollen stuffs, and particularly those kinds known by the name of kerfeymeres, which are employed after being prepared in this way for waistcoat patterns. When it is recollected that woollen stuffs when they are to be dyed generally must be exposed to a considerable degree of heat, it is easy to conceive that it will be difficult to communicate spots or figures by printing to woollen stuffs. The means by which this difficulty is obviated in those manufactures where this operation is conducted have been hitherto kept secret. The preparation of colouring matters, whether such as may be employed simply or require the use of mortants to fix them, will be easily understood from what we have already fully detailed in the course of this treatise. The application of the colours is made in the usual way; and it is said that, after the woollen stuffs are printed, they are wrapped up in two or three folds of thick paper, to prevent the access of moisture which might cause the colours to run, and exposed to the steam of boiling water for such a length of time as may be supposed necessary for the colouring matter to combine with the stuffs.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nAfter that part of the preceding treatise to which it properly belongs, was printed off, the following account of the Indian method of dyeing cotton cloth and cotton thread a red colour came under our notice. It was communicated to the society for the encouragement of arts, &c., by Mr Maclellan of Calcutta. The insertion of it may perhaps excite the curiosity of some of our countrymen to farther inquiries into the state of this as well as of other arts in India, where, from being long known and practised, many of them have arrived at a high degree of simplicity and perfection.\n\nDirections for dyeing a bright Red, four yards of three-fourths broad Cotton Cloth.\n\n1st. The cloth is to be well washed and dried, for the purpose of clearing it of lime and congee, or starch, generally used in India for bleaching and dressing cloths; then put into an earthen vessel, containing twelve ounces of chaya or red dye root, with a gallon of water, and allow it to boil a short time over the fire.\n\n2d. The cloth being taken out, washed in clean water, and dried in the sun, is again put into a pot with one ounce of myrobalans, or galls coarsely powdered, and a gallon of clear water, and allowed to boil to one half; when cool, add to the mixture a quarter of a pint of buffalo's milk. The cloth being fully soaked in this, take it out, and dry it in the sun.\n\n3d. Wash the cloth again in clear cold water, and dry it in the sun; then immerse it into a gallon of water, a quarter of a pint of buffalo's milk, and a quarter of an ounce of the powdered galls. Soak well in this mixture, and dry in the sun. The cloth, at this stage of the process, feeling rough and hard, is to be rolled up and and beetle till it becomes soft.\n\n4th. Infuse into five quarts of cold water, six ounces of red wood shavings, and allow it to remain so two days. On the third day boil it down to two-thirds the quantity, when the liquor will appear of a good bright red colour. To every quart of this, before it cools, add a quarter of an ounce of powdered alum; soak in it your cloth twice over, drying it between each time in the shade.\n\n5th. After three days wash in clean water, and half dry in the sun; then immerse the cloth into five gallons of water, at about the temperature of 120° of Fahrenheit, adding 50 ounces of powdered chaya, and allowing the whole to boil for three hours; take the pot off the fire, but let the cloth remain in it until the liquor is perfectly cool; then wring it gently, and hang it up in the sun to dry.\n\n6th. Mix intimately together, by hand, about a pint measure of fresh sheep's dung, with a gallon of cold water, in which soak the cloth thoroughly, and immediately take it out, and dry it in the sun.\n\n7th. Wash the cloth well in clean water, and spread it out in the sun on a sand-bank (which in India is universally preferred to a grass-plot) for six hours, sprinkling\nDirections for dyeing of a beautiful red, eight ounces of Cotton Thread.\n\n1st.

Put the following articles into an earthen pot, viz. Three quarters of a pint of Gingelly oil; one pint, by measure, of sheep's dung, intimately mixed by hand in water; two pints of the above ley.—After mixing these ingredients well, pour the mixture gradually upon the thread into another vessel, wetting it only as the thread, by being squeezed and rolled about by the hand, imbibes it, continuing to do so until the whole is completely soaked up, and allow the thread to remain in this state until next day.\n\n3rd. Take it up, and put it in the sun to dry; then take a pint and a half of ash-ley, in which squeeze and roll the thread well, and allow it to remain till next day.\n\n4th. Squeeze and roll it in a like quantity of ash-ley, and put it in the sun to dry; when dry, squeeze and roll it again in the ley, and allow it to remain till next day.\n\n5th. Let the same process be repeated three or four times, and intermit till next day.\n\n6th. Lay the thread once, as the day before, and, when well dried in the sun, prepare the following liquor: One gill of Gingelly oil; one pint and a half of ash-ley.—In this squeeze and roll the thread well, and leave it so till next day.\n\n7th. Repeat the process of yesterday, and dry the thread in the sun.\n\n8th. The same process to be repeated.\n\n9th. First repeat the ash-ley process three or four times, as under the operations 3, 4, and 5, and then prepare the following mixture: One pint of sheep-dung water; one gill of Gingelly oil; one pint and a half of ash-ley.—In this squeeze and roll the thread well, and dry it in the sun.\n\n10th.

Dynamics is that branch of physico-mathematical science which includes the abstract doctrine of moving forces; that is, the necessary results of the relations of our thoughts concerning motion, the immediate causes of motion, and its changes.\n\n2. Motion and its general properties are the first and principal object of mechanical philosophy. This science indeed presupposes the existence of motion; and we may consider it as universally admitted and recognized. With regard to the nature of motion, however, philosophers are greatly divided in opinion. The most obvious and simplest conception of motion is the successive application of the moving body to the different parts of indefinite space, which are considered as the place of the body. This idea of motion supposes a space whose parts are penetrable and immoveable; a doctrine directly contrary to that of the followers of Des Cartes, who regarded extension and matter as one and the same thing. To have a distinct idea of motion, it seems requisite to conceive two kinds of extension; the one, which is considered as impenetrable, and which constitutes what we properly call matter or body; the other, which being simply considered as extended, without taking any other property into account, is the measure of the distance of one body from another; and whose parts being supposed fixed and immoveable, enable us to judge of the rest or motion of bodies. We may therefore conceive bodies to be placed in indefinite space, whether real or supposed; and motion as a change in the state or condition of a body from one part of space to another. We must indeed consider motion as a state or condition of existence of a body, which would remain till it is changed by some cause; otherwise we could not have any idea of motion in the abstract. From the changes which we observe, we infer agency in nature; and in these changes we are to discover what we know of their causes.\n\n3. In mechanical disquisitions, the simplest, and at the same time the most usual conception of space, is mere extension. We think only of the distance between two places. The path along which any body moves in passing from one place or point in space to another, is said figuratively to be the path described by that body. Space is considered by the geometer not only as having length but also breadth. In this case it is called a surface. But to have a more complete notion of the capacities of any portion of space, thickness, as well as length and breadth, is taken into consideration. This is called a solid space. By this, however, is meant only the susceptibility of measure in three ways, or extension of three dimensions. The adjacent parts or portions of space are distinguished from each other by their mutual boundaries. Contiguous portions of a line are separated by points; contiguous portions of a surface are separated by lines; and contiguous portions of a solid are separated by surfaces. The boundaries of any portions of space are not to be considered as parts of the contiguous portions. They must be conceived as common to both; as the places where one portion ends and another begins. Space cannot be said to have any bounds or limits; it is therefore said to be infinite or unbounded.\n\n4. Any portion of space may be considered in relation to its place or situation among other portions of space. This portion of space which is occupied by any body has been called the relative place of that body. But this portion of space may be considered as a determinate portion of infinite space; and this portion of infinite space occupied by any body has been called the absolute place of that body. Space, it is obvious, taken in this meaning, is immoveable; for it cannot be conceived that this identical portion of space can be removed from one place to another. The body which occupies that space may be removed, but the space remains. We have no perception of the absolute space of any object. This may be illustrated by the motion of the earth or that of a ship. A person in the cabin of a ship does not consider the table as changing its place while it remains fixed to the same spot on the deck. While a mountain is observed to retain the same situation among other objects, few persons think that it changes its place.\n\n5. The idea of time is acquired by means of the power of memory in observing the succession of events, time. We conceive time as unbounded, continuous, homogeneous, unchangeable in the order of its parts, and infinitely divisible. It is conceived as a proper quantity made up of its own parts, and measured by them. But as the relation of the parts of time is unknown, the only means which we can employ to discover this relation, is to find out some other relation which is more obvious and better known, to which it may be compared. We shall then have discovered the simplest measure of time, if we compare in the simplest manner possible the relation of the parts of time with those relations which are most familiar. Hence it follows, that uniform motion is the simplest measure of time. For, on the one hand, the relation of the parts of a right line is that which is most easily conceived; and, on the other hand, there are no relations more susceptible of comparison with each other than equal relations. Now, in uniform motion, the relation of the parts of time is equal to that of the corresponding parts of the line described. Uniform motion then gives us at once, both the means of comparing the relation of the parts of time with that which is most obvious to our senses, and also of making this comparison in the simplest manner. In uniform motion, then, we find the simplest measure of time. It may be added, that the measure of time by uniform motion, is independent of its simplicity, that which is the most natural to think of employing. Indeed as there is no relation with which we are acquainted more accurate than that of the parts of space; and, as in general, a motion, the law of which is given, would lead us to discover the relation of the parts of time, by the known analogy with that of the parts of space passed over, it is evident that such a motion would be the most accurate measure of time, and\nDYNAMICS.\n\nMotion and that which ought to be employed in preference to every other. In the actual measurement of time, some event which is imagined always to require an equal time for its accomplishment is selected; and this time is employed as a unit of time or duration, in the same way as a foot rule is employed as a measure of extension. During any observed operation, as often as this event is accomplished, so often is it supposed that the time of the operation contains this unit. While a heavy body falls 16 feet, a pendulum, 39½ inches long, makes one vibration; but it makes three vibrations, while the same body falls 144 feet. It is therefore said that the time of a body falling 144 feet, is thrice as great as the time of falling 16 feet.\n\nPART I. OF MOTION.\n\nBEFORE we enter on the consideration of the different kinds of motion, it may be necessary to notice some general circumstances regarding it.\n\n7. It is impossible to conceive that any motion can be instantaneous. A moving body, in passing from the beginning to the end of its path, must pass through all the intermediate points. Now to suppose the motion along even the most minute portions of the space passed through instantaneous, is to suppose that the moving body is in every intervening point at the same instant; which is impossible.\n\n8. Relative motion is the change of situation with regard to other objects. Absolute motion is the change of absolute place. These two motions, it may be observed, may not only be different, but even contrary to each other. From the relative motions of things which are the differences of their absolute motions, we cannot find out what are the absolute motions. It is often a subject of elaborate and intricate investigation to discover and determine the absolute motions, by means of observing the relative motions.\n\n9. The affections or circumstances of motion are various with regard to its quantity and its direction. That affection of motion by which the quantity is determined, is called velocity. The length of the line, which is uniformly described or passed over during some given portion or unit of time, is the proper measure of this velocity. When a ship sails six miles per hour, she describes a length of line equal to six miles in the space of a given portion or unit of time, namely, the hour; and thus the velocity of the ship is said to be ascertained.\n\n10. Another affection or circumstance of motion is its direction. This is the position of the straight line along which the motion is performed. The straight line which a body describes or tends to describe is called its direction. The motion is said to be in the direction AB fig. 1, when the body moved passes along the line AB from A to B. In common language, it is not unusual to express the direction of motion in a manner quite the reverse of this. We have an instance of this kind in speaking of the direction of the winds. A current of air or wind which moves eastward is said to be a westerly wind, deriving its name from the point or quarter from which it proceeds, not as in other cases, and in strict expression, from the point to which it is directed.\n\n6. Between the affections of time and space, there is an obvious analogy; and hence in most languages the same words are employed to express the affections between both. Thus it is that time may be represented by the lines and measured by motion; since uniform motion is of the simplest succession of events that can be conceived, time and space. In the order of situation, all things are placed in space, in the order of succession all events happen in time.\n\nHaving made these preliminary observations, we propose to divide the following treatise into two parts. In the first, we shall consider motion in general. In the second, we shall treat of moving forces, or of dynamics.\n\n11. Motions are of different kinds. They are either rectilinear, rectilineal, deflected, or curvilinear. In a rectilinear motion, the direction remains unchanged during the whole time that the motion is continued, as when a body moves from A to B fig. 1. In a deflected motion, it is performed along two contiguous straight lines in succession. Thus if a body moves from A to B fig. 2, and at the point B its direction is changed from that of AD to BC; this change has been called deflection, the quantity of which may be measured either by the angle DBC, or by a line DC drawn from the point D to which the body would have arrived in the same time, if its motion had remained unchanged, in which it has actually reached the point C. When a body in moving along describes the sides of a polygon, the deflections are repeated, with the intervention of undeflected motions. In curvilinear motion the deviation and deflection are supposed to be continual. Continual deflection therefore constitutes curvilinear motion. Let the motion be performed along a curve line ABCDE (fig. 3.), the direction is continually changing. When the body is in the point C the direction is that of the tangent CF; because this direction alone lies between any pair of polygonal directions, such as CE and CA, or CB and CD, however near the points A and E, or B and D, are taken to the point C.\n\n12. Motions have been divided into uniform motions, division of variable, compound, and curvilinear. These we shall consider separately in the following sections.\n\nSECT. I. Of Uniform Motion.\n\n13. It is of great importance in mechanical disputes, to have the characters of uniform or unchanged fixed motion fixed. For in our conceptions of motion in general, in which we do not turn the attention to its alterations, the motion is supposed to be equable and rectilineal. By the deviations from such motion only can we determine the marks and measures of all changes; and hence also we are to obtain the measures of all changing causes, or in other words of the mechanical powers of nature.\n\nPROPOSITION I.\n\n14. In uniform motions, the velocities are in the proportions of the spaces described in the same or in equal times;\ntimes; or as it is sometimes expressed, The velocities are proportional to the spaces described in equal times.\n\nThe spaces described are the measures of the velocities, and things are proportional to their measure. Let the spaces described in the time $T_s$ be represented by $S$ and $s$, and let the velocities be represented by $V$ and $v$. We have the analogy $V : v = S : s$. Or, as it may be expressed by the proportional equation\n\n$$\\frac{v}{s} = \\frac{V}{S}.$$  \n\n**Prop. II.**\n\n15. In uniform motions with equal velocities, the times are in the proportion of the spaces described during their currency. Or, as it is also expressed, The times are proportional to the spaces described with equal velocities.\n\nFor in uniform motions, equal spaces are described in equal times. The successive portions of time therefore are equal, in which equal spaces are described in succession; and the sums of the equal times must be proportional to the corresponding sums of equal spaces. In all cases, therefore, which are susceptible of being represented by numbers, this proposition is evident. And it may be extended to all other cases, in a way similar to that in which Euclid has demonstrated that triangles of equal bases are in the proportion of their sides.\n\n16. As proportion can only take place between quantities of the same kind, all that is to be understood by the expressions in the above propositions, which are far from being accurate, is, that the proportions of the velocities and the times are the same with the proportions of the spaces. For as space and time are quantities of a different nature, it is evident that we cannot divide space by time. Thus when it is said that the velocities are as the spaces divided by the times, it is an abridged mode of expression, which signifies that the velocities are as the relations of the spaces to the same common measure, divided by the relations of the times to the same measure. Thus, for example, if we take a foot for the measure of the spaces, and a minute for the measure of the times, the velocities of two bodies which move uniformly, are to each other as the number of feet described, divided by the number of minutes which the bodies require to describe the portion of space passed through, and not as the feet divided by the minutes.\n\n17. Hence it is that uniform motion is universally employed as a measure of time. But it is often difficult to find out whether the motion which is proposed for the measure of time be perfectly uniform. What then are the means to ascertain this? To this it may be answered that there is no motion which is not uniform, the law of which we can determine exactly; so that this difficulty only proves that we cannot ascertain the relation of the parts of time with mathematical precision; but it does not follow that uniform motion from its nature may not be the first and simplest measure. And having no strictly accurate measure of time, we endeavour to discover the measure which comes nearest in the motions which approach nearest to uniformity.\n\n18. There are three ways by which it may be ascertained that a motion is nearly uniform. 1. When the moving body describes equal spaces in times which we judge to be equal; and we can determine that the times are equal, after having observed from repeated experience that similar events take place in the same times. Thus we conclude that the times which the same clepsydra requires to be emptied are equal; so also the times in which the same quantity of sand runs in the sandglass; the times in which the shadow moves over the same space on the sundial; the times of the same number of vibrations of a pendulum of the same length; and the times of the revolution of the heavenly bodies through the same spaces are equal. If then it is found by observation that a body during the same times passes over equal spaces, we conclude that the motion is uniform. 2. Another method of ascertaining how far any motion is uniform, is when the effect of the accelerating or retarding cause, if such operate, is imperceptible. It is by combining these two methods that we conclude the motion of the earth round its axis to be uniform; and this inference is not only not opposed by any of the celestial phenomena, but seems to be in perfect accord with them. 3. By a third method of determining the uniformity of any motion, we compare it with others; and when the same law is observed in both the one and the other, we may conclude that the motion compared is uniform. Thus if several bodies move at such a rate that the spaces described in the same time are always to each other, either precisely or very nearly so, in the same ratio, the motion of these bodies, we conclude, is either precisely, or at least very nearly uniform. For if a body A which moves uniformly passes through the space E during the time T taken at pleasure, and another body B also moving uniformly, passes through the space e; during the same time T, the relation of the spaces E, e will be always the same, whether the two bodies have begun to move in the same or in different instants; and it is only to uniform motion that this property belongs. Wherefore if we divide the time into parts, whether equal or unequal, and if it be observed that the spaces passed through by two bodies during one part of the time, are always in the same relation, the greater the number the parts of the time taken, the more there is reason to conclude that the motion of each body is uniform. None of these methods, it has been observed, possesses geometrical precision; but they are sufficient, especially when they are repeated and taken together, to afford a satisfactory conclusion, if not with regard to absolute uniformity of motion, at least with regard to a near approximation to uniform motion.\n\n**Prop. III.**\n\n19. In uniform motions, the spaces described are in the compound ratio of the velocities and the ratio of the times. This proposition is frequently expressed otherwise thus; The spaces described with an uniform motion are proportional to the products of the times and the velocities: Or otherwise thus; The spaces described with a uniform motion are proportional to the rectangles of the times and the velocities.\n\nFor let $S$ be the space described with the velocity $V$, in the time $T$, and let $s$ be the space described with the velocity $v$, in the time $t$. Let another space $Z$ be described in the time $T$ with the velocity $v$.\n\nThen by proposition 1st we have $S : Z = V : v$,\n\nAnd by proposition 2nd $Z : s = T : t$.\nSect. II.\n\nDYNAMICS.\n\nVariable Motions.\n\nBy composition of ratios therefore (or by VI. 23, Euclid), we have \\( S \\times T : v \\times t = S \\times Z : s \\times Z \\); that is,\n\n\\[ S : s = S : s. \\]\n\nThe above are all equivalent expressions which are demonstrated by the same composition of ratios. The products or rectangles of the times and velocities, are the products of numbers which are as the times, multiplied by numbers which are as the velocities; or the rectangles whose bases are as the times, and whose heights are as the velocities.\n\nCOROLLARY.\n\n20. If the spaces described in two uniform motions be equal, the velocities are in the reciprocal proportion of the times.\n\nFor in this case the products \\( VT \\) and \\( vt \\) are equal, and therefore \\( V : v = T : t \\), or \\( V : v = \\frac{1}{T} : \\frac{1}{t} \\). Or, because the rectangles \\( AC, DF \\) (fig. 4,) are in this case equal, we have (by VI. 14, Euclid) \\( AB : BF = BD : BC \\), that is \\( V : v = T : t \\).\n\nPROP. IV.\n\n21. In uniform motions, the times are as the spaces, directly, and as the velocities, inversely.\n\nFor by Prop. III. \\( S : s = VT : vt \\);\n\nTherefore, \\( S : vt = s : VT \\),\n\nAnd, \\( T : t = S : sV \\).\n\nOr, \\( T : t = \\frac{S}{s} : \\frac{s}{v} \\),\n\nAnd, \\( t : t = \\frac{s}{v} : \\frac{s}{v} \\).\n\nPROP. V.\n\n22. In uniform motions, the velocities are as the spaces, directly, and as the times, inversely.\n\nFor by Prop. IV. \\( S : s = VT : vt \\),\n\nTherefore \\( V : v = S : sT \\).\n\nOr, \\( V : v = \\frac{S}{s} : \\frac{s}{t} \\),\n\nAnd \\( v : v = \\frac{s}{t} : \\frac{s}{t} \\).\n\n23. The values of the results of these propositions are not changed by the absolute magnitudes of the space and time, if both are changed in the same ratio.\n\nThe value of 12 feet, or of \\( \\frac{8}{24} \\) feet, is the same with half a foot per second. Therefore, if \\( s' \\) be the expression of an extremely minute portion of space described with this velocity in the small portion of time \\( t' \\), the velocity \\( v \\) is still accurately expressed by \\( \\frac{s'}{t'} \\).\n\nAnd the accurate expression of the time \\( t' \\) is \\( \\frac{s'}{v} \\).\n\nSect. II. Of Variable Motions.\n\n24. In observing the phenomena of nature, it rarely happens that the motions to which our attention is directed are perfectly uniform. These motions, however, we distinctly conceive, with all their properties; and it is obviously of the utmost importance that all the deviations from uniform motions be clearly understood; because these deviations afford the only marks and measures of the variations, and therefore of the causes which produce these changes.\n\n25. When a body continues to move uniformly in the same direction, its motion, or circumstances with respect to motion, have suffered no change. The condition of that body, therefore, must be allowed to be the same in any two portions of its path, whatever the distance of these portions may be. And because a change of place is involved in the very conception of motion, the difference of place does not imply any change. Two bodies, therefore, moving with the same velocity in this path, or in two lines parallel to it, their condition in respect of motion must be allowed to be the same. Their direction is the same, and their rate of motion is the same. The velocity, therefore, and direction of a body, are the only circumstances which seem to enter into our conception of the state of a body, in respect of motion. Changes either in the velocity, or in the direction, or in both of these circumstances, include all the changes of which this condition is susceptible. Let us now consider the first of these changes, namely, changes of velocity.\n\nOf Accelerated and Retarded Motions.\n\n26. It has been ascertained by experiment and observation, that a stone in falling is carried downward with greater rapidity in every succeeding period of its fall. During the first second it falls 16 feet; during the next it falls 48 feet; during the third, it falls 80 feet; during the fourth it falls 112 feet; continuing to fall, during every succeeding second 32 feet more than during the preceding second. A body moving in this manner is said to have an accelerated motion. But if a body be projected perpendicularly upwards, the very reverse takes place in the circumstances of its motion. It is observed to rise with a motion which is continually retarded. These bodies therefore are conceived to be in every succeeding instant in different states of motion. The velocity of the falling body is conceived to be greater in a certain instant than in any preceding instant; as, for example, when it has fallen 144 feet its velocity is said to be thrice as great as when it has fallen only 16 feet. But this inference it is evident cannot be made directly by comparing the spaces described in the following moments; for in these it falls 112 and 48 feet; or by comparing the spaces immediately preceding; for in these the body fell 80 and 16 feet. But in this expression it is supposed that the variable condition of a body, called its velocity, is, in every instant susceptible of an accurate measure; and yet in no moment, however short, does the body describe uniformly a space which can be taken as the measure of its velocity at the beginning of that moment; because the space described in any moment is too great for measuring the velocity at the beginning of the moment, and too small for the measure of its velocity at the end of it. Till however such a measure is obtained, the mechanical condition of the body is not known.\n\n27. But in a continually accelerated motion, no such measure can be obtained. No space is describ-\ned in an instant: for this requires time. In that instant, however, the body possesses what has been called a potential velocity, that is, a certain tendency or determination, which remaining unchanged, causes it to describe a certain space uniformly during some assignable portion of time. At another instant it has another determination, by which, if it be not changed, another space would be uniformly described in an equal portion of time. Now it is in the difference of those two determinations that its difference of mechanical condition consists. The marks and measures of these determinations are known from the spaces which would be uniformly described. These therefore must be carefully investigated as the measures of the velocities; and the proportions of these spaces are to be taken as the proportions of the velocities.\n\nPROP. VI.\n\n28. Let the straight line ABD (fig. 5.) be described with a motion continually varied, it is required to determine the proportion of the velocity in the point A, to the velocity in any other point C.\n\nLet the right line abd, represent the time of this motion along the path AD, so that the points a, b, c, d, may denote the instants of the moving body being in A, B, C, D, and the portions ab, bc, cd, may express the times of describing AB, BC, CD, that is, may be in the proportion of those times; and let ae, perpendicular to ad, express the velocity of the moving body at the instant a, or in the point A. Let egh be a line, so related to the axis ad, that the areas abfe, bcgf, cdhg, comprehended between the ordinates ae, bf, cg, dh, all perpendicular to ad, may be proportional to the spaces AB, BC, CD, described in the times ab, bc, cd, and let this relation hold in every part of the figure. Then the velocity in A is to the velocity in B, or C, or D, as ae to bf, or cg, or dh. Or it may be expressed in other words, If the abscissa ad, of a curve egh, be proportional to the time of any motion, and the areas interrupted by parallel ordinates be proportional to the spaces described, the velocities are proportional to those ordinates.\n\nMake be and cd equal, so as to represent very small and equal moments of time, and make pa equal to one of them. Complete the rectangle paeq. This will represent the space uniformly described in the moment pa, with the velocity ae (Propof. 3.) Let PA be that portion of space thus uniformly described in the moment pa. Let the lines im, kn, parallel to ad, make the rectangles bemi, and cdnk, respectively equal to the areas bcgf, and cdhg. If the motions along the spaces PA and BC had been uniform, the velocities would have been proportional to the spaces described (Propof. 1.) because the times pa, and bc are equal. That is, the velocity in A would be to the velocity in C, as the rectangle paeq to the area bcgf, that is, as paeq to bemi, that is, as the base ae to the base cm, because the altitudes pa and bc are equal.\n\nBut the motion along the line BC is not represented as uniform; for the line fg diverges from the axis bd, the ordinate cg being greater than bf. And therefore the spaces measured by these areas increase faster than the times; and thus the figure represents an accelerated motion. Therefore the velocity with which BC would be uniformly described during the moment bc, is less than the velocity at the end of that moment, that is, at the instant c, or in the point C of the path; and therefore it must be represented and measured by a line greater than cm.\n\nIn the same manner it is proved that ck represents and measures the velocity with which CD would be uniformly described during the moment cd. And therefore, since the motion along CD is also accelerated, the velocity at the beginning of that moment is less than the velocity with which it would be uniformly described in the same time, and must be represented by a line less than ck.\n\nTherefore the velocity in A is to that in C, in a less ratio than that of ae to cg, but in a greater ratio than that of ae to ck. But in this case, as long as the instant b is prior, and posterior, to the instant c, cm is less, and ck is greater, than cg. Therefore the velocity in A is to that in C in a ratio that is greater than any ratio less than that of ae to cg. And, consequently the velocity in A is to that in C, as ae to cg.\n\nIt may be proved in the same way, with respect to the velocity in any other point D; and therefore the proposition may be considered as demonstrated. And had the motion along BCD, instead of being accelerated as in this case, been retarded, the same reasoning would still apply.\n\nCOROLLARIES.\n\n29. Cor. 1. The velocities in different points of the path AD, are in the ultimate ratio of the spaces described in equal small moments of time. Draw go parallel to ad. Then the velocity in the instant a, is to that in the instant c, as ae to cg, that is, as the rectangle pe to the rectangle eo, that is, as paeq to cdhg, nearly. As the moments are diminished, the difference goh between the rectangles cgod and cgdh, diminishes nearly in the duplicate ratio of the moment. If then the moment be taken \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of cd, the error goh is diminished to \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), or \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\): the corollary is now manifest; for the ultimate ratio of cgod to cgdh is the ratio of equality. That is, the velocity in A is to that in C, in the ultimate ratio of PA to BC described in equal final moments.\n\nThere are many cases in which the spaces described in very small moments can be measured, and yet the ultimate ratio cannot be ascertained. These spaces must then be taken as measures of the velocity. And by taking half the sum of the spaces BC and CD, for the measure of the velocity in the point C, the error is almost reduced to nothing.\n\n30. Cor. 2. The momentary increments of the spaces described, are in the compound ratio of the velocities, and the ultimate ratio of the moments.\n\nFor the increments PA, CD are as the rectangles paeq and eo ultimately, (Propof. 3.) and these are in the compound ratio of the base ae, to the base do, and the ultimate ratio of the altitude pa, to the altitude cd. This may be expressed by the proportional equation \\( s = vt \\).\n\n31. Consequently \\( v = \\frac{s}{t} \\), and \\( t = \\frac{s}{v} \\). The equation\nSect. II.\n\nDYNAMICS.\n\nVariable Motions.\n\n\\[ s = vt \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{s}{v} \\]\n\nseem to be the same with those in (23), but there the small space \\( s' \\) was described uniformly, and the equations were absolute. In 30 and 35, \\( s \\) does not represent a space uniformly described. But \\( S : s \\) expresses the ultimate ratio of \\( S' \\) to \\( s' \\) when they are diminished continually, and vanish together. Therefore the meaning of the equation\n\n\\[ s = vt \\]\n\nis that the ultimate ratio of \\( S' \\) to \\( s' \\) is the same with that of \\( VT' \\) to \\( vt' \\).\n\n32. The following is the converse of this proposition.\n\nIf the abscissa \\( a d \\) of the line \\( e f h \\), represent the time of a motion along the line \\( ABD \\), and if the ordinates \\( a c, b f, c g, \\ldots \\) be as the velocities in the points \\( A, B, C, \\ldots \\), then the areas are as the spaces described. This is proved by an indirect demonstration, thus:\n\nFor if the spaces \\( AB, AD \\), be not proportional to the areas \\( a b f e, a d h e \\), they must be proportional to some other, \\( a b f' e, a d h' e \\), of another line \\( e f' h' \\), passing through \\( e \\). Assuming this to be true, then (by Propof. 6.) the velocity in \\( A \\) is to that in \\( B \\), as \\( a c \\) to \\( b f \\). Therefore \\( a c : b f = a e : b f \\), which is absurd.\n\n33. The relation between the space described and the time which elapses is the only immediate observation to be made on these variable motions. By means of the foregoing propositions, the mechanical condition of the body, or rather the effect and measure of this condition, denominated velocity, is inferred. The same inference is made in another way. Sir Isaac Newton often represents the uniform lapse of time by the uniform increase of an area during the motion along the line taken for the abscissa. The velocities or determinations to motion in the different points of this line, are inversely proportional to the ordinates of the curve which bounds this area.\n\nAlong the straight line \\( AD \\), (fig. 6.) let a point move with a motion any how continually changed, and let the curve line \\( LKH \\) be so related to \\( AD \\), that the area \\( LICB \\) is to the area \\( LHDB \\) as the time of moving along \\( BC \\) to that of moving along \\( BD \\). Let this be true in every point of the line \\( AD \\). Let \\( Cc, Dd \\) be two very small spaces described in equal times, draw the ordinates \\( i c, h d \\), and draw \\( ik, hl \\) perpendicular to \\( IC, HD \\).\n\nThe areas \\( IC \\times i \\) and \\( HD \\times h \\) must be equal, because they represent equal moments of time. It is evident also, that as the spaces \\( Cc \\) and \\( Dd \\) are continually diminished, the ratio of \\( IC \\times i \\) and \\( HD \\times h \\) to the rectangles \\( kC \\times i \\) and \\( lD \\times h \\) continually approximates to that of equality, and that the ratio of equality is the limiting or ultimate ratio. Since therefore, the areas \\( IC \\times i \\) and \\( HD \\times h \\) are equal, the rectangles \\( kC \\times i \\) and \\( lD \\times h \\) are ultimately in the ratio of equality. Therefore their bases \\( i c \\) and \\( h d \\) are inversely as their altitudes \\( Cc \\) and \\( Dd \\), that is, \\( i c : h d = Dd : Cc \\). But as \\( Cc \\) and \\( Dd \\) are described in equal times, they are ultimately as the velocities in \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) (29). Therefore \\( i c \\) and \\( h d \\), are inversely as the velocities in \\( c \\) and \\( d \\). And as the same reasoning may be applied to every point of the abscissa, the proposition is demonstrated.\n\n34. In all cases, then, in which the relation between the spaces described, and the times elapsed can be discovered by observation, we discover the mechanical condition of the moving body, or its velocity. But Variable Motions.\n\nIn the practical application of these conclusions, recourse must always be had to arithmetical conclusions; and the indications of these are the algebraic symbols of geometrical reasonings. Thus any ordinate \\( c g \\), (fig. 5.) is represented by \\( v \\), and the portion \\( cd \\) of the abscissa by \\( i \\), and the area \\( cd \\times g \\), or its equal, the rectangle \\( cd \\times g \\), by \\( vi \\). This rectangle then being as the corresponding portion \\( CD \\) of the line of motion, and \\( CD \\) being represented by \\( s \\), we have the equation\n\n\\[ s = vt. \\]\n\n35. The mathematical consequences of these representations may now be assumed to be true; and therefore \\( i = \\frac{s}{v} \\), as in (23.) Algebraic symbols being the representations of arithmetical operations, they represent more remotely the operations of geometry, and only because the area of a rectangle is analogous to the product of numbers which are proportional to its sides.\n\nThe symbol \\( \\int vt \\) being used to represent the sum of all these rectangles, expresses the whole area \\( adhe \\), as well as the whole line of motion \\( AD \\); and the equation may be stated \\( s = \\int vt \\). In like manner \\( \\int \\frac{s}{v} \\) will be equivalent to \\( \\int i \\), that is, to \\( i \\), and will express the whole time \\( ad \\). It is plain too that \\( \\frac{s}{v} \\) represents the ordinate \\( DH \\) of the line \\( LKIH \\) (fig. 6.) because any portion \\( Dd \\) of its abscissa, is properly represented by \\( s \\), and the ordinates are reciprocally proportional to the velocities, that is, are proportional to the quotients of some constant number divided by the velocities, and therefore to \\( \\frac{i}{v} \\). And as \\( i \\) is represented by the rectangle \\( kC \\times i \\), which is also represented by \\( s \\times \\frac{i}{v} \\), we have \\( i = \\frac{s}{v} \\) and \\( t = \\frac{s}{v} \\), as above.\n\n36. In one case of varied motion, when the line \\( efgh \\) (fig. 5.) is a straight line, the characters are very particular and useful. Let this case of motion be represented along the line \\( AD \\) (fig. 7.) and let \\( pa, b c, c d \\) represent equal moments of time, in which the moving body describes \\( PA, BC, CD \\); and draw \\( fm, gn, es \\), parallel to the abscissa \\( ad \\). Now it is evident that \\( mg \\) and \\( nh \\) are equal, or that equal increments of velocity are acquired in equal times; \\( eg, er, es \\) are also proportional to \\( gf, fr, fh \\), and therefore the increments \\( gf, fr, fh \\), of velocity are proportional to the times \\( ab, ac, ad \\), in which they are acquired. This motion may very properly be denominated uniformly accelerated; for here the velocity increases in the same ratio with the times, and equal increments are acquired in equal times. If the line \\( eh \\) cut the abscissa in \\( v \\), it will represent a motion uniformly accelerated from rest, during the time \\( vd \\), and thus exhibit the relations between the spaces, velocities, and times in such motions.\n\nHence it follows from this mode of expressing these relations,\nrelations that in motions uniformly accelerated from a state of rest, the acquired velocities are proportional to the times from the beginning of the motion. For \\(a, b, c, d, e\\), represent the velocities gained during the times \\(v, a, v, b, v, c, v, d\\), and are in the same proportion with those lines.\n\n37. Also, the momentary increments of velocity, are as the moments in which they are acquired.\n\n2. Also, the spaces described from the beginning of the motion, are as the squares of the times.\n\n3. Also, the increments of the spaces are as the increments of the squares of the times; reckoning from the beginning of the motion.\n\n4. Also, the spaces described from the beginning of the motion, are as the squares of the acquired velocities.\n\n5. Also, the momentary increments of the spaces are as the momentary increments of the squares of the velocities.\n\n6. Also, the space described during any portion of time by a motion uniformly accelerated from rest, is one-half of the space uniformly described in the same time with the final velocity of the accelerated motion.\n\n7. And the space described during any portion of the time of the accelerated motion, is equal to that which would be described in the same time with the mean between the velocities at the beginning and end of this portion of time.\n\nIn the investigation of all other varied motions, the properties of uniformly accelerated motion stated above, will be found extremely useful, and especially in cases where approximation only can be easily obtained. But for the fuller illustration of these properties the reader is referred to Robison's Elements of Mechanical Philosophy, p. 38.\n\n38. Supposing the acceleration to be always the same, we conceive of this constancy, that in equal times there are equal increments of velocity; and therefore that the augmentations of velocity are proportional to the times in which they are acquired. That acceleration then, according to this supposition, must be accounted double, or triple, &c., where the velocity acquired is double or triple. And, acceleration being considered as a measurable quantity, the augmentation of velocity uniformly acquired in any given time is its measure.\n\nCOROLLARY.\n\n39. Therefore, accelerations are proportional to the spaces described in equal times, with motions uniformly accelerated from a state of rest. For in this case the spaces are the halves of what would be uniformly described in the same time with the acquired final velocities, and are therefore proportional to these velocities, or to the accelerations, since the velocities were acquired in equal times.\n\n40. It is then said, that accelerations are proportional to the increments of velocity uniformly acquired, directly, and to the times in which they are acquired inversely.\n\n\\[A : a = \\frac{V}{T} : \\frac{v}{t}\\]\n\nThis relation between acceleration, velocity, and time, is also true, in uniformly accelerated motion, with respect to all momentary changes of velocity, as well as to those cases of motion passing through all degrees of velocity from nothing to the final magnitude \\(v\\). For the velocity increasing at the same rate with the time, we have \\(v : v' = t : t'\\); and \\(v\\) and \\(v'\\) express the simultaneous increments of velocity and time.\n\n41. But if the augmentation of velocity be the measure of the acceleration, and therefore proportional to it, and if in uniformly accelerated motions, the velocity increases at the same rate with the times, the increments of velocity are as the accelerations and as the times jointly. Hence the proportional equation\n\n\\[\\frac{v}{v'} = \\frac{a}{a'}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\\frac{v}{v'} = \\frac{a}{a'}.\\]\n\n42. It appears from (39.), that when the velocity has uniformly increased from nothing, the spaces described in equal times are proper measures of acceleration. And in (37.—3.) uniformly accelerated motions, the spaces are as the squares of the times. Therefore, when the acceleration continues the same, the fraction \\(\\frac{s}{t^2}\\) must also remain of the same value, and \\(a\\) is proportional to \\(\\frac{s}{t^2}\\). And therefore, accelerations are proportional to the spaces described with a motion uniformly accelerated from rest, directly, and to the squares of the times inversely.\n\n43. And since \\(a = \\frac{v}{t}\\), we have \\(a = \\frac{v}{v'}\\); but \\(v = \\frac{s}{t}\\),\n\ntherefore \\(a = \\frac{v^2}{s}\\). Therefore we have another measure of acceleration, viz. Accelerations are directly as the squares of the velocities, and inversely as the spaces along which the velocities are uniformly augmented.\n\n44. But when the spaces are equal, we have \\(a = \\frac{v^2}{s}\\), and in uniformly accelerated motions, that is, when \\(a\\) remains constant, the space being increased in any proportion, \\(v^2\\) increases in the same proportion; it follows that \\(v^2\\) increases in the proportion both of the acceleration and of the space. And therefore, in general, we have, \\(v^2 = a s\\). And, as in 41, 42, we shall have \\(v^2 = a s\\), and \\(v^2 = a s - a s'\\), or \\(S = S' - s\\), which may be thus expressed \\(v v' = a s'\\), that is, in a motion uniformly accelerated, the momentary change of the square of the velocity is proportional to the acceleration and to the space jointly. Thus it appears, that the acceleration continued during a given time \\(t\\), or \\(t'\\), produces a certain augmentation of the simple velocity; but the acceleration continued along a given space \\(s\\), or \\(s'\\), produces a certain augmentation of the square of the velocity.\n\n45. But accelerations which are constant and uniform, and such as have been considered, are very rare in the phenomena of nature. They are as variable as velocities, and therefore it is not less difficult to discover their actual measure. By changes of velocity only we obtain any knowledge of the changing cause. From the continual acceleration of a falling body we learn, that the same power which makes it press on the hand, presses it downward, as it falls through the air; and whatever be the rapidity of its descent, it is from observing that it acquires equal increments of velocity in equal times, that we know the downward pressure to be the same.\nIn the same way that we obtain measures of a velocity which is continually varying, we may obtain accurate measures of a similarly varying acceleration. A line may be conceived to increase along with the velocity, and at the same rate; and this rate of increase of velocity is what is called acceleration, in the same way as the rate at which the line increases, is what is called velocity. If, then, we consider the areas (fig. 5.) or the line AD, as representing a velocity; the ordinates to the line eg h, which were demonstrated to be proportional to the rate of variation of the area, will be proportional to the variation of the velocity, that is, to the acceleration.\n\nProp. VII.\n\n46. If the abscissa ad of a curve line egh represent the time of a motion, and if the areas abfe, acge, adhe, &c. are proportional to the velocities at the instants b, c, d, &c., then the ordinates ae, b f, cg, dh, &c. are proportional to the accelerations at the instants a, b, c, d, &c.\n\nBy substituting the word acceleration for the word velocity, the same demonstration may be applied here as in Prop. 6. (28.) From this proposition may be deduced some corollaries of practical use in mechanical discussions.\n\n47. The momentary increments of velocity are as the accelerations, and as the moments jointly.\n\nFor the increment of velocity in the moment cd is accurately represented by the area cdhg, or by the rectangle cdnk; and cd accurately represents the moment. Also, the ultimate ratio of cd to such another ordinate bi, is the ratio of eg to bf; that is, the ratio of the acceleration in the instant c to that in the instant b. And therefore the increment of velocity during the moment pa is to that during the moment cd as pa × ae to cd × dg. Or it may be expressed by the proportional equation v = ai.\n\n48. Conversely. The acceleration a is proportional to v, as in the case when the motion is uniformly accelerated (46.)\n\nAnd as the area of this figure is analogous to the sum of all the inscribed rectangles, when the circumstances of the case admit of its being measured, it may be expressed by fat; and thus is obtained the whole velocity acquired during the time AC, and we say v = fat.\n\nThe intensities (or at least their proportions) of the accelerating power of nature in the different points of the path being frequently known, we wish to discover the velocities in those points. This may be done by the following proposition.\n\nProp. VIII.\n\n49. If the abscissa AE (fig. 8.) of a line ace be the space along which a body moves with a motion continually varied, and if the ordinates Aa, Bb, Cc, &c. be proportional to the accelerations in the points A, B, C, &c., then the areas ABba, ADda, AEea, &c. are proportional to the augmentations of the square of the velocity in A at the points B, D, E, &c.\n\nTake BC, CD, as two very small portions of the line AE, and draw bf, cg, parallel to AE. Then, supposing the acceleration Bb, to continue through the space BC, the rectangle BbfC will express the augmentation made on the square of the velocity in B. In the same way CcgD will express the augmentation of the square of the velocity in C; and, in like manner, the rectangles inscribed in the remainder of the figure will express the increments of the squares of the velocity acquired, while the body moves over the corresponding portions of the abscissa. And, therefore, the whole augmentation of the square of the velocity in A (should there be any velocity in that point) during the time of moving from A to B, will constitute the aggregate of these partial increments. The same thing must be affirmed of the motion from B to E. And, when the subdivision of AE is carried on without end, it is plain that the ultimate ratio of the area AEea to the aggregate of inscribed rectangles, is that of equality; that is, when the acceleration varies continually, the area ABba will express the increment made on the square of the initial velocity in A, while the body moves along AB; and the same must be affirmed with respect to the motion along BE. And, therefore, the intercepted areas ABba, BDdb, DEed, are proportional to the changes made on the squares of the velocities in the points A, B, and D.\n\nCorollaries.\n\n50. Cor. 1. If the body had no velocity in A, the areas ABba, ADda, &c. are proportional to the squares of the velocity acquired in the points B, D, &c.\n\nCor. 2. The momentary change on the square of the velocity, is as the acceleration and increment of the space jointly; or we have v = ai.\n\nCor. 3. v being equal to half the increment of the square of the velocity, it follows that the area AEea, or the fluent fat is only equal to \\(\\frac{V^2 - v^2}{2}\\), taking v and V as the velocities in A and E.\n\n51. What has now been said of the acceleration of motion, is equally applicable to motions that are retarded, whether these motions be uniform or unequal. The momentary variations in this case are to be taken as decrements of velocity instead of increments. A moving body, subject to uniform retardation till it come to rest, will continue in motion during a time proportional to the initial velocity; and describe a space proportional to the square of this velocity; and the space which is so described, is one half what it would have been if the initial velocity had continued undiminished.\n\nSect. III. Of Compound Motions.\n\n52. Having obtained the marks and measures of every variation of velocity, we are now to discover the changes of direction in similar characteristics for every change of direction. In the above investigation of the general marks of any change of motion, it is plain that the change being the same in any two or more instances, the sensible marks must also be the same, whatever may have been the previous\nprevious condition of the moving bodies. In every case of change, some circumstance in the difference between the former motions and the new motions must be observed, which is exactly the same both in respect of velocity and direction. One of the bodies then may be supposed to have been at rest; and thus the change produced on it, is the motion which it has acquired, or the determination to this motion. Therefore, a change of motion is itself a motion, or determination to motion.\n\nIn the above case, it is the new motion only; but it is not the new motion in every other case. For supposing the previous condition of the body to have been different from that of a body at rest, and supposing the same change produced on it, the new condition of the one body must be different from the new condition of the other. The change, therefore, being the same in both cases, the new condition cannot be that change. But, when the same change happens in any previous motion, the difference between the former motion and the new motion, must indicate something that is equivalent to the motion produced in a body previously at rest, or the same with that motion, this body having received the same change. And the difference between the new motions of the two bodies will be such as shall indicate the difference between the previous conditions of each body. The change of motion then is itself a motion; and this being assumed as a principle, we are now to endeavour to discover a motion, which alone shall produce that difference from the former motion, which, in all cases, is observed in the new motion. This is to be considered as the proper characteristic of the change.\n\nThe following motions may serve as an illustration of these conditions. Let it be supposed that the straight line AB (fig. 9.) lies east and west, and that it is crossed by the line AC from north to south. Suppose this line AC to be a rod or wire, and to be carried along the line AB in one minute, but always in the same position, that is, lying north and south. The end of the rod or wire A having moved uniformly one-third of AB at the end of 20\", it will be in the position D d; at the end of 40\" it will have the position E e; and at the end of the minute it will be in the position B b.\n\nLet the line AB, in the mean time, (supposing it also to be material) be uniformly moved from north to south, and always parallel to its first position AB. When it has passed over one-third of AC, at the end of 20\", it will be in the position m n; at the end of 40\" it will have the position o p, and Ao is two-thirds of AC. At the end of the minute, it will have the position C c b. It is evident that the common intersection of these two lines will be always in the diagonal A b of the parallelogram AC b B; for the parallelogram A m D is similar to the parallelogram A C b B, because AD : AB = Am : AC; and, in like manner, Ao : E is a parallelogram similar to AC b B. Therefore, these parallelograms are about a common diagonal A b.\n\nAgain, the motion of the point of intersection of these lines is uniform; for AD : AB = A d : A b, and AE : AB = A e : A b, &c. Therefore the spaces A d, A e, A b are proportional to the times.\n\nThus the intersection of two lines having each a uniform motion in the direction of the other, moves uniformly in the direction of the diagonal of the parallelogram, which is formed by the lines in their first or last position; and the velocity of the intersection is to the velocity of each of the motions of the lines as the diagonal is to the side in the direction of which the motions are made. This motion of the intersection is very properly said to be compounded of two motions in the direction of the sides; for which the point d of the line D d moves eastward, the same point d of the line m n is at the same instant moving southward. The point d, therefore, may be considered as a point of both lines, partaking in every instant of both motions. The motion along A b then contains both motions along A B and A C, and being identical with a motion compounded of these motions, indicates both, or the determination to both. In every situation of the point of intersection, its velocity is compounded of the velocity A B and A C. A body, therefore, whose motion continued unchanged, would have described A B in one minute; but when it reaches the point A, it turns aside, and describes A b uniformly in the same time; the change then which the body sustains in the point A is a motion A C. For suppose the body had been at rest in the point A, and it is observed to describe A C in one minute, the motion A C is the change which it has sustained. The motion A b is not the change: for if A F had been the primitive motion, the same motion A b would have been the result of compounding with it the motion A G. But since A F is different from A B, the same change cannot produce the same new conditions. But, farther, there is no other motion which, by compounding it with A B, will produce the motion A b; and the motion A C is the only circumstance of difference between changing the motion A B into the diagonal motion A b, and giving the motion A C to a body which was previously at rest.\n\nFrom these conditions it follows, that a change of motion, is that motion, which by composition with the previous state of motion, produces the new motion.\n\nThis composition of motion has been considered in another way. While a body is supposed to move uniformly in the direction A B, the space in which this motion is performed, is supposed to be carried in the direction A C. But it cannot be conceived that any portion of space is moved from its place. A distinct notion of this composition may be obtained, by supposing a person walking along a line A B, while this is drawn on a piece of ice, and the ice is floating in the direction A C. But the motion on moving ice is not precisely a composition of two determinations to motion; for this is completed in the first instant. When the motion in the direction and with the velocity A b begins, no further exertion is needed; the motion continues, and A b is described. It serves, however, to exhibit to the mind the mathematical composition of two motions. In the result of this combination, all the characteristics of the two determinations are to be found; for the point of intersection, in whatever way it is considered, partakes of both motions.\n\nThus a general characteristic of a change of motion is obtained, and this corresponds with the mark and measure of every moving cause; for it is the very motion which it is conceived to produce. It may perhaps even be considered as the foundation of former measures; for in every acceleration, retardation, or deflection, there is a new motion compounded with the former.\nSect. II.\n\nDYNAMICS.\n\nWhat is taken for the beginning of motion in every observation of surrounding bodies, is nothing more than a change induced on a motion already produced.\n\n56. The actual composition of motion being so general in the phenomena of the universe, it obtains in all motions and changes of motion produced or observed, and the characteristic which has been affirmed of a change of motion being the same, whatever may have been the previous motion, and this being equally applicable to simple motions, it is evident that a knowledge of the general results of this composition of motion will be of essential service in acquiring a knowledge of mechanical nature.\n\n57. The following is the general theorem to which all others may be reduced.\n\nPROP. IX.\n\nTwo uniform motions, having the directions and velocities represented by the sides AB, AC, of a parallelogram, compose a uniform motion in the diagonal. The demonstration of this has been already given. The motion of the point of intersection of these two lines, each moving uniformly in all its points, in the direction of the other, is, in every instant, composed of the two motions. It is the same as if a point described AB uniformly, while AB is carried uniformly in the direction AC. This motion is along the diagonal Ab, and it has been already shown to be uniform. And, because AB and Ab are described in the same time, the velocities of the motions along AB, AC, and Ab are proportional to those lines.\n\nCOROLLARIES.\n\nCor. 1. The motion Ab, which is compounded of the two simple motions AB and AC, is in the same plane with these motions. For a parallelogram lies all in the same plane.\n\nCor. 2. The motion Ab may be produced by the composition of any two uniform motions having the direction and velocities which are represented by the sides of any parallelogram AFbG, or ACbB, which has Ab for its diagonal.\n\n58. Cases are not unfrequent in which the directions of two simple motions composing an observed motion may be discovered; but the proportion of the velocities is unknown. This velocity may be ascertained by means of this last proposition. For the direction of the three motions, namely, the two simple and the compound motions, determines not only the species of parallelogram, but also the ratio of the sides. Again, in those cases in which the direction and the velocity of one of the simple motions are known, and therefore its proportion to that of the observed compound motion, the direction and velocity of the other may be also found by means of the same proposition; because from these data the parallelogram may be determined.\n\n59. This motion in the diagonal is called the equivalent motion, or the resolving motion; for it is equivalent to the combined motions in the sides. Thus, if the moving body first describes AB, and then Bb or AC, it will be in the same point, as if it had described Ab, namely, in the point b.\n\n60. It is often highly useful in investigations of this kind to substitute such motions for an observed motion, as will produce it by composition. This has been denominated the resolution of motions. By this manner of proceeding, a ship's change of situation at the end of a day, having failed in different courses, is computed. Thus the distance failed to the eastward or the westward, as well as that to the northward or southward, on each course, is observed and marked. The whole of the eastings, and the whole of the southings, are added together; and then it is supposed that the ship has failed for the whole day on that course, which would be produced by combining the same easting and southing.\n\n61. It is also useful to consider how much the body has been advanced in a certain direction by means of the observed motion; let us suppose in the direction AB (fig. 10.) The motion CD is first considered as composed of a motion CE parallel to the given line AB, and another motion CF perpendicular to AB. CD is the diagonal of a parallelogram CEDF, one of whose sides CE is parallel to AB, and the other CF is perpendicular to AB. It is evident, that the body has advanced in the direction of AB as much as if it had moved from G to H, instead of moving from C to D, so that the motion CF has no effect either in obstructing or promoting the progress in AB. This is called estimating a motion in a given direction, or reducing it to that direction.\n\n62. A motion is also said to be estimated in a given plane, when it is considered as composed of a motion perpendicular to the plane, and of another parallel to it. In a given plane ABCD (fig. 11.), let EF be a motion compounded of a motion GE perpendicular to the plane, and EH parallel to it. For if the lines GE, FH are drawn perpendicular to the plane, they cut it in two points e and f, and EH is parallel to ef.\n\n63. In the same way a compound motion may be formed of any number of motions. Let AB, AC, AD, AE, &c. (fig. 12.) be any number of motions, of which the motion AF is compounded. The motion which is the result of this composition is thus ascertained. The motion AG is compounded of AB and AC; and the motion AG compounded with AD, gives the motion AH; which latter being compounded with AE, produces the motion AF. And the same place, or final situation F, will be found by supposing the different motions AB, AC, AD, AE, to be performed successively. The moving body first describes AB; then BG, equal and parallel to AC; then GH, equal and parallel to AD; and lastly, HF, equal and parallel to AE. In this case it is not requisite that all the motions lie in the same plane.\n\n64. Three motions which have the direction and proportions of the sides of a parallelopiped, compose a motion having the direction of its diagonal. Let AB, AC, AD (fig. 13.), be these motions, the compound motion is in the diagonal AF of the parallelopiped; because AB and AC compose the motion AE; and AE and AD compose the motion AF.\n\nIt is in this way that the mine-surveyor proceeds. He sets down a gallery of a mine, not directly by its real position, but marks the easting and southing, the northing and fouthing, as well as its dip and rise. All these measures are referred to three lines, of which one runs east and west, one north and south, and a third is perpendicular. These three lines are obviously analogous.\nCompound gous to the angular boundaries of a rectangular box, as AC, AB, AD.\n\n65. The composition of uniform motions only has yet been considered. But it is easy to conceive that any motions may be compounded. It is a case of this kind when a man is supposed to walk on a field of ice along a crooked path, while the ice floats down a crooked stream. Suppose a uniform motion in the direction AB (fig. 14.), to be compounded with a uniformly accelerated motion in the direction AC. A stone falling from the mast head of a ship, while the ship moves uniformly forward in the direction AB, affords an example of this kind of motion; for the stone will be observed to fall parallel to a plummet hung from the mast head. But the real motion of the stone is a parabolic arch ABFG, which AB touches in A; for while the mast head describes the equal lines AB, BF, FG, the stone has fallen to B and C and D, and the line AC is in the positions BB', FF', GG', so that AC is four times AB; and AC is nine times AB. Therefore AB, AC, AD, are as the squares of BC, CF, CG, and the line ABFG is a parabola.\n\n66. Knowing the direction and velocities of each of the simple motions in any instant, of which two motions, however variable, are compounded, we may discover the direction and velocities of the compound motions in that instant. For it may be supposed that each motion at that instant proceeds unchanged; a parallelogram is then constructed; the sides of which have the directions and proportions of the velocities of the simple motions; and the diagonal of this parallelogram will express the direction and velocity of the compound motion. But on the other hand, if the direction and velocity of the compound motion, with the directions of each of the simple motions, be known, we may discover their velocities.\n\n67. In cases where a curvilinear motion as ABC (fig. 15.), is the result of two motions compounded, of which the direction is known to be AD and AE, we discover the velocities of the three motions in any point B, by drawing the tangent BF, and the ordinate BG, parallel to one of the simple motions, and from any point H in that ordinate drawing HF parallel to the other motion, and cutting the tangent in the point F. The three velocities are in the proportion of the three lines FH, HB, and FB.\n\n68. As the motions which are observed in nature are very different from what they are taken to be, it is not easy to avoid mistakes with respect to the changes of motion, and consequently with respect to the inference of its cause. Without considering the real motion of any body, we are apt to judge only of the change of distance and direction in relation to ourselves. Thus it is that our inferences with regard to the planetary motions are very different from the motions themselves, if the rapid motion of our earth be considered.\n\nProp. X.\n\n69. The motion of one body in relation to another body, or as it is seen from another body, which is also in motion, is compounded of its own real motion, and the opposite of the real motion of the second body.\n\nLet A (fig. 16.) be a body in motion from A to C, as seen from B, which is another body in motion from B to D the motion of A is compounded of its own real motion, and of the opposite to the real motion of B continually deflected.\n\nJoin AB, and draw AE equal and parallel to BD. Complete the parallelogram ACFE, and join ED and DC. Produce EA, and make AL equal to AE or BD. Complete the parallelogram LACK, and draw AK and BK. If then A had moved along AE while B moves along BD, the two bodies would have been at E and D, at the same time, and would have the same relative situation; they would have the same bearing and distance as before. And if the spectator in B is not sensible of his own motion, A will appear not to have changed its place. In the same way two ships becalmed in an unknown current, seem to the persons on board to be at rest. The real position, therefore, and distance DC, are the same with BK; and if a spectator in B imagines himself at rest, the line AK will be taken as the motion of A. And this motion, it is obvious, is composed of the motion AC its real motion, and the motion AL which is the equal and opposite motion to that of BD.\n\nAgain, if BH be drawn equal and opposite to AC, and the parallelogram BHGD be completed, and BG and AG be drawn, the diagonal BG will be the motion of B as it is seen from A. Now as KAGB is a parallelogram, the relative situation and distances of A and B at the end of the motion will appear to be the same as in the former case. For B appears to have moved along BG, which is equal and opposite to AK. Hence it follows, that the apparent or relative motions of two bodies are equal and opposite, whatever their real motions may be; and therefore they do not afford any information of their real motions.\n\n70. Suppose equal and parallel motions are compounded with all and each of the motions of any number of bodies, moving in any manner of way, then their relative motions are not consequently changed. For if it be compounded with the motion of any one of the bodies which may be called A, the real motion of this body is changed; but its apparent motion as seen from another body B, is compounded of the real change, and of the opposite to the real change in A, which therefore destroys that change, and the relative motion of A is the same as before. Thus it is that the motions in the cabin of a ship are not affected by the ship's progressive motion; and the motion of the earth round the sun produces no perceptible effect on the relative motions on its surface. And indeed it is only by observing other bodies which are not affected by these common motions, and to which we refer as to fixed points, that we arrive at any knowledge of them.\n\nSect. IV. Of Motions continually Deflected.\n\n71. Curvilinear motions are cases of continual deflection. They are susceptible of great varieties; and the investigation of their modifications and chief properties is attended with no small difficulty. Uniform motion in a circular arch is an example of the simplest case of curvilinear motion; for here the deflections from rectilinear motion are equal in equal times. If, however, the velocity be increased, the momentary deflection must also be augmented; for a greater arch will be described, and the end of this greater arch is\nWhen a uniform rectilineal motion \\( AB \\) (fig. 17.) is deflected into another \\( BC \\), the linear deflection is affected by drawing a line from the point \\( c \\), at which point the body would have arrived, had it not been deflected to the point \\( C \\) at which it has arrived. The result is the same, whether the lines \\( dD \\) or \\( cC \\) be drawn in this manner; for being proportional to \\( Bc \\), they always give the same measure of the velocities; and here the lines of deflection are all parallel, indicating the direction of the deflection in the point \\( B \\). But this is not the case in any curvilinear motion. It rarely happens that \\( dD : cC = Bc \\); and it is never found that \\( dD : cC = Bc \\). We cannot therefore discover which lines should be taken for the indication of the direction of the deflection at \\( B \\), or for the measure of its magnitude. A greater velocity then, in the same curve, produces a greater deflection, but if the path be more incurved, an arch of the same length described with the same velocity, causes a farther deviation from the tangent. If therefore a body have a uniform motion in a curve of variable curvature, the deflection is greatest where the curvature is greatest.\n\nThus it appears that the direction and measure of the deflections by which a body deviates continually into a curvilinear path cannot be ascertained, but by investigating the ultimate positions and ratios of the lines, which join the points of the curve with the simultaneous points of the tangent, as the points \\( d \\) and \\( C \\) are taken nearer to \\( B \\). In some cases, but rarely, the lines joining the simultaneous points are parallel. But in most cases the direction of the deflection is discovered by observing what direction it approximates. The following proposition which was discovered by Newton is of great importance in this investigation.\n\n**Proposition XI.**\n\nIf a body describe a curve line \\( ABCDEF \\) (fig. 18.) being in the same plane, and if in this plane there be a point \\( S \\) so situated, that the lines \\( SA, SB, SC, \\ldots \\) drawn to the curve, cut off areas \\( ASB, ASC, ASD, \\ldots \\) proportional to the times of describing the arches \\( AB, AC, AD, \\ldots \\), then the deflections are always directed to the point \\( S \\).\n\nSuppose first that the body describes the polygon \\( ABCDEF \\), formed of the chords of this curve, and that it describes each chord uniformly, and is deflected only in the angles \\( B, C, D, \\ldots \\). Suppose also that the sides of the polygon are described in equal times, so that, according to the hypothesis, the triangles \\( ASB, BSC, CSD, \\ldots \\) are all equal. Continue the chords \\( AB, BC, \\ldots \\) beyond the arches, making \\( Be \\) equal to \\( AR \\), and \\( Cd \\) equal to \\( BC \\), and so on. Join \\( cC, dD, \\ldots \\), and draw \\( cS, dS, \\ldots \\); draw \\( CB \\) parallel to \\( cB \\) or \\( BA \\), cutting \\( BS \\) in \\( b \\), and join \\( bA \\), and draw \\( CA \\), cutting \\( BB \\) in \\( o \\). And lastly, make a similar construction at \\( E \\).\n\nThen, because \\( cB \\) is equal to \\( BA \\), the triangles \\( ASB \\) and \\( BSc \\) are equal, and therefore \\( BS \\) is equal to \\( BSC \\). And being on the same base \\( SB \\), they are therefore between the same parallels; that is, \\( cC \\) is parallel to \\( BS \\), and \\( BC \\) is the diagonal of a parallelogram \\( BbCc \\). The motion \\( BC \\) is therefore compounded of the motions \\( Bc \\) and \\( Bb \\), and \\( Bb \\) is the deflection, by which the motion \\( Bc \\) is changed into the motion \\( BC \\); and therefore the deflection in \\( B \\) is directed to \\( S \\). By similar reasoning it may be shown that \\( Ff \\), or \\( Ei \\), is the deflection at \\( E \\), and is likewise directed to \\( S \\); and the same demonstration will apply to every angle of the polygon.—This point \\( S \\) has been called the centre of deflection.\n\nIf the sides of the polygon are diminished, and their number infinitely increased, the demonstration remains the same, and continues, when the polygon coalesces with the curvilinear area, and its sides with the curvilinear arch.\n\nBut when the whole areas are proportional to the times, equal areas are described in equal times. In such motion therefore, the deflections are always directed to \\( S \\).\n\n**Proposition XII.**\n\nIf the deflection by which a curve line is described, be continually directed to a fixed point, the figure will be in one plane, and areas will be described round that point proportional to the times. Let \\( ADF \\) be the curve line described, and let the deflections be directed to the point \\( S \\), this curve line is in the same plane. For \\( BC \\) is the diagonal of a parallelogram, and is in the plane of \\( SB \\) and \\( Be \\); and \\( cC \\) is parallel to \\( BS \\), and the triangles \\( SBC, SBe, \\) and \\( SBA, \\) are equal. But equal areas are described in equal times; and therefore areas are described proportional to the times.\n\n**Corollaries.**\n\n1. The velocities in different points of the curve are inversely proportional to the perpendiculars \\( Sr \\) and \\( St \\) (fig. 19.) drawn from \\( S \\) on the tangents \\( Ar, Et \\) in those points of the curve. For since the elementary triangles \\( ASB, ESF, \\) are equal, their bases \\( AB, EF, \\) are inversely as their altitudes \\( Sr, St. \\) And these bases being described in equal times are as the velocities, and ultimately coincide with the tangents at \\( A \\) and \\( E; \\) and therefore the velocity in \\( A \\) is to that in \\( E \\) as \\( Sr \\) to \\( Sr. \\)\n\n2. The angular velocities round \\( S \\) are inversely as the squares of the distances. For if we describe round the centre \\( S \\) the small arches \\( Ba, Fa, \\) they may be considered as perpendiculars on \\( SA \\) and \\( SE. \\) Describe also with the distance \\( SF \\) the arch \\( gh. \\) It is evident that \\( gh \\) is to \\( Fa \\) as the angle \\( ASB \\) to the angle \\( ESF. \\) And since the areas \\( ASB, ESF \\) are equal, we have \\( Ba : Fa = SE : SA. \\)\n\nBut \\( gh : Fa = SE : SA. \\)\n\nTherefore \\( gh : Fa = SE^2 : SA^2. \\)\n\nAnd \\( ASB : ESF = SE^2 : SA^2. \\)\n\nLet us now proceed to determine the magnitude of the deflection, or to compare its magnitude in any two points, as for example the magnitude in \\( B \\) (fig. 18.) with its magnitude in \\( E. \\) The deflection in \\( B \\) is to that in \\( E \\) as the line \\( Bb \\) to the line \\( Ei; \\) for \\( Bb \\) and \\( Ei \\) are the motions, which, by being compounded with the motions \\( Be \\) and \\( Ef, \\) make the body describe \\( BC \\) and \\( EF. \\) And therefore when the sides of the polygon\nMotions\n\nDYNAMICS.\n\nPart II.\n\n74. Motions are infinitely diminished, the ultimate ratio of continually Bb to Ei is the ratio of the deflection at B to the deflection at E.\n\nTo obtain a convenient expression of this ultimate motion, let ABCXYZ be a circle which passes through the points A, B, C. Draw BSZ through the point S, and draw CZ, AZ. Now the triangles BCb and AZC are similar, for CB was drawn parallel to CB or BA; and therefore the angle CB is equal to the alternate angle bBA or ZEA, which is equal to the angle ZCA, because it is subtended by the same chord ZA; and because they stand on the same chord CZ, CBb, or CBZ, is equal to CAZ. And therefore the remaining angles CB and CAZ are equal, and the triangles are similar. Therefore Bb : CA = BC : AZ.\n\nNow if the sides of the polygon are continually diminished, the points A and C continually approach to B, and CA continually approaches to cA, or to 2CB, or 2CB, and is ultimately equal to it; and AZ is ultimately equal to BZ.\n\nTherefore ultimately, Bb : BC = BC : BZ, and\n\n\\[ Bb \\times BZ = 2BC^2, \\text{ and } Bb = \\frac{2BC^2}{BZ}. \\]\n\nAlso, at the point E, we have Ei ultimately equal to 2EF, for Ei is that chord of the circle through D, E, and F, which passes through i.\n\nTherefore Bb : Ei = 2BC^2 : 2EF.\n\nThe ultimate circle, when the three points A, B, C, coalesce, is called the circle of equal curvature, or the equicurve circle, which coalesces with the curve in B in the closest manner; and the chord BZ of this circle, having the direction of the deflection in B, is called its deflective chord. And since BC and EF are described in equal times, they are proportional to the velocities in B and E. This proposition therefore may be expressed as follows.\n\nIn curvilinear motions, the deflections in different points of the curve, are proportional to the square of the velocities in those points directly, and to the deflective chords of the equicurve circles inversely.\n\nIt ought however, to be remarked, that this theorem is not limited to curvilinear motions, in which the deflections tend always to the same fixed point; it may be extended to all curvilinear motions whatever. A symbolical expression of this theorem will be convenient. If therefore the deflective chord of the equicurve circle be represented by c, and the deflection by d, the theorem may be thus expressed.\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{v^2}{c}, \\text{ or } d = \\frac{2\\text{arch}^2}{c}. \\]\n\n76. The line Bb is the linear deflection by which the uniform motion in the chord AB is changed into a uniform motion in the chord BC, or it is the deviation cC from the point to which the moving body would have arrived, if the deflection at B had not taken place. In the case of curvilinear motion which we are now considering, the lines Bb and Bc are expressions of the measures of the velocities of these motions. Bc is to Bb as the velocity of the progressive motion is to the velocity of the deflection, generated in the time that the arch BC is described. But the deflection in the arch has been continual, and like acceleration, it may be measured by the velocity generated during any moment of time. It may therefore be measured by the velocity generated during the time the arch BC is described. This measure will therefore be double of the space through which the body is actually deflected from the tangent in B in that time. The space described will be BO, or only one-half of Bb. This is exactly what happens; for the tangent is ultimately parallel to OC, and it bisects cC; therefore the velocity gradually generated is that which constitutes the polygonal motion in the chords, although the deflection from the tangent to the curve is only half of the deflection from the produced chord to the curve.\n\n77. In any point of a curvilinear motion, the velocity is that which would be generated by the deflection in that point, if continued through one-fourth of the deflective chord of the equicurve circle. Take x for the space along which a body is to be accelerated that it may acquire the velocity BC.\n\nWe have Bb^2, or 4BO : BC^2 = B : x (37.1); and therefore \\( x = \\frac{BC^2 \\times BO}{4BO^2} = \\frac{BC^2}{4BO} \\), or \\( x = \\frac{BC^2}{BO} \\).\n\nBO : BC = BC : 4x. But BO : BC = BC : BZ; therefore \\( x = \\frac{1}{4} BZ \\).\n\n78. We have now obtained characteristic expressions, or marks and measures of the principal affections of motion. These expressions may be brought into one view as follows.\n\nThe acceleration \\( a \\) is \\( \\frac{v}{t} \\) (48.), or \\( \\frac{v}{s} \\) (49.), or \\( \\frac{s}{t^2} \\) (42.).\n\nThe momentary variation of velocity \\( v = a t \\) (48.).\n\nThe momentary variation of the square of velocity \\( 2v = 2a^2 \\) (49.).\n\nThe momentary deflection \\( d = \\frac{\\text{arc}^2}{\\text{chord}} \\) (76.)\n\nThe deflective velocity \\( = \\frac{2v^2}{c} \\) (75.).\n\n79. But for the application of these doctrines, it is necessary to select some point in any body of sensible magnitude, or in any system of bodies, by whose position or motion, a distinct and accurate notion of the position or motion of the body or system may be formed. The condition by which the propriety of this selection is ascertained, is, that the position, distance, or motion of this point shall be the medium or average of the positions, distances, and motions of every particle of matter in the aggregate or system.\n\nThis will happen, if the point be so situated, that Center of when a plane is made to pass through it in any direction whatever, and perpendiculars being drawn to this plane from every particle of matter in this aggregate or system, the sum of the perpendiculars on the one side of the plane is equal to the sum of the perpendiculars on the other side. And that such a point, which is called the centre of position, may be found in every body, is proved by the following demonstration.\n\nFor let P (fig. 20.) be a point so situated, and let QR be the section of a plane perpendicular to the paper, and at any distance from it, the distance PP' of the point P from this plane is the average of all the distances of each particle from it. Let the plane APB pass through P, and parallel to QR. The distance CS\nMotions CS of any particle C from the plane QR is equal to continually DS—DC, or to Pρ—DC. And the distance GT of a particle G on the other side of APB, is equal to HT+GH, or to Pρ+GH. Let n be the number of particles on that side of AB which is nearest to QR, and let o be the number of particles on the other side of AB. Let m be the number of particles in the whole body; we have then \\( m = n + o \\). It is evident that the sum of all the distances of all the particles such as CS, is \\( n \\times P\\rho \\)—the sum of all the distances, such as CD. Also the sum of all the distances of the particles, such as G, is \\( o \\times P\\rho \\), \\( + \\) the sum of the distances GH. And therefore the sum of both sets is \\( n + o \\times P\\rho \\), \\( + \\) the sum of GH—the sum of DC, or \\( m \\times P\\rho \\), \\( + \\) the sum of GH—the sum of DC. But by the supposed property of the point P, the sum of GH wanting the sum of DC is nothing; and therefore \\( m \\times P\\rho \\) is the sum of all the distances, and \\( P\\rho \\) is the nth part of this sum, or the average distance.\n\nSuppose the body to have changed both its place and its position with respect to the plane QR, and that P (fig. 21.) is still the same point of the body, and \\( P\\rho \\) a plane parallel to QR. Make \\( P\\rho \\) equal to \\( P\\rho \\) of fig. 20. It is plain that \\( P\\rho \\) is still the average distance, and that \\( m \\times P\\rho \\) is the sum of all the present distances of the particles from QR, and that \\( m \\times P\\rho \\) is the sum of all the former distances. Therefore \\( m \\times P\\rho \\) is the sum of all the changes of distance, or the whole quantity of motion estimated in the direction \\( P\\rho \\). \\( P\\rho \\) is the nth part of this sum, and is therefore the average motion in this direction. The point P has therefore been properly selected; and its position, and distance, and motion, in respect of any plane, is a proper representation of the situation and motion of the whole.\n\nHence it follows, that if any particle C (fig. 20.) moves from C to N, in the line CS, the centre of the whole will be transferred from P to Q, so that PQ is the nth part of CN; for the sum of all the distances has been diminished by the quantity CN, and therefore the average distance must be diminished by the nth part of CN, or \\( PQ = \\frac{CN}{m} \\).\n\nBut it may be doubted whether there is in every body a point, and but one point, such that if a plane passes through it, in any direction whatsoever, the sum of all the distances of the particles on one side of this plane is equal to the sum of all the distances on the other.\n\nIt is easy to show that such a point may be found, with respect to a plane parallel to QR. For if the sum of all the distances DC exceed the sum of all the distances GH, we have only to pass the plane AB a little nearer to QR, but still parallel to it. This will diminish the sum of the lines DC, and increase the sum of the lines GH. We may do this till the sums are equal.\n\nIn like manner we can do this with respect to a plane LM (also perpendicular to the paper), perpendicular to the plane AB. The point wanted is somewhere in the plane AB, and somewhere in the plane LM. Therefore it is somewhere in the line in which these two planes intersect each other. This line passes through the point P of the paper where the two lines AB and LM cut each other. These two lines represent planes, but are, in fact, only the intersection of those planes with the plane of the paper. Part of the body must be conceived as being above the paper, and part of it behind or below the paper. The plane of the paper therefore divides the body into two parts. It may be situated, therefore, that the sum of all the distances from it to the particles lying above it shall be equal to the sum of all the distances of those which are below it. Therefore the situation of the point P is now determined, namely, at the common intersection of three planes perpendicular to each other. It is evident, that this point alone can have the condition required in respect of these three planes.\n\nIt still remains to be determined whether the same condition will hold true for the point thus found, in respect to any other plane passing through it; that is, whether the sum of all the perpendiculars on one side of this fourth plane is equal to the sum of all the perpendiculars on the other side.\n\nLet AGHB (fig. 22.), AXYB, and CDFE, be three planes intersecting each other perpendicularly in the point C; and let CIKL be any other plane, intersecting the first in the line CI, and the second in the line CL. Let P be any particle of matter in the body or system. Draw PM, PO, PR, perpendicular to the first three planes respectively, and let PR, when produced, meet the oblique plane in V; draw MN, ON, perpendicular to CB. They will meet in one point N. Then PMNO is a rectangular parallelogram. Also draw MQ perpendicular to CE, and therefore parallel to AB, and meeting CI in S. Draw SV; also draw ST perpendicular to VP. It is evident that SV is parallel to CL, and that STRQ and STPM are rectangles.\n\nAll the perpendiculars, such as PR, on one side of the plane CDFE, being equal to all those on the other side, they may be considered as compensating each other; the one being considered as positive or additive quantities, the other as negative or subtractive. There is no difference between their sums, and the sum of both sets may be called o or nothing. The same must be affirmed of all the perpendiculars PM, and of all the perpendiculars PO.\n\nEvery line, such as RT, or its equal QS, is in a certain invariable ratio to its corresponding QC, or its equal PO. Therefore the positive lines RT are compensated by the negative, and the sum total is nothing.\n\nEvery line, such as TV, is in a certain invariable ratio to its corresponding ST, or its equal PM, and therefore their sum total is nothing.\n\nTherefore the sum of all the lines PV is nothing; but each is in an invariable ratio to a corresponding perpendicular from P on the oblique plane CIKL. Therefore the sum of all the positive perpendiculars on this plane is equal to the sum of all the negative perpendiculars, and the proposition is demonstrated, viz. that in every body, or system of bodies, there is a point such, that if a plane be passed through it in any direction whatsoever, the sum of all the perpendiculars on one side of the plane is equal to the sum of all the perpendiculars on the other side.\n\nSo. If A and B (fig. 23.) be the centres of position of two bodies, whose quantities of matter (or numbers of equal particles) are \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the centre C lies in the straight line joining A and B, and AC : CB = \\( a : b \\); or its distance from the centres of each are inversely as their quantities of matter. For let \\( \\alpha C \\beta \\) be any plane passing...\nDYNAMICS.\n\nOf Moving passing through C. Draw \\( A_a, B_b \\), perpendicular to this plane. Then we have \\( a \\times A_a = b \\times B_b \\), and \\( A_a : B_b = a : b \\), and by similarity of triangles, \\( CA : CB = a : b \\).\n\nIf a third body D, whose quantity of matter is d, be added, the common centre of position E of the three bodies is in the straight line DC, joining the centre D of the third body with the centre C of the other two, and \\( DE : EC = a + b : d \\). For, passing the plane \\( E_x \\) through E, and drawing the perpendiculars \\( D_x, C_x \\), the sum of the perpendiculars from D is \\( d \\times D_x \\); and the sum of the perpendiculars from A and B is \\( a + b \\times C_x \\), and we have \\( d \\times D_x = a + b \\times C_x \\); and therefore \\( DE : EC = a + b : d \\).\n\nIn like manner, if a fourth body be added, the common centre is in the line joining the fourth with the centre of the other three, and its distance from this centre and from the fourth is inversely as the quantities of matter; and so on for any number of bodies.\n\n81. If all the particles of any system be moving uniformly, in straight lines, in any directions, and with any velocities whatever, the centre of the system is either moving uniformly in a straight line, or is at rest.\n\nFor, let m be the number of particles in the system. Suppose any particle to move uniformly in any direction. It is evident from the reasoning in a former paragraph, that the motion of the common centre is the \\( m^{th} \\) part of this motion, and is in the same direction. The same must be said of every particle. Therefore the motion of the centre is the motion which is compounded of the \\( m^{th} \\) part of the motion of each particle.\n\nPART II. OF MOVING FORCES.\n\n84. HAVING in the former part considered the general doctrine of motion, which is the foundation of mechanical investigations, we now proceed to treat of moving forces or dynamics, properly so called.\n\nIt has been already observed, that dynamics includes the abstract doctrine of moving forces, or the necessary results of the relations of our thought concerning motion, the immediate causes of motion, and its changes; and that from the changes observed, we infer agency in nature; and in these changes we are to discover what we know of their causes.\n\n85. When we cast our eyes around us, it cannot escape observation, that the changes which we perceive in the state or condition of any body in respect of motion, are constantly and distinctly related to the situation and distance of other bodies. The motions of the moon, or of a stone projected through the air, have a palpable relation to the earth; the motions of the tides have also an obvious relation to the moon; and the motions of a piece of iron have a palpable dependence on a magnet. The vicinity of the one of these bodies seems to be the occasion, at least, of the motions of the other; and the causes of these motions have an evident connection with, or dependence on, the other body. Such dependences have been called the mechanical relations of bodies. They are indications of properties or distinguishing qualities. They accompany the bodies wherever they are, and are usually conceived to be inherent in them. They at least ascertain and determine what is called the mechanical nature of bodies.\n\n86. The mutual relation of bodies is differently considered according to the interest we may have in the phenomenon. The cause of the approach of the iron bodies different to the magnet is generally ascribed to the magnet. It is said to attract the iron. The approach of a stone to the earth is ascribed to the stone. It is said to tend to the earth. But it is probable that the procedure of nature is the same in both; that both bodies are affected alike, and that the property is distinctive of both. For in all cases that have been observed, the indicating phenomenon is equally connected with both bodies; as in the case of magnetism the magnet and the iron approach each other; and an electrified body and another body near it approach each other. This property is therefore equally inherent in both bodies, between which there is a mutual attraction. But, according to some philosophers, no such mutual tendencies exist either in the one body or the other. The observed approaches or mutual separations of bodies, or their attractions and repulsions, are supposed to depend on the extraneous action of an ethereal fluid.\n\n87. These qualities thus inherent in bodies, which constitute their mechanical relations, or the mechanical effects of matter, have been called powers or forces. The event which is indicated by their presence, is considered\nOf Moving considered as the effect and mark of their agency. Thus Forces, the magnet is said to act on the iron, the earth is said to act on the stone which falls to its surface; and the iron and the stone are said to act on the magnet and the earth. But all this, it must be observed, is figurative language. Power, force, and action, when used in their original strict sense, express only the notions of the power, force and action of sentient, active beings; and cannot be predicated of any thing but the exertions of such beings; for such beings only are agents. In strict propriety, it is perhaps only the exerted influence of the mind on the body which ought to be called action. Language having begun among simple men, such denominations were very properly given to their own exertions; because to move a body they found it necessary to exert their force or power, or to act. But when the changes of motion, observed in the occurrence or vicinity of bodies, were attended to by speculative men, and it was found that the phenomena greatly resembled the results or effects when they exerted their own strength, similar terms were employed to express these occurrences in nature. The old term was retained, in preference to the invention of a new language, to express things which had so near a resemblance. The danger of confounding things from the use of the same terms, was avoided from the differences in other circumstances of the case. It is not, however, to be imagined, that they supposed inanimate bodies exerted force or strength in the same way as living beings. But, in the progress of refinement, the word power or force came at last to be employed to express any efficiency whatsoever; and hence the common expressions, the force of arguments, the action of motives, the power of an acid to dissolve a metal, &c. It is to this idea of convenience, that the use of the terms attraction, repulsion, pressure, impulsion, as well as of the words power and force, which express efficiency in general, is to be ascribed. But these terms, excepting in those cases when they are applied to the exertions or actions of living beings, are metaphorical. On account, however, of the resemblance between the phenomena and those which are observed when we draw a thing toward us, push it from us, forcibly compress it, or kick it away, these different actions being analogous to attraction, repulsion, pressure, and impulsion, these words are employed as terms of distinction. The action of the mind on the body is perhaps the only case of pure unfigurative action. But this action being always exerted with the view of effecting some change on external bodies, our attention is only directed to them. The instrument passes unnoticed; and hence it is said that we act on the external body. The real action is only the first movement in a long succession of events, and is only the remote cause of the interesting event. In many cases of mechanical phenomena, we find the resemblance to such actions to be very strong. The following is of this description. A ball is projected from a man's hand by the motion of his arm; and in the same way a ball is impelled by the unbending of a spring. In all circumstances there is a resemblance between these two events, excepting in the action of the mind on the corporeal organ. And, hence in general, because the ultimate results of the mutual influence of bodies on each other have a strong resemblance to the ultimate results of our actions on bodies, no new or appropriate terms have been invented; but, as has been already observed, mankind have remained satisfied with the use of those terms that are employed to express their own actions, or the exertions of their own powers or forces.\n\n88. When power or force is spoken of as existing or acting of residing in a body, and the effect is ascribed to the exertion of this power, one body considered as possessing powers, it, is said to act on another. Thus a magnet is said to act on a piece of iron; a billiard ball is said to act on one which it strikes. But if it be attempted to fix the attention on this action, independent both of the agent and the thing acted on, we shall find that there is no object of contemplation. The exertion or procedure of nature in effecting the change is kept out of view; and if we limit our attention to the action as a thing distinct from the agent, we shall find that it is not the action, strictly speaking, but the act, that is brought under consideration. And in the same way, it is only in the effect produced that the action of a mechanical power can be conceived.\n\n89. In the very nature of action some change is implied. Without producing some effect, a man is never said to act. Thought is the act of the thinking principle; and the motion of the limb is the act of the mind on it. In mechanics too there is action only so far as some mechanical effect is produced. For instance, to begin motion on a piece of ice, or to slide along it, we must act violently; we must exert force; and this force being exerted produces motion. In all cases, the productions of motion are conceived as the exertions of force; but to continue the motion which has been begun along the ice, no exertion seems requisite. Being conscious of no exertion, we ought to infer that no force is necessary for the continuation of motion. It is not the production of any new effect, but the permanency or continuation of an effect already produced. Motion is indeed considered as the effect of some action; but there would be no effect or no change, if the body were not moving. Motion is not to be considered as an action, but the effect of an action.\n\n90. Mechanical actions or forces have been divided into pressures and impulsions. The idea of pressure is very familiar; perhaps it enters into every distinct conception that we can form of a moving force, when the attention is endeavoured to be fixed on it. Changes of motion by the collision of moving bodies are produced by impulsion. Pressures and impulsions are usually considered as of different kinds, the actions or exertions of different powers. It is supposed that there is an essential difference between pressure and impulsion. That we may obtain all the knowledge that these distinctions can give us, let us state some examples of these kinds of forces, instead of attempting to define or describe them.\n\nLet us first take some examples of pressure. Pressure is known as a moving force; for if a ball lying on the table be gently pressed on one side, it moves toward the other side of the table. If it be followed with the finger, the pressure being continued, its motion is continually increased. There is an acceleration of its motion. By pressing in the same way on the handle of a common kitchen jack, the fly begins to move; and if the pressure be continued on the handle, the motion of the fly becomes very rapid; and there is:\nOf Moving is also a continual acceleration. Such motions as these are the effects of genuine prelure. The unbending of a spring would urge the ball in the same way along the table, and would produce a continually accelerated motion; and a spring coiled up round the axis of the handle of the jack would, by uncoiling itself, urge round the fly with a similar accelerated motion. By comparing the prelure of the finger on the ball with the effects of the spring, we perceive distinctly the perfect similarity. These exertions or actions, or influences, are denoted by the word prelure, which is derived from the most familiar instance of them.\n\nThe same motion may be produced in the ball or fly, by pulling the ball or machine by means of a thread having a weight suspended to it. Both being motions accelerated in the same manner, the action of the thread on the ball or machine comes under the same denomination of prelure. Weight is therefore considered as a preluring power. And indeed the same compulsion is felt from the real prelure of a man on the shoulders and a load laid on them. But in the instance above, the weight acts by the intervention of the thread. By the prelure of the weight it pulls at that part of the thread to which it is attached, this part pulls at the next by the force of cohesion; and this at a third, and so on, till the most remote pulls at the ball or machine. In this way elasticity, weight, cohesion, and other forces, perform the office of a genuine power; and their result being always a motion beginning from nothing, and accelerating to any velocity by perceptible degrees, from this resemblance we are led to give them one familiar name.\n\n91. If the thread by which the weight is suspended be cut, it falls with an accelerated motion. This also is ascribed to some preluring power which acts on the weight; and it is even considered as the cause of the body's weight, which word is a name by which this instance of preluring power is distinguished. Gravitation, therefore, comes under the denomination of prelure. For the same reason the attractions and repulsions of the magnet, or of electric bodies, belong to this class of phenomena; for on bodies placed between them they produce actual compellings, as well as motions which are continually accelerated, in the same way as gravitation does. To all these powers, therefore, the descriptive name of prelures may be given, although this name properly speaking belongs to one of them only. This great class has been subdivided by some philosophers into prelusions and solicitations. Gravity is considered as a solicitation ab extra, by which a body is urged downward. The forces of electricity and magnetism, with many other attractions and repulsions, are also called solicitations. But this classification seems to be of little use.\n\n92. We have a familiar instance of impulsion in one ball striking another, and putting it in motion. In this case the appearances are very different from the phenomena of prelure. For the body that is struck acquires in the instant of impulse a sensible quantity of motion. But after the stroke this motion is neither accelerated nor retarded, unless by the action of some other force. The rapidity of the motion, it is observed depends on the previous velocity of the striking ball. If for instance a clay ball, moving with any velocity, strike another equal ball which is at rest, the ball which is struck moves with one half of the velocity of the other. It is farther observed that the striking ball always loses as much motion as the ball which is struck gains. From this remarkable fact there seems to have arisen an indistinct notion of a kind of transference of motion from one body to another. It is not said that the one ball produces motion or causes it in the other, but it is said to communicate motion to it; and the phenomenon is usually termed the communication of motion. This, however, is a very inaccurate mode of expression. We distinctly conceive the cause or communication of heat, the communication of fatigues, of sweetmeats, and of many other things; but we have no clear conception of part of the identical motion which existed in one body being transferred to another. From this, therefore, it appears that motion is not a thing which can exist independently, and is susceptible of actual transference; but is a state or condition of which bodies are susceptible which may be produced in bodies, and which is the effect or characteristic of certain natural properties or powers.\n\nThe notion of the actual transference of something formerly possessed by the striking body, and now separated from it, or transferred into the body which is struck, has obtained support from the remarkable circumstance in the phenomenon, that a rapid motion requiring for its production the action of a preluring power, continued for a sensible, and frequently a long time, is or seems to be effected instantaneously by impulsion. Here then we find room for the employment of metaphor, both in thought and language. We see the striking body affect the body which is struck. It possesses the power of impulsion, or of communicating motion, but it only possesses this power while it is itself in motion; and we therefore conclude that this power is the efficient distinguishing cause of its motion. Hence it has been called inherent force, the force inherent in a moving body, vis inusta corpori moto. This force is communicated to the body impelled, or transferred into it; the transference is instantaneous, and the body thus impelled continues its motion till it is changed by a new force. But if we attend scrupulously to those feelings which have given rise to this metaphorical conception, we shall find, that although at first sight this train of observation seems very plausible, we should entertain very different notions. To begin the motion of sliding on a smooth piece of ice, we are conscious of exertion; but when the ice is very smooth, no exertion that we are conscious of seems requisite to continue the motion. No exertion of power is here necessary; and therefore we have no primitive feeling of power while we slide along. And indeed we cannot think of moving forward without effort otherwise than as a certain mode of existence. It has however been imagined that those who support this opinion have in some way deduced it from their feelings. To move forward in walking, we must continue the exertion with which we began; and unless this power of walking be continually exerted, we must stop our progress. But this is inaccurate observation. In the action of walking there is much more than the continuance in progressive motion. It is the repeated and continued lifting the body up a small height, and allowing it to come down again, and this repeated ascent requires repeated exertion.\n93. From the consideration of the instantaneous production of rapid motion by impulse, some distinguished philosophers have been led to suppose that the force or power of impulse is not susceptible of being compared with a pressing power. It has been asserted that impulse when compared with pressure is infinitely great. But the similarity of the ultimate results of impulse and pressure, have always led them to adopt a different view. There is no difference between the motion of two balls which move with equal rapidity, one of which descends from a height by the force of gravity, while the other has been struck by another body. In this struggle of the mind attached to preconceived opinions, and at the same time accommodating these opinions to observed phenomena, other singular forms of expression have arisen. Pressure is considered as an effort to produce motion. And here we have another instance of metaphorical expression as well as thought. The weight of a ball on the table is called a power; and this weight is continually endeavouring to move the ball downward. But these efforts being ineffectual, the power in this case is said to be dead. It is called *vis mortua*, in contradistinction to the force of impulse which is called a living power, *vis viva*. But this mode of expression must appear very inaccurate, if we consider the case of the impelling ball falling perpendicularly on the other ball lying on the table. No motion is induced by this impulse; and if the table be conceived to be annihilated, the power of gravity becomes a *vis viva*.\n\nTo prove that impulse is infinitely greater than pressure, numerous familiar instances have been adduced by those who support this doctrine. A nail is driven with a moderate blow of a hammer, which would require a pressure many hundred times greater than the impelling effort of the person who employs the hammer. A hard body may be shattered into pieces with a moderate blow, which would support an inconceivable weight gradually applied. This prodigious superiority in impulse leaves it a difficult matter to account for the production of motion by means of pressure; because the motion of the hammer might have been acquired in consequence of the continued pressure of the carpenter's arm. It is considered as the aggregate of an infinite number of succeeding pressures repeated in every instant of its continuance. The smallness of each effort is compensated by their number.\n\n94. After all, it does not appear clear that there are two kinds of mechanical force which are essentially different in their nature. It is, indeed, in a great measure given up by those who support the doctrine that impulse is infinitely greater than pressure: Some method might perhaps be found of explaining satisfactorily this remarkable difference between the two modes of producing motion. But there seems to be no considerable advantage in thus arranging the phenomenon under two distinct heads.\n\n95. The nature of the sole moving force in nature has given rise to much discussion among mechanicians, and produced no small diversity of opinion. According to some, all motion is the effect of pressure; for when impulse is considered as equivalent to the aggregate of an infinite number of pressures, every pressure, however small, is supposed to be a moving force.\n\nThe sole cause of motion, according to other philosophers, is impulse. Bodies are observed in motion; they impel others, and produce motion in them; and this production of motion is said to be regulated by such laws, that there is only one absolute quantity of motion in the universe, which quantity remains invariably the same. Some portion of this motion, therefore, must be transferred or transfused when bodies come into collision with each other. But besides, there are some cases in which it is perfectly obvious that motion produces pressure. Cases, which are indeed both whimsical and complicated have been adduced by Euler, to show that an action, in all respects similar to pressure, may be produced by motion. Such a case is the following. If two balls are connected by a thread, they may be struck in such a way, that they shall not only move forward, but at the same time also wheel round. When this happens, the thread by which they are connected is stretched. Since then, according to this reasoning, motion is observed, and pressure is produced by motion, it would be absurd to suppose that pressure is anything else than the result of certain motions. The philosophers who are attached to this doctrine of moving forces, proceed to account for those pressing powers or solicitations to motion which are observed in the acceleration of falling bodies, the phenomena of magnetism and electricity, and others of the same kind, where motion is induced on certain bodies which are in the vicinity of other bodies, or as it is expressed in common language by the action of other bodies at a distance. To say that a magnet cannot act on a piece of iron at a distance, is to say that it acts where it is not; which is not less absurd than to say that it acts, when it is not. Euler assumed it is an axiom, *nihil movetur nisi a contiguo et moto*.\n\nThe methods proposed by these philosophers to produce pressure, are less ingenious and not more satisfactory than that adduced by Euler which was mentioned above; and indeed they do not seem to be very anxious about the manner in which these motions are produced. The phenomena of magnetism are induced, or a piece of iron is put in motion, when it is in the vicinity of a magnet, by a stream of fluid which issues from one pole of a magnet, passes in a circle round the magnet, and enters at the other pole. By this stream of fluid the iron is impelled, and brought to arrange itself in certain determined positions. In the same way all bodies are impelled in lines perpendicular to the surface of the earth by a stream of fluid which is in continual motion towards its centre. In the same way similar phenomena are accounted for, and thus these motions are reduced to simple cases of impulse. But to say nothing worse of this doctrine, it is not very compatible with the dictates of common sense. It proceeds on the supposition that something acts which we do not see; and of the existence of which there is not the smallest proof.\n\n96. Pressure, according to the opinion of others, is or pressure, the only moving force in nature; but it is that kind of pressure which has been termed solicitation, not what arises from the mutual contact of solid bodies. Gravitation is an instance of the kind of pressure here alluded to. It is affirmed by these philosophers, that there is no such thing as contact on the instantaneous communication of motion by the real collision of bodies. It is said that the particles of solid bodies exert very strong repulsions.\nOf Moving repulsions to a small distance; and when they are brought by any motion sufficiently near to another body, they exert a repulsive force, and are equally repelled by this body. Motion is thus produced in the one body, while it is diminished in the other. It is then shown by scrupulously considering the state of the bodies while the one advances, and the other retires, in what way they attain a common velocity, the quantity of motion before collision remaining the same, and the one body gaining exactly as much as the other loses. Cases also are adduced, of such mutual action between bodies, where it is obvious they have never come into contact; but where the result is exactly the same as when the motion seemed to be instantaneously changed. And hence it is concluded that there is no such thing as instantaneous communication, or transmutation of motion by contact in collision or impulse. All moving forces according to these philosophers, are of that kind which have been named solicitations; such as gravity is.\n\n97. Different names have been given to the exertions of mechanical forces, according to the reference that is made to the result. In wrestling when my antagonist exerts his strength to prevent being thrown down, and I am sensible of his exertion, I thus discover that he resists. But if I oppose him only to prevent him throwing me, I am said to resist. If I strike or endeavour to throw him, I am said to act. The same distinction is applied to the exertion of mechanical powers. If, for instance one body A change the motion of another body B, the change in the motion of B may be considered either as the indication and measure of the power of A in producing motion, or as the indication and measure of the resistance made by A in being brought to rest, or having any change induced on its motion. The distinction which is here made is not in the thing itself, but exists only in the reference which we are disposed to make of its effect, from other considerations. If a change of motion take place when one of the powers ceases to be exerted, it is conceived that this power has resisted. But this language is metaphorical. Resistance, effort, endeavour, are all words which express motion that relate to sentient beings. There is perhaps no word preferable to the word reaction, to express the mutual force which is observed in all the operations of nature which have been successfully investigated.\n\n98. A difficulty has been started with regard to the opinion of those who affirm that all mechanical phenomena are dependent on attracting and repelling forces; because it is here supposed that bodies act on each other at a distance, and however small this distance may be, this is conceived to be absurd. It may however be observed, that the mutual approaches or recedes of bodies may be ascribed to tendencies to, or from each other. Without thinking of any intermediate connection between the iron and the magnet, we conceive the iron to be affected by the magnet; and if this be conceivable, it is not absurd. Our knowledge of the essence or nature of matter is not such as to render this tendency of the iron to the magnet impossible. We do not indeed see intuitively why the iron should approach to the magnet; but this is by no means sufficient to pronounce it impossible or inconsistent with the nature of matter. To suppose therefore in the production of motion, the impulse of an invisible fluid, of which we know not anything, and of whose existence there is no evidence, is a rash and unwarrantable assumption. But farther, if it be true that bodies do not come into contact, even when one ball strikes another, and drives it before it, the supposition of the existence of this invisible fluid will not assist us in solving the difficulty; for the same difficulty would occur in the action of any one particle of the fluid in the body. At any rate the production of motion without any observed contact, is more familiar to us than the production of motion by one body acting on another by impulse. Every case of gravitation is an instance of this.\n\n99. In those cases where the exertions of any mechanical power are observed to be always directed toward any body, that body is said to attract. Thus a boat is attracted toward a man when he pulls it toward him by means of a rope. This is a case of pure attraction. But when the other body always moves off, the body exhibiting this phenomenon is said to repel; and it is a case of pure repulsion when a person pushes any body from him. And because there is a resemblance to the results of real attraction and repulsion, the same terms are employed to express the mechanical phenomena of nature. But that our conceptions may not be embarrassed or rendered obscure by the use of such metaphorical expressions, it is requisite to be careful not to allow these words to suggest to us any opinion about the manner in which mechanical forces produce their effects. If the opinion which is held of the existence of an invisible fluid on which mechanical action depends be well founded, it is obvious that there can be neither attraction nor repulsion in the universe.\n\n100. Forces are conceived as measurable quantities. Thus we conceive one man to possess double the strength measurable of another man, when we observe that he can resist the quantities, combined efforts of two others. It is in this way that animal force is conceived as a quantity made up of its own parts and measured by them. This however seems not to be a very accurate conception. Our conception of one strain being added to another is obscure, although we have a distinct notion of their being combined. There are no words to express the difference of these two notions in our minds; but we think that the same difference is perceived by others. We have a clear conception of the addition of two lines or two minutes; but our notions of two forces combined are indistinct; although it cannot be affirmed that two equal forces are not double of one of them. They are measured by the effects which they are known to produce.\n\n101. In the same way mechanical forces are conceived as measurable by their effects, and thus become the subjects of mathematical discussion. We speak of the proportions of magnetism, electricity &c., and even of the proportion of gravity to magnetism. These however, considered in themselves, are quite different, and do not admit of any proportion; but some of their effects are measurable, and these assumed measures being quantities of the same kind are susceptible of comparison. The acceleration of motion in a falling body, is one of the effects of gravity; magnetism accelerates the motion of a piece of iron; and these two accelerations may be compared together. But because none of the measurable effects of magnetism with which we are acquainted\nPart II.\n\nDYNAMICS.\n\nThus of the first kind are the terms accelerating, attractive, or repulsive forces; of the second, are the terms magnetism, electricity, &c.\n\nOf the Laws of Motion.\n\n105. Such then being our notions of mechanical forces, of the causes of the production of motion and its changes, there are certain results, which by the constitution of the human mind, necessarily arise from the relations of these ideas. These results are laws of human judgment, independent of all experience of external nature. Some of these laws may be intuitive, presenting themselves to the mind as soon as the ideas which they involve are presented to it. These may be called axioms. Others may be as necessary results from the relations of these notions, are less obvious, and may require a process of reasoning to establish their truth.\n\nOf these laws there are three, which were first distinctly propounded by Sir Isaac Newton. These may be considered as the first principles of all discussions in mechanical philosophy, give a sufficient foundation for all the doctrines of Dynamics, and to these principles we may refer for the elucidation of all the mechanical phenomena of nature.\n\nFirst Law of Motion.\n\n106. Every body continues in a state of rest, or of uniform rectilinear motion, unless it is affected by some mechanical force.\n\nOn the truth of this proposition the whole of mechanical philosophy chiefly depends. But with regard to its truth and the foundation on which it rests, the opinions of philosophers are very different. In general these opinions are obscure and unsatisfactory; and, as is usual, they influence the discussions of those who hold them in all their investigations.\n\n107. It is not only the popular opinion that a state of rest is the natural state of body, and that motion is something foreign to it, but the same opinion has been supported by many philosophers. They allow that of body matter unless it is acted on by some moving force will remain at rest; and nothing seems necessary for matter to remain where it is, but its continuing to exist. But the case is widely different, according to these philosophers, with respect to matter in motion. For here the relations of the body to other things are continually changing; and as there is the continual production of an effect, the continual agency of a changing cause is necessary. This metaphysical argument, it is said, is fully confirmed by the most familiar observation. All motions, whatever may have been their violence, terminate in rest, and for their continuance the continual exertion of some force is necessary.\n\n108. It is affirmed by these philosophers, that the continual action of the moving cause is essentially requisite for the duration of the motion. But their opinions of the nature of this cause are not uniform. According to some, all the motions in the universe are produced and continued by the direct agency of the Deity himself. By others all the motions and changes of every particle of matter are ascribed to a sort of mind which is inherent in it. This is called an elemental mind. It is the same as the ἀνάγκη and the ἐνεργεία of Aristotle. Every thing, according to these philosophers,\nOf Moving Bodies, which moves, is mind, and every thing which is moved is body. But this elemental mind is only known and characterized by the effects which are ascribed to its action; and these are observed in the motions or changes which are produced. These, we learn from uniform experience, are regulated by laws equally precise with the laws of mathematical truth. But there is nothing which indicates anything like intention or purpose; none of the marks or characters by which mind was brought first into view. They resemble the effects produced by the exertions of corporeal force; and hence the word force has been applied to express the causes of motion.\n\n109. A state of rest, it has been supposed, is the natural state of matter. But it does not appear that the continued action of some cause is necessary for continuing matter in motion. Experience gives us no authority for supposing that the natural condition of matter is a state of rest. It cannot be affirmed of any body whatever that it has ever been seen in absolute rest. All the parts of the planetary system are in motion; and even the sun himself with his attendant planets is carried in a certain direction with a great velocity. There is no unquestionable evidence that any of the stars are absolutely fixed; and many of them, it has been ascertained by observation, are in motion. Rest, therefore being so rare a condition of matter, no experience which we have, supports the notion that this is its natural condition. This opinion seems to be derived from our own experiments on matter. To continue the motion of a body, we find that the continued action of some moving force is necessary, otherwise the motion becomes gradually slower, and at last terminates in rest. Since then we see that our own exertions are constantly necessary in the production of motion, and especially in those cases where we are interested; we are thus induced to ascribe to matter something that is naturally quiescent and inert, and even something that is sluggish and aversive from motion. But this is an erroneous conception, which is suggested to our thoughts from the imperfection of language. We ascribe animation to matter to give it motion, and endow it with a kind of moral character in order to explain the phenomena of motion.\n\n110. But more accurate and more extended observation leads us to conclude that matter has no peculiar aptitude to a state of rest. Every observed retardation has a distinct reference to external circumstances. Wherever there is a diminution of motion, it is invariably accompanied by the removal of obstacles; as in the case when a ball moves through fluid, or air, or water. The diminution of motion is also owing to opposite motions which are destroyed. And it is found that the more these obstacles are kept out of the way, the less is the diminution of motion. The vibration of a pendulum in water soon ceases; it continues longer in air; and much longer in the exhausted receiver. The conclusion then from these observations is, that if all obstacles could be completely removed, motion would continue for ever. This conclusion is strongly supported by the motions of the heavenly bodies. These motions, so far as we know, are retarded by no obstacles; and accordingly they have been observed to retain them without perceptible diminution for thousands of years.\n\n111. The inactivity of matter has been denied by other philosophers. According to them it is essentially active, and continually undergoing changes in its condition. Some traces of this doctrine are to be found in the writings of some of the ancient philosophers; but it others was reduced to a systematic form by Leibnitz. According to this philosopher, every particle of matter is endowed with a principle of individuality. This he calls a monad, which is supposed to have a kind of perception of its place in the universe, and of its relation to all other parts of the universe. This monad too is supposed to act on the particle of matter in the same way as the soul acts on the body. The motion of the material particle is modified by the monad, and thus are produced, according however to unalterable laws, all the observed modifications of motion. And thus matter, or the particles of matter, are continually active and continually changing their situation. No information in any way useful can be obtained from this fanciful hypothesis. It is not unlike the system of elemental minds. And should its existence be admitted, it would not any more than the actions of animals invalidate the general proposition which is considered as the fundamental law of motion. The powers of the monads or of the elemental minds are supposed to be the causes of all the changes; but the particle of matter itself is subject to the law, and any change of motion which it exhibits is ascribed to the exertion of the monad.\n\n112. By another set of philosophers, this law of motion is deduced from the want of a determining cause. At the head of this sect is Sir Isaac Newton, who maintains the doctrine affirmed in the proposition. But these determiners are not uniform in their opinion of the foundation on which it rests. It is asserted by some that it is a kind of necessary truth which arises from the nature of the thing. If, for instance, a body in a state of rest, and if it be affected that it will not remain at rest, it must move in some direction; and if it be in motion in any direction, and with any velocity, and do not continue its equable, rectilinear motion, it must be either accelerated or retarded; it must either turn to one side, or to some other side. The event, whatever it be, is individual and determinate; but no cause which can determine it being supposed, the determination cannot take place, and no change with respect to motion will happen in the condition of the body. It will either remain at rest, or persevere in its rectilinear and equable motion. But to this argument of sufficient reason, as it has been called, considerable objections may be made. In the immensity and perfect uniformity of time and space, there is no determining cause why the visible universe should exist in one place rather than in another, or at this time rather than at another. It is essentially necessary that there should be a cause of determination; for a determination may be without a cause, as well as a motion without a cause.\n\n113. Other philosophers deduce this law of motion and from experience. They consider it merely as an experimental truth, of the universality of which there are innumerable proofs. When a stone is thrown from the hand, it is pressed forward, and when the hand has the greatest velocity that we can give it, the stone is let go, and it continues in that state of motion which it gradually acquired along with the hand. A stone may be thrown much farther by means of a sling, because with\nOf Moving a very moderate motion of the hand, the stone being whirled round acquires a very great velocity, and when it is let go, it continues its rapid motion. We have a similar illustration in the case of an arrow shot from a bow. The string which presses hard on the notch of the arrow carries it forward with an accelerated motion as it becomes a straight line by the unbending of the bow; and there being nothing to check the arrow, it flies off. In these simple cases of perseverance in a state of motion the procedure of nature is easily traced; it is perceived almost intuitively. In many other phenomena it is not less difficult, although somewhat more complicated. A man can stand on the saddle of a horse at a gallop, and step from it to the back of another horse that gallops along with him at the same rate; and this he seems to do with the same ease as if the horses were standing still. The man is carried along with the same velocity as the horse which gallops under him, and he retains the same velocity while he steps from the back of one horse to that of the other. But if the horse to which he steps were standing still, he would fly over his head, because he is carried forward with the velocity of the galloping horse; or if he stepped from the back of a horse standing still to that of one at a gallop, he would be left behind; because he has not acquired the velocity of the galloping horse. In the same way, a man tosses oranges from one hand to the other while he is carried forward with the motion of a horse at a gallop, or while he swings on the slack-wire. In both cases the oranges have the same motion as the man, and while they are in the air are moving forward with the same velocity, so that they drop into the hand at a considerable distance from the place in which they were thrown from the other hand. While a ship sails forward with a rapid motion a ball dropped from the mast head falls at the foot of the mast; for it retains the motion which it had previous to its being dropped, and follows the mast during the whole time of its fall.\n\n114. Familiar instances may also be given of a body in a state of rest. A vessel filled with water drawn suddenly along the floor, leaves the water behind, which is dashed over the posterior side of the vessel; and when a boat or coach is suddenly dragged forward, the persons in it find themselves strike against the hinder part of the carriage or boat; or rather it should be said the carriage strikes on them, for it sooner acquires motion from the action of the force applied. A ball discharged from a cannon will pass through a wall and move onward; but the wall remains behind.\n\n115. Common experience is perhaps insufficient for establishing the truth of this fundamental proposition. It must be granted, that we have never seen a body either at rest, or in uniform rectilinear motion; yet this seems necessary before it can be said that the proposition is experimentally established. What is supposed in our experiments to be putting a body, formerly at rest, into motion, is in fact only producing a change of a very rapid motion—a motion not less than 90,000 feet per second.\n\n116. For the purpose of obtaining such experimental proof of the truth of this proposition, it will be necessary to refer to other observations. The relative motions of bodies, which are the differences of their absolute motions, only can be measured. We cannot measure their absolute motions. If then it can be shown by experiment that bodies have equal tendencies to resist the augmentation and diminution of their relative motions, they thus have equal tendencies to resist the augmentation or diminution of their absolute motions.\n\nLet A and B two bodies be put into such a situation, that they cannot persevere in their relative motions. The change which we observe produced on A is the effect and measure of the tendency of B to persevere in its former state. From the proportion of these changes therefore we derive the proportion of their tendencies to remain in their former condition. This will be illustrated by the following experiment which should be made at noon.\n\n117. Let the body moving at the rate of three feet per second to the westward, strike the equal body B which is apparently at rest. Different cases of the results of the changes thus produced may be supposed.\n\n118. Let A impel B forward without having its own velocity at all diminished. From this result it appears that B shows no tendency to maintain its motion unchanged, but that A retains its motion without diminution.\n\n2d. Suppose that A stops, and that B remains at rest. This case shows that A does not resist a diminution of motion, and that the motion of B is not changed.\n\n3d. Let it be supposed that both move westward at the rate of one foot per second. There is in this case a diminution of the velocity in A, equal to two feet per second. This then is to be considered as the effect and measure of the tendency of B to maintain its velocity unaltered. B has received an augmentation of one foot per second in its velocity. From this change it appears that the tendency is but half of the former; and the result shows that the resistance to a diminution of velocity is only equal to one half of the resistance to augmentation; and perhaps equal only to one quarter, since the change on B has effected a double change on A.\n\n4th. Let it be supposed that both bodies move forward with the velocity of one and a half feet per second. In this case it is obvious that the tendencies of the two bodies to maintain their states unchanged are equal.\n\n5th. But suppose that $A = 2B$, and that the velocity of both after collision is equal to two feet per second. The body B has then received an addition of two feet per second to its former velocity; and this is the effect and measure of the whole tendency of A to preserve its motion undiminished. One half of this change on B measures the persevering tendency of one half of A; but it is supposed that A which formerly moved with the apparent or relative velocity three, now moves with the velocity two, and thus has lost the velocity of one foot per second. Therefore each half of A has lost this velocity; and the whole loss of motion is two. This then is the measure of the tendency of B to maintain its former state unaugmented; and it is the same with the measure of the tendency of A to preserve its former state undiminished. From such a result therefore the conclusion would be that bodies have equal tendencies to maintain their former states of motion unaugmented and undiminished.\n\nThe suppositions made above in the 4th and 5th cases are the result of all the experiments which have been made; and in all the changes of motion which are,\nOf Moving produced by the mutual action of bodies on impulsion, this is the regulating law. To this there is no exception. And thus it appears that there exists in bodies no preferable tendency to rest. No fact can be adduced which should lead us to suppose that a motion having once begun should suffer any diminution without the intervening action of some changing cause.\n\n118. It must, however, be observed that this is a very imperfect way of establishing the first law of motion. It is inapplicable to those cases where experiment cannot be made; and at best it is subject to all the inaccuracy of the best managed experiments. If this proposition be examined by means of the general principles which have been adopted in the article Philosophy, (which see) an accurate decision of this question may be given. These principles, which are the foundation of all our knowledge, show that this proposition is an axiom or intuitive consequence of the relations of those ideas which we have of motion, of its changes, and of their causes.\n\n119. Powers or forces, it has been shewn, are not the immediate objects of our perceptions. Their existence, kind, and degree, are inferences from the motions which we observe. And hence it follows, that when no change of motion is observed, no such inference is made; no force or power is supposed to act. But when any change of motion is observed, the inference is made; a power or force is supposed to have acted. By a similar conclusion, it is said, that when no change of motion is supposed, no force is thought of or supposed; and whenever a change of motion is supposed, it always implies a changing force. On the other hand, when the action of a changing force is supposed, the change of motion is also supposed; the action of this force and the change of motion being the same thing. The mind does not admit the idea of the action, without at the same time thinking of the indication of the action, and this indication is the change of motion. And in the same way, when we do not think of the changing force, or do not suppose the action of a changing force, we suppose, although it be not expressed in terms, that there is no indication of this changing force; that there is no change. If, therefore, it be supposed that no mechanical force acts on a body, we suppose in fact that the body remains in its former condition with respect to motion. And if it be supposed that nothing accelerates or retards, or deflects the motion, it is conceived as neither accelerated nor retarded, nor deflected. Hence it follows, that we suppose the body to continue in its former state of rest or motion, unless we suppose that it is changed by some mechanical force.\n\n120. This proposition then does not depend on the properties of body as a matter of experience or contingency. It is to us a necessary truth. It is not so much any circumstances with regard to body that are expressed in the proposition, as the operations of the mind in considering these circumstances. The truth of the proposition will not be invalidated by taking into view, that it may be essential to move in some particular direction; that it may be essential to body to stop when the moving cause ceases to act; or gradually to diminish its motion, and at last come to rest. The circumstances in the nature of body which render these modifications essentially necessary, are the causes of these modifications; and they are to be considered as changing forces.\n\nIf we should suppose that body of its own nature is capable of producing a change in its condition, this change must be effected according to some law which characterizes the nature of body. But the knowledge of this law can be obtained only by observing the deviations from uniform rectilinear motion. It then becomes indifferent whether external causes operate these changes, or they depend on the nature of the thing; for in considering the various motions of bodies, we must first consider the nature of matter as one of its mechanical affections which operates in every instance; and this brings us back to the law contained in the proposition. This is rendered more certain by reflecting, that the external causes, such as instance are gravity and magnetism, which are acknowledged to operate changes of motion, are not less unknown to us than this essential property of matter. They are, like it, only inferences from the phenomena.\n\n121. Many philosophers, among which number may be included Newton himself, have introduced modes of expression, which suggest inadequate notions, and such getted as are incompatible with the doctrine of the proposition; for although they allow that rest is the natural condition of body, and that force is necessary for the continuation of motion, yet they speak of a power or force residing in a moving body by which it perseveres in its motion. This has been called the vis insita, or the inherent force of a moving body. Now if the motion be supposed to be continued in consequence of a force, that force must be supposed to be exerted, and it is supposed that if it were not exerted the motion would cease. The proposition, therefore, must be false. To obviate this objection it is indeed sometimes said, that the body continues in uniform rectilinear motion, unless it is acted on by some external cause. This mode of expression, however, subjects us to the impropriety of afflicting that gravity, electricity, and other mechanical forces, are external to the bodies on which they are supposed to act and to put in motion. Everything which produces a change of motion is very properly called a force; and when a change of motion is observed, the action of such a force is very properly inferred. But to give the same name to what has not this property of producing a change, and to infer the action of a force when no change is observed, is not a very accurate or consistent expression. This error has arisen from the use of analogical language in philosophical discourses.\n\n122. But motion is not, as philosophers have imagined, the continual production of an effect. We can conceive there is such a thing as a moving cause, to which the name of force has been given. This produces motion, and the character of motion in body, which is a continual change of place. Motion is the effect of an action; and previous to the commencement of the motion, this action is equally incomplete as it is the minute after. The immediate effect of a moving force is a determination to motion, which if not obstructed by some cause would go on for ever. In this determination only the condition of the body differs from a state of rest. Motion then is a condition or mode of existence, which no more requires the continued agency of the moving cause than colour or figure. Some mechanical cause is required to change this condition into the state or condition of rest. When a moving\nPart II.\n\nDYNAMICS.\n\nOf Moving moving body is brought to rest, some cause of this cessation of motion never fails to occur to the mind. A cause is no less necessary to stop the motion of body than it is to produce it. Now this cause must either reside in the body or be external to it. If it reside in the body, then it possesses a self-determining power or force, by which it may be able to stop its own motion as well as to produce it.\n\n123. Taking this view of the subject, the opinion of a force residing in a moving body by which its motion is continued must be given up; and the remarkable difference between a body in a state of motion and a state of rest must be explained on other principles. Motion, it cannot be doubted, is necessary in the impelling body to permit the forces which are inherent in one or both bodies to continue the prelude long enough for the production of sensible motion. But whether bodies be in the condition of motion or rest, these forces are inherent in them. If we reflect on the motions that are involved in the general conception of one body being impelled and put in motion by another, we shall see that there is nothing individual transferred from the one to the other. Before collision took place the determination to motion existed only in the impelling body. After collision, both bodies possessed this condition or determination. But we have no conception, we can form no notion of the thing transferred.\n\n124. An expression not less vague and indefinite is \"vis inertiae,\" an indecisive term. This is the phrase \"inertia,\" or \"vis inertiae.\" This expression, which was introduced by Kepler, seems to have been generally employed by him as well as by Newton to express the fact of the perseverance of body in a state of motion or rest. Sometimes, however, it has been employed by these philosophers to express something like indifference to motion or rest; and this is supposed to be manifested by body requiring the same quantity of force to make an augmentation of its motion, as is necessary to produce an equal diminution of it. To suppose resistance from a body at rest seems to be in direct contradiction to the common use of the word \"force\"; and yet this expression \"vis inertiae\" is very common. It is not less absurd to say that a body remains in the condition of rest by the exertion of a \"vis inertiae,\" than to affirm that it maintains itself in a state of motion by the exertion of an inherent force. Such expressions, which are metaphorical, should be carefully avoided, because they are apt to lead to misconception of the procedure of nature.\n\n125. In the phenomena of motion the force employed of matter always produces its complete effect. No resistance whatever is observed. When one man throws down another, and he finds that no more force has been required than to throw down a similar and equal mass of inanimate matter, he concludes that no resistance has been made; but if more force be necessary, the conclusion is that resistance has been made. When, therefore, the exerted force produces its full effect, there is no such thing as resistance properly so called. It is therefore misconceiving the mode in which mechanical forces operate in the collision of bodies, to say that there is any resistance. For there is no more in these cases than in other natural changes of condition. It may be observed, that these terms \"inherent force,\" and \"inertia,\" may be employed for the purpose of abbreviation language, provided they are used only for expressing either the simple fact of persevering in the former state, or the necessity of a determinate force to produce a change on that state, being careful to avoid all thought of resistance.\n\n126. Thus it appears that deviations from uniform motions are the only indications of the existence and from unagency of mechanical forces. This indication is simple, implying change of place; and it can only indicate what is actions of very simple, something competent to the production of force. The same thing is indicated by two similar changes of motion. A compass needle in a state of rest, can be moved some degrees by means of the finger, a magnet, an electrified body, or by the unbending of a spring, &c., in all which cases the indication is precisely the same; and therefore the thing indicated must also be the same. This is the intensity and direction of some moving power. The circumstances of resemblance by which the affections of matter are to be characterized are impulsiveness, intensity, and direction. This leads us to consider the second law of motion.\n\nSecond Law of Motion.\n\nEvery change of motion is proportional to the force impressed, and it is made in the direction of that force.\n\n127. This law of motion also may almost be considered as an identical proposition. It is equivalent to saying that the changing force is to be measured by the position; change produced, and the direction of this force is the direction of the change. Considering the force only in the sense of its being the cause of motion, and withdrawing the attention from the manner or form of its exertion, there can be no doubt of this. In whatever way a body is put in motion, whether by the expansive force of the air, by the unbending of a spring, or by any similar prelude, when it moves off in the same direction, and with the same velocity, the force or the exertion of the force is considered as the same. Even when it is put in motion by instantaneous percussion from a smart stroke, although in this case the manner of the effect being produced is essentially different from the other cases, we cannot conceive the propelling force, as such, but as precisely one and the same. The expression of this law of motion by Newton is equivalent to saying, \"that the changes of motion are taken as the measures of the changing forces, and the direction of the change is taken as the indication of the direction of the forces; for it cannot be said that it is a deduction from the acknowledged principle, that deduced from effects are proportional to their causes. This law is not affirmed from the proportion of the forces and the forces, proportion of the changes, and that these proportions are the same, having been observed; and that this universally holds in nature. For forces are not objects of observation, and we do not know their proportions. In this way it would be established as a physical law, as indeed it is in fact. But according to the definition of the term, this does not establish it as a law of motion; or as a law of human thought, the result of the relations of our ideas. Philosophers having attempted to prove this as a matter of observation, have produced great diversity of opinion in the mode of eliminating forces. A bullet, it is well known, which moves with double velocity, penetrates four times as far. This is confirmed.\nDYNAMICS.\n\nOf Moving confirmed by other similar facts; and to generate this double velocity in the bullet, it has been observed by philosophers four times the force is expended, four times as much powder is required. This is the invariable result; and in cases of this kind, it would appear that the ratio of the forces employed has been very accurately ascertained. The conclusion therefore is, that moving forces are not proportional to the velocities produced, but to the squares of the velocities. This is strongly confirmed by observing that moving bodies seem to possess forces in this very proportion, and to produce effects in this proportion; when, for instance, the velocity is only twice as great, they penetrate four times as deep.\n\n128. If this mode of estimation be just, it is irreconcilable with the conception of those who admit that the velocity is proportional to the force impressed, in those cases where no previous observation can be had of the ratio of the forces, and of its equality to the ratio of the velocities. Such a case is the force of gravity, which these philosophers always measure by its accelerating power, or the velocity generated in a given time. This must be granted; for there are cases in which the force can be measured by the actual pressure which it exerts. Thus a spring steelyard can be constructed, the rod of which is divided by hanging on successively a number of perfectly equal weights. In the different states of tension of the spring, its elasticity is proportional to the pressures of gravity which it balances. If it be found, that at Quito in Peru, a weight will pull out the rod to the mark 312, and that the same weight at Spitzbergen draws it out to 313, it seems to be a fair inference to say, that the pressure of gravity at Quito is to its pressure at Spitzbergen as 312 to 313; and this is affirmed on the authority of effects being proportional to their causes. Such cases, however, are very rare; for it is seldom, that the whole of a natural power, accurately measured in some other way, is employed in producing the observed motion. Part of it is generally otherwise expended, and therefore it frequently happens that the motions are not in the proportion with the supposed forces. And allowing that this could be done with accuracy, it would only be the proof of a general law or fact; but these philosophers attempt to establish it as an abstract truth.\n\n129. It seems to be considered by Sir Isaac Newton only as a physical law. And in this sense good arguments are not wanting. A ball which moves with a double, triple, or quadruple velocity, generates by impulse in another, a double, triple, or quadruple velocity, or it generates the same velocity in a double, triple, or quadruple quantity of matter, and losing at the same time similar proportions of its own velocity.\n\nTwo bodies, having equal quantities of motion, meeting together, mutually stop each other.\n\nWhen two forces, which act similarly during equal times, produce equal velocities in a third body, they will, by acting together during the same time, produce a double velocity.\n\nIf a pressure which acts for a second, produce a certain velocity, a double pressure acting during a second, will produce in the same body a double velocity.\n\nA force which is known to act equably, produces in equal times equal increments of velocity, whatever the velocities may be.\n\nIn all the examples above adduced, the forces are observed to be in the same proportion with the change of motion effected by them in a similar way.\n\nBut the curious discoveries of Dr Hooke, about the middle of the 17th century, seemed to show, from a great collection of facts, forces to be in a very different proportion. In the production of motion it was found, that four springs equal in strength, and bent to the same degree, generated only a double velocity in the ball which they impelled; nine springs generated only a triple velocity, &c. In the extinction of motion, it was found, that a ball moving with a double velocity, will penetrate four times as deep into a uniformly resisting mass; and a triple velocity will make it penetrate nine times as far, &c.\n\n130. These facts were brought forward by Leibnitz in support of his own pretensions to the discovery of the real nature and measure of mechanical action and force, which he said had been hitherto totally mistaken. He affirmed, that the inherent force of a moving body was in the proportion of the square of the velocity. In this argument he was supported by John Bernoulli, who adduced many simple facts to confirm the relation between the inherent force of a moving body and its velocity. One of the strongest arguments urged by Leibnitz is, that the inherent force of a moving body is to be estimated by all that it is able to do before the total extinction of its motion; and therefore, when it penetrates four times as far, it is to be considered as having produced a quadruple effect. In this mode of estimation many things are gratuitously assumed, many contradictions are incurred; and it is only because forces are assumed as proportional to the velocities which they generate, that these facts come to be proportional to the squares of the same velocities. When Leibnitz assumes the quadruple penetration as the proof of the quadruple force of a body having twice the velocity, he has not considered that a double time is employed during this penetration. But a double force, acting equably during a double time, should produce a quadruple effect. This circumstance is lost sight of in all the facts which this philosopher has adduced. It may, however, be observed, that Leibnitz, as well as his followers, holds no difference of opinion in all the consequences which are deduced from the measure which is here adopted. They admit, that a force producing an uniformly accelerated motion must be constant; they agree with the followers of Des Cartes in the valuations both of accelerating and deflecting forces; and have assiduously and successfully cultivated the philosophy of Newton, which proceeds on the principle of estimating the measure of moving forces by the velocity generated.\n\n131. It ought here to be observed, that moving forces only are taken into consideration. When a ball has acquired a certain velocity, whether it has been impelled by the elasticity of the air, by a spring, or struck off by a blow, or urged forward by means of a stream of air or water, or has obtained its velocity by falling; in all these cases it is conceived that it has sustained the same action of moving force. The only distinct notion, perhaps, which we are able to form, is pressure;\nThe following is the enunciation, adapted to the characteristic and measure of a change of motion.\n\nLaw of the Changes of Motion.\n\nPROP. XII.\n\n134. In every change of motion, the new motion is compounded of the former motion, and of the motion which the changing produces in a body at rest.\n\nLet the change of motion be from AB (fig. 23.) to AD, this new motion AD is compounded of the former motion AB and of the motion AC.\n\nFor it has been shewn, that the change in any motion, is that motion, which when compounded with the former motion, produces the new motion; and the new motion (55.) is the compound of the former motion and the changing motion. Since then the change of motion is the mark and measure of the changing force (133.) by which both the direction and intensity or velocity produced, are determined, the truth of the proposition will appear of course.\n\n133. It has been already observed (54.), that the composition of motions and the similar composition of forces are very different things. The first is a pure mathematical truth; the second, is a physical question dependent on the nature of the mechanical forces as they exist in the universe. Our notions are not very distinct of two forces, each of which separately produces motions, having the directions and velocities expressed by the sides of a parallelogram, producing by their joint action a motion in the diagonal. The demonstrations which have been frequently given, are altogether inconclusive, and only include the composition of motions; while gratuitous postulates have been assumed by those who endeavoured to accommodate their reasonings to physical principles. The celebrated Daniel Bernoulli gave the first legitimate demonstration of this proposition, in which, however, he employs a series of many propositions, some of which are very arbitrary. It was greatly simplified by D'Alembert, Mem. Acad. des Sciences 1769, still, however, requiring many propositions. Ingenious demonstrations have also been given by other celebrated mechanicians. In the following demonstration by Professor Robison, this distinguished philosopher has attempted to combine the demonstration of Bernoulli, D'Alembert, and others, thus rendering it more expeditious, and at the same time legitimate. This demonstration is entirely limited to preludes, without at all considering or employing the motions supposed to be produced by them.\n\n(A) If two equal and opposite preludes or incitements to motion act at once on a material particle, it suffers no change of motion; for if it yields in either direction by their joint action, one of the preludes prevails, and they are not equal.\n\nEqual and opposite preludes are said to balance each other; and such balance must be esteemed equal and opposite.\n\n(B) If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are two magnitudes of the same kind, proportional to the intensities of two preludes which act in the same direction, then the magnitude \\(a + b\\) will measure the intensity of the prelude, which is equivalent, and may be called equal, to the combined effort of the other two; for when we try to form a notion of pressure as a measurable magnitude, distinct from motion...\nOf Moving Forces.\n\nDYNAMICS.\n\nOf Moving Forces.\n\nIf Moving or any other effect of it, we find nothing that we can measure it by but another prelude. Nor have we any notion of a double or triple prelude different from a prelude that is equivalent to the joint effort of two or three equal preludes. A prelude \\(a\\) is accounted triple of a prelude \\(b\\), if it balances three preludes, each equal to \\(b\\), acting together. Therefore, in all proportions which can be expressed by numbers, we must acknowledge the legitimacy of this measurement; and it would surely be affectation to omit those which the mathematicians call incommensurable.\n\nThe magnitude \\(c = b\\), in like manner, must be acknowledged to measure that prelude which arises from the joint action of two preludes \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) acting in opposite directions, of which \\(a\\) is the greatest.\n\n(C) Let \\(ABCD\\) and \\(abC'd'\\) (fig. 24.) be two rhombuses, which have the common diagonal \\(AC\\). Let the angles \\(BA_b\\), \\(DA_d\\), be bisected by the straight lines \\(AE\\) and \\(AF\\).\n\nIf there be drawn from the points \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) the lines \\(EG\\), \\(EH\\), \\(FG\\), \\(FH\\), making equal angles on each side of \\(EA\\) and \\(FA\\), and if \\(Gg\\), \\(Hh\\) be drawn, cutting the diagonal \\(AC\\) in \\(I\\) and \\(L\\); then \\(AI + AL\\) will be greater or less than \\(AQ\\), the half of \\(AC\\), according as the angles \\(GEH\\), \\(gFh\\), are greater or less than \\(GAH\\), \\(gAh\\).\n\nDraw \\(GH\\), \\(gH\\), cutting \\(AE\\), \\(AF\\), in \\(O\\) and \\(o\\), and draw \\(Oo\\), cutting \\(AC\\) in \\(K\\).\n\nBecause the angles \\(AEG\\) and \\(EAG\\) are respectively equal to \\(AEH\\) and \\(EAH\\), and \\(AE\\) is common to both triangles, the sides \\(AG\\), \\(GE\\) are respectively equal to \\(AH\\), \\(HE\\), and \\(GH\\) is perpendicular to \\(AE\\), and is bisected in \\(O\\); for the same reasons, \\(gH\\) is bisected in \\(o\\). Therefore the lines \\(Gg\\), \\(Oo\\), \\(Hh\\), are parallel, and \\(IL\\) is bisected in \\(K\\). Therefore \\(AI + AL\\) is equal to twice \\(AK\\). Moreover, if the angle \\(GEH\\) be greater than \\(GAH\\), \\(AO\\) is greater than \\(EO\\), and \\(AK\\) is greater than \\(KQ\\). Therefore \\(AI + AL\\) is greater than \\(AQ\\); and if the angle \\(GEH\\) be less than \\(GAH\\), \\(AI + AL\\) is less than \\(AQ\\).\n\n(D) Two equal preludes, acting in the directions \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\) (fig. 25.), at right angles to each other, compose a prelude in the direction \\(AD\\), which bisects the right angle; and its intensity is to the intensity of each of the constituent preludes as the diagonal of a square to one of the sides. It is evident, that the direction of the prelude, generated by their joint action, will bisect the angle formed by their directions; because no reason can be assigned for the direction inclining more to one side than to the other.\n\nIn the next place, since a force in the direction \\(AD\\) does, in fact, arise from the joint action of the equal preludes \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\), the prelude \\(AB\\) may be conceived as arising from the joint action of two equal forces similarly inclined and proportioned to it. Draw \\(EAF\\) perpendicular to \\(AD\\). One of these forces must be directed along \\(AD\\), and the other along \\(AE\\). In like manner, the prelude \\(AC\\) may arise from the joint action of a prelude in the direction \\(AD\\), and an equal prelude in the direction \\(AF\\). It is also plain, that the preludes in the directions \\(AE\\) and \\(AF\\), and the two preludes in the direction \\(AD\\), must be all equal. And also, any one of them must have the same proportion to \\(AB\\) or to \\(AC\\); that \\(AB\\) or \\(AC\\) has to the force in the direction \\(AD\\), arising from their joint action.\n\nTherefore, if it be said that \\(AD\\) does not measure the prelude arising from the joint action of \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\), let \\(Ad\\) greater than \\(AD\\), be its just measure, and make \\(Ad : AB = AG : AB = AE\\). Then \\(AG\\) and \\(AE\\) have the same inclination and proportion to \\(AB\\) that \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\) have to \\(Ad\\). We determine, in like manner, two forces \\(Af\\) and \\(Ag\\) as constituents of \\(AC\\).\n\nNow \\(Ad\\) is equivalent to \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\), and \\(AB\\) is equivalent to \\(AE\\) and \\(AG\\); and \\(AC\\) is equivalent to \\(Af\\) and \\(Ag\\). Therefore \\(Ad\\) is equivalent to \\(AE\\), \\(Af\\), \\(AG\\), and \\(Ag\\). But \\((A)\\) \\(AE\\) and \\(Af\\) balance each other, or annihilate each other's effect; and there remain only the two forces, or preludes \\(AG\\), \\(Ag\\). Therefore \\((B)\\) their measure is a magnitude equal to twice \\(Ag\\). But if \\(Ad\\) be greater than the diagonal \\(AD\\) of the square, whose sides are \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\); then \\(Ag\\) must be less than \\(AI\\), the side of the square whose diagonal is \\(AB\\). But twice \\(Ag\\) is less than \\(AD\\), and much less than \\(Ad\\). Therefore the measure of the equivalent of \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\) cannot be a line \\(Ad\\) greater than \\(AD\\). In like manner, it cannot be a line \\(Ag\\) that is less than \\(AD\\). Therefore it must be equal to \\(AD\\), and the proposition is demonstrated.\n\nCOROLLARY.\n\n(E) Two equal forces \\(AB\\), \\(AC\\), acting at right angles, will be balanced by a force \\(AO\\), equal and opposite to \\(AD\\), the diagonal of the square whose sides are \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\); for \\(AO\\) would balance \\(AD\\), which is the equivalent of \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\).\n\n(F) Let \\(AECF\\) (fig. 26.) be a rhombus, the acute angle of which \\(EAF\\) is half of a right angle. Two equal preludes, which have the directions and measures \\(AE\\), \\(AF\\), compose a prelude, having the direction and measure \\(AC\\), which is the diagonal of the rhombus.\n\nIt is evident, in the first place, that the compound force has the direction \\(AC\\), which bisects the angle \\(EAF\\). If \\(AC\\) be not its just measure, let it be \\(AP\\) less than \\(AC\\). Let \\(ABCD\\) be a square described on the same diagonal, and make \\(AP : AQ = AE : AO = AF : Ao\\). Draw \\(KOG\\), \\(Kog\\) perpendicular to \\(AE\\), \\(AF\\); draw \\(GIg\\), \\(OHo\\), \\(EG\\), \\(EK\\), \\(Fg\\), \\(FK\\), \\(PF\\), and \\(PE\\).\n\nThe angles \\(CAB\\) and \\(FAE\\) are equal, each being half of a right angle. Also the figures \\(AEPF\\) and \\(AGEK\\) are similar, because \\(AP : AQ = AE : AO\\). Therefore \\(FA : AP = KA : AE\\), and \\(EA : AP = GA : AE\\). Therefore, in the same manner that the forces \\(AE\\), \\(AF\\) are affirmed to compose \\(AP\\), the forces \\(AG\\) and \\(AK\\) may compose the force \\(AE\\), and the forces \\(Ag\\) and \\(AK\\) may compose the force \\(AF\\). Therefore \\((B)\\) the force \\(AP\\) is equivalent to the four forces \\(AG\\), \\(AK\\), \\(Ag\\), \\(AK\\). But \\((D)\\) \\(AG\\) and \\(Ag\\) are the sides of a square, whose diagonal is equal to twice \\(AI\\); and the two forces \\(AK\\), \\(AK\\) are equal to, or are measured by, twice \\(AK\\). Therefore the four forces \\(AG\\), \\(AK\\), \\(Ag\\), \\(AK\\), are equivalent to \\(2AI + 2AK = 4AH\\).\n\nBut because \\(AP\\) was supposed less than \\(AC\\), the angle \\(FPE\\) is greater than \\(FAE\\), and \\(GEK\\) is greater than \\(GAK\\), \\(AO\\) is greater than \\(OE\\), and \\(AH\\) is greater than \\(HQ\\), and \\(2AH\\) is greater than \\(AQ\\); and therefore \\(4AH\\) is greater than \\(AC\\), and much greater than\nPart II.\n\nDYNAMICS.\n\nOf Moving than AP. Therefore AP is not the just measure of Forces.\n\nThe force composed of AE and AF.\n\nIn like manner, it is shewn, that AE and AF do not compose a force whose measure is greater than AC. It is therefore equal to AC; and the proposition is demonstrated.\n\n(G) By the same process it may be demonstrated, that if BAD be half a right angle, and EAF be the fourth of a right angle, two forces AE, AF will compose a force measured by AC. And the process may be repeated for a rhombus whose acute angle is one-eighth, one-sixteenth, &c. of a right angle; that is, any portion of a right angle that is produced by continual bisection. Two forces, forming the sides of such a rhombus, compose a force measured by the diagonal.\n\n(H) Let ABCD, A b c d (fig. 27.) be two rhombuses formed by two consecutive bisections of a right angle. Let AECF be another rhombus, whose sides AE and AF bisect the angles BA b and DA d.\n\nThe two forces AE, AF, compose a force AC.\n\nBisect AE and AF in O and o. Draw the perpendiculars GOH, g o h, and the lines GIg, OK o, HL h, and the lines EG, EH, Fg, Fh.\n\nIt is evident, that AGEH and AGFh are rhombuses; because AO = OE, and Ao = OF. It is also plain, that since b A d is half of BAD, the angle GAH is half of b A d. It is therefore formed by a continual bisection of a right angle. Therefore (G) the forces AG, AH, compose a force AE; and Ag, A h, compose the force AF. Therefore the forces AG, AH, Ag, A h, acting together, are equivalent to the forces AE, AF acting together. But AG, Ag compose a force = 2 AI; and the forces AH, A h compose a force = 2 AL. Therefore the four forces acting together are equivalent to 2 AI + 2 AL, or to 4 AK. But because AO is 1/2 AE, and the lines Gg, Oo, Hh, are evidently parallel, 4 AK is equal to 2 AQ, or to AC; and the proposition is demonstrated.\n\nCorollary.\n\n(I) Let us now suppose, that by continual bisection of a right angle we have obtained a very small angle a of a rhombus; and let us name the rhombus by the multiple of a which forms its acute angle.\n\nThe proposition (G) is true of a, 2a, 4a, &c. The proposition (H) is true of 3a. In like manner, because (G) is true of 4a and 8a, proposition (H) is true of 6a; and because it is true of 4a, 6a, and 8a, it is true of 5a and 7a. And so on continually till we have demonstrated it of every multiple of a that is less than a right angle.\n\n(K) Let RAS (fig. 28.) be perpendicular to AC, and let ABCD be a rhombus, whose acute angle BAD is some multiple of 2a that is less than a right angle. Let A b c d be another rhombus, whose sides A b, A d bisect the angles RAB, SAD. Then the forces A b, A d compose a force AC.\n\nDraw bR, dS parallel to BA, DA. It is evident, that AR b B and AS d D are rhombuses, whose acute angles are multiples of a, that are each less than a right angle: Therefore (I) the forces AR and AB compose the force A b, and AS AD compose A d; but AR and AS annihilate each other's effect, and there remains only the forces AB, AD. Therefore\n\nA b and A d are equivalent to AB and AD, which compose the force AC; and the proposition is demonstrated.\n\nCorollary.\n\n(L) Thus is the corollary of last proposition extended to every rhombus, whose angle at A is some multiple of a less than two right angles. And since a may be taken less than any angle that can be named, the proposition may be considered as demonstrated of every rhombus; and we may say,\n\n(M) Two equal forces, inclined to each other in any angle, compose a force which is measured by the diagonal of the rhombus, whose sides are the measures of the constituent forces.\n\n(N) Two forces AB, AC (fig. 29.) having the direction and proportion of the sides of a rectangle, compose a force AD, having the direction and proportion of the diagonal.\n\nDraw the other diagonal CB, and draw EAF parallel to it; draw BE, CF parallel to DA.\n\nAEBG is a rhombus; and therefore the forces AE and AG compose the force AB. AFCG is also a rhombus, and the force AC is equivalent to AF and AG. Therefore the forces AB and AC, acting together, are equivalent to the forces AE, AF, AG, and AG acting together, or to AE, AF, and AD acting together: But AE and AF annihilate each other's action, being opposite and equal (for each is equal to the half of BC). Therefore AB and AC acting together, are equivalent to AD, or compose the force AD.\n\n(O) Two forces, which have the direction and proportions of AB, AC (fig. 30.) the sides of any parallelogram, compose a force, having the direction and proportion of the diagonal AD.\n\nDraw AF perpendicular to BD, and BG and DE perpendicular to AC.\n\nThen ATBG is a rectangle, as is also AFDE; and AG is equal to CE. Therefore (N) AB is equivalent to AF and AG. Therefore AB and AC acting together, are equivalent to AR, AG, and AC acting together; that is, to AF and AE acting together; that is (N) to AD; or the forces AB and AC compose the force AD.\n\nHence arises the most general proposition.\n\nIf a material particle be urged at once by two pre-compositions or incitements to motion, whose intensities are proportion of all to the sides of any parallelogram, and which incitements act in the directions of those sides, it is affected in the same manner as if it were acted on by a single force, whose intensity is measured by the diagonal of the parallelogram, and which acts in its direction: Or, two pre-compositions, having the direction and proportion of the sides of a parallelogram, generate a pre-composition, having the direction and proportion of the diagonal.\n\n136. Thus is demonstrated from abstract principles the perfect similarity of the composition of pre-compositions and the composition of forces measured by the motions which are produced. A separate demonstration seems indifferently necessary; for what may be deduced from the one case is not always applicable to the other. The change produced on a motion already existing by a deflecting force, cannot be explained by any composition of pre-compositions; because the changing pre-composition is the only one that exists, and there is none with which it may be compounded.\nDYNAMICS.\n\nOf Moving Forces.\n\n137. Considering this law of motion merely as a universal fact or physical law, abundant proof may be adduced in support of it.\n\n1. The joint action of different forces is quite familiar. A lighter, for example, is dragged in different directions by two ropes on different sides of the canal, the lighter moving in an intermediate direction, as if dragged in that direction by one rope only. A ball moving in a particular direction, which receives a stroke across this direction, takes a direction lying between that of the first motion and that of the transverse stroke.\n\n2. If a particle of matter A (fig. 23.) be urged at once by two pressures in the directions AB and AC; and if AB and AC be proportional to the intensities of those pressures, the joint action of these two pressures is equivalent to the action of a third pressure in the direction of the diagonal AD, and having its intensity in the proportion of AD. This is proved by observing, that the point A is withheld from moving by a pressure AE, which is equal and opposite to AD. But pressures are moving forces, producing velocities when they act similarly during equal times, proportional to their intensities. The proportion, therefore, is true with respect to pressures, considered merely as such, and also with respect to the motions which may be produced by their composition.\n\n3. The weight of a ball which is suspended by a thread, and drawn aside from its position in a state of rest, urges it downwards, and the ball is supported obliquely by the thread. Supposing this proposition to be true, the directions and intensities of the forces inciting it to motion in any position, as well as the result of the velocities, can be precisely ascertained.\n\n4. The motions of the planets computed on these principles of the composition of forces, do not exhibit any perceptible deviation from calculation, at the end of thousands of years.\n\nNothing, therefore, can be relied on with greater confidence than the perfect agreement between the composition of motions, and the composition of the forces, which, separately taken, would produce those motions, and which are measured by the velocities produced. But it ought to be remarked, that if the moving forces are measured by the squares of the velocities which they generate, the composition cannot possibly hold; namely, from two forces which are represented by the sides of a parallelogram made proportional to the squares of the velocities, there will not result a force which can be represented by the diagonal. But supposing the composition of forces to be as the velocities, nature exhibits them exactly.—This proposition, therefore, whether it be considered as an abstract truth or as a physical law, may be received as fully established. The following is the converse of this proposition.\n\nPROP. XIII.\n\n138. The force by which the motion AB is changed into AD, is that which would produce in a body at rest, the motion AC, and this compounded with AB produces the observed motion AD.\n\nPROP. XIV.\n\n139. The force which will produce in a body at rest a motion having the direction and velocity represented by AC, when applied to a body moving with the velocity and in the direction AB, will change its motion into the motion AD, which is the diagonal of the parallelogram ABDC. For the new motion must be that which is compounded of AB and AC, that is, it must be the motion AD.\n\nThe combination of these two propositions gives rise to the following, which is still more general.\n\nPROP. XV.\n\n140. A body A being urged at once by two forces, which separately would cause it to describe AB and AC, the sides of a parallelogram ABDC, the body by their joint action will describe the diagonal AD in the same time.\n\nFor if the body had been already moving with the velocity and in the direction AB, and if it had been acted on in A by the force AC, it would describe AD in the same time. But it matters not at what time it acquired the determination to describe AB. Let it be then at the instant that the force AC is applied to it. And because its mechanical condition in A, which has the determination to the motion AB, is the same as in any other point of that line, it must describe AD.\n\nCOROLLARY.\n\nTwo forces acting on a body in the same or in opposite directions, will cause it to move with a velocity equal to the sum or to the difference of the velocities which it would have received from the forces separately. For, if AC approach continually to AB by diminishing the angle BAC, the points C and D will at last fall on a and d, and then AD is equal to the sum of AB and AC. But if the angle BAC increase continually, the points C and D will at last fall on x and δ, and then Aδ becomes equal to the difference of AB and AC. In the last case, it is evident, that if AC be equal to AB, the point D or δ will coincide with A, and the two forces being equal and acting in opposite directions, there will be no motion.\n\n141. In such cases the equal and opposite forces AC and AB are said to balance each other; and it is generally said, that these forces, by whose joint operation no change of motion is produced, balance each other. Such forces are accounted equal and opposite, each producing on the body a change of motion equal to what it would produce on a body at rest, and at the same time equal to the motion produced by the other force on a body at rest. The two motions being equal and opposite, the forces are therefore equal and opposite.\n\n142. What has been demonstrated concerning the affections with respect to the affections of compound motions, may now be applied to the combination of forces; taking care, however, to recollect the essential difference between the composition of motions and the composition of forces. In the combination of forces, the composition is complete, when the determination has been given to the body to move with the proper velocity in the diagonal. When the body has acquired this determination, there is no farther composition; and it continues its uniform motion, till its condition be changed.\nPart II.\n\nDYNAMICS.\n\nOf Moving Forces.\n\nOn the other hand, in the composition of two or more motions, the constituent motions are supposed to continue; and it is only during their continuance that the compound motion exists. If it be possible, which does not appear to be the case, that any force can generate a finite velocity by its instantaneous action, two such forces generate in an instant the determination in the diagonal. But supposing the action to continue for some time, to generate the velocities \\(AB\\) or \\(AC\\), there must be a continuance of the joint action during the same time to produce the velocity \\(AD\\). And although the moving powers of the two forces may vary in their intensity, yet it is necessary that they retain the same proportion to each other during the whole time of their joint action. Overlooking this circumstance, experiments have been made for the purpose of comparing this doctrine with the phenomena; and they have been found to exhibit very different results. But experiments made by the combination of pressures, such as weights pulling a body by means of threads, coincide precisely with this doctrine; for it is always found that two weights pulling in the directions \\(AB\\), \\(AC\\), and proportional to those lines, are balanced by a third weight in the proportion of \\(AD\\), and pulling in the direction \\(AE\\). In this way the composition of pressures is clearly proved; and, having no other distinct conception of a moving force, these experiments may be considered as sufficient. But we may go farther; for there is the clearest proof by experiment, that pressures produce motions in proportion to their intensities by their similar action during equal times. In the planetary motions, the directions and intensities of the compound forces are accurately known as moving forces. These motions afford a complete proof of the physical law, by their perfect coincidence with the calculations which proceed on the principles of this doctrine. This coincidence must be acknowledged as a full proof of the propriety of the measure which has been assumed. The assumption of any other measure would exhibit results quite different from the phenomena.\n\n143. Forces which produce motions along the sides of a parallelogram are called simple forces, or constituent forces. And the force which singly produces the motion in the diagonal, is called the equivalent force, the compound force, or the resulting force.\n\n144. Some general conclusions may now be pointed out, which will facilitate greatly the use of the parallelogram of forces.\n\nGeneral Corollaries.\n\n1. The constituent and the resulting forces, or the simple and compound forces, act in the same plane; for the sides and diagonal of a parallelogram are in one plane.\n\n2. The simple and the compound forces are proportional to the sides of any triangle which are parallel to their directions. For if any three lines \\(ab\\), \\(bd\\), \\(ad\\), be drawn parallel to \\(AB\\), \\(AC\\), and \\(AD\\) (fig. 31.), they will form a triangle similar to the triangle \\(ABD\\). For the same reasons they are proportional to the sides of a triangle \\(a'b'd'\\), which are respectively perpendicular to their directions.\n\n3. Therefore each is proportional to the fine of the opposite angle of this triangle; for the sides of any triangle are proportional to the fines of the opposite angles.\n\n4. Each is proportional to the fine of the angle contained by the directions of the other two; for \\(AD\\) is to \\(AB\\) as the fine of the angle \\(ABD\\) to the fine of the angle \\(ADB\\). Now the fine of \\(ABD\\) is the same with the fine of \\(BAC\\) contained between the directions \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\), and the fine of \\(ADB\\) is the same with the fine of \\(CAD\\); also \\(AB\\) is to \\(AC\\), or \\(BD\\), as the fine of \\(ADB\\) (or \\(CAD\\)) to the fine of \\(BAD\\).\n\n145. Let us now proceed to the application of this special use fundamental proposition. And we observe, in the first of the places, that since \\(AD\\) may be the diagonal of an indefinite number of parallelograms, the motion or the pressure \\(AD\\) may result from the joint action of many pairs of forces. It may be produced by forces which would separately produce the motions \\(AF\\) and \\(AG\\). This generally gives us the means of discovering the forces which concur in its production. If one of them, \\(AB\\), is known in direction and intensity, the direction \\(AC\\), parallel to \\(BD\\), and the intensity, are discovered. Sometimes we know the directions of both. Then, by drawing the parallelogram or triangle, we learn their proportions. The force which deflects any motion \\(AB\\) into a motion \\(AD\\), is had by simply drawing a line from the point \\(B\\) (to which the body would have moved from \\(A\\) in the time of really moving from \\(A\\) to \\(D\\)) to the point \\(D\\). The deflecting force is such as would have caused the body move from \\(B\\) to \\(D\\) in the same time. And, in the same manner, we get the compound motion \\(AD\\), which arises from any two simple motions \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\), by supposing both of the motions to be accomplished in succession. The final place of the body is the same, whether it moves along \\(AD\\) or along \\(AB\\) and \\(BD\\) in succession.\n\n146. This theorem is not limited to the composition Equivalent of two forces only; for since the combined action of many two forces puts the body into the same state as if their forces equivalent alone had acted on it, we may suppose this to have been the case, and then the action of a third force will produce a change on this equivalent motion. The resulting motion will be the same as if only this third force and the equivalent of the other two had acted on the body. Thus, in fig. 32., the three forces \\(AB\\), \\(AC\\), \\(AE\\), may act at once on a particle of matter. Complete the parallelogram \\(ABDC\\); the diagonal \\(AD\\) is the force which is generated by \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\). Complete the parallelogram \\(AEFD\\); the diagonal \\(AF\\) is the force resulting from the combined action of the forces \\(AB\\), \\(AC\\), and \\(AE\\). In like manner, completing the parallelogram \\(AGHF\\), the diagonal \\(AH\\) is the force resulting from the combined action of \\(AB\\), \\(AC\\), \\(AE\\), and \\(AG\\), and so on of any number of forces.\n\nThis resulting force and the resulting motion may be much more expeditiously determined, in any degree of composition, by drawing lines in the proportion and direction of the forces in succession, each from the end of the preceding. Thus, draw \\(AB\\), \\(BD\\), \\(DF\\), \\(FH\\), and join \\(AH\\); \\(AH\\) is the resulting force. The demonstration is evident.\n\n147. In the composition of more than two forces, we are not limited to one plane. The force \\(AD\\) is in the same plane with \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\); but \\(AE\\) may be elevated above this plane, and \\(AG\\) may lead below it.\nOf Moving AF is in the plane of AD and AE, and AH is in the plane of AF and AG.\n\nComplete the parallelograms ABLE, ACKE, ELFK. It is evident that ABLFKCD is a parallelopiped, and that AF is one of its diagonals. Hence we derive a more general and very useful theorem.\n\nThree forces having the proportion and direction of the three sides of a parallelopiped, compose a force having the proportion and direction of the diagonal.\n\n148. In the investigation of very complicated phenomena, the mechanician considers every force as resulting from the joint action of three forces at right angles to each other, and he takes the sum or difference of these in the same or opposite directions. Thus he obtains the three sides of a parallelopiped, and from these computes the position and magnitude of the diagonal. This is the force resulting from the composition of all the partial ones. This process is called the elimination or reduction of forces. Forces may be estimated in the direction of a given line or plane, or they may be reduced to that direction, as has been done with respect to motion. See Cor. 2. Propos. 9. in Art. 57.\n\nThe laws of motion which have now been considered, are necessary consequences of the relations of those conceptions which we form of motion and mechanical force, and they are universal facts or physical laws. To these Sir Isaac Newton has added another, which is the following.\n\nThird Law of Motion.\n\n149. Every action is accompanied by an equal and contrary reaction, or the actions of bodies on one another are always mutual, equal, and in contrary directions.\n\nIn all cases which can be accurately examined, this holds to be a universal fact. Newton has made this affirmation on the authority of what he conceives to be a law of human thought; namely that the qualities discovered in all bodies on which experiments and observations can be made, are to be considered as universal qualities of body. But if the term law of motion be limited to those consequences that necessarily flow from our notions of motion, of the causes of its production and changes, this proposition is not such a result. Because a magnet causes the iron to approach toward it, it by no means follows from this observation that the presence of the iron shall be accompanied by any motion or change of state of the magnet, or it does not appear to be necessarily supposed that the iron attracts the magnet. When this was observed, it was accounted a discovery, and a discovery which is to be ascribed to the ancients. Dr Gilbert, who first mentions it, affirms that the magnet and the iron are observed mutually to attract each other, as well as all electrical substances, and the light bodies which are attracted by them. The discovery was made by Kepler that a mutual attraction exists between the earth and the moon. Newton discovered that the sun acts on the planets, and that the earth acts on the moon. It had been observed too by Newton that the iron reacts on the magnet, that the actions of electrified bodies are mutual, and that all the actions of solid bodies are accompanied by an equal and contrary reaction. On the authority of the rule of philosophizing which he had laid down, he affirmed that the planets react on the sun, and that the sun is not at rest, but is continually agitated by a small motion round the general centre of gravitation; and he pointed out several of the consequences of this reaction.\n\nAs the celestial motions were more narrowly examined by astronomers, their consequences were found to obtain, and to produce disturbances in the planetary motions. This reciprocity of action is now found to hold with the utmost precision through the whole of the solar system; and therefore this third proposition of Newton is to be considered as a law of nature. And it is true with respect to all bodies on which experiment or observation can be made.\n\n150. This then being a universal law, we cannot divest our minds of the belief that it depends on a general principle, by which all the matter in the universe is influenced. It strongly induces the persuasion of the ultimate particles of matter being alike, that a certain number of properties belong in the same degree to each atom, and that all the sensible differences of substance which are observed, arise from a different combination of those primary atoms in the formation of a particle of those substances. All this is no doubt perfectly possible. But if each primary atom be so constituted, no action of any kind of particle or collection of particles can take place on another, which is not accompanied by an equal reaction in the opposite direction.\n\n151. Let us now direct our attention to the application of these laws. This answers a twofold purpose. The first is to discover the mechanical powers of natural substances by which they are fitted to become parts of a permanent universe. This is accomplished by observing the changes of motion which always accompany those substances. It is from these changes that the only characteristics of powers are derived; and thus is discovered the power of gravity, of magnetism, &c. Another purpose in the employment of these laws is, that, after having obtained the mechanical character of any substance, we may ascertain what will be the result of its being in the vicinity of the bodies mechanically allied, or we may ascertain what is the change induced on the condition of the neighbouring bodies.\n\n152. The mechanical powers of bodies occasionally produce accelerations, retardations, and deflections in the motions of other bodies. These names have been given, because nothing is known of their nature, or of the manner in which they are effective; they are therefore named, as they are measured by the phenomena which are observed and considered as their effects. Let us now attend a little to the principal circumstances relating to the action of these forces.\n\nOf Accelerating and Retarding Forces.\n\n153. Changes of motion are the only marks and measures of changing forces; and having no other mark of the force but the acceleration, it has obtained the name of an accelerating force. When the motion is retarded it is called retarding force. Nor is there any other measure of the intensity of an accelerating force, but the acceleration which it produces. To investigate therefore the powers which produce all the changes of motion it is necessary to obtain measures of the acceleration. What has been said of accelerations and retardations of motion is equally descriptive of the effects of accelerating and retarding forces. Hence the following proposition.\n\nIf\nCorollaries.\n\nCor. 1. The momentary change of velocity is as the force \\( f \\) and the time \\( t \\) jointly. It may be thus expressed:\n\n\\[\nv_t = \\frac{v}{t} = \\frac{f}{t}\n\\]\n\nAlso, the accelerating or retarding force is proportional to the momentary variation of the velocity, directly, and to the moment of time in which it is generated, inversely (48).\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{v}{t}, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{v}{t} = \\frac{f}{t}\n\\]\n\nIndeed, all that we know of force is that it is something which is always proportional to \\( \\frac{v}{t} \\).\n\nCor. 2. Uniformly accelerated or retarded motion is the indication of a constant or invariable accelerating force. For, in this case, the areas \\( abfe, acge, \\ldots \\) increase at the same rate with the times \\( ab, ac, \\ldots \\), and therefore the ordinates \\( ae, bf, cg, \\ldots \\) must all be equal; therefore the forces represented by them are the same, or the accelerating force does not change its intensity, or, it is constant. If, therefore, the circumstances mentioned in articles 37 and 38, are observed in any motion, the force is constant. And if the force is known to be constant, those propositions are true regarding the motions.\n\nCor. 3. No finite change of velocity is generated in an instant by an accelerating or retarding force. For the increment or decrement of velocity is always expressed by an area, or by a product \\( ft \\), one side or factor of which is a portion of time. As no finite space can be described in an instant, and the moveable must pass in succession through every point of the path, so it must acquire all the intermediate degrees of velocity. It must be continually accelerated or retarded.\n\nCor. 4. The change of velocity produced in a body in any time, by a force varying in any manner, is the proper measure of the accumulated or whole action of the force during this time. For, since the momentary change of velocity is expressed by \\( \\frac{f}{t} \\), the aggregate of all these momentary changes, that is, the whole change of velocity, must be expressed by the sum of all the quantities \\( \\frac{f}{t} \\). This is equivalent to the area of the figure employed in art. 148, and may be expressed by \\( \\int f \\cdot t \\).\n\nCorollary.\n\nThe momentary change on the square of the velocity is as the force, and as the small portion of space along which it acts, jointly;\n\n\\[\nv^2 = \\frac{f}{s}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{v^2}{s}\n\\]\n\n155. It deserves remark here, that as the momentary change of the simple velocity by any force \\( f \\) depends only on the time of its action, it being \\( = \\frac{f}{t} \\) (148.) Cor. 1. to the change on the square of the velocity depends on the space, it being \\( = \\frac{f}{s} \\). It is the same, whatever is the velocity thus changed, or even though the body be at rest when the force begins to act on it. Thus, in every second of the falling of a heavy body, the velocity is augmented 32 feet per second, and in every foot of the fall, the square of the velocity increases by 64.\n\n156. The whole area \\( AE \\cdot ea \\), expressed by \\( \\int f \\cdot s \\), expresses the whole change made on the square of the velocity which the body had in \\( A \\), whatever this velocity may have been. We may therefore suppose the body to have been at rest in \\( A \\). The area then measures the square of the velocity which the body has acquired in the point \\( E \\) of its path. It is plain that the change on \\( v^2 \\) is quite independent on the time of action, and therefore a body, in passing through the space \\( AE \\) with any initial velocity whatever, sustains the same change of the square of that velocity, if under the influence of the same force.\n\n157. This proposition is the same with the 39th of the First Book of Newton's Principia, and is perhaps the most generally useful, of all the theorems in Dynamics, in the solution of practical questions. It is to be found, without demonstration, in his earliest writings, the Optical Lectures, which he delivered in 1669 and following years.\n\n158. One important use may be made of it at present. It gives a complete solution of all the facts which were observed by Dr Hooke, and adduced by Leibnitz, with such pertinacity in support of his measure of the force of moving bodies. All of them are of precisely the same nature with the one mentioned in art. 157, or with the fact, \"that a ball projected directly upwards with a double velocity, will rise to a quadruple height,\" and that a body, moving twice as fast, will penetrate \"four times as far into a uniformly tenacious mass.\" The uniform force of gravity, or the uniform tenacity of the penetrated body, makes a uniform opposition to the motion, and may therefore be considered as a uniform retarding force. It will therefore be represented, in fig. 8, by an ordinate always of the same length, and the areas which measure the square of the velocity lost will be portions of a rectangle \\( AE \\cdot ea \\). If therefore \\( AE \\) be the penetration necessary for extinguishing the velocity \\( v_2 \\), the space \\( AB \\), necessary for extinguishing the velocity \\( v_1 \\), must be \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of \\( AE \\), because the square of \\( 1 \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the square of \\( 2 \\).\n\n159. What particularly deserves remark here, is, that this proposition is true, only on the supposition that forces are proportional to the velocities generated by them in equal times. For the demonstration of this proposition proceeds entirely on the previously established measure of\nOf Moving of acceleration. We had \\( \\dot{v} = f \\dot{i} \\); therefore \\( v = f i \\).\n\nBut \\( \\dot{v} = \\dot{s} \\); therefore \\( v = f s \\), which is precisely this proposition.\n\n160. Those may be called similar points of space, and similar instants of time, which divide given portions of space or time in the same ratio. Thus, the beginning of the 5th inch, and of the 2nd foot, are similar points of a foot, and of a yard. The beginning of the 21st minute, and of the 9th hour, are similar instants of an hour, and of a day.\n\nForces may be said to act similarly when, in similar instants of time, or similar points of the path, their intensities are in a constant ratio.\n\n161. Lemma. If two bodies be similarly accelerated during given times \\( ac \\) and \\( hk \\) (fig. 33.), they are also similarly accelerated along their respective paths AC and HK.\n\nLet \\( a, b, c \\) be instants of the time \\( ac \\), similar to the instants \\( h, i, k \\) of the time \\( hk \\). Then, by the similar accelerations, we have the force \\( ae : hf : im \\). This being the case throughout, the area \\( af \\) is to the area \\( hm \\) as the area \\( ag \\) to the area \\( hn \\). These areas are as the velocities in the two motions 48. Therefore the velocities in similar instants are in a constant ratio, that is, the velocity in the instant \\( b \\) is to that in the instant \\( i \\), as the velocity in the instant \\( c \\) to that in the instant \\( k \\).\n\nThe figures may now be taken to represent the times of the motion by their abscissae, and the velocities by their ordinates, as in art. 28. The spaces described are now represented by the areas. These being in a constant ratio, as already shewn, we have A, B, C, and H, I, K, similar points of the paths. And therefore, in similar instants of time, the bodies are in similar points of the paths. But in these instants, they are similarly accelerated, that is, the accelerations and the forces are in a constant ratio. They are therefore in a constant ratio in similar points of the paths, and the bodies are similarly accelerated along their respective paths (155.)\n\n162. If two particles of matter are similarly urged by accelerating or retarding forces during given times, the whole changes of velocity are as the forces and times jointly; or \\( v = ft \\).\n\nFor the abscissae \\( ac \\) and \\( hk \\) will represent the times, and the ordinates \\( ae \\) and \\( hl \\) will represent the forces, and then the areas will represent the changes of velocity, by art. 47. And these areas are as \\( ac \\times ae \\) to \\( hk \\times hl \\).\n\nHence \\( t = \\frac{v}{f} \\), and \\( f = \\frac{v}{t} \\).\n\n163. If two particles of matter are similarly impelled or opposed through given spaces, the changes in the squares of velocity are as the forces and spaces jointly; or \\( v^2 = fs \\).\n\nThis follows, by similar reasoning, from art. 49.\n\nIt is evident that this proposition applies directly to the argument to confidently urged for the propriety of the Leibnitzian measure of forces, namely, that four springs of equal strength, and bent to the same degree, generate, or extinguish only a double velocity.\n\n164. If two particles of matter are similarly impelled through given spaces, the spaces are as the forces and the squares of the times jointly.\n\nFor the moveables are similarly urged during the times of their motion (converse of 156.) Therefore \\( v = f t \\), and \\( v^2 = f s \\); but (158.) \\( v^2 = f s \\). Therefore \\( f s = f^2 t^2 \\) and \\( s = f t^2 \\).\n\nCorollary.\n\n\\( t^2 = \\frac{s}{f} \\) and \\( f = \\frac{s}{t^2} \\). That is, the squares of the times are as the spaces, directly, and as the forces, inversely; and the forces are as the spaces, directly, and as the squares of the times, inversely.\n\n165. The quantity of motion in a body is the sum of the motions of all its particles. Therefore, if all are moving in one direction, and with one velocity \\( v \\), and if \\( m \\) be the number of particles, or quantity of matter, \\( mv \\) will express the quantity of motion \\( q \\), or \\( q = mv \\).\n\n166. In like manner, we may conceive the accelerating forces \\( f \\), which have produced this velocity \\( v \\) in each particle, as added into one sum, or as combined on one particle. They will thus compose a force, which, for distinction's sake, it is convenient to mark by a particular name. We shall call it the motive force, and express it by the symbol \\( p \\). It will then be considered as the aggregate of the number \\( m \\) of equal accelerating forces \\( f \\), each of which produces the velocity \\( v \\) on one particle. It will produce the velocity \\( mv \\), and the same quantity of motion \\( q \\).\n\n167. Let there be another body, consisting of \\( n \\) particles, moving with one velocity \\( u \\). Let the moving force be represented by \\( \\pi \\). It is measured in like manner by \\( nu \\). Therefore we have, \\( p : \\pi = mv : nu \\), and \\( v : u = \\frac{p}{m} : \\frac{\\pi}{n} \\); that is,\n\nThe velocities which may be produced by the similar action of different motive forces, in the same time, are directly as these forces, and inversely as the quantities of matter to which they are applied.\n\nIn general, \\( \\frac{v}{f} = \\frac{p}{m} \\).\n\nAnd \\( f \\) being \\( \\frac{v}{t} \\), \\( f = \\frac{p}{mt} \\).\n\nRemark.\n\n168. In the application of the theorems concerning accelerating or retarding forces, it is necessary to attend carefully to the distinction between an accelerative and a motive force. The caution necessary here has been generally overlooked by the writers of Elements, and this has given occasion to very inadequate and erroneous notions of the action of accelerating powers. Thus, if a leaden ball hangs by a thread, which passes over a pulley, and is attached to an equal ball, movable along a horizontal plane, without the smallest obstruction, it is known, that, in one second, it will descend 8 feet, dragging the other 8 feet along the plane, with a uniformly accelerated motion, and will generate in it the velocity 16 feet per second. Let the thread be attached to three such balls. We know that it will descend 4 feet in a second, and generate the velocity 8 feet per second. Most readers are disposed to think that it should generate no greater velocity than \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\) feet per second, or \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of 16, because it is applied to three times as much matter (162.) The error\nOf Moving error lies in considering the motive force as the same in both cases, and in not attending to the quantity of matter to which it is applied. Neither of these conjectures is right. The motive force changes as the motion accelerates, and in the first case, it moves two balls, and in the second it moves four. The motive force decreases similarly in both motions. When these things are considered, we learn by articles 202 and 207, that the motions will be precisely what we observe.\n\nOf Deflecting Forces, in General.\n\n169. It was observed, in art. 71, that a curvilinear motion is a case of continual deflection. Therefore, when such motions are observed, we know that the body is under the continual influence of some natural force, acting in a direction which crooks that of the motion in every point. We must infer the magnitude and direction of this deflecting force by the magnitude and direction of the observed deflection. Therefore, all that is affirmed concerning deflections in the first and subsequent articles, may be affirmed concerning deflecting forces. It follows, from what has been established concerning the action of accelerating forces, that no force can produce a finite change of velocity in an instant. Now, a deflection is a composition of a motion already existing with a motion accelerated from rest by insensible degrees. Supposing the deflecting force of invariable direction and intensity, the deflection is the composition of a motion having a finite velocity with a motion uniformly accelerated from rest. Therefore the linear deflection from the rectilineal motion must increase by insensible degrees. The curvilinear path, therefore, must have the line of undeflected motion for its tangent. To suppose any finite angle contained between them would be to suppose a polygonal motion, and a sublunary deflection.\n\nTherefore no finite change of direction can be produced by a deflecting force in an instant.\n\n170. The most general and useful proposition on this subject is the following, founded on art. 75.\n\nThe forces by which bodies are deflected from the tangents in the different points of their curvilinear paths are proportional to the squares of the velocities in those points, directly, and inversely to the deflective chords of the equicurve circles in the same points. We may still express the proposition by the same symbol\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v^2}{c} \\]\n\nwhere \\( f \\) means the intensity of the deflecting force.\n\n171. We may also retain the meaning of the proposition expressed in article 76, where it is shown that the actual linear deflection from the tangent is the third proportional to the deflective chord and the arch described in a very small moment. For it was demonstrated in that article (see fig. 18.) that \\( BZ : BC = BC : BO \\).\n\nWe see also that \\( Bb \\), the double of \\( BO \\), is the measure of the velocity, generated by the uniform action of the deflecting force, during the motion in the arch \\( BC \\) of the curve.\n\n172. The art. 77, also furnishes a proposition of frequent and important use, viz.\n\nThe velocity in any point of a curvilinear motion is that which the deflecting force in that point would generate in the body by uniformly impelling it along the fourth part of the deflective chord of the equicurve circle.\n\nRemark.\n\n173. The propositions now given proceed on the supposition that, when the points \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) of fig. 18, after continually approaching to \\( B \\), at last coalesce with it, the last circle which is described through these three points has the same curvature which the path has in \\( B \\). It is proper to render this mode of solving these questions more plain and palpable.\n\nIf \\( ABCD \\) (fig. 35.) be a material curve or mould, and a thread be made fast to it at \\( D \\), this thread may be lapped on the convexity of this curve, till its extremity meets it in \\( A \\). Let the thread be now unlapped or evolved from the curve, keeping it always tight. It is plain that its extremity \\( A \\) will describe another curve line \\( Abc \\). All curves, in which the curvature is neither infinitely great nor infinitely small, may be thus described by a thread evolved from a proper curve. The properties of the curve \\( Abc \\) being known, Mr Huyghens (the author of this way of generating curve lines) has shewn how to construct the evolved curve \\( ABC \\) which will produce it.\n\nFrom this genesis of curves we may infer, 1st, that the detached portion of the thread is always a tangent to the curve \\( ABC \\); 2dly, that when this is in any situation \\( Bb \\), it is perpendicular to the tangent of the curve \\( Abc \\) in the point \\( b \\), and that it is, at the same time, describing an element of that curve, and an element of a circle \\( abx \\), whose momentary centre is \\( B \\), and which has \\( Bb \\) for its radius. 3dly, That the part \\( bA \\) of the curve, being described with radii growing continually shorter, is more incurvated than the circle \\( ba \\), which has \\( Bb \\) for its constant radius. For similar reasons the arch \\( bc \\) of the curve \\( Abc \\) is less incurvated than the circle \\( abx \\). 4thly, That the circle \\( abx \\) has the same curvature that the curve has in \\( b \\), or is an equicurve circle. \\( Bb \\) is the radius, and \\( B \\) the centre of curvature in the point \\( b \\).\n\n\\( ABC \\) is the curva evoluta or the evolute. \\( Abc \\) is sometimes called the involute of \\( ABC \\), and sometimes its evolventrix.\n\n174. By this way of describing curve lines, we see clearly that a body, when passing through the point \\( b \\) of the curve \\( Abc \\) may be considered as in the same state, in that instant, as in passing through the same point \\( b \\) of the circle \\( abx \\); and the ultimate ratio of the deflections in both is that of equality, and they may be used indiscriminately.\n\nThe chief difficulty in the application of the preceding theorems to the curvilinear motions which are observed in the spontaneous phenomena of nature, is in ascertaining the direction of the deflection in every point of a curvilinear motion. Fortunately, however, the most important cases, namely those motions, where the deflecting forces are always directed to a fixed point, afford a very accurate method. Such forces are called by the general name of\n\nCentral Forces.\n\n175. If bodies describe circles with a uniform motion, the deflecting forces are always directed to the centres of the\nOf Moving the circles, and are proportional to the square of the velocities, directly, and to their distances from the centre, inversely.\n\nFor, since their motion in the circumference is uniform, the areas formed by lines drawn from the centre are as the times, and therefore (72.) the deflections, and the deflecting forces (164.) are directed to the centre. Therefore, the deflective chord is, in this case, the diameter of the circle, or twice the distance of the body from the centre. Therefore, if we call the distance from the centre \\(d\\), we have \\(f = \\frac{v^2}{d}\\).\n\n176. These forces are also as the distances, directly, and as the square of the time of a revolution, inversely.\n\nFor the time of a revolution (which may be called the periodic time) is as the circumference, and therefore as the distance, directly, and as the velocity, inversely. Therefore \\(t = \\frac{d}{v}\\), and \\(v = \\frac{d}{t}\\), and \\(v^2 = \\frac{d^2}{t^2}\\), and therefore \\(f = \\frac{d}{t^2}\\).\n\n177. These forces are also as the distances, and the square of the angular velocity, jointly.\n\nFor, in every uniform circular motion, the angular velocity is inversely as the periodic time. Therefore, calling the angular velocity \\(a\\), \\(a^2 = \\frac{1}{t^2}\\), and \\(d^2 = d \\cdot a^2\\), and therefore \\(f = \\frac{d}{a^2}\\).\n\n178. The periodic time is to the time of falling along half the radius by the uniform action of the centripetal force in the circumference, as the circumference of a circle is to the radius.\n\nFor, in the time of falling through half the radius, the body would describe an arch equal to the radius (37.—6.) because the velocity acquired by this fall is equal to the velocity in the circumference (167.). The periodic time is to the time of describing that arch as the circumference to the arch, that is, as the circumference is to the radius.\n\n179. When a body describes a curve which is all in one plane, and a point is so situated in that plane, that a line drawn from it to the body describes round that point areas proportional to the times, the deflecting force is always directed to that point (72.)\n\n180. Conversely. If a body is deflected by a force always directed to a fixed point, it will describe a curve lying in one plane which passes through that point, and the line joining it with the centre of forces will describe areas proportional to the times (73.)\n\nThe line joining the body with the centre is called the radius vector. The deflecting force is called centripetal, or attractive, if its direction be always toward that centre. It is called repulsive, or centrifugal, if it be directed outwards from the centre. In the first case, the curve will have its concavity toward the centre, but, in the second case, it will be convex toward the centre. The force which urges a piece of iron towards a magnet is centripetal, and that which causes two electrical bodies to separate is centrifugal.\n\n181. The force by which a body may be made to describe circles round the centre of forces, with the angular velocities which it has in the different points of its curvilinear path, are inversely as the cubes of its distances from the centre of forces. For the centripetal force in circular motions is proportional to \\(da^2\\) (172.) But when the deflections (and consequently the forces) are directed to a centre, we have \\(a = \\frac{1}{d^2}\\) (75.) and \\(a^2 = \\frac{1}{d^4}\\), therefore \\(da^2 = d \\times \\frac{1}{d^4} = \\frac{1}{d^3}\\), therefore \\(f = \\frac{1}{d^3}\\).\n\nThis force is often called centrifugal, the centrifugal force of circular motion, and it is conceived as always acting in every case of curvilinear motion, and to act in opposition to the centripetal force which produces that motion. But this is inaccurate. We suppose this force, merely because we must employ a centripetal force, just as we suppose a resisting vis inertiae, because we must employ force to move a body.\n\n182. If a body describe a curve line ABC by means of a centripetal (fig. 36.) force directed to S, and varying according to some proportion of the distances from it, and if another body be impelled toward S in the straight line aS by the same force, and if the two bodies have the same velocity in any points A and a which are equidistant from S, they will have equal velocities in any other two points C and c, which are also equidistant from S.\n\nDescribe round S, with the distance SA, the circular arch Aa, which will pass through the equidistant point a. Describe another arch Bb, cutting off a small arc AB of the curve, and also cutting AS in D. Draw DE perpendicular to the curve.\n\nThe distances AS and aS being equal, the centripetal forces are also equal, and may be represented by the equal lines AD and ab. The velocities at A and a being equal, the times of describing AB and ab will be as the spaces (14.) The force ab is wholly employed in accelerating the rectilineal motion along aS. But the force AD, being transverse or oblique to the motion along AB, is not wholly employed in thus accelerating the motion. It is equivalent to the two forces AE and ED, of which ED, being perpendicular to AB, neither promotes nor opposes it, but incurvates the motion. The accelerating force in A therefore is AE. It was shewn, in art. 48, that the change of velocity is as the force and as the time jointly, and therefore it is as AE \\(\\times\\) AB. For the same reason, the change of the velocity at a is as ab \\(\\times\\) ab, or ab². But, as the angle ADB is a right angle, as also AED, we have AE : AD = AD : AB, and AE \\(\\times\\) AB = AD² = ab². Therefore, the increments of velocity acquired along AB and ab are equal. But the velocities at A and a were equal. Therefore the velocities at B and b are also equal. The same thing may be said of every subsequent increase of velocity, while moving along BC and bc; and therefore the velocities at C and c are equal.\n\nThe same thing holds, when the deflecting force is directed in lines parallel to aS, as if to a point S' infinitely distant, the one body describing the curve line VA'B', while the other describes the straight line VS.\n\n183. The propositions in art 73. and 74. are also true in curvilinear motions by means of central forces.\nWhen the path of the motion is a line returning into itself, like a circle or oval, it is called an orbit; otherwise it is called a trajectory.\n\nThe time of a complete revolution round an orbit is called the periodic time.\n\n184. The formula \\( f = \\frac{v^2}{c} \\) serves for discovering the law of variation of the central force by which a body describes the different portions of its curvilinear path; and the formula \\( f = \\frac{d}{r^2} \\) serves for comparing the forces by which different bodies describe their respective orbits.\n\n185. It must always be remembered, in conformity to art. 77, that \\( f = \\frac{v^2}{c} \\) or \\( f = \\frac{\\text{arc}^2}{c} \\) expresses the linear deflection from the tangent, which may be taken for a measure of the deflecting force, and that \\( f = \\frac{2v^2}{c} \\) or \\( f = \\frac{2\\text{arc}^2}{c} \\) expresses the velocity generated by this force, during the description of the arc, or the velocity which may be compared directly with the velocity of the motion in the arc. The last is the most accurate, because the velocity generated is the real change of condition.\n\n186. A body may describe, by the action of a centripetal force, the direction of which passes through C (fig. 36), a figure VPS, which figure revolves (in its own plane) round the centre of forces C, in the same manner as it describes the quiescent figure, provided that the angular motion of the body in the orbit be to that of the orbit itself in any constant ratio, such as that of m to n.\n\nFor, if the direction of the orbit's motion be the same with that of the body moving in it, the angular motion of the body in every point of its motion is increased in the ratio of m to n + m, and it will be in the same ratio in the different parts of the orbit as before, that is, it will be inversely as the square of the distance from S (75). Moreover, as the distances from the centre in the simultaneous positions of the body, in the quiescent and in the revolving orbit, are the same, the momentary increments of the area are as the momentary increments of the angle at the centre; and therefore, in both motions, the areas increase in the constant ratio of m to m + n (75.) Therefore the areas of the absolute path, produced by the composition of the two motions, will still be proportional to the times; and therefore (73.) the deflecting force must be directed to the centre S; or, a force so directed will produce this compound motion.\n\n187. The differences between the forces by which a body may be made to move in the quiescent and in the moveable orbit are in the inverse triplicate ratio of the distances from the centre of forces.\n\nLet VKSBV (fig. 36.) be the fixed orbit, and u p k b n the same orbit moved into another position; and let VP n No N t QV be the orbit described by the body in absolute space by the composition of its motion in the orbit with the motion of the orbit itself. If the body be supposed to describe the arch VP of the fixed orbit while the axis VC moves into the situation u C, and if the arch u p be made equal to VP, then p will be the place of the body in the moveable orbit, and in the compound path V p. If the angular motion in the fixed orbit be to the motion of the moving orbit as m to n, it is plain that the angle VCP is to VCP as m to m + n. Let PK and p k be two equal and very small arches of the fixed and moving orbits. PC and p c are equal, as are also KC and k C, and a circle described round C with the radius CK will pass through k. If we now make VCK to VC n as m to m + n: the point n of the circle K k n will be the point of the compound path, at which the body in the moving orbit arrives when the body in the fixed orbit arrives at K, and p n is the arch of the absolute path described while PK is described in the fixed path.\n\nIn order to judge of the difference between the force which produces the motion PK in the fixed orbit and that which produces p n in the absolute path, it must be observed that, in both cases, the body is made to approach the centre by the difference between CP and CK. This happens, because the centripetal forces, in both cases, are greater than what would enable the body to describe circles round C, at the distance CP, and with the same angular velocities that obtain in the two paths, viz. the fixed orbit and the absolute path. We shall call the one pair of forces the circular forces, and the other the orbital. Let C and c represent the forces which would produce circles, with the angular velocities which obtain in the fixed and moving orbits, and let O and o be the forces which produce the orbital motions in these two paths.\n\nThese things being premised, it is plain that o — c is equal to O — C, because the bodies are equally brought towards the centre by the difference between O and C and by that between o and c. Therefore o — O is equal to c — C (a). The difference, therefore, of the forces which produce the motions in the fixed and moving orbits is always equal to the difference of the forces which would produce a circular motion at the same distances, and with the same angular velocity. But the forces which produce circular motions, with the angular motion that obtains in an orbit at different distances from the centre of forces, are as the cubes of the distances inversely (175.) And the two angular motions at the same distance are in the constant ratio of m to m + n. Therefore the forces are in a constant ratio to each other, and their differences are in a constant ratio to either of the forces. But the circular force at different distances is inversely as the cube of the distance (221). Therefore the difference of them in the fixed and moveable orbits is in the same proportion. But the difference of the orbital forces is equal to that of the circular. Therefore, finally, the difference of the centripetal\n\n(a) For let A o, AO, Ac, AC represent the four forces o, O, c, and C. By what has been said, we find that o c = OC. To each of these add O c, and then it is plain that o = c C, that is, that the difference of the circular forces c and C is equal to that of the orbital forces o and O.\nOf Moving petal forces by which a body may be retained in a fixed orbit, and in the same orbit moving as determined in article 180, is always in the inverse triplicate ratio of the distances from the centre of forces.\n\nIn this example, the motion of the body in the orbit is in the same direction with that of the orbit, and the force to be joined with that in the fixed orbit is always additive. Had the orbit moved in the opposite direction, the force to be joined would have been subtractive, unless the retrograde motion of the orbit exceeded twice the angular motion of the body. But in all cases, the reasoning is similar.\n\n188. Thus we have considered the motions of bodies influenced by forces directed to a fixed point. But we cannot conceive a mere mathematical point of space as the cause or occasion of any such exertion of forces. Such relations are observed only between existing bodies or masses of matter. The propositions which have been demonstrated may be true in relation to bodies placed in those fixed points. That continual tendency towards a centre, which produces an equable description of areas round it, becomes intelligible, if we suppose some body placed in the centre of forces, attracting the revolving body. Accordingly, we see very remarkable examples of such tendencies towards a central body in the motions of the planets round the sun, and of the satellites round the primary planet.\n\nBut, since it is a universal fact that all the relations between bodies are mutual, we are obliged to suppose that whatever force inclines the revolving body towards the body placed in the centre of forces, an equal force (from whatever source it is derived) inclines the central body toward the revolving body, and therefore it cannot remain at rest, but must move towards it. The notion of a fixed centre of forces is thus taken away again, and we seem to have demonstrated propositions inapplicable to anything in nature. But more attentive consideration will show us that our propositions are most strictly applicable to the phenomena of nature.\n\n189. For, in the first place, the motion of the common centre of position of two, or of any number of bodies, is not affected by their mutual actions. These, being equal and opposite, produce equal and opposite motions, or changes of motion. In this case, it follows from art. 115, that the state of the common centre is not affected by them.\n\n190. Now, suppose two bodies S and P, situated at the extremities of the line SP (fig. 37.) Their centre of position is in a point C, dividing their distance in such a manner that SC is to CP as the number of material atoms in P to the number in S or SC : PC = P : S. Suppose the mutual forces to be centripetal. Then, being equal, exerted between every atom of the one, and every particle of the other, the vis motrix may be expressed by $P \\times S$. This must produce equal quantities of motion in each of the bodies, and therefore must produce velocities inversely as the quantities of matter. In any given portion of time, therefore, the bodies will move towards each other, to $s$ and $p$, and $S : s$ will be to $P : p$ as $P$ to $S$, that is, as $SC$ to $PC$. Therefore we shall still have $s : C : p C = SC : PC$. Their distances from C will always be in the same proportion. Also we shall have $SC : SP = s : P : S + P$; and therefore $SC : SP = s : C : s P$. Consequently, in whatever manner the mutual forces vary by a variation of distance from each other, they will vary in the same manner by the same variation of distance from C. And, conversely, in whatever manner the forces vary by a change of distance from C, they vary in the same manner by the same change of distance from each other.\n\nLet us now suppose that when the bodies are at S and P, equal moving forces are applied to each in the opposite directions SA and PB. Did they not attract each other at all, they would, at the end of some small portion of time, be found in the points A and B of a straight line drawn through C, because they will move with equal quantities of motion, or with velocities SA and PB inversely as their quantities of matter. Therefore $SA : PB = SC : PC$, and A, C, and B are in a straight line. But let them now attract, when impelled from S and P. Being equally attracted toward each other, they will describe curves $Sa$ and $Pb$, so that their deflections $Aa$ and $Bb$ are as $SC$ and $PC$; and we shall have $aC : bC = SC : PC$. As this is true of every part of the curve, it follows that they describe similar curves round C, which remains in its original place.\n\nLastly, If the motion of P be considered by an observer placed in S, unconscious of its motion, since he judges of the motion of P only by its change of direction and of distance, we may make a figure which will perfectly represent this motion. Draw the line EF equal and parallel to PS, and EG equal and parallel to $ab$. Do this for every point of the curve $Sa$ and $Pb$. We shall then form a curve FG similar to the curves $Sa$ and $Pb$, having the homologous lines equal to the sum of the homologous lines of these two curves. Thus the bodies will describe round each other curve lines which are similar and equal (linearly) to the lines which they describe round their common centre by the same forces. They may appear to describe areas proportional to the times round each other; and they really describe areas proportional to the times round their common centre of position, and the forces, which really relate to the body which is supposed to be central, have the same mathematical relation to their common centre.\n\nThus it appears that the mechanical inferences, drawn from a supposed relation to a mere point of space, are true in the real relations to the supposed central body, although it is not fixed in one place.\n\n191. The time of describing any arch FG of the curve described round the other body at rest in a centre of forces (where we may suppose it forcibly withheld from moving) is to the time of describing the similar arch $Pb$ round the common centre of position in the subduplicate ratio of $S + P$ to $S$, that is, in the ratio of $\\sqrt{S + P}$ to $\\sqrt{S}$. For the forces being the same in both motions, the spaces described by their similar actions, that is, their deflections from the tangent, are as the squares of the times $T$ and $t$ (204). That is, $HG : BA = T^2 : t^2$; and $T : t = \\sqrt{HG} : \\sqrt{BA} = \\sqrt{S + P} : \\sqrt{S}$.\n\nHence it follows that the two bodies S and P are moved in the same way as if they did not act on each other, but were both acted upon by a third body, placed in their common centre C, and acting with the same forces on each; and the law of variation of the forces by a change of distance from each other, and from this third body, is the same.\n\n192. If a body P (fig. 38.) revolve around another body...\nDYNAMICS.\n\nOf Moving body S, by the action of a central force, while S moves in any path ASB, P will continue to describe areas proportional to the times round S, if every particle in P be affected by the same accelerating force that acts, in that instant, on every particle in S. For, such action will compound the same motions Pp and Ss with the motions of S and P, whatever they are; and it was shown in art. 69, that such composition does not affect their relative motions. This is another way of making a body describe the same orbit in motion which it describes while the orbit is fixed (186).\n\nERRATUM in DYNAMICS.—Line 10th from the bottom, Col. 13, For fig. 11 read fig. 1. Plate CLXXXIV.\n\nDYNA\n\nDYANOMETER, an instrument for ascertaining the relative strength of men and animals. Of an instrument of this kind, invented by Regnier, and of which a description is given in vol. ii. Jour. de l'Ecole Polytechnique, the author thus speaks. \"Some important knowledge, says he, might be acquired, had we the easy means of ascertaining, in a comparative manner, our relative strengths at the different periods of life, and in different states of health. Buffon and Gueneau, who had some excellent ideas on this subject, requested me to endeavour to invent a portable machine, which, by an easy and simple mechanism, might conduct to a solution of this question, on which they were then engaged. These philosophers were acquainted with that invented by Graham, and improved by Dr Defaguliers, at London; but this machine, constructed of wooden-work, was too bulky and heavy to be portable; and, besides, to make experiments on the different parts of the body, several machines were necessary, each suited to the part required to be tried. They were acquainted also with the dynanometer of Citizen Leroy of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. It consisted of a metal tube 10 or 12 inches in length, placed vertically on a foot like that of a candlestick, and containing in the inside a spiral spring, having above it a graduated shank terminating in a globe. This shank, together with the spring, sunk into the tube in proportion to the weight acting upon it, and thus pointed out, in degrees, the strength of the person who pressed on the ball with his hand.\n\nThis instrument, though ingenious, did not appear sufficient however to Buffon and Gueneau; for they wished not merely to ascertain the muscular force of a finger or hand, but to estimate that of each limb separately, and of all the parts of the body. I shall not here give an account of the attempts I made to fulfil the wishes of these two philosophers, but only observe, that in the course of my experiments I had reason to be convinced that the construction of the instrument was not so easy as might have been expected. Besides the use which an enlightened naturalist may make of this machine, it may be possible to apply it to many other important purposes. For example, it may be employed with advantage to determine the strength of draught cattle; and, above all, to try that of horses, and compare it with the strength of other animals. It may serve to make known how far the assistance of well-constructed wheels may favour the movement of a carriage, and what is its vis inertiae in proportion to the load. We might appreciate by it, also, what resistance the slope of a mountain opposes to a carriage, and be able to judge whether a carriage is sufficiently loaded in proportion to the number of horses that are to be yoked to it. In the arts, it may be applied to machines of which we wish to ascertain the resistance, and when we are desirous to calculate the moving force that ought to be adapted to them. It may serve, also, as a Roman balance to weigh burdens. In short, nothing would be easier than to convert it into an anemometer, to discover the absolute force of the wind, by fitting to it a frame of a determined size filled up with wax-cloth; and it would not be impossible to ascertain by this machine the recoil of fire-arms, and consequently the strength of gun-powder.\n\nThis dynanometer, in its form and size, has a near resemblance to a common graphometer. It consists of a spring twelve inches in length, bent into the form of an ellipse; from the middle of which arises a semicircular piece of brass, having engraved upon it the different degrees that express a force of the power acting on the spring. The whole of this machine, which weighs only two pounds and a half, opposes, however, more resistance than may be necessary to determine the action of the strongest and most robust horse.\" For a fuller description, see Phil. Mag. vol. i.\n\nDYNASTY, among ancient historians, signifies a race or succession of kings of the same line or family. Such were the dynasties of Egypt. The word is formed from the Greek δυναστεία of δυνάστης, to be powerful, or king.\n\nThe Egyptians reckon 30 dynasties within the space of 36,525 years; but the generality of chronologers look upon them as fabulous. And it is very certain, that these dynasties are not continually successive, but collateral.\n\nDYRRACHIUM, in Ancient Geography, a town on the coast of Illyricum, before called Epidamnum, or Epidamnus, an inauspicious name, changed by the Romans to Dyrrachium; a name taken from the peninsula on which it stood. Originally built by the Corcyreans, A Roman colony (Pliny). A town famous in story; its port answered to that of Brundusium, and the passage between\nbetween both was very ready and expeditious. It was also a very famous mart for the people living on the Adriatic; and the free admission of strangers contributed much to its increase: A contrast to the conduct of the Apollonians; who, in imitation of the Spartans, discouraged strangers from settling among them.\n\nDYSÆ, in Mythology, inferior goddesses among the Saxons, being the messengers of the great Woden, whose province it was to convey the souls of such as died in battle to his abode, called Valhalla, i.e. the hall of slaughter; where they were to drink with him and their other gods cerevisia, or a kind of malt liquor, in the skulls of their enemies. The Dysæ conveyed those who died a natural death to Hela, the goddess of hell, where they were tormented with hunger, thirst, and every kind of evil.\n\nDYSCRASY, among physicians, denotes an ill habit or state of the humours, as in the scurvy, jaundice, &c.\n\nDYSENTERY, in Medicine, a diarrhoea or flux, wherein the stools are mixed with blood, and the bowels miserably tormented with gripes. See Medicine Index.\n\nDYSENTERIC FEVER. Ibid.\n\nDYSSERT, a parliament town of Scotland, in the county of Fife, situated on the northern shore of the frith of Forth, about 11 miles north of Edinburgh.\n\nDYSOREXY, among physicians, denotes a want of appetite, proceeding from a weakly stomach.\n\nDYSPEPSY, a difficulty of digestion.\n\nDYSPNOEA, a difficulty of breathing, usually called asthma. See Medicine Index.\n\nDYSURY, in Medicine, a difficulty of making water, attended with a sensation of heat and pain. See Medicine Index.\n\nDYTISCUS, WATER-BEETLE. See Entomology Index.\n\nDYVOUR, in Scots Law; otherwise Bare-man: A person who, being involved in debt, and unable to pay the same,—for avoiding imprisonment and other pains, makes cession of his effects in favour of his creditors; and does his devoir and duty to them, proclaiming himself bare-man and indigent, and becoming debt bound to them of all that he has. The word is used in the same sense as Bankrupt; see that article; and Law Index.\n\nE.\n\nE, THE second vowel, and fifth letter of the alphabet. The letter E is most evidently derived from the old character י in the ancient Hebrew and Phoenician alphabets, inverted by the Greeks to this position Ε, and not from the Hebrew He ה. From the same origin is also derived the Saxon e, which is the first letter in their alphabet that differs from the Latin one. It is formed by a narrower opening of the larynx than the letter A; but the other parts of the mouth are used nearly in the same manner as in that letter.\n\nIt has a long and short sound in most languages. The short sound is audible in bed, fret, den, and other words ending in consonants: its long sound is produced by a final e, or an e at the end of words; as in glebe, here, hire, scene, sphere, interfere, reverse, sincere, &c., in most of which it sounds like ee; as also in some others by coming after i, as in believe, chief, grief, reprieve, &c., and sometimes this long sound is expressed by ee, as in bleed, beer, creed, &c. Sometimes the final e is silent, and only serves to lengthen the sound of the preceding vowel, as in rag, rage, flag, flage, hug, huge, &c. The sound of e is obscure in the following words oxen, heaven, bouned, fire, massacre, maugre, &c.\n\nThe Greeks have their long and short e which they call epsilon and eta. The French have at least five kinds of e's: the Latins have likewise a long and short e; they also write e instead of a, as dicem for dicam, &c., and this is no doubt the reason why a is so often changed into e in the preter tense, as ago, agi; facio, feci, &c.\n\nAs a numeral, E stands for 250, according to the Eachard verse,\n\nE, quoque ducentos et quinquaginta tenebit.\n\nIn music it denotes the tone e-la-mi. In the calendar it is the fifth of the dominical letters. And in sea charts it distinguishes all the easterly points: thus, E alone denotes East; and E. by S. and E. by N. East by South, and East by North.\n\nEACHARD, JOHN, an English divine of great learning and wit in the 17th century, bred at Cambridge, author (in 1670) of The Grounds and Occasions of the Contempt of the Clergy and Religion inquired into. In 1675 he was chosen master of Catharine-hall upon the decease of Dr John Lightfoot; and the year following was created D.D. by royal mandate. He died in 1696.\n\nEACHARD, Laurence, an eminent English historian of the 18th century, nearly related to Dr John Eachard. He was the son of a clergyman, who, by the death of his elder brother, became master of a good estate in Suffolk. He was educated in the university of Cambridge, entered into holy orders, and was presented to the living of Welton and Elkington in Lincolnshire, where he spent above 20 years of his life, and distinguished himself by his writings, especially his History of England, which was attacked by Dr Edmund Calamy and by Mr John Oldmixon. His \"General Ecclesiastical History from the Nativity of Christ to the first Establishment of Christianity by Human Laws under the emperor Constantine the Great,\" has passed through several editions. He was installed archdeacon of\nEadmerus, an esteemed historian, was an Englishman; but his parents, and the particular time and place of his nativity, are not known. He received a learned education, and very early discovered a taste for history, by recording every remarkable event that came to his knowledge. Being a monk in the cathedral of Canterbury, he had the happiness to become the bosom friend and inseparable companion of two archbishops of that see, St Anselm and his successor Ralph. To the former of these he was appointed spiritual director by the pope; and that prelate would do nothing without his permission. In the year 1120, he was sent for by King Alexander I. of Scotland, to be raised to the primacy of that kingdom; and having obtained leave of King Henry and the archbishop of Canterbury, he departed for Scotland, where he was kindly received by the king; and on the third day after his arrival, he was elected bishop of St Andrew's with much unanimity. But on the day after his election, an unfortunate dispute arose between the king and him, in a private conference about his consecration. Eadmerus having been a constant companion of the late and of the present archbishop of Canterbury, was a violent stickler for the prerogatives of that see. He therefore told the king, that he was determined to be consecrated by none but the archbishop of Canterbury, who he believed to be the primate of all Britain. Alexander, who was a fierce prince, and supported the independency of his crown and kingdom with great spirit, was so much offended, that he broke off the conference in a violent passion, declaring, that the see of Canterbury had no pre-eminency over that of St Andrew's. This breach between the king and the bishop-elect became daily wider, till at length Eadmerus, despairing of recovering the royal favour, sent his pastoral ring to the king, and laid his pastoral staff on the high altar, from whence he had taken it, and abandoning his bishopric returned to England. He was kindly received by the archbishop and clergy of Canterbury, though they disapproved of his stiffness, and thought him too hasty in forsaking the honourable station to which he had been called. Nor was it long before Eadmerus became sensible of his error, and desirous of correcting it. With this view he wrote a long submissive letter to the king of Scotland, entreating his leave to return to his bishopric, promising compliances with his royal pleasure in every thing respecting his consecration, which was accompanied by an epistle to the same purpose from the archbishop. These letters, however, which were written A.D. 1122, did not produce the desired effect. But Eadmerus is most worthy of the grateful remembrance of posterity for his historical works, particularly for his excellent history of the affairs of England in his own time, from A.D. 1066 to A.D. 1122; in which he hath inserted many original papers, and preserved many important facts, that are nowhere else to be found. This work hath been highly commended, both by ancient and modern writers, for its authenticity, as well as for regularity of compilation and purity of style. It is indeed more free from legendary tales than any other work of this period; and it is impossible to peruse it with attention, without conceiving a favourable opinion of Eagles, the learning, good sense, sincerity, and candour of its author.\n\nEAGLE. See Falco, Ornithology Index.\n\nEagle, in Heraldry, is accounted one of the most noble bearings in armoury; and, according to the learned in this science, ought to be given to none but such as greatly excel in the virtues of generosity and courage, or for having done singular services to their sovereigns; in which cases they may be allowed a whole eagle, or an eagle naiant, or only the head or other parts thereof, as may be most agreeable to their exploits.\n\nThe eagle has been borne, by way of ensign or standard, by several nations. The first who seem to have assumed the eagle are the Persians; according to the testimony of Xenophon. Afterwards it was taken by the Romans; who, after a great variety of standards, at length fixed on the eagle, in the second year of the consulate of C. Marius: till that time, they used indifferently wolves, leopards, and eagles, according to the humour of the commander.\n\nThe Roman eagles, it must be observed, were not painted on a cloth or flag; but were figures in relievo, of silver or gold, borne on the tops of pikes; the wings being displayed, and frequently a thunderbolt in their talons. Under the eagle on the pike, were piled bucklers, and sometimes crowns. Thus much we learn from the medals.\n\nConstantine is said to have first introduced the eagle with two heads, to intimate, that though the empire seemed divided, it was yet only one body. Others say, that it was Charlemagne who resumed the eagle as the Roman ensign, and added to it a second head; but that opinion is destroyed, by an eagle with two heads, noted by Liphius, on the Antonine column; as also by the eagle's only having one head on the feet of the golden bull of the emperor Charles IV. The conjecture, therefore, of F. Menefrier appears more probable, who maintains, that as the emperors of the East, when there were two on the throne, at the same time, struck their coins with the impression of a cross, with a double travers, which each of them held in one hand, as being the symbol of the Christians; the like they did with the eagle in their ensigns; and instead of doubling their eagles, they joined them together, and represented them with two heads. In which they were followed by the emperors of the West.\n\nF. Papebroche wishes that this conjecture of Menefrier were confirmed by ancient coins; without which, he rather inclines to think the use of the eagle with two heads to be merely arbitrary; though he grants it probable, that it was first introduced on occasion of two emperors on the same throne.\n\nThe eagle on medals, according to M. Spanheim, is a symbol of divinity and providence; and, according to all other antiquaries, of empire. The princes on whose medals it is most usually found, are the Ptolemies and the Seleucides of Syria. An eagle with the word consecratio, expresses the apotheosis of an emperor.\n\nEagles, a name found very frequently in the ancient histories of Ireland, and used to express a sort of base money that was current in that kingdom in the first...\nEagle first years of the reign of Edward I. that is, about the year 1272. There were, besides the eagles, lionines, rosettes, and many other coins of the same sort, named according to the figures they were impressed with.\n\nThe current coin of the kingdom was at that time a composition of copper and silver, in a determined proportion, but these were so much worse than the standard proportion of that time, that they were not intrinsically worth quite half so much as the others. They were imported out of France and other foreign countries. When this prince had been a few years established on the throne, he set up mints in Ireland for the coining sufficient quantities of good money, and then decreed the use of these eagles, and other like kinds of base coins, and made it death, with confiscation of effects, to import any more of them into the kingdom.\n\nEAGLE, in Astronomy, is a constellation of the northern hemisphere, having its right wing contiguous to the equinoctial. See AQUILA.\n\nThere are also three several stars, particularly denominated among the Arab astronomers, nafr; i.e. \"eagle.\" The first, nafr sahail, the \"eagle of Canopus,\" called also sahail jemen, the star of Arabia Felix, over which it is supposed to preside; the second, nafr al-thair, the \"flying eagle;\" and the third, nafr al-wake, the \"reflting eagle.\"\n\nWhite EAGLE, is a Polish order of knighthood, instituted in 1325 by Uladislaus V. on marrying his son Casimir with a daughter of the great duke of Lithuania.\n\nThe knights of this order were distinguished by a gold chain, which they wore on the stomach, whereon hung a silver eagle crowned.\n\nBlack EAGLE, was a like order, instituted in 1701 by the elector of Brandenburgh, on his being crowned King of Prussia.\n\nThe knights of this order wear an orange-coloured ribbon, to which is suspended a black eagle.\n\nEAGLE, in Architecture, is a figure of that bird anciently used as an attribute, or cognizance of Jupiter, in the capital and friezes of the columns of temples consecrated to that god.\n\nEAGLE-flower. See BALSAMINE.\n\nEAGLE-stone, in Natural History, is a stone by the Greeks called atties, and by the Italian pietra d'aquila, as being supposed to be sometimes found in the eagle's nest. It is of famous traditionary virtue, either for forwarding or preventing the delivery of women in labour, according as it is applied above or below the womb. Matthiolus tells us, that birds of prey could never hatch their young without it, and that they go in search of it as far as the East Indies. Baufch has an express Latin treatise on the subject. See ATTIES.\n\nEAGLET, a diminutive of eagle, properly signifying a young eagle. In heraldry, when there are several eagles on the same escutcheon, they are termed eaglets.\n\nEALDERMAN, or EALDORMAN, among the Saxons, was of like import with earl among the Danes.\n\nThe word was also used for an elder, senator, or statesman. Hence, at this day, we call those aldermen who are associates to the chief officer in the common council of a city or corporate town.\n\nEAR. See ANATOMY Index.\n\nSeveral naturalists and physicians have held, that cutting off the ear rendered persons barren and unprofitable; and this idle notion was what first occasioned the legislators to order the ears of thieves, &c., to be cut off, lest they should produce their like.\n\nThe ear has its beauties, which a good painter ought by no means to disregar; where it is well formed, it would be an injury to the head to be hidden. Suetonius inflicts, particularly, on the beauties of Augustus's ears; and Ælian, describing the beauties of Aspasia, observes, she had short ears. Martial also ranks large ears among the number of the deformities.\n\nAmong the Athenians, it was a mark of nobility to have the ears bored or perforated. And among the Hebrews and Romans, this was a mark of servitude.\n\nLoss of one ear is a punishment enacted by 5 and 6 Edw. VI. cap. 4, for fighting in a churchyard; and by 2 and 3 Edw. VI. cap. 15, for combinations to raise the price of provisions, labour, &c., if it be the third offence, beside pillory, and perpetual infamy, or a fine of 40l.\n\nBy a statute of Henry VIII., maliciously cutting off the ear of a person is made a trespass, for which treble damages shall be recovered; and the offender is to pay a fine of ten pounds to the king, 37 Hen. VIII. cap. 6, § 4. In the Index to the Statutes at Large, it is said, that this offence may be punished as felony, by 22 and 23 Car. II. cap. 1, § 7, commonly called Coventry's act; but ear is not mentioned in that statute.\n\nEAR of Fifes. See ANATOMY Index.\n\nEAR, in Music, denotes a kind of internal sense, whereby we perceive and judge of harmony and musical sounds. See MUSIC.\n\nIn music we seem universally to acknowledge something like a distinct sense from the external one of hearing; and call it a good ear. And the like distinction we should probably acknowledge in other affairs, had we got distinct names to denote these powers of perception by. Thus a greater capacity of perceiving the beauties of painting, architecture, &c., is called a fine taste.\n\nEAR is also used to signify a long cluster of flowers or seeds, produced by certain plants; usually called by botanists spica. The flowers and seeds of wheat, rye, barley, &c., grow in ears. The same holds of the flowers of lavender, &c. We say the stem of the ear, i.e., its tube or straw; the knot of the ear; the lobes or cells wherein the grains are enclosed; the beard of the ear, &c.\n\nEAR-Ach. See MEDICINE Index.\n\nEARING, in the sea language, is that part of the bolt rope which at the four corners of the sail is left open, in the shape of a ring. The two uppermost parts are put over the ends of the yard arms, and so the sail is made fast to the yard; and into the lower most earings, the sheets and tacks are seized or bent at the clew.\n\nEAR-Pick, an instrument of ivory, silver, or other metal, somewhat in form of a probe, for cleansing the ear. The Chinese have a variety of these instruments,\nEAR\n\nwith which they are mighty fond of tickling their ears; but this practice, Sir Hans Sloane observes, must be very prejudicial to so delicate an organ, by bringing too great a flow of humours on it.\n\nEAR-RING. See PENDANT.\n\nEAR-WAX. See ANATOMY INDEX.\n\nEARWIG. See TORFICULA, ENTOMOLOGY INDEX.\n\nEARL, a British title of nobility, next below a marquis, and above a viscount.\n\nThe title is so ancient, that its original cannot be clearly traced out. This much, however, seems tolerably certain, that among the Saxons they were called caldormen, quasi elder men, signifying the same with senior or senator among the Romans; and also schiremen, because they had each of them the civil government of a several division or shire. On the irruption of the Danes they changed their names to eorels, which, according to Camden, signified the same in their language. In Latin they are called comites, (a title first used in the empire), from being the king's attendants; a societate nomen sumusfertunt, reges enim tales fibi afficiant.\n\nAfter the Norman conquest they were for some time called counts, or countess, from the French; but they did not long retain that name themselves, though their titles are from thence called counties to this day. It is now become a mere title: they having nothing to do with the government of the county; which is now entirely devolved on the sheriff, the earl's deputy, or vicecomes. In writs, commissions, and other formal instruments, the king, when he mentions any peer of the degree of an earl, usually styles him \"truly and well beloved count,\" an appellation as ancient as the reign of Henry IV.; who being either by his wife, his mother, or his sisters, actually related or allied to every earl in the kingdom, artfully and constantly acknowledged that connexion in all his letters and other public acts; whence the usage has descended to his successors, though the reason has long ago failed.\n\nAn earl is created by cincture of sword, mantle of state put upon him by the king himself, a cap and a coronet put upon his head, and a charter in his hand.\n\nEARL Marshal. See MARSHAL.\n\nEARNEST (ARRHÆ), money advanced to bind the parties to the performance of a verbal bargain. By the civil law, he who recedes from his bargain loses his earnest, and if the person who received the earnest give back, he is to return the earnest double. But with us, the person who gave it, is in strictness obliged to abide by his bargain; and in case he decline it, is not discharged upon forfeiting his earnest, but may be sued for the whole money stipulated.\n\nEARTH, among ancient philosophers, one of the four elements of which the whole system of nature was thought to be composed. See ELEMENT.\n\nEARTHS, in Chemistry, are such substances as have neither taste nor smell, are incombustible, are nearly insoluble in water, and have a specific gravity under 5. Such are lime, barytes, &c. See CHEMISTRY INDEX.\n\nEARTH, in Astronomy and Geography, one of the primary planets; being this terraqueous globe which we inhabit.\n\nFor the astronomical facts with regard to the earth, see ASTRONOMY; for its geographical history, see GEOGRAPHY; and for the opinions or theories of its Earthquake formation and changes, see GEOLOGY INDEX.\n\nEARTHQUAKE. See GEOLOGY INDEX.\n\nEARTHWORM. See HELMINTHOLOGY INDEX.\n\nEASEL PIECES, among painters, such small pieces, either portraits or landscapes, as are painted on the easel, i.e. the frame whereon the canvas is laid.

It is called easter in English, from the goddess Eostre, worshipped by the Saxons with peculiar ceremonies in the month of April.\n\nThe Asiatic churches kept their Easter upon the very same day the Jews observed their passover, and others on the first Sunday after the first full moon in the new year. This controversy was determined in the council of Nice; when it was ordained that Easter should be kept upon one and the same day, which should always be a Sunday, in all Christian churches in the world. For the method of finding Easter by calculation, see CHRONOLOGY.\n\nEASTER ISLAND, an island in the South Sea, lying in N. Lat. 27° 5', W. Long. 109° 46'. It is thought to have been first discovered in 1686 by one Davis an Englishman, who called it Davis's Land. It was next visited by Commodore Roggewein, a Dutchman, in 1722; who gave it the name of Easter Island, and published many fabulous accounts concerning the country and its inhabitants. It was also visited by a Spanish ship in 1770, the captain of which gave it the name of St. Carlos. The only authentic accounts of this island, however, which have yet appeared, are those published by Captain Cook and Mr Forster, who visited it in the month of March 1774. According to these accounts, the island is about 12 or 13 leagues in circumference, and of a triangular figure; its greatest length from north-west to south-east is about four leagues, and its greatest breadth two. The hills are so high, that they may be seen at the distance of 15 or 16 leagues. The north and east points of the island are of a considerable height; between them, on the south-east side, the shore forms an open bay, in which Captain Cook thinks the Dutch anchored in 1722. He himself anchored on the west side of the island, three miles northward.\nward from the south point. This, he says, is a good road with easterly winds; but a dangerous one when the wind blows from the contrary quarter, as the other on the south-east side must be with easterly winds; so that there is no good accommodation to be had for shipping round the whole island.\n\nThe island itself is extremely barren; and bears evident marks not only of a volcanic origin, but of having been not very long ago entirely ruined by an eruption. As they approached the south point, Mr Forster informs us, that they observed the shore to rise perpendicularly. It consisted of broken rocks, whose cavernous appearance, and black or ferruginous colour, seemed to indicate that they had been thrown up by subterraneous fire. Two detached rocks lie about a quarter of a mile off this point: one of them is singular on account of its shape, and represents a huge column or obelisk; and both these rocks were inhabited by multitudes of sea fowls. On landing and walking into the country, they found the ground covered with rocks and stones of all sizes, which appeared to have been exposed to a great fire, where they seemed to have acquired a black colour and porous texture. Two or three flinty species of grasses grew among these stones, and in some measure softened the desolate appearance of the country. The farther they advanced, the more ruinous the face of the country seemed to be. The roads were intolerably rugged, and filled with heaps of volcanic stones, among which the Europeans could not make their way but with the greatest difficulty; but the natives leaped from one stone to another with surprising agility and ease. As they went northward along the island, they found the ground still of the same nature; till at last they met with a rock of large black melted lava, which seemed to contain some iron, and on which was neither soil nor grass, nor any mark of vegetation. Notwithstanding this general barrenness, however, there are several large tracts covered with cultivated soil, which produces potatoes of a gold yellow colour as sweet as carrots, plantains, and sugar canes. The soil is a dry hard clay: and the inhabitants use the grass which grows between the stones in other parts of the island as a manure, and for preserving their vegetables when young from the heat of the sun.\n\nThe most remarkable curiosity belonging to this island is a number of colossal statues; of which, however, very few remain entire. These statues are placed only on the sea coast. On the east side of the island were seen the ruins of three platforms of stone work, on each of which stood four of these large statues; but they were all fallen down from two of them, and one from the third: they were broken or defaced by the fall. Mr Wales measured one that had fallen, which was 15 feet in length, and six broad over the shoulders: each statue had on its head a large cylindrical stone of a red colour, wrought perfectly round. Others were found that measured near 27 feet, and upwards of eight feet over the shoulders; and a still larger one was seen standing, the shade of which was sufficient to shelter all the party, consisting of near 30 persons, from the rays of the sun. The workmanship is rude, but not bad, nor are the features of the face ill formed; the ears are long, according to the distortion practised in the country, and the bodies have hardly any thing of a human figure about them. How these islanders, wholly unacquainted with any mechanical power, could raise such stupendous figures, and afterwards place the large cylindric stones upon their heads, is truly wonderful! The most probable conjecture seems to be, that the stone is fictitious; and that each figure was gradually erected, by forming a temporary platform round it, and raising it as the work advanced; but they are at any rate very strong proofs of the ingenuity and perseverance of the islanders in the age when they were built, as well as that the ancestors of the present race had been better days than their descendants enjoy. The water of this island is in general brackish, there being only one well that is perfectly fresh, which is at the east end of the island; and whenever the natives repair to it to flake their thirst, they wash themselves all over; and if there is a large company, the first leaps into the middle of the hole, drinks, and washes himself without ceremony; after which another takes his place, and so on in succession. This custom was much disdained by their new friends, who stood greatly in need of this valuable article, and did not wish to have it contaminated by such ablutions.\n\nThe people are of a middle size. In general they are rather thin; go entirely naked; and have punctures on their bodies, a custom common to all the inhabitants of the South Sea islands. Their greatest singularity is the size of their ears, the lobe of which is stretched out so that it almost rests on their shoulder; and is pierced with a very large hole, capable of admitting four or five fingers with ease. The chief ornaments for their ears are the white down of feathers, and rings which they wear in the inside of the hole, made of the sugar cane, which is very elastic, and for this purpose is rolled up like a watch spring. Some were seen clothed in the same cloth used in the island of Otaheite, tinged of a bright orange colour with turmeric; and these our voyagers supposed to be chiefs. Their colour is a chestnut brown; their hair black, curling, and remarkably strong; and that on the head as well as the face is cut short. The women are small, and slender limbed: they have punctures on the face, resembling the patches sometimes used by European ladies; they paint their face all over with a reddish brown ruddle, and above this they lay a fine orange colour extracted from turmeric root; the whole is then variegated with streaks of white shell lime. But the most surprising circumstance of all with regard to these people, is the apparent scarcity of women among them. The nicest calculation that could be made, never brought the number of inhabitants in this island to above 700, and of these the females bore no proportion in number to the males. Either they have but few females, or else their women were restrained from appearing during the stay of the ship; notwithstanding, the men showed no signs of a jealous disposition, or the women any scruples of appearing in public: in fact, they seemed to be neither revered nor chaste; and the large pointed cap which they wore gave them the appearance of professed wantons. But as all the women who were seen were liberal of their favours, it is more than probable that all the married and modest ones had concealed themselves from their impetuous visitants in some inextricable parts of the island; and what further strengthens this supposition is,\nthat heaps of stones were seen piled up into little hillocks, which had one steep perpendicular side, where a hole went under ground. The space within, says Mr Forster, could be but small; and yet it is probable that these cavities served, together with their miserable huts, to give shelter to the people at night; and they may communicate with natural caverns, which are very common in the lava currents of volcanic countries. The few women that appeared were the most lascivious of their sex perhaps that have been ever noticed in any country; shame seemed to be entirely unknown to them.\n\nEATON, a town of Buckinghamshire, situated on the north side of the Thames, opposite to Windsor, and famous for its collegiate school, founded by King Henry VI. being a seminary for King's College, Cambridge, the fellows of which are all from this school.

See PHARMACY.\n\nEau de Luce, a fragrant alkaline liquor which was some years ago in great repute, especially among the fair sex, and of which the leading perfection is, that it shall possess and retain a milky opacity.\n\nMr Nicolson, in the second number of his valuable journal, tells us, that being informed by a philosophical friend, that the usual recipes for making this compound do not succeed, and that the use of mastic in it has hitherto been kept a secret, he made the following trials to procure a good eau de luce.\n\nOne dram of the rectified oil of amber was dissolved in four ounces of the strongest ardent spirit of the shops; its specific gravity being .840 at 60 degrees of Fahrenheit. A portion of the clear spirit was poured upon a larger quantity of fine powdered mastic than it was judged could be taken up. This was occasionally agitated without heat; by which means the gum resin was for the most part gradually dissolved. One part of the oily solution was poured into a phial, and to this was added one part of the solution of mastic. No opacity or other change appeared. Four parts of strong caustic volatile alkali were then poured in, and immediately shaken. The fluid was of a dense opaque white colour, affording a slight ruddy tinge when the light was seen through a thin portion of it. In a second mixture, four parts of the alkali were added to one of the solution of mastic; it appeared of a less dense and more yellowish white than the former mixture. More of the gum resinous solution was then poured in; but it still appeared less opaque than that mixture. It was ruddy by transmitted light. The last experiment was repeated with the oily solution instead of that of mastic. The white was much less dense than either of the foregoing compounds, and the requisite opacity was not given by augmenting the dose of the oily solution. No rudeness nor other remarkable appearance was seen by transmitted light. These mixtures were left at repose for two days; no separation appeared in either of the compounds containing mastic; the compound, consisting of the oily solution and alkali, became paler by the separation of a cream at the top.\n\nIt appears, therefore, that the first of these three mixtures, subject to variation of the quantity of its ingredients, and the odorant additions which may be made, is a good eau de luce.\n\nIn a subsequent number of the same Journal, we have the following recipe by one of the author's correspondents, who had often proved its value by experience.\n\n\"Digest ten or twelve grains of the whitest pieces of mastic, selected for this purpose and powdered, in two ounces of alcohol; and, when nearly dissolved, add twenty grains of elemi. When both the resins are dissolved, add ten or fifteen drops of rectified oil of amber, and fifteen or twenty of essence of bergamot; shake the whole well together, and let the excess subside. The solution will be of a pale amber colour. It is to be added in very small portions to the best aqua ammoniae purae, until it attains a milky whiteness, shaking the phial well after each addition, as directed by Macquer. The strength and causticity of the ammoniac are of most essential consequence. If, upon the addition of the first drop or two of the tincture, a dense opaque congealed precipitate is formed, not much unlike that which appears on dropping a solution of silver into water slightly impregnated with common salt, it is too strong, and must be diluted with alcohol. A considerable proportion of the tincture, perhaps one to four, ought to be employed to give the liquor the proper degree of opacity.\"\n\nEAVES, in Architecture, the margin or edge of the roof of a house; being the lowest tiles, slates, or the like, that hang over the walls, to throw off water to a distance from the wall.\n\nEAVES-DROPPERS, are such persons as stand under the eaves, or walls, and windows of a house, by night or day, to hearken after news, and carry it to others, and thereby cause strife and contention in the neighbourhood.

See BOTANY Index.\n\nEBION, the author of the heresy of the EBIONITES, was a disciple of Cerinthus, and his successor. He improved upon the errors of his master, and added to them new opinions of his own. He began his preaching in Judea; he taught in Asia, and even at Rome. His tenets infected the isle of Cyprus. St John opposed both Cerinthus and Ebion in Asia; and it is thought, that this apostle wrote his gospel, in the year 97, particularly against this heresy.\n\nEBIONITES, ancient heretics, who rose in the church in the very first age thereof, and formed themselves into a sect in the second century, denying the divinity of Jesus Christ.\nOrigen takes them to have been so called from the Hebrew word *ebion*, which in that language signifies poor; because, says he, they were poor in sense, and wanted understanding. Eusebius, with a view to the same etymology, is of opinion they were thus called, as having poor thoughts of Jesus Christ, taking him for no more than a mere man.\n\nIt is more probable the Jews gave this appellation to the Christians in general out of contempt; because in the first times there were few but poor people that embraced the Christian religion. This opinion Origen himself seems to give into, in his book against Celsus, where he says that they called Ebionites, such among the Jews as believed that Jesus was truly the expected Messiah.\n\nIt might even be urged, with some probability, that the primitive Christians assumed the name themselves, in conformity to their profession. It is certain, Epiphanius observes, they valued themselves on being poor, in imitation of the apostles. The same Epiphanius, however, is of opinion, that there had been a man of the name of Ebion, the chief and founder of the sect of Ebionites, contemporary with the Nazarenes and Cerinthians. He gives a long and exact account of the origin of the Ebionites, making them to have risen after the destruction of Jerusalem, when the first Christians, called Nazarenes, went out of the same to live at Pella.\n\nThe Ebionites were little else than a branch of Nazarenes: only that they altered and corrupted in many things the purity of the faith held among those first adherents to Christianity. For this reason Origen distinguishes two kinds of Ebionites, in his answer to Celsus; the one believed that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin; and the other, that he was born after the manner of other men.\n\nThe first were orthodox in every thing, except that to the Christian doctrine they joined the ceremonies of the Jewish law, with the Jews, Samaritans, and Nazarenes; together with the traditions of the Pharisees. They differed from the Nazarenes, however, in several things, chiefly as to what regards the authority of the sacred writings; for the Nazarenes received all for Scripture contained in the Jewish canon; whereas the Ebionites rejected all the prophets, and held the very names of David, Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, in abhorrence. They also rejected all St Paul's epistles, whom they treated with the utmost disrespect.\n\nThey received nothing of the Old Testament but the Pentateuch; which should intimate them to have descended rather from the Samaritans than from the Jews. They agreed with the Nazarenes in using the Hebrew gospel of St Matthew, otherwise called the Gospel of the Twelve Apostles; but they had corrupted their copy in abundance of places; and particularly, had left out the genealogy of our Saviour, which was preserved entire in that of the Nazarenes, and even in those used by the Cerinthians.\n\nSome, however, have made this gospel canonical, and of greater value than our present Greek gospel of St Matthew: See Nazarenes. These last, whose sentiments, as to the birth of our Saviour, were the same with those of the Ebionites, built their error on this very genealogy.\n\nBesides the Hebrew gospel of St Matthew, the Ebionites had adopted several other books, under the names of St James, John, and the other apostles: they also made use of the Travels of St Peter, which are supposed to have been written by St Clement; but had altered them so, that there was scarce any thing of truth left in them. They even made that faint tell a number of falsehoods, the better to authorize their own practices. See St Epiphanius, who is very diffusive on the ancient heresy of the Ebionites, Hier. 30. But his account deserves little credit, as, by his own confession, he has confounded the other sects with the Ebionites, and has charged them with errors to which the first adherents of this sect were utter strangers.\n\nEBONY OF CRETE. See EBENUS, BOTANY Index.\n\nEBONY Wood is brought from the Indies, exceedingly hard and heavy, susceptible of a very fine polish, and on that account used in mosaic and inlaid works, toys, &c. There are divers kinds of ebony; the most usual among us are black, red, and green, all of them the product of the island of Madagascar, where the natives call them differently *hason mainthi*, q. d. black wood. The island of St Maurice, belonging to the Dutch, likewise furnishes part of the ebonies used in Europe.\n\nAuthors and travellers give very different accounts of the tree that yields the black ebony. By some of their descriptions, it should be a sort of palm tree; by others a cytus, &c. The most authentic of them is that of M. Falcourt, who resided many years in Madagascar as governor thereof; he affirms us, that it grows very high and big, its bark being black, and its leaves resembling those of our myrtle, of a deep dusky green colour.\n\nTavernier affirms us, that the islanders always take care to bury their trees, when cut down, to make them the blacker, and to prevent their splitting when wrought. F. Plumier mentions another black ebony tree, discovered by him at St Domingo, which he calls *portunum portulaceae foliis aculeatum ebeni materie*. Candia also bears a little shrub, known to the botanists under the name of *Ebenus Cretica*, above described.\n\nPliny and Dioscorides say the best ebony comes from Ethiopia, and the worst from India; but Theophratus prefers that of India. Black ebony is much preferred to that of other colours. The best is a jet black, free of veins and rind, very massive, astringent, and of an acrid pungent taste. Its rind, infused in water, is said to purge pituita, and cure venereal disorders; whence Matthiolus took guaiacum for a sort of ebony. It yields an agreeable perfume when laid on burning coals; when green, it readily takes fire from the abundance of its fat. If rubbed against a stone, it becomes brown. The Indians make statues of their gods, and sceptres for their princes, of this wood. It was first brought to Rome by Pompey, after he subdued Mithridates. It is now much less used among us than anciently, since the discovery of so many ways of giving other hard woods a black colour.\n\nAs to the green ebony, besides Madagascar and St Maurice, it likewise grows in the Antilles, and especially in the isle of Tobago. The tree that yields it is very bushy; its leaves are smooth, and of a fine green colour. Beneath its bark is a white blea, about two inches thick; all beneath which, to the very heart, is a deep green, approaching towards a black, though sometimes streaked with yellow veins. Its use is not confined\nEBORACUM, in Ancient Geography, a famous city of the Brigantes in Britain, the residence of Septimius Severus and Constantius Chlorus, and where they both died; a Roman colony; and the station of the Legio Sexta Victrix.

It was situated on a gentle declivity, distant 12 stadia from Mount Orontes, and was in compass 50 stadia. Here stood the royal treasury and tombs. It was an open walled town, but had a very strong citadel, encompassed with seven walls, one within and rising above another. The extent of the outmost was equal to the whole extent of Athens, according to Herodotus; the situation favouring this construction, as being a gentle ascent, and each wall was of a different colour.—Another Ecbatana of Persia, a town of the Magi (Pliny).—A third of Syria.\n\nECCENTRICITY.

The congregation de propaganda fide afflicated him, 1636, with those whom they employed in making an Arabic translation of the Scriptures. They recalled him from Paris, and he laboured in that translation at Rome in the year 1652. While he was professor of the Oriental languages at Rome, he was pitched upon by the great duke Ferdinand II. to translate from Arabic into Latin the 5th, 6th, and 7th books of Apollonius's Conics; in which he was assisted by John Alphonso Borelli, who added commentaries to them. He died at Rome in 1644.\n\nECHYMOSIS, from εχύμειν, to pour out, or from εχύμη, out of, and χυμός, juice. It is an effusion of humours from their respective vessels, under the integuments; or, as Paulus Aegneta says, \"When the flesh is bruised by the violent collision of any object, and its small veins broken, the blood is gradually discharged from them.\" This blood, when collected under the skin, is called echymosis; the skin in the mean time remaining entire; sometimes a tumour is formed by it, which is soft and livid, and generally without pain. If the quantity of blood is not considerable, it is usually reforbed; if much, it suppurates: it rarely happens that any further inconvenience follows; though, in case of a very bad habit of body, a mortification may be the result, and in such case regard must be had thereto.\n\nECCLAIRCISSEMENT. See ESCLAIRCISSEMENT.\n\nECCLESIASTES, a canonical book of the Old Testament, the design of which is to show the vanity of all sublunary things.\n\nIt was composed by Solomon; who enumerates the several\nEcclesiastical several objects on which men place their happiness, and then shows the insufficiency of all worldly enjoyments.\n\nThe Talmudists made King Hezekiah to be the author of it: Grotius ascribes it to Zorobabel, and others to Isaiah; but the generality of commentators believe this book to be the produce of Solomon's repentance, after having experienced all the follies and pleasures of life.\n\nECCLESIASTICAL, an appellation given to whatever belongs to the church: thus we say, ecclesiastical polity, jurisdiction, history, &c.\n\nBlackstone's Comments\n\nEcclesiastical Courts. In the time of the Anglo-Saxons there was no sort of distinction between the lay and the ecclesiastical jurisdiction: the county court was as much a spiritual as a temporal tribunal: the rights of the church were ascertained and affected at the same time, and by the same judges, as the rights of the laity. For this purpose the bishop of the diocese, and the alderman, or in his absence the sheriff of the county, used to sit together in the county court, and had there the cognizance of all causes as well ecclesiastical as civil; a superior deference being paid to the bishop's opinion in spiritual matters, and to that of the lay judges in temporal. This union of power was very advantageous to them both: the presence of the bishop added weight and reverence to the sheriff's proceedings; and the authority of the sheriff was equally useful to the bishop, by enforcing obedience to his decrees in such refractory offenders as would otherwise have despised the thunder of mere ecclesiastical censures.\n\nBut so moderate and rational a plan was wholly inconsistent with those views of ambition that were then forming by the court of Rome. It soon became an established maxim in the papal system of policy, that all ecclesiastical persons, and all ecclesiastical causes, should be solely and entirely subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction only: which jurisdiction was supposed to be lodged in the first place and immediately in the Pope, by divine indefeasible right and investiture from Christ himself, and derived from the Pope to all inferior tribunals. Hence the canon law lays it down as a rule, that \"facere deos a regibus honorandi sunt, non judicandi;\" and places an emphatical reliance on a fabulous tale which it tells of the emperor Constantine. That when some petitions were brought to him, imploring the aid of his authority against certain of his bishops accused of oppression and injustice; he caused, (says the holy canon) the petitions to be burnt in their presence, dismissing them with this valediction: \"Ite, et inter vos causae vestras discutite, quia dignum non est ut nos judicemus Deos.\"\n\nIt was not, however, till after the Norman conquest, that this doctrine was received in England; when William I. (whose title was warmly espoused by the monasteries which he liberally endowed, and by the foreign clergy whom he brought over in shoals from France and Italy, and planted in the best preferments of the English church) was at length prevailed upon to establish this fatal encroachment, and separate the ecclesiastical court from the civil: whether actuated by principles of bigotry, or by those of a more refined policy, in order to discountenance the laws of King Edward abounding with the spirit of Saxon liberty, is not altogether certain. But the latter, if not the cause, Ecclesiastical was undoubtedly the consequence, of this separation: for the Saxon laws were soon overborne by the Norman justiciaries, when the county court fell into disrepute by the bishop's withdrawing his presence, in obedience to the charter of the conqueror; which prohibited any spiritual cause from being tried in the secular courts, and commanded the suitors to appear before the bishop only, whose decisions were directed to conform to the canon law.\n\nKing Henry I. at his accession, among other restorations of the laws of King Edward the Confessor, revived this of the union of the civil and ecclesiastical courts. Which was, according to Sir Edward Coke, after the great heat of the conquest was past, only a restitution of the ancient law of England. This however was ill relished by the Popish clergy, who, under the guidance of that arrogant prelate Archbishop Anselm, very early disapproved of a measure that put them on a level with the profane laity, and subjected spiritual men and causes to the inspection of the secular magistrates: and therefore, in their synod at Westminster, 3 Hen. I. they ordained, that no bishop should attend the discussion of temporal causes; which soon dissolved this newly effected union. And, when upon the death of King Henry I. the usurper Stephen was brought in and supported by the clergy, we find one article of the oath which they imposed upon him was, that ecclesiastical persons and ecclesiastical causes should be subject only to the bishop's jurisdiction. And as it was about that time that the contest and emulation began between the laws of England and those of Rome, the temporal courts adhering to the former, and the spiritual adopting the latter, as their rule of proceeding; this widened the breach between them, and made a coalition afterwards impracticable; which probably would else have been effected at the general reformation of the church.\n\nEcclesiastical courts are various; as the Archdeacons', the Consistory, the court of Arches, the Peculiars, the Prerogative, and the great court of appeal in all ecclesiastical causes, viz. the Court of Delegates. See these articles.\n\nAs to the method of proceeding in the spiritual courts, it must (in the first place) be acknowledged to their honour, that though they continue to this day to decide many questions which are properly of temporal cognizance, yet justice is in general so able and impartially administered, in those tribunals (especially of the superior kind), and the boundaries of their power are now so well known and established, that no material inconvenience at present arises from this jurisdiction still continuing in the ancient channel. And, should any alteration be attempted, great confusion would probably arise, in overturning long established forms, and new-modelling a course of proceedings that has now prevailed for seven centuries.\n\nThe establishment of the civil law process in all the ecclesiastical courts was indeed a masterpiece of papal dexterity, as it made a coalition impracticable between them and the national tribunals, without manifest inconvenience and hazard. And this consideration had undoubtedly its weight in causing this measure to be adopted, though many other causes concurred.

The word is formed from the Greek ἑχώ, ἑχεῖν, ἑχοῦσιν, ἑχοῦσιν.\n\nThe ancients being wholly unacquainted with the true cause of the echo, ascribed it to several causes sufficiently whimsical. The poets, who were not the worst of their philosophers, imagined it to be a person of that name metamorphosed, and that the affected to take up her abode in particular places; for they found by experience, that she was not to be met with in all. (See below, Echo in Fabulous History.) But the moderns, who know sound to consist in a certain tremor or vibration in the sonorous body communicated to the contiguous air, and by that means to the ear, give a more consistent account of echo.\n\nFor a tremulous body, striking on another solid body, it is evident, may be repelled without destroying or diminishing its tremor; and consequently a sound may be redoubled by the reflection of the tremulous body, or air.\n\nBut a simple reflection of the sonorous air is not enough to solve the echo: for then every plain surface of a solid hard body, as being fit to reflect a voice or sound, would redouble it; which we find does not hold.\n\nTo produce an echo, therefore, it should seem that a kind of concameration or vaulting were necessary, in order to collect, and by collecting to heighten and increase, and afterwards reflect, the sound; as we find is the case in reflecting the rays of light, where a concave mirror is required.\n\nIn effect, as often as a sound strikes perpendicularly on a wall, behind which is any thing of a vault or arch, or even another parallel wall, so often will it be reverberated in the same line, or other adjacent ones.\n\nFor an echo to be heard, therefore, it is necessary the ear be in the line of reflection: for the person who made the sound to hear its echo, it is necessary he be perpendicular to the place which reflects it; and for a manifold or tautological echo, it is necessary there be a number of walls, and vaults or cavities, either placed behind or fronting each other.\n\nA single arch or concavity, &c. can scarce ever stop and reflect all the sound; but if there be a convenient disposition behind it, part of the sound propagated thither, being collected and reflected as before, will present another echo: or, if there be another concavity, opposed at a due distance to the former, the sound reflected from the one upon the other will be tossed back again by this latter, &c.\n\nMany of the phenomena of echoes are well considered by the bishop of Leighs, &c. who remarks, that any sound, falling either directly or obliquely on any dense body of a smooth, whether plain or arched, superficies, is reflected, or echoes, more or less. The surface, says he, must be smooth; otherwise the air, by reverberation, will be put out of its regular motion, and the sound thereby broken and extinguished. He adds, that it echoes more or less, to show, that when all things are as before described, there is still an echoing, though it be not always heard, either because the direct sound is too weak to beat quite back again to him that made it; or that it does return to him, but so weak, that it cannot be discerned; or that he stands in a wrong place to receive the reflected sound, which passes over his head, under his feet, or on one side of him; and which therefore may be heard by a man standing in the place where the reflected sound does come, provided no interposed body intercepts it, but not by him that first made it.\n\nEchoes may be produced with different circumstances. For, 1. A plane obstacle reflects the sound back in its due tone and loudness; allowance being made for the proportionable decrease of the sound, according to its distance.\n\n2. A convex obstacle reflects the sound somewhat smaller and somewhat quicker, though weaker, than otherwise it would be.\n\n3. A concave obstacle echoes back the sound, bigger, flower, and also inverted; but never according to the order of words.\n\nNor does it seem possible to contrive any single echo, that shall invert the sound, and repeat backwards; because, in such case, the word last spoken, that is, which last occurs to the obstacle, must be repelled first; which cannot be. For where in the mean time should the first words hang and be concealed? or how, after such a pause, be revived, and animated again into motion?\n\nFrom the determinate concavity or archness of the reflecting bodies, it may happen that some of them shall only echo back one determinate note, and only from one place.\n\n4. The echoing body being removed farther off, it reflects more of the sound than when nearer; which is the reason why some echoes repeat but one syllable, some one word, and some many.\n\n5. Echoing bodies may be so contrived and placed, as that reflecting the sound from one to the other, either directly and mutually, or obliquely and by succession, out of one sound, a multiple echo or many echoes shall arise.\n\nAdd, that a multiple echo may be made, by so placing the echoing bodies at unequal distances, that they may reflect all one way, and not one on the other; by which means, a manifold successive sound will be heard; one clap of the hands, like many; one ha, like a laughter; one single word, like many of the same tone and accent; and so one viol, like many of the same kind, imitating each other.\n\nLastly, Echoing bodies may be so ordered, that from any one sound given, they shall produce many echoes different both as to tone and intention. By which means a musical room may be so contrived, that not only one instrument playing therein shall seem many of the same fort and size, but even a concert of different ones, only by placing certain echoing bodies so, that any note played shall be returned by them in 3ds, 6ths, and 8ths.\n\nEcho, is also used for the place where the repetition of the sound is produced or heard.\n\nEchoes are distinguished into divers kinds, viz.\n\n1. Single,\n1. Single, which return the voice but once. Whereof some are tonical, which only return a voice when modulated into some particular musical tone: Others, polyphallic, which return many syllables, words, and sentences. Of this last kind is that fine echo in Woodstock park, which Dr Plot affirms us, in the day time, will return very distinctly seventeen syllables, and in the night twenty.\n\n2. Multiple, or tautological; which return syllables and words the same oftentimes repeated.\n\nIn echoes, the place where the speaker stands is called the centrum phonicum, and the object or place that returns the voice, the centrum phonoacanticum.\n\nAt the sepulchre of Metella, wife of Craflus, was an echo, which repeated what a man said five times. Authors mention a tower at Cyzicus, where the echo repeated seven times. One of the finest echoes we read of is that mentioned by Barthius, in his notes on Statius's Thebaïs, lib. vi. 90, which repeated the words a man uttered 17 times: it was on the banks of the Naha, between Coblenz and Bingen. Barthius affirms us, he had proved what he writes; and had told 17 repetitions. And whereas, in common echoes, the repetition is not heard till some time after hearing the word spoke, or the notes sung; in this, the person who speaks or sings is scarce heard at all; but the repetition most clearly, and always in surprising varieties; the echo seeming sometimes to approach nearer, and sometimes to be further off. Sometimes the voice is heard very distinctly, and sometimes scarce at all. One hears only one voice, and another several; one hears the echo on the right, and the other on the left, &c. At Milan in Italy, is an echo which reiterates the report of a pistol 56 times; and if the report is very loud, upwards of 60 reiterations may be counted. The first 20 echoes are pretty distinct; but as the noise seems to fly away, and answer at a greater distance, the reiterations are so doubled, that they can scarce be counted.

She was once one of Juno's attendants, and became the confidant of Jupiter's amours. Her loquacity, however, displeased Jupiter, and she was deprived of the power of speech by Juno, and only permitted to answer to the questions which were put to her.

Echo, after she had been punished by Juno, fell in love with Narcissus; but EchoMeter being despised by him, pined herself to death, having nothing but her voice left.\n\nECHOMETER, among musicians, a kind of scale or rule, with several lines thereon, serving to measure the duration and length of sounds, and to find their intervals and ratios.\n\nECHOUERIES.

He was a man of uncommon learning, parts, and zeal, and died in 1543.\n\nECLECTICS (eclectic), a name given to some ancient philosophers, who, without attaching themselves to any particular sect, took what they judged good and solid from each. Hence their denomination; which, in the original Greek, signifies, \"that may be chosen,\" or \"that chooses;\" of the verb ελέγχω, I choose.—Laertius notes, that they were also, for the same reason denominated analogetici; but that they call themselves Philalethi, i.e., lovers of truth.\n\nThe chief or founder of the eclectic was one Potamon of Alexandria, who lived under Augustus and Tiberius; and who, weary of doubting of all things with the Sceptics and Pyrrhonians, formed the eclectic sect; which Vossius calls the eclectic.\n\nTowards the close of the second century, a sect arose in the Christian church under the denomination of Eclectic, or modern Platonics. They professed to make truth the only object of their inquiry, and to be ready to adopt from all the different systems and sects such tenets as they thought agreeable to it.—However, they preferred Plato to the other philosophers, and looked upon his opinions concerning God, the human soul, and things invisible, as conformable to the spirit and genius of the Christian doctrine. One of the principal patrons of this system was Ammonius Saccas, who at this time laid the foundation of that sect, afterwards distinguished by the name of the new Platonics, in the Alexandrian school. See Ammonius and Platonists.\n\nEclectics were also a certain set of physicians among the ancients, of whom Archigenes, under Trajan, was the chief, who selected from the opinions of all the other sects that which appeared to them best and most rational; hence they are called eclectics, and their prescriptions medicina eclectic.\n\nECLIPSE, in Astronomy, the deprivation of the light of the sun, or of some heavenly body, by the interposition of another heavenly body between our sight and it.

See Astronomy Index.\n\nSome call it via Solis, \"the way of the sun,\" because the sun in his apparent annual motion never deviates from it, as all the other planets do more or less.\n\nECLIPSE, in Geography, a great circle on the terrestrial globe, not only answering to, but falling within, the plane of the celestial ecliptic. See Geography.\n\nECLOGUE, in Poetry, a kind of pastoral composition, wherein shepherds are introduced conversing together. The word is formed from the Greek εκλογή choice; so that, according to the etymology, eclogue should be no more than a select or choice piece; but custom has determined it to a farther signification, viz. a little elegant composition in a simple natural style and manner.\n\nIdyllion and eclogue, in their primary intention, are the same thing: thus, the idyllia, ἀδυνάτων, of Theocritus, are pieces wrote perfectly in the same vein with the eclogae of Virgil. But custom has made a difference between them, and appropriated the name eclogue to pieces wherein shepherds are introduced speaking: idyllion, to those wrote like the eclogue, in a simple natural style, but without any shepherds in them.\n\nECLUSE, a small but strong town of the Dutch Low Countries, in the county of Flanders, with a good harbour and sluices.

It has several good harbours, and contains about 600 inhabitants.\n\nEDDA, in antiquities, is a system of the ancient Icelandic or Runic mythology, containing many curious particulars of the theology, philosophy, and manners, of the northern nations of Europe; or of the Scandinavians, who had migrated from Asia, and from whom our Saxon ancestors were descended. Mr Mallet apprehends that it was originally compiled, soon after the Pagan religion was abolished, as a course of poetical lectures, for the use of such young Icelanders as devoted themselves to the profession of a scald or poet. It consists of two principal parts; the first containing a brief system of mythology, properly called the Edda; and the second being a kind of art of poetry, and called scalda or poetics. The most ancient Edda was compiled by Soemund Sigfusson, named the Learned, who was born in Iceland about the year 1057. This was abridged, and rendered more easy and intelligible about 120 years afterwards, by Snorro Sturlefon, who was supreme judge of Iceland in the years 1215 and 1222; and it was published in the form of a dialogue. He added also the second part in the form of a dialogue, being a detail of different events transacted among the divinities. The only three pieces that are known to remain of the more ancient Edda of Soemund, are the Volupsa, the Havamal, and the Runic chapter. The Volupsa, or prophecy of Vola or Fola, appears to be the text, on which the Edda is the comment. It contains, in two or three hundred lines, the whole system of mythology disclosed in the Edda, and may be compared to the Sibylline verses, on account of its laconic yet bold style, and its imagery and obscurity. It is professedly a revelation of the decrees of the Father of nature, and the actions and operations of the gods. It describes the chaos, the formation of the world, with its various inhabitants, the function of the gods, their most signal adventures, their quarrels with Loke their great adversary, and the vengeance that ensued; and concludes with a long description of the final state of the universe, its dissolution and conflagration, the battle of the inferior deities and the evil beings, the renovation of the world, the happy lot of the good, and the punishment of the wicked. The Havamal, or Sublime Discourse, is attributed to the god Odin, who is supposed to have given these precepts of wisdom to mankind; it is comprised in about 120 stanzas, and resembles the book of Proverbs. Mr Mallet has given several extracts of this treatise on the Scandinavian ethics. The Runic chapter contains a short system of ancient magic, and especially of the enchantments wrought by the operation of Runic characters, of which Mr Mallet has also given a specimen. A manuscript copy of the Edda of Snorro is preserved in the library of the university of Upsal; the first part of which hath been published with a Swedish and Latin version by M. Goranson. The Latin version is printed as a supplement to M. Mallet's Northern Antiquities. The first edition of the Edda was published by Reichenius, professor at Copenhagen, in a large quarto volume, in the year\nEdda year 1665; containing the text of the Edda, a Latin translation by an Icelandic priest, a Danish version, and various readings from different MSS. M. Mallet has also given an English translation of the first part, accompanied with remarks; from which we learn, that the Edda teaches the doctrine of the Supreme, called the Universal Father, and Odin, who lives for ever, governs all his kingdom, and directs the great things as well as the small; who formed the heaven, earth, and air; made man, and gave him a spirit or soul, which shall live after the body shall have mouldered away; and then all the just shall dwell with him in a place Gimle or Vingolf, the palace of friendship; but wicked men shall go to Hel, or death, and from thence to Niflheim, or the abode of the wicked, which is below in the ninth world. It inculcates also the belief of several inferior gods and goddesses, the chief of whom is Frigg or Freia, i.e. lady, meaning hereby the earth, who was the spouse of Odin or the Supreme God; whence we may infer that, according to the opinion of these ancient philosophers, this Odin was the active principle or soul of the world, which uniting itself with matter, had thereby put it into a condition to produce the intelligences or inferior gods, and men and all other creatures. The Edda likewise teaches the existence of an evil being called Loki, the calumniator of the gods, the artificer of fraud, who surpasses all other beings in cunning and perfidy. It teaches the creation of all things out of an abyss or chaos; the final destruction of the world by fire; the absorption of the inferior divinities, both good and bad, into the bosom of the grand divinity, from whom all things proceeded, as emanations of his essence, and who will survive all things; and the renovation of the earth in an improved state.\n\nEDDISH, or EADISH, the latter pasture or grass that comes after mowing or reaping; otherwise called engrafe or earfh, and etch.\n\nEDDOES, or EDERS, in Botany, the American name of the Arum eculentum.\n\nEDDY (Saxon), of ed \"backward,\" and ea \"water,\" among seamen, is where the water runs back contrary to the tide; or that which hinders the free passage of the stream, and so causes it to return again. That eddy water which falls back, as it were, on the rudder of a ship under sail, the seamen call the dead water.\n\nEddy Wind is that which returns or is beat back from a fall, mountain, or any thing that may hinder its passage.\n\nEDLINCK, GERARD, a famous engraver, born at Antwerp, where he was instructed in drawing and engraving. He settled at Paris, in the reign of Louis XIV, who made him his engraver in ordinary. Edelinck was also counsellor in the Royal Academy of Painting. His works are particularly esteemed for the neatness of the engraving, their brilliant cast, and the prodigious ease apparent in the execution; and to this facility is owing the great number of plates we have of his; among which are excellent portraits of a great number of illustrious men of his time. Among the most admired of his prints, the following may be specified as holding the chief place.\n\n1. A battle between four horsemen, with three figures lying slain upon the ground, from Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n2. A holy family, with Elizabeth, St John, and two angels, from the famous picture of Raphael in the king of France's collection. The first impressions are before the arms of M. Colbert were added at the bottom of the plate; the second are with the arms; and in the third the arms are taken out, but the place where they had been inserted is very perceptible.\n\n3. Mary Magdalen bewailing her sins, and trampling upon the riches of the world, from Le Brun. The first impressions are without the narrow border which surrounds the print.\n\n4. Alexander entering into the tent of Darius, a large print on two plates, from Le Brun. This engraving belongs to the three battles, and triumphal entry of Alexander into Babylon, by Girard Audran, and completes the set. The first impressions have the name of Gayon the printer at the bottom.\n\n5. Alexander entering into the tent of Darius (finished by P. Drevet), from Peter Mignard. Edelinck died in 1707, in an advanced age, at the Hotel Royal at the Gobelins, where he had an apartment. He had a brother named John, who was a skilful engraver, but died young.\n\nEDEN, (Moses) the name of a country, with a garden, in which the progenitors of mankind were settled by God himself: The term denotes pleasure or delight. It would be endless to recount the several opinions concerning its situation, some of them very wild and extravagant. Moses says, that \"a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was parted and became into four heads.\" This river is supposed to be the common channel of the Euphrates and Tigris, after their confluence; which parted again, below the garden, into two different channels; so that the two channels before, and the other two after their confluence, constitute the heads mentioned by Moses. Which will determine the situation of the garden to have been in the south of Mesopotamia, or in Babylonia. The garden was also called Paradise; a term of Persian origin, denoting a garden. See Paradise.\n\nEDGINGS, in Gardening, the series of small but durable plants set round the edges or borders of flower beds, &c. The best and most durable of all plants for this use is box; which, if well planted and rightly managed, will continue in strength and beauty for many years. The seasons for planting this are the autumn, and very early in the spring: and the best species for this purpose is the dwarf Dutch box.\n\nFormerly, it was also a very common practice to plant borders, or edgings, of aromatic herbs; as thyme, savory, hyssop, lavender, and the like; but these are all apt to grow woody, and to be in part, or wholly, destroyed in hard winters. Daisies, thrift, or sea julyflower, and chamomile, are also used by some for this purpose; but they require yearly transplanting, and a great deal of trouble, else they grow out of form; and they are also subject to perish in very hard seasons.\n\nEDHILLING, EDHILINGUS, an ancient appellation of the nobility among the Anglo-Saxons.\n\nThe Saxon nation, says Nithard (Hist. lib. iv.) is divided into three orders or classes of people; the edhilingi, the frillingi, and the laezzi; which signify the nobility, the freemen, and the vassals or slaves.\n\nInstead of edhilling, we sometimes meet with atheling, or athelingi; which appellation was likewise given to\nthe king's son, and the presumptive heir of the crown.\n\nSee Athelling.\n\nEDICT, in matters of polity, an order or instrument, signed and sealed by a prince, to serve as a law to his subjects. We find frequent mention of the edicts of the praetor, the ordinances of that officer in the Roman law. In the French law, the edicts are of several kinds: some importing a new law or regulation; others, the erection of new offices; establishments of duties, rents, &c.; and sometimes articles of pacification. In France, edicts are much the same as a proclamation is with us: but with this difference, that the former have the authority of a law in themselves, from the power which issues them forth; whereas the latter are only declarations of a law, to which they refer, and have no power in themselves.\n\nEDILE, or ÆDILE. See ÆDILE.\n\nEDINBURGH, a city of Mid-Lothian in Scotland, situated in W. Long. 3°, and N. Lat. 56°, near the southern bank of the river Forth.—The origin of the name, like that of most other cities, is very uncertain. Some imagine it to be derived from Eth, a supposed king of the Picts; others from Edwin, a Saxon prince of Northumberland, who overran the whole or greatest part of the territories of the Picts about the year 617; while others choose to derive it from two Gaelic words Dun Edin, signifying the face of a hill. The name Edinburgh itself, however, seems to have been unknown in the time of the Romans. The most ancient title by which we find this city distinguished is that of Caefell Mynyd Agned; which, in the British language, signifies \"the fortres of the hill of St Agnes.\" Afterwards it was named Cafrum Paellarum, because the Pictish princesses were educated in the castle (a necessary protection in those barbarous ages) till they were married.—The ages in which these names were given cannot indeed now be exactly ascertained: but the town certainly cannot boast of very great antiquity; since, as Mr Whittaker informs us, the celebrated King Arthur fought a battle on the spot where it is situated towards the end of the fifth century.\n\nThe Romans, during the time they held the dominion of part of this island, divided their possessions into six provinces. The most northerly of these was called Valentia, which comprehended all the space between the walls of Adrian and Severus. Thus, Edinburgh, lying on the very outskirts of that province which was most exposed to the ravages of the barbarians, became perpetually subject to wars and devastations; by means of which, the time of its first foundation cannot now be guessed at.\n\nThe castle is certainly very ancient. It continued in the hands of the Saxons or English from the invasion of Oeta and Ebusa in the year 452 till the defeat of Egfrid king of Northumberland in 685 by the Picts, who then repopulated themselves of it. The Saxon kings of Northumberland reconquered it in the ninth century; and it was retained by their successors till the year 956, when it was given up to Indulphus king of Scotland. In 1093 it was unsuccessfully besieged by the usurper Donald Bane. Whether the city was at that time founded or not is uncertain. Most probably it was: for as protection from violence was necessary in those barbarous ages, the castle of Edinburgh could not fail of being an inducement to many people to settle in its neighbourhood; and thus the city would gradually be founded and increase.—In 1128, King David I. founded the abbey of Holyroodhouse, for certain canons regular; and granted them a charter, in which he styled the town Burgo meo de Edwinesburgh, \"my borough of Edinburgh.\" By the same charter he granted these canons 40 shillings yearly out of the town revenues; and likewise 48 shillings more, from the same, in case of the failure of certain duties payable from the king's revenue; and likewise one half of the tallow, lard, and hides, of all the beasts killed in Edinburgh.\n\nIn 1174, the castle of Edinburgh was surrendered to Castle fur Henry II. of England, in order to purchase the liberty rendered to King William I. who had been defeated and taken the English prisoner by the English. But when William recovered his liberty, he entered into an alliance with Henry, and married his cousin Ermengarde; upon which the castle was restored as part of the queen's dower.\n\nIn 1215, this city was first distinguished by having a parliament and provincial synod held in it.—In 1206, the castle was besieged and taken by Edward I. of England; but was recovered in 1313 by Randolph earl of Moray, who was afterwards regent of Scotland during the minority of King David II. At last King Robert destroyed this fortress, as well as all others in Scotland, lest they should afford shelter to the English in any of their after incursions into Scotland.—It lay in ruins for a considerable number of years; but was afterwards rebuilt by Edward III. of England, who placed a strong garrison in it.\n\nIn 1341 it was reduced by the following stratagem. A man pretending to be an English merchant, came to the governor, and told him that he had on board his ship in the Firth some wine, beer, biscuits, &c., which he would sell him on very reasonable terms. A bargain being made, he promised to deliver the goods next morning at a very reasonable rate: but at the time appointed, twelve men, disguised in the habit of sailors, entered the castle with the goods and supposed merchant: and having instantly killed the porter and sentinels, Sir William Douglas, on a preconcerted signal, rushed in with a band of armed men, and quickly made himself master of the place, after having cut most of the garrison in pieces.\n\nThe year 1437 is remarkable for the execution of Cruel the earl of Athol and his accomplices, who had a connection in the murder of James I. The crime, it must be owned, was execrable; but the punishment was altogether shocking to humanity. For three days successively the afflains were tortured by putting on their heads iron crowns heated red hot, dilocating their joints, pinching their flesh with red hot pinchers, and carrying them in that dreadful situation through the streets upon hurdles. At last an end was put to their sufferings, by cutting them up alive, and sending the parts of their mangled bodies to the principal towns of the kingdom.\n\nAbout the end of the 14th century it was customary to consider Edinburgh as the capital of the kingdom. The town of Leith, with its harbour and mills, had been bestowed upon it by Robert I. in 1329; and his grandson John earl of Carrick, who afterwards ascended the throne by the name of Robert III., conferred upon all the burgesses the singular privilege of building.\nEdinburgh-building houses in the castle, upon the sole condition that they should be persons of good fame; which we must undoubtedly consider as a proof that the number of these burgesses was at that time very small. In 1461, a very considerable privilege was conferred on the city by Henry VI. of England when in a state of exile; viz. that its inhabitants should have liberty to trade to all the English ports on the same terms with the city of London. This extraordinary privilege was bestowed in consequence of the kindness with which that king was treated in a visit to the Scottish monarch at Edinburgh; but as Henry was never restored, his gratitude was not attended with any benefit to this city. From this time, however, its privileges continued to be increased from various causes. In 1482 the citizens had an opportunity of liberating King James from the oppression of his nobles, by whom he had been imprisoned in the castle. On this account the provost was by that monarch made hereditary high sheriff within the city, an office which he continues still to enjoy. The council at the same time were invested with the power of making laws and statutes for the government of the city; and the trades, as a testimony of the royal gratitude for their loyalty, received the banner known by the name of the Blue Blanket; an ensign formerly capable of producing great commotions, but which has not now been displayed for many years past. However, it still exists; and the convener of the trades has the charge of keeping it.\n\nIt was not long after the discovery of America that the venereal disease, imported from that country, made its way to Edinburgh. As early as 1497, only five years after the voyage of Columbus we find it looked upon as a most dreadful plague; and the unhappy persons affected with it were separated as effectually as possible from society. The place of their exile was Inchkeith, a small island near the middle of the Forth; which, small as it is, has a spring of fresh water, and now affords pasture to some sheep.\n\nBy the overthrow of James IV. at the battle of Flodden, the city of Edinburgh was overwhelmed with grief and confusion, that monarch having been attended in his unfortunate expedition by the earl of Angus, then provost, with the rest of the magistrates, and a number of the principal inhabitants, most of whom perished in the battle. After this disaster, the inhabitants being alarmed for the safety of their city, it was enacted that every fourth man should keep watch at night; the fortifications of the town were renewed, the wall being also extended in such a manner as to enclose the Grassmarket, and the field on which Heriot's Hospital, the Grey Friars Church, and Charity Workhouse, stand. On the east side it was made to enclose the College, Infirmary, and High School; after which, turning to the north, it met the old wall at the Netherbow port. After this alarm was over, the inhabitants were gradually relieved from the trouble of watching at night, and a certain number of militia appointed to prevent disturbances; who continue to this day, and are known by the name of the Town Guard. Before these new enclosures, most of the principal people lived in the Cowgate without the wall; and the burying place was situated where the Parliament Close now is. In our days of peace, when Edinburgh no alarm of an enemy is at all probable, great part of the walls, with all the gates, have been taken down, and the city laid quite open, in order to afford more ready passage to the great concourse of people with whom the street is daily filled. But at the period we speak of, not only were the inhabitants much less numerous by reason of the small extent of the city, but it was depopulated by a dreadful plague; so that, to stop if possible the progress of the infection, all houses and shops were shut up for 14 days, and some where infected persons had died were pulled down altogether.\n\nIn 1504, the tract of ground called the Burrough of Muir was totally overgrown with wood, though now wooden it affords not the smallest vestige of having been in houses. Such a state. So great was the quantity at that time, however, that it was enacted by the town council, that whoever inclined to purchase as much wood as was sufficient to make a new front for their house, might extend it seven feet into the street. Thus the city was in a short time filled with houses of wood instead of stone; by which, besides the inconvenience of having the street narrowed 14 feet, and the beauty of the whole entirely marred, it became much more liable to accidents by fire; but almost all these are now pulled down; and in doing this a singular taste in the masonry which supported them is said to have been discovered.\n\nIn 1542, a war with England having commenced Edinburgh through the treachery of Cardinal Beaton, an English fleet of 200 sail entered the Forth; and having landed by the forces, quickly made themselves masters of the towns of Leith and Edinburgh. They next attacked the castle, but were repulsed from it with loss; and by this they were so enraged, that they not only destroyed the towns of Edinburgh and Leith, but laid waste the country for a great way round.—These towns, however, speedily recovered from their ruinous state; and, in 1547, Leith was again burned by the English after the battle of Pinkney, but Edinburgh was spared.\n\nSeveral disturbances happened in this capital at the time of the Reformation, of which an account is given under the article Scotland; but none of these greatly affected the city till the year 1570, at which time there was a civil war on account of Queen Mary's forced resignation. The regent, who was one of the contending parties, bought the castle from the perfidious governor (Balfour) for £5000, and the priory of Pittenweem. He did not, however, long enjoy the fruits of this infamous bargain. Sir William Kirkaldy, the new governor, a man of great integrity and bravery, declared for the queen. The city in the mean time was sometimes in the hands of one party and sometimes of another; during which contentions, the inhabitants, as may easily be imagined, suffered extremely. In the Siege of the year 1570 above mentioned, Queen Elizabeth sent a castle in body of 1000 foot and 300 horse, under the command of Sir William Drury, to assist the king's party. The castle was summoned to surrender; and several skirmishes happened during the space of two years, in which a kind of predatory war was carried on. At last a truce was agreed on till the month of January 1573; and this opportunity the earl of Morton, now regent,\nEdinburgh regent, made use of to build two bulwarks across the high street, nearly opposite to the tolbooth, to defend the city from the fire of the castle.\n\nOn the first of January, early in the morning, the governor began to cannonade the city. Some of the cannon were pointed against the fish-market, then held on the high street; and the bullets falling among the fishes, scattered them about in a surprising manner, and even drove them up so high in the air, that they fell down upon the tops of the houses. This unusual spectacle having brought a number of people out of their houses, some of them were killed and others dangerously wounded. Some little time afterwards, several houses were set on fire by shot from the castle, and burned to the ground; which greatly enraged the people against the governor. A treaty was at last concluded between the leaders of the opposite factions; but Kirkaldy refused to be comprehended in it. The regent therefore solicited the affiance of Queen Elizabeth, and Sir William Drury was again sent into Scotland with 1500 foot and a train of artillery. The castle was now besieged in form, and batteries raised against it in different places. The governor defended himself with great bravery for 33 days; but finding most of the fortifications demolished, the well choked up with rubbish, and all supplies of water cut off, he was obliged to surrender. The English general, in the name of his mistress, promised him honourable treatment; but the queen of England shamefully gave him up to the regent, by whom he was hanged.\n\nSoon after this, the spirit of fanaticism, which succeeded the Reformation, produced violent commotions, not only in Edinburgh, but through the whole kingdom. The foundation of these disturbances, and indeed of most others which have ever happened in Christendom on account of religion, was that pernicious maxim of Popery, that the church is independent of the state. It is not to be supposed that this maxim was at all agreeable to the sovereign; but such was the attachment of the people to the doctrines of the clergy, that King James found himself obliged to compound matters with them. This, however, answered the purpose but very indifferently; and at last a violent uproar was excited. The king was then sitting in the court of session, which was held in the tolbooth, when a petition was presented to him by six persons, lamenting the dangers which threatened religion; and being treated with very little respect by one Bruce a minister, his majesty asked who they were that dared to convene against his proclamation? He was answered by Lord Lindsay, that they dared to do more, and would not suffer religion to be overthrown. On this the king perceiving a number of people crowding into the room, withdrew into another without making any reply, ordering the door to be shut. By this the petitioners were so much enraged, that on their return to the church the most furious resolutions were taken; and had it not been for the activity of Sir Alexander Home the provost, and Mr Watt the deacon convener who assembled the crafts in his majesty's behalf, it is more than probable that the door would have been forced, and an end put to his life. This affront was so much resented by the king, that he thought proper to declare Edinburgh an unfit place of residence for the court or the administration of justice. In consequence of this declaration, he commanded the college of justice, Edinburgh, the inferior judges, and the nobility and barons, to retire from Edinburgh, and not to return without express license. This unexpected declaration threw the whole town into consternation, and brought back the magistrates and principal inhabitants to a sense of their duty. With the clergy it was far otherwise. They railed against the king in the most furious manner; and endeavouring to persuade the people to take up arms, the magistrates were ordered to imprison them; but they escaped by a timely flight. A deputation of the most respectable burgesses was then sent to the king at Linlithgow, with a view to mitigate his resentment. But he refused to be pacified; and on the last day of December 1596 entered the town between two rows of his soldiers who lined the streets, while the citizens were commanded to keep within their houses. A convention of the estates was held in the tolbooth, before whom the magistrates made the most abject submissions, but in vain. The convention declared one of the late tumults, in which an attack had been made upon the king's person, to be high treason; and ordained, that if the magistrates did not find out the authors, the city itself should be subjected to all the penalties due to that crime. It was even proposed to raze the town to the foundation, and erect a pillar on the spot where it had stood, as a monument of its crimes. The inhabitants were now reduced to the utmost despair; but Queen Elizabeth interposing in behalf of the city, the king thought proper to abate somewhat of his rigour. A criminal prosecution, however, was commenced, and the town council were commanded to appear at Perth by the first of February. On their petition, the time for their appearance was prolonged to the first of March; and the attendance of 13 of the common council was declared sufficient, provided they had a proper commission from the rest. The trial commenced on the 5th day of the month; and one of the number having failed in his attendance, the cause was immediately decided against the council; they were declared rebels, and their revenues forfeited.\n\nFor 15 days the city continued in the utmost confusion; but, at last, on their earnest supplication, and offering to submit entirely to the king's mercy, the community were restored on the following conditions, which they had formerly proffered: That they should continue to make a most diligent search for the authors of the tumult in order to bring them to condign punishment; that none of the sedulous ministers should be allowed to return to their charges, and no others admitted without his majesty's consent; and that in the election of their magistrates they should present a list of the candidates to the king and his lords of council and session, whom his majesty and their lordships might approve or reject at pleasure. To these conditions the king now added some others; viz. that the houses which had been possessed by the ministers should be delivered up to the king; and that the clergymen should afterwards live dispersed through the town, every one in his own parish: That the town council house should be appointed for accommodating the court of exchequer; and that the town should become bound for the safety of the lords of session from any attempts of the burgesses, under a penalty of 40,000 merks; and, lastly,\nthat the town should immediately pay 20,000 merks to his majesty.\n\nUpon these terms a reconciliation took place; which appears to have been very complete, as the king not only allowed the degraded ministers to be replaced, but in 1610 conferred a mark of his favour on the town, by allowing the provost to have a sword of state carried before him, and the magistrates to wear gowns on public occasions. In 1618 he paid his last visit to this city, when he was received with the most extravagant pomp and magnificence. See SCOTLAND.\n\nThe events which, during this period, regard the internal police of the city, were principally the following. After the unfortunate battle at Pinkney, the magistrates, probably apprehending that now their power was enlarged by reason of the present calamity, proceeded in some respects in a very arbitrary manner; forcing the inhabitants to furnish materials for the public works; enjoining merchants to bring home silver to be coined at the mint; and ordering lanterns to be hung out at proper places to burn till nine at night, &c. Another invasion from England being apprehended in 1558, the city raised 1450 men for its defence, among whom there are said to have been 200 tailors, so that their profession seems to have been in a very flourishing state at that time. During the disturbances which happened at the Reformation, and of which a particular account is given under the article SCOTLAND, it was enacted, that the figure of St Giles should be cut out of the town standard, and that of a thistle inserted in its place. It was likewise enacted, that none but those who professed the reformed religion should serve in any office whatever; and the better to preserve the extraordinary appearance of sanctity which was affected, a pillar was erected in the North Loch, for the purpose of ducking fornicators.\n\nIn 1595, the boys of the High School rose against their masters; and such was the barbarism of those days, that one of these striplings shot a magistrate with a pistol, who had come along with the rest to reduce them to obedience. The reason of the uproar was, that they were in that year refused two vacations, which had been customary in former times; however, they were at last obliged to submit, and ever since have been allowed one for about six weeks in the autumn. The same year the house of one of the bailies was assaulted by the tradesmen's sons, afflicting by journeymen who had not received the freedom of the town; he escaped with his life, but the offenders were banished the city for ever.\n\nIn the beginning of the reign of Charles I., a perfect harmony seems to have subsisted between the court and the city of Edinburgh; for in 1627 King Charles I. presented the city with a new sword and gown to be worn by the provost at the times appointed by his father James VI. Next year he paid a visit to this capital, and was received by the magistrates in a most pompous manner; but soon after this the disturbances arose which were not terminated but by the death of that unfortunate monarch. These commenced on an attempt of Charles to introduce Episcopacy into the kingdom; and the first step towards this was the erection of the three Lothians and part of Berwick into a diocese, Edinburgh being the episcopal seat, and the church of St Giles the cathedral. An account of the disturbance occasioned by the first attempt to read the Edinburgh prayer book there, is given under the article BRITAIN; but though the attempt was given over, the minds of the people were not to be quieted. Next winter they resorted to town in such multitudes, that the privy-council thought proper to publish two acts; by one of which the people were commanded, under severe penalties, to leave the town in 24 hours; and by the other, the court of session was removed to Linlithgow. The populace and their leaders were so much enraged by the latter, that Lord Traquair and some of the bishops narrowly escaped with their lives; and next year (1638) matters became still more serious. For now, the king having provoked his subjects throughout all Scotland with the innovations he attempted in religion, Edinburgh was made the general place of rendezvous, and the most formidable associations took place; an account of which has already been given under the article BRITAIN. Each of the towns in Scotland had a copy; and that which belonged to Edinburgh, crowded with 5000 names, is still preserved among the records of the city. Notwithstanding this disagreement, however, the king once more visited Edinburgh in 1641, and was entertained by the magistrates at an expense of 12,000l. Scots. It does not appear that after this the city was in any way particularly concerned with the disturbances which followed either throughout the remainder of the reign of Charles I., the commonwealth, or the reign of Charles II. In 1680 the duke of York with his duchess, the princess Anne, and the whole court of Scotland, were entertained by the city in the Parliament House, at the expense of 15,000l. Scots. At this time it is said that the scheme of building the bridge over the North Loch was first projected by the duke.\n\nFrom the time that King James VI. paid his last visit to Edinburgh in 1618, till the time of the union made in 1707, a considerable number of private regulations were made by the magistrates; some of them evidently calculated for the good of the city, others strongly characteristic of that violent spirit of fanaticism which prevailed to much in the last century. Among the former was an act passed in 1621, that the houses, instead of being covered with straw or boards, should have their roofs constructed of slate, tiles, or lead. This act was renewed in 1667; and in 1668 an act was passed regulating their height also. By this they were restrained to five stories, and the thickness of the wall determined to be three feet at bottom. In 1684 a lantern with a candle was ordered to be hung out on the first floor of every house, in order to light the streets at night; and there were two coaches with four horses each ordered to be bought for the use of the magistrates; but it does not appear how long they continued to be used. In 1681 the court of session discontinued its fittings in summer; but as this was found to be attended with inconvenience, an act was passed for their restoration, which has continued ever since. During the time of the civil war in 1649, the city was visited by the plague, which is the last time that dreadful distemper hath made its appearance in this country. The infection was so violent, that the city was almost depopulated, the prisoners were discharged from the tolbooth, and an act was made for giving one Dr Joannes Politius a salary of 80l. Scots per month, for visiting\nIn contradiction to these salutary acts, we may state those which show an extravagant desire of preserving the appearance of virtue in the female sex, as if it had been possible for others to inspire them with virtuous notions if they had not imbibed them of themselves. In 1633 an act of council was passed, by which women were forbidden to wear plaids over their faces, under penalty of five pounds and the forfeiture of the plaid for the first fault. Banishment was the punishment of the third. The reason assigned for this act was, that matrons were not known from strumpets and loose women, while the plaid continued to be worn over the face. This act was renewed in 1637 and 1638. Succeeding town councils continued to show the same regard to these matters; and in 1665 they enacted, that no innkeeper, vintner, or alefeller, should for the future employ women as waiters or servants, under the penalty of five shillings sterling for each.\n\nThe following anecdote may perhaps make the virtues of these legislators themselves wear a suspicious aspect. In 1649 the city having borrowed 40,000 Scots, in order to raise their quota of men for his majesty, the payment of it was absolutely refused by the town council when a demand was made for that purpose. That they might not, however, depend entirely upon their own opinion in a matter of such importance, they took that of the General Assembly upon the subject; and it was determined by these reverend divines, that they were not in conscience bound to pay for an unlawful engagement which their predecessors had entered into. But in 1652, Cromwell's parliament, who pretended to no less sanctity than they, declared themselves of a very different opinion; and on the application of one of the creditors, forced them to repay the sum.\n\nThe treatment which the brave marquis of Montrose met with, likewise fixes an indelible stigma both upon the magistrates and clergy at that time. Having been put under sentence of excommunication, no person was allowed to speak to him or do him the least office of friendship. Being met without the city by the magistrates and town guard, he was by them conducted in a kind of gloomy procession through the streets bareheaded, and in an elevated cart made for the purpose; the other prisoners walking two and two before him. At the time of his execution he was attended by one of the ministers, who according to his own account, did not choose to return till he had seen him casten over the ladder.\n\nThe union in 1707 had almost produced a war between the two kingdoms which it was designed to unite; and on that occasion Edinburgh became a scene of the most violent disturbances, of which a particular account is given under the article BRITAIN. During the time the act was passing, it was found absolutely necessary for the guards and four regiments of foot to do duty in the city. The disturbances were augmented by the disagreement of the two members of parliament; and notwithstanding the victory gained at that time by the Edinburgh court party, Sir Patrick Johnston the provost, who voted for the union, was obliged afterwards to leave the country. In 1715 the city remained faithful to Loyalty of the royal cause, and proper measures were taken for its city in defence. A committee of safety was appointed, and city guard increased, and 400 men raised at the expense of the town. The trained bands likewise were ordered out, 100 of whom mounted guard every night; by which precautions the rebels were prevented from attempting the city; they however, made themselves master of the citadel of Leith; but fearing an attack from the duke of Argyll, they abandoned it in the nighttime. A scheme was even laid for becoming masters of the castle of Edinburgh; for which purpose they bribed a sergeant to place their scaling ladders. Thus some of the rebels got up to the top of the walls before any alarm was given; but in the mean time the plot being discovered by the sergeant's wife, her husband was hanged over the place where he had attempted to introduce the rebels. The expense of the armament which the city had been at on this occasion amounted to about 1700l. which was repaid by government in the year 1721.\n\nThe loyalty of this city was still farther remarkable in the year 1725, when disturbances were excited in all parts of the kingdom, particularly in the city of Glasgow, concerning the excise bill; for all remained quiet in Edinburgh, notwithstanding the violent outcries that were made elsewhere; and so remarkable was the tranquillity in the metropolis, that government afterwards returned thanks to the magistrates for it. In 1736, however, the city had again the misfortune to fall under the royal displeasure, on the following account. Two smugglers having been detected in stealing their own goods out of a customhouse, were condemned to be hanged. The crime was looked upon as trivial; and therefore a general murmur prevailed among the populace, which was no doubt heightened by the following accident. At that time it had been customary Captain Porteous for persons condemned to die to be carried each Sunday to the church, called from that circumstance the Tolbooth church. The two prisoners just mentioned were conducted in the usual way, guarded by three soldiers, to prevent their making their escape: but having once gone thither a little before the congregation met, one of the prisoners seized one of the guards in each hand, and the other in his teeth, calling out to his companion to run; which he immediately did with such speed, that he soon got out of sight, and was never heard of afterwards. The person who had thus procured the life of his companion without regard to his own, would no doubt become a general object of compassion; and of course, when led to the place of execution, the guard were feverishly pelted by the mob, and some of them, according to the testimony of the witnesses who were sworn on the occasion, pretty much wounded. By this Captain Porteous, who commanded the guard, was so much provoked, that he gave orders to fire, by which six people were killed and eleven wounded. The evidence, however, even of the fact that the orders to fire were given, appears not to have been altogether unexceptionable; nevertheless, on this he was tried and condemned to be executed. At that time the king was absent in Hanover, having\nEdinburgh having left the regency in the hands of the queen; and the case of the unfortunate Porteous having been represented to her, she was pleased to grant him a reprieve; but such was the inveteracy of the people against him, that they determined not to allow him to avail himself of the royal clemency. On the night previous to the day that had been appointed for his execution, therefore, a number of people assembled, shut the gates of the city, and burnt the door of the prison, the same which the mob would formerly have broken open in order to murder King James. They then took out Porteous, whom it was found impossible to refuse out of their hands, though every method that the magistrates could take for that purpose in such a confusion was made use of. It was even proved, that the member of parliament went to the commander in chief, and requested that he would send a party of soldiers to quell the disturbance, but was absolutely denied this request, because he could not produce a written order from the provost to this purpose; which, in the confusion then existing in the city, could neither have been expected to be given by the provost, nor would it have been safe for any person to have carried it about him. Thus the unhappy victim was left in the hands of his executioners; and being dragged by them to the place destined for receiving his fate, was hanged on a dyer's sign post. As they had not brought a rope along with them, they broke open a shop where they knew they were to be had; and having taken out what they wanted, left the money upon the table, and retired without committing any other disorder.\n\nSuch an atrocious insult on government could not but be highly resented. A royal proclamation was issued, offering a pardon to any accomplice, and a reward of £500. to any person who would discover one of those concerned. The proclamation was ordered to be read from every pulpit in Scotland the first Sunday of every month for a twelvemonth; but so divided were the people in their opinions about this matter, that many of the clergy hesitated exceedingly about complying with the royal order, by which they were brought in danger of being turned out of their livings; while those who complied were rendered unpopular, that their situation was rendered still worse, than the others. All the efforts of government, however, were insufficient to produce any discovery; by which, no doubt, the court were still more exasperated; and it was now determined to execute vengeance on the magistrates and city at large. Alexander Wilson, the provost at that time, was imprisoned three weeks before he could be admitted to bail; after which, he and the four bailies, with the lords of justiciary, were ordered to attend the house of peers at London. On their arrival there, a debate ensued, whether the lords should attend in their robes or not? but at last it was agreed, that they should attend in their robes at the bar. This however, was refused by their lordships, who insisted that they should be examined within the bar; upon which the affair of their examination was dropped altogether. A bill at last passed both houses, by which it was enacted, that the city of Edinburgh should be fined in £2000. for the benefit of Porteous's widow (though she was prevailed upon to accept of £500. for the whole); and the provost was declared incapable of ever serving government again in any capacity whatever. To prevent such catastrophes in future, the town council enacted, that, on the first appearance of an insurrection, the chief officers in the different societies and corporations should repair to the council to receive the orders of the magistrates for the quelling of the tumult, under the penalty of £1. 6s. 8d. for each omission.\n\nIn 1745, the city was invested by the Pretender's army; and on the 17th of September, the Netherbow gate being opened to let a coach pass, a party of highlanders, who had reached the gate undetected, rushed in, and took possession of the city. The inhabitants were commanded to deliver up their arms at the palace or Holyroodhouse; a certain quantity of military stores was required from the city, under pain of military execution; and an assessment of £3. 6d. upon the pound was imposed upon the real rents within the city and liberties for defraying that expense.\n\nThe Pretender's army guarded all the avenues to the castle; but no signs of hostilities ensued till the 25th of the month, when the garrison being alarmed from some unknown cause, a number of cannon were discharged at the guard placed at the West Port, but with very little effect. This gave occasion to an order to the guard at the Weigh-house, to prevent all intercourse between the city and castle; and then the governor acquainted the provost by letter, that unless the communication was prevented, he would be obliged to dislodge the guard by means of artillery. A deputation was next sent to the Pretender; acquainting him with the danger the city was in, and entreating him to withdraw the guard. With this he refused to comply; and the highland centinels firing at some people who were carrying provisions into the castle, a pretty smart cannonading ensued, which set on fire several houses, killed some people, and did other damage. The Pretender then consented to dismiss the guard, and the cannonading ceased. After the battle of Culloden, the provost of Edinburgh was obliged to stand a very long and severe trial, first at London and then at Edinburgh, for not defending the city against the rebels; which, from the situation and extent of the walls, every one must have seen to be impossible.\n\nDuring this trial a very uncommon circumstance happened; the jury having sat two days, insisted that they could fit no longer, and prayed for a short respite. As the urgency of the case was apparent, and both parties agreed, the court, after long reasoning adjourned till the day following, taking the jury bound under a penalty of £500. each; when the court continued sitting two days longer, and the jury were one day enclosed. The event was, that the provost was exculpated.\n\nAfter the battle of Culloden the duke of Cumberland caused fourteen of the rebel standards to be burned at the cross; that of the Pretender was carried by the common executioner, the others by chimney-sweepers; the heralds proclaiming the names of the commanders to whom they belonged as they were thrown into the fire. At this time the city of Edinburgh felt a temporary inconvenience from the election of their magistrates not having taken place at the usual time; Government so that it became necessary to apply to his majesty for the restoration of the government of the city. This city reformation was readily granted, the burgesses being allowed a polled tax; after which an entire new set of magistrates was returned,\nEdinburgh returned, all of them friends to the house of Hanover; and soon after the freedom of the city in a gold box was presented to the duke of Cumberland.\n\nWith these transactions all interferences betwixt government and the metropolis of Scotland were ended; the rest of its history therefore only consists of internal occurrences, the regulations made by its own magistrates for the benefit of the city, their applications to government for leave to improve it, or the execution of these improvements; of which we shall now give a brief detail.\n\nIn the year 1716, the city first bestowed a settled salary on the provost, in order to enable him to support the dignity of the first magistrate. This was at first £300; but has since been augmented to £500, which his lordship still enjoys. In 1718 it was recommended to the magistrates to distinguish themselves by wearing coats of black velvet, for which they were allowed £10, but this act being abrogated in 1754, gold chains were assigned as badges of their office, which they continue to wear. Provost Kincaid happened to die in office in the year 1777; which, being a very rare accident, perhaps the only one of the kind to be met with in the records of Edinburgh, he was buried with great solemnity, and a vast concourse of people attended.\n\nTumults have been frequent in Edinburgh, chiefly on account of the dearth of provisions. In 1740 Bell's mills were first attacked by the populace, and afterwards Leith mills; nor could the rioters be dispersed till the military had fired among them and wounded three, of whom one died; and it was found necessary to order some dragoons into the city in order to preserve tranquillity. In 1742, another violent tumult took place, owing to a custom of stealing dead bodies from their graves for anatomical purposes, which had then become common. The populace beat to arms, threatened destruction to the surgeons; and, in spite of the efforts of the magistrates, demolished the house of the beadle at St Cuthbert's. In 1756 new disturbances, which required the assistance of the military, took place: the cause at this time was the impressing of men for the war which was then commencing. A disturbance was likewise excited in 1760. This was occasioned by the footmen, who till then were allowed to follow their masters into the playhouse, and now took upon them to disturb the entertainment of the company; the consequence of which was, that they were turned out, and have ever since been obliged to wait for their masters. In 1763 and 1765, the tumults on account of the price of provisions were renewed; many of the meal-mongers had their houses broken open and their shops destroyed. The magistrates, as usual, were obliged to call in a party of dragoons to quell the disturbance; but at the same time, to put an effectual stop, as far as was in their power, to these proceedings for the future, they gave security, that people who brought grain or provision into the market should be secured in their property. Since that time there have been no tumults directly on the account of provisions; though in 1784 a terrible riot and attack of a distillery at Canonmills took place, on a supposition that the distillers enhanced the price of meal by using unmalted grain. The attack was repelled by the servants of the distillery; but the mob could not be quelled until the sheriff called the soldiers quartered in the castle to his assistance. The same night a party of rioters set out for Ford, a place ten miles to the southward, where there was likewise a large distillery; which, as there was none to make any opposition, they soon destroyed. One man was killed in this riot at Edinburgh by the fire of a servant of the distillery, and several of the rioters were afterwards secured and punished.\n\nIn the years 1778 and 1779 two very alarming disturbances happened, which threatened a great deal of bloodshed, though happily they were terminated without any. The first was a mutiny of the earl of Seaforth's Highland regiment, who were at this time quartered in the castle. These having been ordered to embark, for some reason or other unanimously refused, and posted themselves on the top of Arthur's seat, where they continued for two days. Troops were collected to prevent their escape, and the inhabitants were ordered to keep within doors at the first toll of the great bell, which was to be a signal of violence about to take place; but fortunately all the fears, naturally arising from the expectation of this event, were dissipated by an accommodation. The other happened on account of the attempt to repeal the penal laws against the Papists; and was much more alarming than the other, as being the effect of a premeditated scheme and determined resolution to oppose government. On the 2d of February 1779 a mob assembled in the evening, burned a Popish chapel, and plundered another. Next day they renewed their depredations; destroying and carrying off the books, furniture, &c. of several Popish priests and others of that persuasion. The riot continued all that day, though the assistance of the military was called in; but happily no lives were lost, nor was there any firing. The city was afterwards obliged to make good the damage sustained by the Catholics on this occasion, which was estimated at £1500. This year also an unlucky accident happened at Leith. About 50 Highland recruits having refused to embark, a party of the South Fencibles was sent to take them prisoners. Unexpectedly, however, the Highlanders flooded upon their defence; then, after some words, a firing commenced on both sides, and about one half of the Highlanders were killed and wounded, the remainder being taken prisoners and carried to the castle. Captain Mansfield and two or three privates were killed in this affray.\n\nWe shall close this history of Edinburgh with a general account of the improvements which have lately taken place in it, and of which a particular description will afterwards be given. These began in the year 1753, when the foundation-stone of the Exchange was laid, at which time there was a grand procession, and the greatest concourse of people ever known in Edinburgh. A triumphal arch was erected for the purpose, through which the procession passed, and medals were scattered among the populace. In 1756 the high street was cleared by the removal of the cros; though many regretted this, on account of its being a very ancient and elegant building. In the middle it had an unicorn placed on the top of a pillar 20 feet high; but this fine ornament was broken to pieces by the giving way of the tackle by which it was attempted to remove it. It is now again erected at Drum, a seat formerly belonging to Lord Somerville, about four miles\nIn 1763 the first stone of the North bridge was laid by Provost Drummond; and in 1767 an act of parliament was obtained for extending the royalty of the city over the fields to the northward, where the New Town is now situated. About the same time a spot of ground upon the south side of the town was purchased by a private person for £200, which being freed out for building, gave rise to the increase of the town on that quarter; and this proceeded more rapidly, as the houses built there were free from the dues imposed upon others subject to the royalty. In 1774 the foundation of the Register Office was laid. In 1784 the project for rendering the access to the town equally easy on both sides was begun to be put into execution by laying the foundation of the South bridge. At the same time a great improvement was made by reducing the height of the street several feet all the way from the place where the cross stood to the Netherbow; by which means the ascent is rendered more easy, not only for carriages, but also for persons who walk on foot. At the same time, the street was farther cleared by the removal of the town guard house, which had long been complained of as an encumbrance. Within these three years (1805) part of the Luckenbooths has been removed, and it is still farther in contemplation to remove the whole with the prison. When this is accomplished, with other improvements by which it must necessarily be accompanied, it is to be questioned whether any city in Britain will be able to vie with Edinburgh in elegance and beauty.\n\nHaving thus given a concise history of the city from its earliest foundation, we shall now proceed to describe it in its most improved state.\n\nEdinburgh is situated upon a steep hill, rising from east to west, and terminating in a high and inaccessible rock, upon which the castle stands. At the east end or lower extremity of this hill stands the abbey of Holyroodhouse, or king's palace, distant from the castle upwards of a mile; and betwixt which, along the top of the ridge, and almost in a straight line, runs the high street. On each side, and parallel to this ridge or hill, is another ridge of ground lower than that in the middle, and which does not extend so far to the east; that on the south being intercepted by Salisbury rocks and Arthur's seat, a hill of about 800 feet of perpendicular height; and that on the north by the Calton hill, considerably lower than Arthur's seat; so that the situation of this city is most singular and romantic; the east or lower part of the town lying between two hills; and the west or higher part rising up towards a third hill, little inferior in height to the highest of the other two, upon which, as has been observed, the castle is built, and overlooks the town.\n\nThe buildings of the town terminate at the distance of about 200 yards from the castle gate; which space affords a most delightful as well as convenient and healthful walk to the inhabitants. The prospect from this spot is perhaps the finest anywhere to be met with, for extent, beauty, and variety.\n\nIn the valley or hollow betwixt the mid and the south ridges, and nearly parallel to the high street, is another street called the Cowgate; and the town has now extended itself over most part of that fourth ridge also.\n\nBetwixt the mid and the north ridges was a loch, which, till very late, terminated the town on that side. From the high street towards the loch on the north, and Cowgate on the south, run narrow cross streets or lanes, called wynds and closes, which grow steeper and steeper the farther west or nearer the castle; so that, were it not for the clofens and great height of the buildings, this city, from its situation and plan, might naturally be expected to be the best aired, as well as the cleanest, in Europe. The former, notwithstanding these disadvantages, it enjoys in an eminent degree; but we cannot compliment it upon the latter, notwithstanding every possible means has been used by the magistrates for that purpose.\n\nThe steepness of the ascent makes the access to the high street from the north and south very difficult; which no doubt greatly retarded the enlargement of the city. To remedy this inconvenience on the north, and with a view to extend the town on that quarter, a most elegant bridge has been thrown over the North Loch, which joins the north ridge to the middle of the high street, by so easy an ascent as one in fifteen; and in pursuance of the design, a plan of a new town to the north was fixed upon, and is now nearly finished, with an elegance and taste that does honour to this country. In like manner, to facilitate the access from the south side, a bridge has been thrown over the valley through which the Cowgate runs; which, if not equally elegant with the North bridge, is certainly as convenient.\n\nThe gradual increase of the city of Edinburgh may account of in some degree be understood from the traces of its ancient walls that still remain. James II. in 1490, first bestowed on the community the privilege of fortifying the city with a wall, and empowered them to levy a tax upon the inhabitants for defraying the expense. When the city was first fortified, the wall reached no further than the present water-house, or reservoir, on the castle hill: from thence to the foot of Halkerton's wynd, just below the new bridge, the city was defended by the North Loch; an inconsiderable morass, which, being formerly overflowed, formed a small lake that hath since been drained. From this place to the foot of Leith wynd, it does not appear how the city was fortified; but from the foot of Leith wynd to the Nether-bow port it was defended only by a range of houses; and when these had become ruinous, a wall was built in their place. The original wall of Edinburgh, therefore, began at the foot of the north-east rock of the castle. Here it was strengthened by a small fortress, the ruins of which are still to be seen, and are called the Wellhouse Tower, from their having a spring in their neighbourhood. When the wall came opposite to the reservoir, it was carried quite across the hill, having a gate on the top for making a communication between the town and castle. In going down the hill, it went slanting in an oblique direction to the first angle in going down the Well-bow, where was a gate named the Upper-bow Port, one of the hooks of which still remains. Thence it proceeded eastward in such a manner, as would have cut off not only all the Cowgate, but some part of the parliament house; and being continued as far as the Mint close, it turned to the north-east, and connected itself with the buildings on the north.\nEdinburgh, north side of the high street, where was the original Nether-bow Port, about 50 yards west from that which afterwards went by the same name.\n\nSoon after the building of this wall, a new street was formed on the outside of it, named the Cowgate, which in the 16th century became the residence of the nobility, the senators of the college of justice, and other persons of the first distinction. After the fatal battle of Flodden, however, the inhabitants of the Cowgate became very anxious to have themselves defended by a wall as well as the rest. The wall of the city was therefore extended to its present limits. This new wall begins on the south-east side of the rock on which the castle is built, and to which the town wall comes quite close. From thence it descends obliquely to the West Port; then ascends part of a hill on the other side, called the High Riggs; after which, it runs eastward with but little alteration in its course, to the Britto and Potter-row ports, and from thence to the Pleasance. Here it takes a northerly direction, which it keeps from thence to the Cowgate port; after which the enclosure is completed to the Nether-bow by the houses of St Mary's wynd. The original Nether-bow port being found not well adapted for defence was pulled down, and a new one built in 1571 by the adherents of Queen Mary. In 1606, the late handsome building was erected about 50 yards below the place where the former stood. It was two stories high, and had an elegant spire in the middle; but being thought to encumber the street, and the whole building being in a crazy situation, it was pulled down by order of the magistrates in 1764.\n\nIn the original wall of Edinburgh there was, as has been already observed, a port on the Cattle hill. On the extension of the wall, after building the houses in the Cowgate, this gate was pulled down. That in the upper or West-bow stood for a much longer time, and was pulled down within the memory of some persons lately or perhaps still living. Besides these, there was a third, about 50 yards above the head of the Canongate; but whether there were any more, is uncertain.\n\nThe ports or gates of the new walls were, 1. The West Port, situated at the extremity of the Grass Market; beyond which lies a suburb of the town and a borough of regality, called Portsburgh. Next to this is a wicket, struck out of the town wall in 1744, for the purpose of making an easier communication between the town and the public walks in the meadows, than by Britto port. The next to this was Britto Port, built in 1575; beyond which lies a suburb called Britto Street. At a small distance from Britto was the Potter-row Port, which took this name from a manufactory of earthen ware in the neighbourhood. Formerly it was called Kirk of Field Port. Between this and the Cowgate port stood another, called St Mary's Wynd Port, which extended from east to west across the foot of the Pleasance, and which was demolished only since the middle of the last century. Close to the middle of this flood the Cowgate Port; which opened a communication between the Cowgate and St Mary's wynd, and the Pleasance. The Nether-bow Port has been already spoken of. At the foot of Leith wynd was another gate, known by the name of Leith Wynd Port; and within it was a wicket giving access to the church of Trinity College, and which still remains. At the foot of Halkerston's wynd was another, which, as well as the former, was built about the year 1560. Both of these were pulled down some years ago, and all the rest in 1785. Another still remains at the foot of the Canongate, known by the name of the Water-gate.\n\nFor 250 years the city of Edinburgh occupied the same space of ground, and it is but very lately that its limits have been so considerably enlarged. In the middle of the 16th century, it is described as extending in length about an Italian mile, and about half as much in breadth; which answers very nearly to its present limits, the late enlargements only excepted. This space of ground, however, was not at that time occupied in the manner it is at present. The houses were neither so high nor so crowded upon each other as they are now. This was a consequence of the number of inhabitants increasing, which has occasioned the raising of the houses to such a height as is perhaps not to be paralleled in any other part of the world. Till the time of the Reformation, the burying ground of the city extended over all the space occupied by the Parliament square, and from thence to the Cowgate. The lands lying to the southward of the Cowgate were chiefly laid out in gardens belonging to the convent of Black friars, and the church of St Mary in the Field. These extended almost from the Pleasance to the Potterrow port. From the Britto to the West port the ground was laid out in gardens belonging to the Gray friars. The magistrates, on their application to Queen Mary, obtained a grant of the Gray friars gardens for a burying place; for which it was given as a reason, that they were somewhat distant from the town. Here, however, it must be understood, that these gardens were distant from the houses, and not without the walls; for they had been inclosed by them long before. In the time of James I. the houses within the walls seem to have been in general, if not universally, covered with thatch or broom; and not above 20 feet high. Even in the year 1621, these roofs were so common, that they were prohibited by act of parliament, in order to prevent accidents from fire. In the middle of the last century, there were neither courts nor squares in Edinburgh. The Parliament close or square is the oldest of this kind in the city. Miln's square, James's court, &c. were built long after; and Argyll's and Brown's squares about the years 1750 or 1760.\n\nThe New Town was projected in the year 1752; but as the magistrates could not then procure an extension of the royalty, the execution of the design was suspended for some time. In 1767, an act was obtained, by which the royalty was extended over the fields to the northward of the city; upon which advertisements were published by the magistrates, defining proper plans to be given in. Plans were given in accordingly, and that designed by Mr James Craig architect was adopted. Immediately afterwards, people were invited to purchase lots from the town council; and such as purchased became bound to conform to the rules of the plan. In the mean time, however, the town council had secretly referred to themselves a privilege of departing from their own plan; which they afterwards made use of in such a manner as produced a law suit. According to the plan held forth to the purchasers, a canal was to be made through that place.\nplace where the North Loch had been, and the bank on the north side of it laid out in terraces; but instead of this, by an act of council, liberty was referred to the town to build upon this spot; and therefore, when many gentlemen had built genteel houses in the new town on faith of the plan, they were surprised to find the spot appointed for terraces and a canal, beginning to be covered with mean irregular buildings, and work houses for tradesmen. This deviation was immediately complained of; but as the magistrates showed no inclination to grant any redress, a prosecution was commenced against them before the Lords of Session. In that court the cause was given against the pursuers, who thereupon appealed to the House of Lords. Here the sentence of the Court of Session was reversed, and the cause remitted to the consideration of their Lordships. At last, after an expensive contest, matters were accommodated. The principal term of accommodation was, that some part of the ground was to be laid out in terraces and a canal; but the time of disposing it in that manner, was referred to the Lord President of the Court of Session and the Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. The fall of part of the bridge, hereafter mentioned, proved a very considerable disadvantage to the New Town; as it necessarily induced a suspicion that the passage, by means of the bridge, could never be rendered safe. An oversight of the magistrates proved of more essential detriment. A piece of ground lay to the southward of the Old Town, in a situation very proper for building. This the magistrates had an opportunity of purchasing for £2000; which, however, they neglected, and it was bought by a private person, who immediately freed it out in lots for building, as has been already mentioned. The magistrates then began to see the consequence, namely, that this spot being free from the duties to which the royalty of Edinburgh is subject, people would choose to reside there rather than in the New Town. Upon this they offered the purchaser £3000, for the ground for which he had paid £2000; but as he demanded £20,000, the bargain did not take place. Notwithstanding these discouragements, the New Town is now almost finished; and from the advantages of its situation, and its being built according to a regular plan, it hath undoubtedly a superiority over any city in Britain. By its situation, however, it is remarkably exposed to storms of wind, which, at Edinburgh, sometimes rage with uncommon violence.\n\nIt has three streets, almost a mile in length, running from east to west, intersected with cross streets at proper distances. The most northerly, called Queen's Street, till lately that Heriot row was built, is 100 feet broad, and commands an extensive prospect of the Forth, the county of Fife, and the shipping in the river. That called George's Street, which is in the middle, is no less than 115 feet wide. It is terminated at each end by two very elegant and extensive squares; that on the east end is called St Andrew's Square; the other, which is not yet finished, is called Charlotte's Square. Prince's street is the most southerly; and extends from the northern extremity of the bridge, quite to the west end of the town. It has only been finished this year (1805). From the west end of Prince's street, a spacious road has been lately opened to join the two roads to Glasgow by Airdrie and Whitburn. This has greatly improved the approach to the town from the west.\n\nThe most remarkable public buildings in Edinburgh are—\n\n1. The Castle. This stands on a high rock, accessible only on the east side. On all others it is very steep, and buildings in some places perpendicular. It is about 300 feet high from its base; so that, before the invention of artillery, it might well have been deemed impregnable; though the event showed that it was not. The entry to this fortress is defended by an outer barrier of palliadoes; within this is a dry ditch, draw-bridge, and gate, defended by two batteries which flank it; and the whole is commanded by a half-moon mounted with brass cannon, carrying balls of 12 pounds. Beyond these are two gate-ways, the first of which is very strong, and has two portcullises. Immediately beyond the second gate way, on the right hand, is a battery mounted with brass cannon, carrying balls of 12 and 18 pounds weight. On the north side are a mortar and some gun batteries. The upper part of the castle contains a half-moon battery, a chapel, a parade for exercise, and a number of houses in the form of a square, which are laid out in barracks for the officers. Besides these there are other barracks sufficient to contain 1000 men; a powder magazine, bomb proof; a grand arsenal, capable of containing 8000 stand of arms; and other apartments for the same use, which can contain 22,000 more; so that 30,000 stand of arms may be conveniently lodged in this castle. On the east side of the square above mentioned, were formerly royal apartments; in one of which King James VI. was born, and which is still shown to those who visit the castle. In another, the regalia of Scotland were deposited on the 26th of March 1707; but as they were never shown to any body, a suspicion has arisen that they were carried to London, perhaps during the rebellions 1715 or 1745. This apartment was opened in 1794 by an order from government, in presence of the first civil officers of the crown, as the lord president of the court of session, the lord justice clerk, &c., but no part of the regalia was found.\n\nThe governor of the castle is generally a nobleman, whose place is worth about £1000 a-year; and that of deputy governor, £500. This last resides in the house appointed for the governor, as the latter never inhabits it. There is also a fort-major, a store-keeper, master gunner, and chaplain; but as this last does not reside in the castle, worship is seldom performed in the chapel. The parliament house was formerly included in the great square on the top, and the royal gardens were on the marsh afterwards called the North Loch; the king's stables being on the south side, where the houses still retain the name, and the place where the barns were still retain the name of Cattle barns.\n\nThe castle is defended by a company of invalids, and four or five hundred men belonging to some marching regiment, though it can accommodate 1000, as above mentioned; and this number has been sometimes kept in it. Its natural strength of situation was not sufficient to render it impregnable, even before the invention of artillery, as we have already observed; much less would it be capable of securing it against the attacks of a modern army well provided with cannon. It could not, in\nEdinburgh—all probability, withstand, even for a few hours, a well-directed bombardment: for no part but the powder magazine is capable of resisting these destructive machines; and the splinters from the rock on which the castle is built, could not fail to render them still more formidable. Besides, the water of the well, which is very bad, and drawn up from a depth of 100 feet, is apt to subside on the continued discharge of artillery, which produces a conciliation in the rock.\n\n2. The Palace of Holyroodhouse. This, though much neglected, is the only royal habitation in Scotland that is not entirely in ruins. It is a handsome square of 230 feet in the inside, surrounded with piazzas. The front, facing the west, consists of two double towers joined by a beautiful low building, adorned with a double balustrade above. The gate-way in the middle is decorated with double stone columns, supporting a cupola in the middle, representing an imperial crown, with a clock underneath. On the right hand is the great staircase which leads to the council chamber and the royal apartments. These are large and spacious, but unfurnished: in one of them the Scotch peers meet to elect 16 of their number to represent them in parliament. The gallery is on the left hand, and measures 150 feet by 27½. It is adorned with the supposed portraits of all the kings of Scotland. In the apartments of the duke of Hamilton, which he possesses as hereditary keeper of the palace, Queen Mary's bed of crimson damask, bordered with green fringes and tassels, is still to be seen, but almost reduced to rags. Here also strangers are shown a piece of wainscot hung upon hinges, which opens to a trap stair communicating with the apartments below. Through this passage Darnley and the other conspirators rushed in to murder the unhappy Rizzio. Towards the outward door of these apartments are large dusty spots on the floor, said to be occasioned by Rizzio's blood, which could never be washed out. In the lodgings assigned to Lord Dunmore is a picture by Van Dyke, esteemed a masterly performance, of King Charles I. and his queen going a-hunting. There are likewise the portraits of their present majesties at full length by Ranlay. The lodgings above the royal apartments are occupied by the duke of Argyll as heritable master of the household.\n\nThe front of this palace is two stories high; the roof flat; but at each end the front projects, and is ornamented with circular towers at the angles. Here the building is much higher, and the rest of the palace is three stories in height. The north-west towers were built by James V. for his own residence: his name is still to be seen below a niche in one of these towers. During the minority of Queen Mary, this palace was burned by the English; but soon after repaired and enlarged beyond its present size. At that time it consisted of five courts, the most westerly of which was the largest. It was bounded on the east by the front of the palace, which occupied the same space it does at present; but the building itself extended further to the south. At the north-west corner was a strong gate with Gothic pillars, arches, and towers, part of which was not long ago pulled down. Great part of the palace was burnt by Cromwell's soldiers; but it was repaired and altered into the present form after the Restoration. The fabric was planned by Sir William Bruce a celebrated architect, and executed Edinburgh by Robert Mylne mason. The environs of the palace afford an asylum for insolvent debtors; and adjoining to it is an extensive park, all of which is a sanctuary.\n\nThe abbey church was formerly called the monastery of Holyroodhouse, and built by King David I. in 1128. He gave it the name of Holyroodhouse, in memory, as is said of his deliverance from an enraged hart, by the miraculous interposition of a crois from heaven. This monastery he gave to the canons regular of St Augustine; on whom he also bestowed the church of Edinburgh cattle, with those of St Cuthbert's, Corforphorn, and Liberton, in the shire of Mid Lothian, and of Airth in Stirlingshire; the priories of St Mary's Isle in Galloway, of Blantyre in Clydesdale, of Rowadill in Roos, and three others in the Western Isles. To them he also granted the privilege of erecting a borough between the town of Edinburgh and the church of Holyroodhouse. From these canons it had the name of the Canongate, which it still retains. In this new borough they had a right to hold markets. They had also portions of land in different parts, with a most extensive jurisdiction, and right of trial by duel, and fire and water ordeal. They had also certain revenues payable out of the exchequer and other funds, with fisheries, and the privilege of erecting mills on the water of Leith, which still retain the name of Canon mills. Other grants and privileges were bestowed by succeeding sovereigns; so that it was deemed the richest religious foundation in Scotland. At the Reformation, its annual revenues were 442 bolls of wheat, 640 bolls of bear, 560 bolls of oats, 550 capons, two dozen of hens, as many salmon, 12 loads of salt; besides a great number of swine, and about 250l. sterling in money. At the Reformation, the superiority of North Leith, part of the Pleasance, the barony of Broughton, and the Canongate, were veiled in the earl of Roxburgh; and were purchased from him by the town council of Edinburgh in 1636. In 1644, the church suffered considerably by the invasion of the English; but was speedily repaired. At the Restoration, King Charles II. ordered the church to be set apart as a chapel royal, and prohibited its use as a common parish church for the future. It was then fitted up in a very elegant manner. A throne was erected for the sovereign, and 12 stalls for the knights of the order of the thistle; but as masts had been celebrated in it in the reign of James VII., and it had an organ, with a spire, and a fine chime of bells on the west side, the Presbyterians at the Revolution entirely destroyed its ornaments, and left nothing but the bare walls.—Through time, the roof of the church became ruinous; on which the duke of Hamilton represented its condition to the barons of exchequer, and craved that it might be repaired. This request was complied with; but the architect and mason who were employed, covered the roof with thick flag stones, which soon impaired the fabric; and on the 2d of December 1768, the roof fell in. Since that time, no attempt has been made to repair it, and it is now entirely fallen to ruin.\n\nThe ruins of this church, however, are still sufficient to discover the excellency of the workmanship. Here some of the kings of Scotland are interred; and an odd\nEdinburgh: odd kind of curiosity has been the occasion of exposing some bones said to be those of Lord Darnley and a countess of Roxburgh who died several hundred years ago. Those said to belong to the former were very large, and the latter had some flesh dried upon them. The chapel was fitted up in the elegant manner above mentioned by James VII, but such was the enthusiasm of the mob, that they not only destroyed the ornaments, but tore up even the pavement, which was of marble.\n\nTo the eastward of the palace is the bowling green, now entirely in disorder; and behind it is a field called St Ann's Yards. Beyond this is a piece of ground called the King's Park; which undoubtedly was formerly overgrown with wood, though now there is not a single tree in it. It is about three miles in circumference; and was first enclosed by James V. It contains the rocky hills of Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Craigs, which last afford an inexhaustible stone quarry; and upon the north side of the hill stands an old ruined chapel, dedicated to St Anthony. The stones are used in building, as well as for paving the streets and highways. The park was mortgaged to the family of Haddington for a debt due to them; and by the present earl has been divided into a number of enclosures by stone dykes raised at a considerable expense. A good number of sheep and some black cattle are fed upon it; and it is now rented at £500 annually.\n\n3. St Giles's Church, is a beautiful Gothic building, measuring in length 206 feet. At the west end, its breadth is 110; in the middle, 129; and at the east end, 76 feet. It has a very elevated situation, and is adorned with a lofty square tower; from the sides and corners of which rise arches of figured stone work: these meeting with each other in the middle, complete the figure of an imperial crown, the top of which terminates in a pointed spire. The whole height of this tower is 161 feet.\n\nThis is the most ancient church in Edinburgh. From a passage in an old author called Simeon Dunelmensis, some conjecture it to have been built before the year 854; but we do not find express mention made of it before 1359. The tutelar saint of this church, and of Edinburgh, was St Giles, a native of Greece. He lived in the sixth century, and was descended of an illustrious family. On the death of his parents, he gave all his estate to the poor; and travelled into France, where he retired into a wilderness near the confluence of the Rhone with the sea, and continued there three years. Having obtained the reputation of extraordinary sanctity, various miracles were attributed to him; and he founded a monastery in Languedoc, known long after by the name of St Giles's.—In the reign of James II. Mr Preston of Gorton, a gentleman whose descendants still possess an estate in the county of Edinburgh, got possession of the arm of this saint; which relic he bequeathed to the church of Edinburgh. In gratitude for this donation, the magistrates granted a charter in favour of Mr Preston's heirs, by which the nearest heir of the name of Preston was entitled to carry it in all processions. At the same time, the magistrates obliged themselves to found an altar in the church of St Giles's, and appoint a chaplain for celebrating an annual mass for the soul of Mr Preston; and likewise, that a tablet, containing his arms, and an account of his pious donation, should be put up in the chapel.—St Giles's was first simply a parish church, of which the bishop of Lindisfarne or Holy Island, in the county of Northumberland, was patron. He was succeeded in the patronage by the abbot and canons of Dunfermline, and they by the magistrates of Edinburgh. In 1466, it was erected into a collegiate church by James III. At the Reformation, the church was, for the greater convenience, divided into several parts. The four principal ones are appropriated to divine worship, the lesser ones to other purposes. At the same time the religious utensils belonging to this church were seized by the magistrates. They were,—St Giles's arm, enshrined in silver, weighing five pounds three ounces and a half; a silver chalice, or communion cup, weighing 23 ounces; the great eucharist or communion cup, with golden wreath and stones; two cruets of 25 ounces; a golden bell, with a heart, of four ounces and a half; a golden unicorn; a golden pix, to keep the holy; a small golden heart, with two pearls; a diamond ring; a silver chalice, paten, and spoon, of 32 ounces and a half; a communion table cloth of gold brocade; St Giles's coat, with a little piece of red velvet which hung at his feet; a round silver eucharist; two silver censers, of three pounds fifteen ounces; a silver ship for incense; a large silver cross, with its base, weighing sixteen pounds thirteen ounces and a half; a triangular silver lamp; two silver candlesticks, of seven pounds three ounces; other two, of eight pounds thirteen ounces; a silver chalice gilt, of 20½ ounces; a silver chalice and cross, of 7½ ounces; besides the priest's robes, and other vestments, of gold brocade, crimson velvet embroidered with gold, and green damask.—These were all sold, and part of the money applied to the repairs of the church; the rest was added to the funds of the corporation.\n\nIn the steeple of St Giles's church are three large bells brought from Holland in 1621; the biggest weighing 2000lb, the second 700, and the third 500. There are also a set of music bells, which play every day between one and two o'clock, or at any time in the case of rejoicings. The cathedral is divided by partition walls; and the principal apartments are used as four separate churches, which are distinguished by the names of the New or High Church, the Old Church, the Tolbooth Church, which is contiguous to the prison, and the Little Church, or Haddow's Hole Church, which derives its latter name from a gentleman who had been confined in it. The principal division is called the High Church, which has been elegantly repaired and new seated. There is a very elegant and finely ornamented seat for his majesty, with a canopy supported by four Corinthian pillars decorated in high taffeta. This seat is used by the king's commissioner during the time the General Assembly sits. On the right hand is a seat for the lord high constable of Scotland, whose office it is to keep the peace within doors in his majesty's presence; it being the duty of the earl marshal to do the same without. The seats belonging to the lords of council and session are on the right of the lord high constable; and on the left of the throne was a seat for the lord high chancellor of Scotland; but that office being now abolished, the seat is occupied by others. On the left of this fit the barons of exchequer; and, to the left of them, the lord provost, magistrates,\nThe pulpit, king's seat, and galleries, are covered with crimson velvet with gold and silk fringes.\n\nThe aisle of St Giles's church is fitted up with seats for the general assembly who meet here; and there is a throne for his majesty's commissioner with a canopy of crimson silk damask, having the king's arms embroidered with gold, presented by the late Lord Cathcart to his successor in office. In this church is a monument dedicated to the memory of Lord Napier, baron of Merchiston, well known as the inventor of logarithms; a second to the earl of Murray, regent of Scotland during the minority of James VI.; and a third to the great marquis of Montrose.\n\n4. The Parliament House, in the great hall of which the Scottish parliament used to assemble, is a magnificent building. The hall is 123 feet long and 42 broad, with a fine arched roof of oak, painted and gilded. In this the lawyers and agents now attend the courts, and single judges sit to determine causes in the first instance, or to prepare them for the whole court, who fit in an inner room formerly appropriated to the privy council. This inner apartment has been lately repaired and very commodiously fitted up. In a niche of the wall is placed a fine marble statue of President Forbes, erected at the expense of the faculty of advocates. There are also full-length portraits of King William III., Queen Mary his consort, and Queen Anne, all done by Sir Godfrey Kneller; also of George I., John duke of Argyll and Archibald duke of Argyll, by Mr Aikman of Cairney.\n\nAbove stairs were formerly the court of exchequer and treasury chamber, with the different offices belonging to that department; but these were removed in 1803 to the apartments in the royal exchange occupied by the customhouse; and below is one of the most valuable libraries in Great Britain, belonging to the faculty of advocates. Besides 30,000 printed volumes, there are many scarce and valuable manuscripts, medals, and coins: here is also an entire mummy in its original case, presented to the faculty (at the expense of 300l.) by the earl of Morton, late president to the Royal Society. As these rooms are immediately below the hall where the parliament sat, they are subject to a search by the lord high constable of Scotland ever since the gunpowder plot; and this is specified in the gift from the city to the faculty. This library was founded, in the year 1682, by Sir George Mackenzie lord advocate. Among other privileges, it is entitled to a copy of every book entered in Stationers' hall. Before the great door is a noble equestrian statue of Charles II., the proportions of which are reckoned exceedingly just. Over the entrance are the arms of Scotland, with Mercy and Truth on each side for supporters.\n\nThe court of session, the supreme tribunal in Scotland, consists of 15 judges, who sit on a circular bench, clothed in purple robes turned up with crimson velvet. Six of these are lords of the judiciary, and go the circuit twice a-year; but, in that capacity, they wear scarlet robes turned up with white satin.\n\n5. The Tolbooth was erected in 1561, not for the purposes merely of a prison, but likewise for the accommodation of the parliament and other courts; but it has since become so very unfit for any of these purposes, that it is now proposed to pull it down, and rebuild it in some other place, especially as it is very inconvenient in its present situation on account of its encumbering the street. The provost is captain of the tolbooth, with a gaoler under him; and the latter has a monopoly of all the provisions for the prisoners; a circumstance which must certainly be considered as a grievous oppression, those who are least able to purchase them being thus obliged to do so at the highest price. There is a chaplain who has a salary of 30l. a-year.\n\n6. Bridewell. \"On the Calton-hill, to be seen from the North Bridge, is a correction-house or Bridewell, built within these few years. It is a strong stone fabric. The principal part of the building is in the form of the letter D, with a house for the governor at some distance opposite to the northern or rectangular part of it. The whole is surrounded by lofty walls, between which and the house is an area laid out as a garden.\n\n\"This is said to be one of the most complete buildings of the kind in Britain. It consists of five stories; the uppermost of which is used as a hospital for sick prisoners and for store-rooms, &c. The other four stories are laid out in the following manner: A passage goes along the middle of the semicircular part of the building with apartments on each hand. The apartments on the outward side of the curvature are smaller than those on the inner side. They are double the number, and are used as separate bed-chambers for each of the persons confined. The apartments on the inner side of the semicircle, of which there are thirteen in each story, are allotted for labour. They have a grate in front, and look into the inner court. Opposite to them, in the flat side of the building, is a dark apartment with narrow windows, from which, without being seen, the governor can see how the prisoners in the apartments for work are employed. The court, or space in the middle between the flat and semicircular part of the building, is roofed in at the top; and a great part of it is covered with glass, so as to light the whole. On the floor of the area is a stove, which during winter heats the whole apartments allotted to labour. There is also a pulpit, from which a chaplain preaches on Sundays; and the prisoners come into the front apartments to attend the service.\n\n\"The bed-chambers, looking outwards to the country, are lighted by a long narrow window in each. The window is glazed. The frame in which the glass is fixed is of iron. It turns on pivots fixed at the top and bottom, so as to be opened and shut at pleasure. Each bed-chamber, which is about eight feet long by seven broad, is furnished with a bed and a bible. The frame of the bed is of iron, the bed consists of a straw mattress of the best quality. The whole floors and partitions of the building are of stone. No wood is used excepting for the doors of the apartments. There are cells, however, for solitary confinement for male criminals, in which the frames of the beds are of wood, left, by breaking them, tools or weapons of a dangerous nature should be obtained. Large cisterns, supplied with water from the city's reservoir, are placed at the top of the house, from which the water is distributed to the different stories, and to a kitchen, washing house, and baths, on the ground floor.\n\n\"The institution is managed with great care. Besides being superintended by the magistrates of Edinburgh,\nEdinburgh: the sheriff of the county once each month visits every corner of it. It is kept in a state of the most perfect cleanliness. The prisoners, when first received, are clothed in a uniform belonging to the place; and their own clothes, after being cleaned, are preferred for them till their diffusion. They remain during the day in the apartments allotted to labour, from which they are always dismissed as soon as it becomes dark to their bed-chambers. The women spin, and the men pick oakum. Their food consists of oatmeal porridge with small beer for breakfast and supper; and for dinner, of broth made of fat and vegetables, resembling what in Scotland is called \"bears' broth.\" Those that exert any tolerable industry are allowed bread to their broth, and also a larger portion of porridge. Only one death has occurred in the house during the last four years; and in that case the individual who died had come into Bridewell under a complication of difficulties. In truth, the food, clothing, good air, and comfortable lodging, which are enjoyed in this place, are far superior to what the greater number of inhabitants can expect to obtain on their return to the world at large. To reside here, therefore, is a punishment from moral and not from physical causes; that is to say, because it is attended with the loss of freedom and of society, and because it is a place of infamy.\"\n\n7. There is a hall in the Writers Court belonging to the clerks to his majesty's signet, where there is also an office for the business of the signet. The office of keeper of the signet is very lucrative, and he is allowed a deputy and clerks under him. Before any one enters into this society he must attend the college for two years, and serve five years as an apprentice to one of the society. There is a very excellent library belonging to this hall, which is rapidly increasing, as every one who enters must pay £10 towards it. He pays also £100 of apprentice fee, and £100 when he enters.\n\n8. The Exchange is a large and elegant building, with a court of about 90 feet square in the middle. On the north side are piazzas where people can walk under cover, the other three sides being laid out in shops; but the merchants have never made use of it to meet in, still standing in the street as formerly. The back part of the building formerly used for the general customhouse of Scotland, where the commissioners met to transact business, is now occupied by the offices connected with the Exchequer. They had above 20 offices for the different departments, to which the access is by a hanging stair 60 feet in height. In looking over the window before he ascends this stair, a stranger is surprised to find himself already 40 feet from the ground, which is owing to the declivity on which the Exchange is built. The fine mansion of Bellevue north of the New Town is now converted into apartments for the customhouse.\n\nThe Trustees Office for the improvement of fisheries and manufactures in Scotland is in the south-west corner of the Exchange; the fund under their management being part of the equivalent money given to Scotland at the Union. This is distributed in premiums amongst those who appear to have made any considerable improvement in the arts.\n\n9. The North Bridge, which forms the main passage of communication between the Old and New Towns, was founded, as has already been observed, in 1763 by Provost Drummond; but the contract for building it was not signed till August 21, 1765. The architect was Mr William Mylne, who agreed with the town council of Edinburgh to finish the work for £1,400, and to uphold it for 10 years. It was also to be finished before Martinmas 1769; but on the 3d of August that year, when the work was nearly completed, the vaults and side walls on the south fell down, and five people were buried in the ruins. This misfortune was occasioned by the foundation having been laid, not upon the solid earth, but upon the rubbish of the houses which had long before been built on the north side of the High Street, and which had been thrown out into the hollow to the northward. Of this rubbish there were no less than eight feet between the foundation of the bridge and the solid earth. Besides this deficiency in the foundation, an immense load of earth which had been laid over the vaults and arches in order to raise the bridge to a proper level, had no doubt contributed to produce the catastrophe above mentioned.—The bridge was repaired, by pulling down some parts of the side walls, and afterwards rebuilding them; strengthening them in others with chain bars; removing the quantity of earth laid upon the vaults, and supplying its place with hollow arches, &c. The whole was supported at the south end by very strong buttresses and counterforts on each side; but on the north it has only a single support.—The whole length of the bridge, from the High Street in the Old Town to Prince's Street in the New, is 1125 feet; the total length of the piers and arches is 310 feet. The width of the three great arches is 72 feet each; of the piers, 13½ feet; and of the small arches, each 20 feet. The height of the great arches, from the top of the parapet to the base, is 68 feet; the breadth of the bridge within the wall over the arches is 40 feet, and the breadth at each end 50 feet.—On the southern extremity of this bridge stands the General Post Office for Scotland; a neat plain building, with a proper number of apartments for the business, and a house for the secretary.\n\nThe communication between the two towns by means of this bridge, though very complete and convenient for such as lived in certain parts of either, was yet found insufficient for those who inhabit the western districts. Another bridge being therefore necessary, it was proposed to fill up the valley occasionally with the rubbish dug out in making the foundations of houses in the New Town; and so great was the quantity, that this was accomplished so as to be fit for the passage of carriages in little more than four years and a half.\n\n10. The South Bridge is directly opposite to the other, so as to make but one street, crossing that called the High Street almost at right angles. It consists of 19 arches of different sizes: but only one of them is visible, viz. the large one over the Cowgate; and even this is small in comparison with those of the North Bridge, being no more than 30 feet wide and 31 feet high. On the south it terminates at the University on one hand, and the Royal Infirmary on the other. The Tron Church, properly called Christ Church, stands at the northern extremity, facing the High Street, and in the middle of what is now called Hunter's Square, in memory of the worthy chief magistrate who planned those improvements, but did not live to see them executed.\nOn the west side of this square the Merchant Company have built a very handsome hall for the occasional meetings of their members. This bridge was erected with a design to give an easy access to the great number of streets and squares on the south side, as well as to the country on that quarter from whence the city is supplied with coals. The street on the top is supposed to be as regular as any in Europe; every house being of the same dimensions, excepting that between every two of the ordinary construction there is one with a pediment on the top, in order to prevent that famenels of appearance which would otherwise take place. So great was the rage for purchasing ground on each side of this bridge for building, that the areas sold by public auction at 50l. per foot in front. By this the community will undoubtedly be considerable gainers; and the proprietors hope to indemnify themselves for their extraordinary expense by the vast sale of goods supposed to attend the shops in that part of the town; though this seems somewhat more dubious than the former.\n\n11. The Concert Hall, called also St Cecilia's Hall, stands in Niddery's street; and was built in 1762, after the model of the great opera theatre in Parma. The plan was drawn by Sir Robert Mylne, architect of Blackfriars bridge. The musical room is of an oval form, the ceiling being a concave elliptical dome, lighted from the top by a lanthorn. The seats are ranged in the form of an amphitheatre; and are capable of containing 500 persons, besides leaving a large area in the middle of the room. The orchestra is at the upper end, and is terminated by an elegant organ.\n\nThe musical society was first instituted in the year 1728. Before that time, several gentlemen had formed a weekly club at a tavern kept by one Steil, a great lover of music, and a good finger of Scots songs. Here the common entertainment consisted in playing on the harpsichord and violin the concertos and sonatas of Handel, just then published. The meeting, however, soon becoming numerous, they instituted, in the year above mentioned, a society of 70 members, for the purpose of holding a weekly concert. The affairs of the society were regulated by a governor, deputy-governor, treasurer, and five directors, who were annually chosen by the members. The meetings were continued ever since that time on much the same footing as at first, and the number of members increased to 200. The weekly concerts were on Friday; the tickets being given gratis by the directors, and attention paid in the first place to strangers. Oratorios were occasionally performed throughout the year; and the principal performers had also benefit concerts. The band were excellent in their several departments; and several of the members being also good performers, took their part in the orchestra. There were always many applications on the occasion of a vacancy; and such was generally the number of candidates, that it was no easy matter to be admitted. This society, however, has been long neglected, and the hall disposed of for other purposes.\n\n12. The University. In the year 1581, a grant was obtained from King James VI. for founding a college or university within the city of Edinburgh; and the citizens, aided by various donations from well-disposed persons, purchased a situation for the intended new college, consisting of part of the areas, chambers, and Edinburgh-church of the collegiate provostry and prebends of the Kirk-a-field, otherwise called Templum et Prefectura Sanctae Mariae in campis, lying on the south side of the city. Next year, a charter of confirmation and erection was obtained also from King James VI., from which the college to be built did afterwards derive all the privileges of an university.\n\nIn 1583, the provost, magistrates, and council, the patrons of this new institution, prepared the place in the best manner they could for the reception of teachers and students; and in the month of October the same year, Robert Rollock, whom they had invited from a professorship in St Salvator's College in the university of St Andrew's, began to teach in the new college of Edinburgh. Other professors were soon after elected; and in the year 1586, Rollock was appointed principal of the college, and the following year also professor of divinity, immediately after he had conferred the degree of M.A. on the students who had been under his tuition for four years. The offices of principal and professor of divinity remained united till the year 1620.\n\nIn the 1617, King James VI. having visited Scotland after his accession to the crown of England, commanded the principal and regents of the college of Edinburgh to attend him in Stirling castle; and after they had there held a solemn philosophical disputation in the royal presence, his majesty was so much satisfied with their appearance, that he desired their college for the future might be called The College of King James, which name it still bears in all its diplomas or public deeds.\n\nFor several years the college consisted only of a principal, who was also professor of divinity, with four regents or professors of philosophy. Each of these regents instructed one class of students for four years, in Latin, Greek, school logic, mathematics, ethics, and physics, and graduated them at the conclusion of the fourth course. A professor of humanity or Latin was afterwards appointed, who prepared the students for entering under the tuition of the regents; also a professor of mathematics, and a professor of Hebrew or Oriental languages. It was not till about the year 1710 that the four regents began to be confined each to a particular profession; since which time they have been commonly styled Professors of Greek, Logic, Moral Philosophy, and Natural Philosophy.—The first medical professors instituted at Edinburgh, were Sir Robert Sibbald and Doctor Archibald Pitcairn, in the year 1685*. These, however, were only titular professors; and for 30 years afterwards, a summer lecture of Physic on the official plants, and the dissection of a human body once in two or three years, completed the whole course of medical education at Edinburgh. In 1720, an attempt was made to teach the different branches of physic regularly; which succeeded so well, that ever since, the reputation of the university as a school for medicine hath been constantly increasing, both in the island of Britain, and even among distant nations.\n\nThe college is endowed with a very fine library, founded in 1580 by Mr Clement Little advocate, who bequeathed it to the town council. They ordered a house to be built for it in the neighbourhood of St Giles's church, where it was for some time kept under\nEdinburgh—under the care of the eldest minister of Edinburgh, but was afterwards removed to the college. This collection is enriched, as well as others of a similar kind, by receiving a copy of every book entered in Stationers hall, according to the statute for the encouragement of authors. Besides this, the only fund it has is the money paid by all the students at the university, except those of divinity, upon their being matriculated; and a sum of £1 given by each professor at his admission. The amount of these sums is uncertain, but has been estimated at about £50 annually. The students of divinity, who pay nothing to this library, have one belonging to their own particular department.\n\nHere are shown two skulls, one almost as thin as paper, pretended to be that of the celebrated George Buchanan; and, by way of contrast, another said to have been that of an idiot, and which is excessively thick. Here also are preserved the original protest against the council of Constance for burning John Hus and Jerome of Prague in 1417; the original contract of Queen Mary with the dauphin of France, and some valuable coins and medals. There are also several portraits; particularly of Robert Pollock the first principal of the university, King James VI. John Napier the inventor of logarithms, John Knox, Principal Carlyle, Mr Thomson the author of the Seafons, &c. The museum contains a good collection of natural curiosities, the number of which is daily increasing. The anatomical preparations are worth notice, as are also those belonging to the professor of midwifery.\n\nThe celebrity of this college has been greatly owing to the uniform attention of the magistracy in filling up the vacant chairs with men of known abilities in their respective departments.\n\nThe university of Edinburgh \"having been instituted after the Reformation, among a frugal people that had no love for ecclesiastical dignities, it differs greatly from the wealthy foundations which receive the name of universities and colleges in England, or in the catholic countries of the continent of Europe. The university of Edinburgh consists of a single college, which enjoys the privilege of conferring degrees. It consists of a principal, with a salary of £111. 2s. 6½d. whole office is in a great measure nominal, and of a professor in each of the following departments:\n\n**Faculty of Theology.**\n\n| Department          | Salary |\n|---------------------|--------|\n| Divinity            | £161   |\n| Church History      | 100    |\n| Oriental Languages  | 119    |\n\n**Faculty of Law.**\n\n| Department                      | Salary |\n|---------------------------------|--------|\n| Law of Nature and Nations.—Salary variable, but always above | 300    |\n| Civil Law                       | 100    |\n| Scots Law                       | 100    |\n| Civil History and Antiquities   | 100    |\n\n**Faculty of Medicine.**\n\n| Department                  | Salary |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Anatomy and Surgery         | 50     |\n| Practice of Medicine        | —      |\n| Botany                      | 77     |\n| Materia Medica              | —      |\n\n\"Of these, the professors of church history and natural history, astronomy, law of nature and nations, and rhetoric, are in the gift of the crown. The professor of agriculture was nominated by Sir William Pultney, founder of the institution. The remaining chairs are in the gift of the town-council of Edinburgh. Besides these classes here enumerated, the medical professors alternately give clinical lectures upon the cases of patients in the royal infirmary of Edinburgh.\"\n\nThe university is now attended by not less than from 1200 to 1400 students in the different departments of science and literature.\n\nThe old buildings being very mean, and unfit for the reception of so many professors and students, and quite unsuitable to the dignity of such a flourishing university, as well as inconsistent with the improved state of the city, the Lord Provost, Magistrates, and Council, set on foot a subscription for erecting a new structure, according to a design of Robert Adam, Esq., architect. Part of the old fabric has in consequence been pulled down, and the new building is already in considerable forwardness. The foundation stone was laid on Monday the 16th of November, with great solemnity, by the Right Hon. Francis Lord Napier, grand master mason of Scotland, in the presence of the Right Hon. the Lord Provost, Magistrates, and Town Council of the city of Edinburgh, with the principal, professors, and students of the university of Edinburgh, a number of nobility and gentry, and the masters, officers, and brethren of all the lodges of free masons in the city and neighbourhood, who marched in procession from the Parliament House down the High street. After the different masonic ceremonials were performed, two crystal bottles, cast on purpose at the glass house of Leith, were deposited in the foundation stone. In one of these were put different coins of the present reign, each of them being previously enveloped in crystal, in such an ingenious manner, that the legend on the coins could be distinctly read without breaking the crystal. In the other bottle were deposited seven rolls of vellum, containing a short account of the original foundation and present state of the university, together with several other papers, in particular the different newspapers, containing advertisements relative to the college, &c., and a list of the names of the principal and professors, also of the present lord provost and magistrates, and officers of the...\"\nEdinburgh the grand lodge of Scotland. The bottles being carefully sealed up, were covered with a plate of copper wrapped in block tin; and upon the under side of the copper were engraved the arms of the city of Edinburgh and the university; likewise the arms of the Right Hon. Lord Napier, grand master mason of Scotland. Upon the upper side, a Latin inscription, of which the following is a copy:\n\nANNUENTE DEO OTT. MAX.\nREGNANTE GEORGIO III. PRINCIPE\nMUNIFICENTISSIMO;\nACADEMIA EDINBURGENSIS\nÆDIBUS,\nINITIO QUIDEM HUMILLIMIS,\nET JAM, POST DUO SECULA, FENE RUINOSIS;\nNOVI HIUS ÆDIFICI,\nQUI COMMODITATI SIMUL ET ELEGANTIE,\nTANTO DOCTRINARUM DOMICILIO\nDIGNA,\nCONSULLETUR,\nPRIMUM LAPIDEM POSUIT,\nFLAUDENTE INGENTI OMNI ORDINUM\nFREQUENTIA,\nVIR NOBILISSIMUS\nFRANCISCUS DOMINUS NAPIER,\nREPUB.

S.\n\nThe east and west fronts of this pile are to extend 255 feet, and the south and north 358. There are to be houses for the principal and six or seven of the professors. The library is to be a room of 160 feet in length; the museum for natural curiosities is to be of the same extent; and the dimensions of the hall for degrees and public exercises are about 90 feet by 30. There are likewise to be an elegant and most convenient anatomical theatre; a chemical laboratory; and large rooms for instruments and experiments for the professors of mathematics, natural philosophy, and agriculture. The whole, when finished, if not the most splendid structure of the sort in Europe, will however be the completest and most commodious. The progress of the building has now (1804) stopped. The front was completed by the aid of royal munificence; but after an expenditure of 50,000l. it is supposed that not more than one third of the plan has been executed.\n\nThe botanical garden belonging to the university is situated at the distance of about a mile, on the road between Edinburgh and Leith. It consists of about five acres of ground; and is furnished with a great variety of plants, many of them brought from the most distant quarters of the globe. The professor's botanist to the king, and receives a salary of 120l. annually for the support of the garden. A monument, to the memory of the celebrated botanist Linnaeus, was erected here by the late Dr Hope, who first planned the garden, and Edinburgh brought it to perfection.\n\nThe university of Edinburgh, like the others in this kingdom, sends one member to the General Assembly of the church of Scotland; and the widows of the professors have a right to the funds of those of ministers, the professors being trustees on that fund along with the presbytery of Edinburgh.\n\n\"In the year 1772, the Board of Trustees for the encouragement of Manufactures, &c., in Scotland, appointed Mr Alexander Runciman, painter, to teach 23 boys or girls drawing, allowing him a yearly salary of 120l. He was succeeded in this office by Mr Allan, to whom followed Mr Graham. This institution being appropriated for the use of manufactures, is not properly a school of painting. In this last art, however, very eminent teachers are to be found in Edinburgh, but no public establishment exists for its encouragement.\n\n\"Near the University there is also a Riding School, called the Royal Academy for teaching Exercises. The teacher of this academy receives a salary of 200l. a-year from the crown, and is accommodated with a riding school of 120 feet in length by 40 in breadth, and stables to a considerable extent.\n\n\"In Edinburgh there is established, in imitation of that in London, a Royal Society, which has published some volumes of transactions. It contains a number of members of great respectability; but in Edinburgh men of letters are apt to be extremely jealous and unsociable with regard to each other. This illiberality of temper prevents the Royal Society from being of much value. Great numbers of the most accomplished and active men of letters are unconnected with it, while it contains others who have been introduced to it merely by their rank in the world, or the circumstance of having attained to distinguished literary situations by the patronage of men in power, who of late years have, in this country, displayed little of that anxiety to discriminate and bring into notice men of literary talents, which once formed the most honourable characteristic of the nobles and gentlemen of Scotland.\"\n\n13. The Royal Infirmary was first thought of by the College of Physicians in 1725. A fishing company happening to be dissolved at that time, the partners contributed some of their stock towards the establishment of the Infirmary. A subscription was also let on foot, and application made to the General Assembly to recommend the same throughout their jurisdiction. This was readily complied with, and the assembly passed an act for that purpose; but very little regard was paid to it by the clergy. Notwithstanding this, however, 200l. being procured, a small house was opened for the reception of the sick poor in August 1729. In 1736, the contributors towards the Infirmary were erected into a body corporate by royal statute; and after this the contributions increased very considerably: by which means the managers were enabled to enlarge their scheme from time to time; and at last to undertake the present magnificent structure, the foundation of which was laid in 1738. During 25 years, when this institution was in its infancy, Lord Hopetoun bestowed upon it an annuity of 200l. In 1750, Doctor Archibald Ker bequeathed to this incorporation 200l. a-year in the island of Jamaica. In 1755, the lords,\nEdinburgh: lords of the treasury made a donation to it of £8000, which had been appointed for the support of invalids.\n\nIn return for this, the managers of the Infirmary constantly keep 60 beds in readiness for the reception of sick soldiers. This year also sick servants began to be admitted into the Infirmary, and a ward was fitted up for their reception.\n\nThis institution, however, was more indebted to George Drummond, Esq., than to any other person. He was seven times chosen lord provost of Edinburgh; and always directed his attention to the improvement of the city, particularly to that of the Royal Infirmary. So sensible were the managers of their obligations to him, that, in their hall, they erected a bust of him with this inscription, \"George Drummond, to whom this country is indebted for all the benefit which it derives from the Royal Infirmary.\"\n\nIn 1748, the stock of the Infirmary amounted to £3000; in 1755, to £7000; besides the estate left by Doctor Ker; in 1764, to £23,426; and in 1778, to £27,074.\n\nThe Royal Infirmary is attended by two physicians chosen by the managers, who visit their patients daily in presence of the students. All the members of the College of Surgeons were obliged to attend in rotation, according to seniority. If any surgeon declined attendance, he was not allowed to appoint a deputy; and the patients were committed to the care of one of four assistant surgeons, chosen annually by the managers: this was formerly the mode of attendance, but the managers have in consequence of a decision of the high court of judicature assumed to themselves the sole right of electing the surgeons.—From the year 1762 to 1769, there were admitted 6261 patients; which number added to 109 who were in the hospital at the commencement of the year 1762, made, in all, 6370. Of these, 4395 were cured; 358 died; the rest were either relieved, dismissed incurable, for irregularities, or by their own desire, or remained in the hospital.—From 1770 to 1775, the patients annually admitted into the Infirmary were, at an average, 1567; of whom 63 died. In 1776, there were admitted 1668, of whom 57 died; and in 1777, the number admitted was 1593, and of deaths, 52. In the year 1786, there were admitted 1822 patients: Of these 1354 were cured; 166 relieved; 84 died; the rest were either relieved, dismissed incurable, for irregularities, or by their own desire.\n\nThe building consists of a body and two wings, each of them three stories high, with an attic story and garrets, and a very elegant front. The body is 210 feet long, and 36 broad in the middle, but at the ends only 24 feet broad. There is a bust of King George II. in a Roman dress, above the great door. The wings are 70 feet long, and 25 broad. In the centre is a large staircase, so wide that sedan chairs may be carried up. In the different wards, 228 patients may be accommodated, each in a different bed. There are cold and hot baths for the patients, and also for the citizens; and to these last the patients are never admitted.\n\nBesides the apartments necessary for the sick, there are others for the officers and servants belonging to the house. There are likewise rooms for the managers, a consulting room for the physicians and surgeons—a waiting room for the students, and a theatre that will hold upwards of 200 people for performing surgical operations. There is a military ward, supported by the interest of the £8000 already mentioned; and in consequence of which a small guard is always kept at the Infirmary. The wards for sick servants are supported by collections at the church doors. Besides the surgical attendance already mentioned, there are two physicians belonging to the house, who are elected by the managers, and have a salary: there is likewise a house-surgeon and apothecary. Students who attend the Infirmary paid formerly 3l. 3s. which is increased to 5l. 5s. annually, which brings in a considerable revenue towards defraying the expense of the house. Two wards are set apart for the patients whose cases are supposed to be most interesting; and the medical professors in the university give clinical lectures upon them by rotation.\n\n14. The Public Dispensary was founded by Dr Duncan in 1776, for the poor whose diseases are of such a nature as to render their admission into the Infirmary either unnecessary or improper. Here the patients receive advice gratis four days in the week; a register is kept of the diseases of each, and of the effects produced by the medicines employed. All patients not improper for dispensary treatment are admitted on the recommendation of the elder or church warden of the parish where they reside. The physicians officiate and give lectures gratis; so that the apothecary who lodges in the house, and the medicines, are the only expenses attending this useful institution. The expense of the whole is defrayed by public contributions, and from a small annual fee paid by the students who attend the lectures. It is under the direction of a president, two vice-presidents, and 20 directors, elected annually from among the contributors. One guinea entitles a contributor to recommend patients and be a governor for two years, and five guineas gives the same privilege for life. Under the same management there is an institution for the gratuitous inoculation for the cowpox.\n\n15. The High School. The earliest institution of a grammar school in Edinburgh seems to have been about the year 1519. The whole expense bestowed upon the first building of this kind amounted only to about 40l. sterling. Another building, which had been erected for the accommodation of the scholars in 1578, continued, notwithstanding the great increase of their number, to be used for that purpose till 1777. The foundation of the present new building was laid on the 24th of June that year by Sir William Forbes, Grand Master of the Free Masons. The total length of this building is 120 feet from south to north; the breadth in the middle 36, at each end 38 feet. The great hall where the boys meet for prayers, is 68 feet by 30l. At each end of the hall is a room of 32 feet by 20, intended for libraries. The building is two stories high, the one 18, the other 17, feet in height. The expense of the whole was reckoned at 4000l.\n\nThere is a rector and four masters, who teach from 400 to 500 scholars annually. The salaries are trifling, and the fees depend upon the reputation they have obtained for teaching; and as this has been for some years very considerable, the rector's place is supposed to be worth not less than 400l. per annum, a master's about half that sum. There is a janitor, whose place is supposed to be worth about 70l. a-year. His business is\nto take care of the boys on the play ground; and there is a woman who lives on the spot as under-janitor, whose place may be worth about £21 annually. There is a library, but not large, as each of the boys pays only one shilling annually to its support.\n\nThere are four established English schools in Edinburgh; the masters of which receive a small salary, upon express condition that they shall not take above a limited sum per quarter from any of their scholars. There are likewise many other private schools in Edinburgh for all languages; and, in general, every kind of education is to be had here in great perfection and at a very cheap rate.\n\n16. The Mint is kept up by the articles of Union, with all the offices belonging to it, though no money is ever struck here. It stands in the Cowgate, a little to the west of the English church; but is in a ruined state, though still inhabited by the different officers, who have free houses; and the bellman enjoys his salary by regularly ringing the bell. This place, as well as the abbey of Holyroodhouse, is an asylum for debtors.\n\n17. The English Chapel stands near the Cowgate Port, and was founded on the 3d of April 1771. The foundation stone was laid by General Oughton, with the following inscription: Edificii sacri Ecclesiae episc. Anglicae, primum posuit lapidem J. Adolphus Oughton, in archetectonice Scotiae repub. curio maximus, militum praefectus, regnante Georgio III. tertio Ap. die, A.D. MDCCCLXXI. It is a plain handsome building, neatly fitted up in the inside, and somewhat resembling the church of St Martin's in the Fields, London. It is 90 feet long, 75 broad, and ornamented with an elegant spire of considerable height. It is also furnished with an excellent bell, formerly belonging to the chapel royal at Holyroodhouse, which is permitted to be rung for assembling the congregation; an indulgence not granted to the Presbyterians in England. The expense of the building was defrayed by voluntary subscription; and to the honour of the country, people of all persuasions contributed to this pious work. It has already cost £7000, and will require £1000 more to finish the portico. This church is built in a singular manner, viz. from south to north, and the altar-piece stands on the east side. Three clergymen officiate here, of whom the first has £150, the other two £100 each: the altar-piece is finely decorated, and there is a good organ.\n\nThere is another Episcopal chapel, but small, in Blackfriars wynd, which was founded by Baron Smith in the year 1722. There are also some meetings of the Episcopal church of Scotland, who adhere to their old forms, having still their bishops and inferior clergy. For some time these were subjected to penal laws, as they refused to take the oath to government, or mention the present royal family in their public prayers:\n\nbut having conformed, and taken the oath of allegiance, Edinburgh, their conduct has been approved of by his majesty; so that now every denomination of Christians in Britain pray for the royal family on the throne.\n\n18. Heriot's Hospital owes its foundation to George Heriot, goldsmith to James VI, who acquired by his business a large fortune. At his death, he left the magistrates of Edinburgh £23,625.10s. \"for the maintenance, relief, and bringing up of so many poor and fatherless boys, freemen's sons of the town of Edinburgh,\" as the above sum should be sufficient for. This hospital is finely situated on the west end of the fourth ridge, almost opposite to the castle, and is the most magnificent building of the kind in Edinburgh. It was founded in July 1628, according to a plan (as is reported) of Inigo Jones; but the work being interrupted by the civil wars, it was not finished till the year 1650. The expense of the building is said to have been upwards of £30,000. (a) and the hospital is now possessed of an income of about £3000 a-year; though this cannot be absolutely ascertained, as the rents are paid in grain, and of course must be fluctuating.\n\nIt stands on a rising ground to the south-west of the city, and is a square of 162 feet without, having a court 94 feet square in the inside, with piazzas on three of the sides. There is a spire with a clock over the gateway, and each corner of the building is ornamented with turrets; but notwithstanding the magnificent appearance of the outside, the inner part is far from being convenient. There is a statue of the founder over the gateway, in the dress of the times, and a very good painting of him in the governors' room, with a picture of the late treasurer Mr Carmichael. There is a chapel 61 feet long and 22 broad, which is now repairing in such a manner as will make it worthy of notice. When Cromwell took possession of Edinburgh after the battle of Dunbar, he quartered his sick and wounded soldiers in this hospital. It was applied to the same purpose till the year 1658, when General Monk, at the request of the governors, removed the soldiers; and on the 11th of April 1659, it was opened for the reception of boys, 30 of whom were admitted into it. The August after, they were increased to 40; and in 1661, to 52. In 1753 the number was raised to 130, and in 1763 to 140; but since that time it has decreased.—In this hospital the boys are instructed in reading, writing, arithmetic, and a knowledge of the Latin tongue. With such as choose to follow any kind of trade, an apprenticeship fee of £10 is given when they leave the hospital; and those who choose an academical education, have an annuity of £10 a-year bestowed on them for four years. The whole is under the oversight of the treasurer, who has under him a house governor, housekeeper, and schoolmasters.\n\n(a) It is to be observed, that money then bore 10l. per cent. interest.—The above sums are taken from Mr Arnott's History of Edinburgh, who subjoins the following note. \"Where Maitland had collected his most erroneous account of George Heriot's effects we do not know. He makes the sum received, out of Heriot's effects, by the governors of the hospital, to be £43,608l. 11s. 3d. being almost double of what they really get. This blunder has been the cause of many unjust murmurings against the magistrates of Edinburgh, and even the means of spiriting up lawsuits against them.\"\n19. Watson's Hospital has its name from the founder George Watson, who was at first clerk to Sir William Dick provost of Edinburgh in 1676, then accountant of the bank of Scotland; after that he became receiver of the city's impost on ale, treasurer to the Merchants' Maiden Hospital, and to the society for propagating Christian knowledge. Dying a bachelor in 1723, he left £2,000l. for the maintenance and education of the children and grandchildren of decayed members of the merchant company of Edinburgh. The scheme, however, was not put in execution till the year 1738, when the sum originally left had accumulated to £20,000l. The present building was then erected, in which about 60 boys are maintained and educated. It is much less magnificent than Heriot's hospital, but the building is far from being despised. It stands to the southward of the city at a small distance from Heriot's hospital, and was erected at the expense of £5000l.: its present revenue is about £1700l. It is under the management of the master, assistants, and treasurer of the Merchant Company, four old bailies, the old dean of guild, and the two ministers of the Old church. The boys are genteely clothed and liberally educated. Such as choose an university education are allowed £10l. per annum for five years: those who go to trades have £20l. allowed them for their apprentice fee, and at the age of 25 years, if they have behaved properly, and not contracted marriage without consent of the governors, they receive a bounty of £50l. The boys are under the immediate inspection of the treasurer, schoolmaster, and housekeeper.\n\n20. The Merchants' Maiden Hospital was established by voluntary contribution about the end of the last century, for the maintenance of young girls, daughters of the merchants burgesses of Edinburgh. The governors were erected into a body corporate, by act of parliament, in 1707. The annual revenue amounts to £1350l. Seventy girls are maintained in it; who, upon leaving the house, receive £1l. 6s. 8d. excepting a few who are allowed £8l. 6s. 8d. out of the funds of the hospital. The profits arising from work done in the house are also divided among the girls, according to their industry.\n\n21. The Trades' Maiden Hospital was founded in the year 1704 by the incorporations of Edinburgh, for the maintenance of the daughters of decayed members, on a plan similar to that of the merchants hospital. To this, as well as to the former, one Mrs Mary Erskine, a widow, gentlewoman, contributed so liberally, that she was by the governors styled joint founders of the hospital. Fifty girls are maintained in the house, who pay of entry money £1l. 13s. 4d.; and, when they leave it, receive a bounty of £1l. 11s. 4d. The revenues are estimated at £600l. a-year.\n\n22. The Orphan Hospital was planned in 1732, by Andrew Gairdner merchant, and other inhabitants. It was promoted by the society for propagating Christian knowledge, by other societies, by voluntary subscriptions, and a collection at the church doors.—In 1733, the managers hired a house, took in 30 orphans, maintained them, gave them instructions in reading and writing, and taught them the weaving business. In 1735, they were erected into a body corporate by the town of Edinburgh: and, in 1742, they obtained a charter of erection from his late majesty, appointing most of the great officers of state in Scotland, Edinburgh, and the heads of the different societies in Edinburgh, members of this corporation; with powers to them to hold real property to the amount of £1000l. a-year. The revenue is inconsiderable; but the institution is supported by the contributions of charitable persons. Into this hospital orphans are received from any part of the kingdom. None are admitted under seven, nor continued in it after 14 years of age.\n\nThe orphan hospital is situated to the east of the North bridge; and is a handsome building, consisting of a body and two wings, with a neat spire, furnished with a clock and two bells. The late worthy Mr Howard admits, that this institution is one of the most useful charities in Europe, and is a pattern for all institutions of the kind. The funds have been considerably increased, and the building greatly improved, through the attention and exertions of Mr Thomas Tod formerly treasurer.\n\n23. The Trinity Hospital. This was originally founded and amply endowed by King James II.'s queen. At the Reformation, it was stripped of its revenues; but the regent afterwards bestowed them on the provost of Edinburgh, who gave them to the citizens for the use of the poor. In 1585, the town council purchased from Robert Pont, at that time provost of Trinity college, his interest in these subjects; and the transaction was afterwards ratified by James VI. The hospital was then repaired, and appointed for the reception of poor old burgesses, their wives and unmarried children, not under 50 years of age. In the year 1700, this hospital maintained 54 persons; but, since that time, the number has decreased.—The revenue consists in a real estate of lands and houses, the gross rents of which are £62l. a year, and £550l. lent out at bonds at 4 per cent.\n\nThis hospital is situated at the foot of Leith wynd, and maintains about 50 of both sexes, who are comfortably lodged, each having a room for themselves. They are supplied with roast or boiled meat every day for dinner, have money allowed them for clothes, and likewise a small sum for pocket money. There is a small library for their amusement, and they have a chaplain to say prayers. There are some out-pensioners who have £1l. a-year, but these are discouraged by the governors. The funds are under the management of the town council.\n\n24. The Charity Workhouse was erected in 1743 by voluntary contribution. It is a large plain building, on the south side of the city. Here the poor are employed, and are allowed twopence out of every shilling they earn. The expense of this institution is supposed not to be less than £4000l. annually; as about 700 persons of both sexes, including children, are maintained here, each of whom cannot be reckoned to cost less than £1l. 10s. per annum; and there are besides 300 out-pensioners. The only permanent fund for defraying this expense is a tax of two per cent. on the valued rents of the city, which may bring in about £600l. annually; and there are other funds which yield about £400l. The rest is derived from collections at the church doors and voluntary contributions; but as these always fall short of what is requisite, recourse must frequently be had to extraordinary collections. The sum arising from the rents of the city, however, is constantly...\nTo the fourth-west of the castle, near a suburb called the Wright's House, on the site of a very ancient building, which was demolished to make way for it, Gillespie's Hospital has lately been erected. Its appellation is derived from the founder, an eminent manufacturer of snuff in Edinburgh. It is intended for the support of aged persons; and those bearing the name of the founder are preferred. It is a neat stone building, executed in a style of moderate expense, with a small tower in the centre and a parapet, and Gothic turrets at suitable distances around the roof.\n\nBesides these there are to be found in Edinburgh several charitable establishments, which, though not furnished with costly buildings, are not of a less benevolent or valuable nature. Of these, one of the most distinguished is the Hospital or Workhouse, or Asylum, as it is called, for the Industrious Blind; which is supported by the contributions of charitable persons, and by the price of the articles manufactured in it. Here the blind are taught such trades as may enable them to earn a subsistence, or at least aid them in contributing to their own support. They manufacture baskets, mats, &c.; and some of them have been taught to act as weavers, for which purpose they use the shuttle.\n\nThe Magdalene Asylum also deserves notice; in which a most laudable attempt has of late years been made, by a benevolent society, to reclaim, from vice and misery, women who have degraded themselves by public prostitution, but who think fit to retire thither with the view of abandoning their mode of life, and of supporting themselves by industry. This institution is managed with a degree of care and delicacy which does the highest credit to its patrons. The objects of this charity are kept concealed: they reap the fruits of their own labour; and every effort is made to procure employment for them. In particular, needle-work of all sorts is executed in it in the neatest manner; and linen is washed, at moderate prices, for such persons in the city as think fit to transmit these articles to the society.\n\nBesides all these charities, there is an hospital in the city for Lying-in Women, under the care of the professor of midwifery: which is an institution analogous to that of the Royal Infirmary.—There is a Society for the Relief of the Destitute Sick, which has received considerable public countenance, though it has no appropriate building or local establishment.—An institution of a peculiar nature, not unconnected with the present subject, called the Repository, ought not to pass unnoticed. It is a shop or ware-room on South Bridge Street, to which ladies in straitened circumstances have an opportunity of sending for sale curious, beautiful, or useful articles of needle-work, with the price affixed. When a purchaser has been found for the goods, the proceeds are transmitted in such a manner as to prevent its being known to the public by whom the articles were prepared. This institution has been promoted by the Duchess of Buccleugh and many other persons of rank.\n\nThere are two other charity workhouses in the suburbs, much on the same plan with that now described: one in the Canongate, and the other in St Cuthbert's Edinburgh, or West Kirk parish.\n\nTo this account of the charitable establishments in Edinburgh, we shall add that of some others; which, though not calculated to decorate the city by any public building, are perhaps no less deserving of praise than any we have mentioned. The first is that of Captain William Horn; who left £300l. in trust to the magistrates, the annual profits to be divided on Christmas day to poor out-door labourers, who must at that season of the year be destitute of employment; five pounds to be given to those who have large families, and one half to those who have smaller.\n\nAnother charity is that of Robert Johnston, LL.D., of London, who in 1640 left £300l. to the poor of this city; £100l. to be employed in setting them to work, another £100l. to clothe the boys in Heriot's Hospital, and the third £100l. to bursars at the university.\n\nAbout the beginning of this century John Strachan left his estate of Craigcrook, now upwards of £300l. a-year, in trust to the presbytery of Edinburgh, to be by them disposed of in small annual sums to poor old people not under 65 years of age, and to orphans not above 12.\n\nThere is besides a society for the support of the industrious poor, another for the indigent sick, and there are also many charity schools.\n\nHaving thus given an account of the most remarkable edifices belonging to Old Edinburgh, we shall now proceed to those of the New Town. This is terminated on the east side by the Calton hill, round which there is a pleasant walk, and which affords one of the finest prospects that can be imagined, varying remarkably almost at every step. On this hill is a burying ground, which contains a fine monument to the memory of David Hume the historian.—On the top is an observatory, the scheme for building which was first adopted in the year 1736; but the disturbance occasioned by the Porteous mob prevented anything from being done towards the execution of it at that time. The earl of Morton afterwards gave £100l. for the purpose of building an observatory, and appointed Mr MacLaurin professor of mathematics, together with the principal and some professors of the university, trustees for managing the sum. Mr MacLaurin added to the money above mentioned the profits arising from a course of lectures which he read on experimental philosophy; which, with some other small sums, amounted in all to £300l.; but Mr MacLaurin dying, the design was dropped.—Afterwards the money was put into the hands of two persons who became bankrupt; but a considerable dividend being obtained out of their effects, the principal and interest, about the year 1776, amounted to £400l. A plan of the building was made out by Mr Craig architect; and the foundation stone was laid by Mr Stoddart, lord provost of Edinburgh, on the 23rd of August 1776. About this time, however, Mr Adam architect happening to come to Edinburgh, conceived the idea of giving the whole the appearance of a fortification, for which its situation on the top of the Calton hill was very much adapted. Accordingly a line was marked out for enclosing the limits of the observatory with a wall constructed...\nfor pit and boxes; and 1s. 6d. for the gallery) 40l. or Edinburgh-\n45l. a night. About this time an act of parliament\nwas passed, prohibiting the exhibition of plays, except\nin a house licensed by the king. Of this the presby-\ntery of Edinburgh immediately laid hold; and at their\nown expense brought an action on the statute against\nthe players. The case was by the court of session\ndecided against the players; who thereupon applied to\nparliament for a bill to enable his majesty to license a\ntheatre in Edinburgh. Against this bill petitions were\npresented in 1739 to the house of commons by the\nmagistrates and town council, the principal and pro-\nfessors of the university, and the dean of guild and his\ncouncil; in consequence of which, the affair was drop-\nped. All this opposition, however, contributed in\nreality to the success of the players; for the spirit of\nparty being excited, a way of evading the act was ea-\nily found out, and the house was frequented more\nthan usual, inasmuch that Taylor's Hall was found in-\nsufficient to contain the number of spectators.\n\nThe comedians now fell out among themselves, and\na new playhouse was erected in the Canongate in the\nyear 1746. The consequence of this was, that the old\none in Taylor's Hall became entirely deserted, and\nthrough bad conduct the managers of the new theatre\nsoon found themselves greatly involved. At last, a riot\nensuing through dissensions among the performers, the\nplayhouse was totally demolished.—When the extension\nof the royalty over the spot where the New Town is\nbuilt was obtained, a clause was likewise added to the\nbill, enabling his majesty to license a theatre in Edin-\nburgh. This was obtained, and thus the opposition\nof the clergy for ever silenced. But notwithstanding\nthis, the high price paid by the managers to the pa-\ntentee, being no less than 500 guineas annually, pre-\nvented them effectually from decorating the house as\nthey would otherwise have done, or even from always\nretaining good actors in their service; by which means\nthe success of the Edinburgh theatre has not been so\ngreat as might have been expected.\n\nNot far from this building, an amphitheatre was\nopened in 1792, on the road to Leith, for equestrian\nexhibitions, pantomime entertainments, dancing, and\ntumbling. The circus was 60 feet diameter; and in the\nforenoon ladies and gentlemen were taught to ride.\nThe house held about 1500 people. This building\nhas since converted into an elegant and commodious\nconcert room.\n\n27. The Register Office. This work was first fug-\ngetted by the late Earl of Morton, lord-register of Scot-\nland, with a view to prevent the danger which attended\nthe usual method of keeping the public records. In\nformer times, indeed, these suffered from a variety of\naccidents. Edward I. carried off or destroyed most of\nthem, in order to prevent any marks of the former in-\ndependence of the nation from remaining to posterity.\nAfterwards Cromwell spoiled this nation of its records,\nmost of which were sent to the Tower of London. At\nthe time of the restoration, many of them were sent\ndown again by sea; but one of the vessels was ship-\nwrecked, and the records brought by the other have\never since been left in the greatest confusion.—The\nEarl of Morton taking this into consideration, obtain-\ned from his majesty a grant of 12,000l. out of the for-\nfeited estates, for the purpose of building a register\noffice,\nEdinburgh office, or house for keeping the records, and disposing them in proper order. The foundation was laid on the 27th of June 1774, by Lord Frederic Campbell lord-register, Mr Montgomery of Stainhowe lord advocate, and Mr Miller of Bariskinning lord justice clerk; three of the trustees appointed by his majesty for executing the work. The ceremony was performed under a discharge of artillery, in presence of the judges of the courts of session and exchequer, and in the sight of a multitude of spectators. A brass plate was put into the foundation stone with the following inscription: Conservandis Tabulis Publicis positum est, anno M.DCC.LXXIV, munificentia optimi et pietissimi principis Georgii Tertii. In a glass vase hermetically sealed, which is also placed in the foundation stone, are deposited specimens of the different coins of his present majesty.\n\nThe front of the building directly faces the bridge, extends from east to west 100 feet, and is 40 feet back from the line of Prince's street. In the middle of the front is a small projection of three windows in breadth. Here is a pediment, having in its centre the arms of Great Britain, and the whole is supported by four Corinthian pilasters. At each end is a tower projecting beyond the rest of the building, having a Venetian window in front, and a cupola on the top. The front is ornamented from end to end with a beautiful Corinthian entablature. In the centre of the building is a dome of wooden work covered with lead. The inside forms a saloon 50 feet diameter and 80 high, lighted at top by a copper window 15 feet in diameter. Round the whole is a hanging gallery of stone, with an iron balustrade, which affords conveniency for preludes in the walls for keeping the records. The whole number of apartments is 97; all of which are vaulted beneath, and warmed with fire-places. This building, which is the most beautiful of Mr Adam's designs, has been executed in a substantial manner, in about 16 years, at the expense of near 40,000l. and is one of the principal ornaments of the city. A sergeant's guard is placed here from the castle, for the further protection of the records. It is intended to place a statue of his present majesty in the front of the building, with the lion and unicorn above the sentinels' boxes. The lord-registrar has the direction of the whole, and the principal clerks of session are his deputies. There have a great number of clerks under them for carrying on the business of the court of session. The lord-registrar is a minister of state in this country. He formerly collected the votes of the parliament of Scotland, and still collects those of the peers at the election of 16 to represent them in parliament.\n\n27. On the east side of St. Andrew's square stands the General Excise Office, built by the late Sir Lawrence Dundas for his own residence, but sold by his son for the above purpose. It is a very handsome building, with a pediment in front ornamented with the king's arms, and supported by four Corinthian pilasters; and, in conjunction with the two corner houses, has a fine effect.\n\n28. St. Andrew's Church stands on the north side of George's street. It is of an oval form; and has a very neat spire of 186 feet in height, with a chime of eight bells, the first and only one of the kind in Scotland. It has also a handsome portico in front.\n\n29. Opposite to St. Andrew's church is the Physic Hall, designed for the meetings of the faculty, and which has a portico resembling that of the church.\n\n30. Farther to the westward, on the south side, stand the Assembly Rooms, which though a heavy looking building on the outside, are nevertheless extremely elegant and commodious within. The largest is 100 feet long and 40 broad, being exceeded in its dimensions by none in the island, the large one at Bath excepted. Weekly assemblies are held here for dancing and card-playing, under the direction of a master of ceremonies; admission tickets five shillings each.\n\n\"There are three Banking Companies in Edinburgh established by statute, or by royal charters. These are, the Bank of Scotland, commonly called the Old Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and the British Linen Company.\n\n31. \"The Bank of Scotland, commonly called the Old Bank, was erected by act of parliament, A.D. 1695. By the statute of erection, the company was empowered to raise a joint stock of 1,200,000l. Scots, or 100,000l. Sterling, for the purpose of carrying on a public bank. The smallest share which any person could hold in the bank was declared to be 100l. Scots; and the largest sum for which any one was allowed to subscribe was 20,000l. of the same money. Eight thousand are declared to be the qualification necessary to entitle any one to be elected governor; 600l. deputy governor; and 300l. for each director. The management of the affairs of the company was vested in a governor, deputy governor, and twenty-four directors; and in choosing these managers, each proprietor was declared to have a vote for every 100l. of stock held by him.\n\n\"The office of this company has hitherto been held in a house down a narrow lane at the south side of that part of the High street called the Lawn-market; but, at a great expense, they have erected for their accommodation a building which will speedily be ready to be occupied, and which is situated to the northward of the High street, in full view of Prince's street. This is at once a magnificent and beautiful fabric. The back of the building is towards Prince's street; and here, while erecting, it had the disadvantage, from its vast height, of having somewhat the aspect of a tower. This effect, however, is now removed by raising the earth for the purpose of covering up the lower part of it, and by a wall of considerable height in the nature of a curtain, which has been added to augment its apparent breadth. It forms, upon the whole, a beautiful and most superb fabric. As a work of magnitude, it is seen to most advantage from the mound of earth which connects the Old and the New Town, at that part of the mound which is in the direction of the north-west angle of the building. Here the eye is filled by the full view of two sides of the fabric, and by a display of its great height. The result of which is, that as a magnificent and stupendous structure, it seems to have no rival in this country.\n\n\"This banking company has established branches in every considerable town in Scotland, excepting Glasgow, which, in consequence of an amicable adjustment to avoid rivalryship, is left to the Royal Bank. By agreement, the latter has a branch at Glasgow, and no branch in any other town in Scotland.\"\n33. \"The Royal Bank was established in the following manner: By the articles of union, Scotland was declared to be liable to the same duties which were levied by way of customs or excise in England. As these duties had, in the latter of these nations, been appropriated for the discharge of debts contracted by England before the union, it was found reasonable to give Scotland an equivalent for this additional burden. The sum, given by way of equivalent, was ordained to be paid for certain purposes, and to certain persons or bodies corporate, mentioned in the articles of union and in posterior statutes. The proprietors of these sums, to the extent of £248,550 sterling, were erected into a body corporate, under the name of the Equivalent Company; and the said sum of £248,550, was declared to be the joint stock of the company. Upon application by this company, they obtained a royal charter, empowering such of them as inclined to subscribe their shares in the joint stock for that purpose, to carry on the business of banking. By this charter the subscribers to this banking business were, in A.D. 1727, erected into a body corporate, to be called, \"The Royal Bank of Scotland.\" They were vested with the requisite powers, and the management of the company's affairs declared to be in a governor, deputy governor, nine ordinary and nine extraordinary directors. The qualifications of these managers were declared to be, that of the governor to hold stock to the extent of £2000; of the deputy governor, of £1500; of the ordinary directors, of £1000; and of the extraordinary directors, of £500. The sum originally subscribed was £111,000; but by a charter passed in favour of the Royal Bank, A.D. 1738, explaining the privileges formerly bestowed upon them, and enabling them to increase their capital, they were empowered to raise their stock to a sum not exceeding in whole, when joined to their original funds, £150,000. By the charter of erection of this company, a share of £300 entitles a proprietor to one vote, one of £500, to two, of £1000, to three, and of £2000, to four; and no proprietor can have more than four votes.\n\n34. \"The British Linen Company, with a capital of £100,000, was incorporated by royal charter in 1746, with a view to encourage the manufacture of linen in Scotland. By the constitution of this company, its affairs are declared to be under the management of a governor, deputy governor, and five directors. It is declared a necessary qualification in the governor to be possessed of a share in the company's stock to the amount of £1000; of the deputy governor, £500; and of each director, of £300. A share of £200 entitles a proprietor to vote in the choice of these managers, of £500, to two votes, and of £1000, to four votes; but it is declared that no proprietor shall possess more than four votes.\n\n\"This company carries on the business of banking, and issues promissory notes like the two former companies; but the banking business is carried on separately from the linen trade. The Linen Hall remains in the Canongate; but the apartments of the bank are removed to a lane on the south side of the High street, above what was called the Nether-bow port.\n\n\"Promissory notes, payable on demand, have also been long issued in Edinburgh by a private banking house, that of Sir William Forbes, Sir James Hunter, and Company; and their notes have possessed a most extensive circulation.\n\n\"Besides these there are several private banking houses of great reputation in Edinburgh, which do not issue promissory notes for small sums payable on demand, but which carry on the other branches of the banking trade, by transmitting money, discounting bills, and accommodating individuals with cash accounts.\"\n\nIt now remains only to speak something of the religious and civil establishments of this metropolis. The highest of the former is the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, who meet here annually in the month of May, in an aisle of the church of St Giles fitted up on purpose for them. The throne is filled by a commissioner from his majesty, but he neither debates nor votes. He calls them together, and dissolves them at the appointed time in the name of the king; but they call and dissolve themselves in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. This assembly consists of 350 members chosen out of the various presbyteries throughout the kingdom; and the debates are often very interesting and eloquent. This is the supreme ecclesiastical court in Scotland, to which appeals lie from the inferior ones.\n\nThe ecclesiastical court next in dignity to the assembly is the Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale, who meet in the same place in April and November; and next to them is the Presbytery of Edinburgh. These meet on the last Wednesday of every month, and are trustees on the fund for ministers widows. They have a hall in Scott's close, where there is a good picture of Dr Webster by Martin, which was put up at the expense of the trustees, out of gratitude for the trouble he took in planning and fully establishing the fund.\n\nThe Society for propagating Christian Knowledge in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, was established a body corporate by Queen Anne in the year 1709, for the purpose of erecting schools to instruct poor children in the principles of Christianity, as well as in reading and writing. The society have a hall in Warriston's close where their business is transacted. From time to time they have received large contributions, which have always been very properly applied; and for much the same purpose his majesty gives £1000 annually to the general assembly of the church of Scotland, which is employed by a committee of their number for instructing the poor Highlanders in the principles of the Christian religion.\n\nThe Erse church at Edinburgh was built about 30 years ago by subscriptions for the same laudable purpose. Great numbers of people resort to the metropolis from the Highlands, who understand no other language but their own, and consequently have no opportunity of instruction without it; and a most remarkable proof of the benefit they have received from it is, that though the church is capable of holding 1000 people, yet it is not large enough for those who apply for seats. The minister has £100 per annum arising from the seat rents, and holds communion with the church of Scotland. The establishment was promoted by William Dickson dyer in Edinburgh.\n\nWith regard to the political constitution of Edinburgh, the town council have the direction of all public affairs.\nThe ordinary council consists only of 25 persons; but the council ordinary and extraordinary, of 33. The whole is composed of merchants and tradesmen, whose respective powers and interests are so interwoven, that a balance is preserved between the two bodies. The members of the town council are partly elected by the members of the 14 incorporations, and they partly choose their own successors. The election is made in the following manner: First, a list or list of six persons is made out by each incorporation; from which number, the deacon belonging to the incorporation must be chosen. These lists are then laid before the ordinary council of 25, who \"shorten the lists,\" by expunging one half of the names from each; and from the three remaining ones the deacon is to be chosen. When this election is over, the new deacons are presented to the ordinary council, who choose six of them to be members of their body, and the six deacons of last year then walk off. The council of 25 next proceed to the election of three merchant and two trades councillors. The members of council, who now amount to 33 in number, then make out lists, from which the lord provost, dean of guild, treasurer, and bailies, must be chosen. The candidates for each of these offices are three in number; and the election is made by the 30 members of council already mentioned, joined to the eight extraordinary council deacons.\n\nThe lord provost of Edinburgh, who is styled right honourable, is high sheriff, coroner, and admiral, within the city and liberties, and the town, harbour, and road of Leith. He has also a jurisdiction in matters of life and death. He is preses of the convention of royal boroughs, colonel of the trained bands, commander of the city guard and of Edinburgh jail. In the city he has the precedence of all the great officers of state and of the nobility; walking on the right hand of the king or of his majesty's commissioner; and has the privilege of having a sword and mace carried before him. Under him are four magistrates called bailies, whose office is much the same with that of aldermen in London. There is also a dean of guild, who has the charge of the public buildings, and without whose warrant no house nor building can be erected within the city. He has a council to consult with, a nominal treasurer, who formerly had the keeping of the town's money, which is now given to the chamberlain. These seven are elected annually; who with the seven of the former year, three merchants and two trades councillors, and 14 deacons or preses of incorporated trades, making in all 33, form the council of the city, and have the sole management and disposal of the city revenues; by which means they have the disposal of places to the amount of 20,000l. annually. Formerly the provost was also an officer in the Scots parliament. The magistrates are sheriffs-depute and justices of the peace; and the town council are also patrons for all the churches in Edinburgh, patrons of the university, and electors of the city's representative in parliament. They have besides a very ample jurisdiction both civil and criminal. They are superiors of the Canongate, Portsburgh, and Leith; and appoint over these certain of their own number, who are called baron bailies: but the person who presides over Leith has the title of admiral because he hath there a jurisdiction over maritime affairs.\n\nThe baron bailies appoint one or two of the inhabitants of their respective districts to be their substitutes, and these are called resident bailies. They hold courts in absence of the baron bailies, for petty offences and diffusing civil causes of little moment.\n\nNo city in the world affords greater security to the inhabitants in their persons and properties than Edinburgh. Robberies are here very rare, and street murder hardly known in the memory of man; so that a person may walk the streets at any hour of the night in perfect security. This is in a great measure owing to the town guard. This institution originated from the consternation into which the citizens were thrown after the guard battle at Flowden. At that time, the town council commanded the inhabitants to assemble in defence of the city, and every fourth man to be on duty each night. This introduced a kind of personal duty for the defence of the town, called watching and warding; by which the trading part of the inhabitants were obliged in person to watch alternately, in order to prevent or suppress occasional disturbances. This, however, becoming in time extremely inconvenient, the town council, in 1648, appointed a body of 60 men to be raised; the captain of which was to have a monthly pay of 11l. 2s. 3d., two lieutenants of 2l. each, two sergeants of 1l. 5s. and the private men of 15s. each. No regular fund was established for defraying this expense: the consequence of which was, that the old method of watching and warding was resumed, but the people on whom this service devolved were now become so relaxed in their discipline, that the magistrates were threatened with having the king's troops quartered in the city if they did not appoint a sufficient guard. On this 40 men were raised in 1679, and in 1682 the number was increased to 158. After the Revolution, the town council complained of the guard as a grievance, and requested parliament that it might be removed. Their request was immediately granted, and the old method of watching and warding was renewed. This, however, was now so intolerable, that the very next year they applied to parliament for leave to raise 126 men for the defence of the city, and to tax the citizens for their payment. This being granted, the corps was raised which still continues under the name of the town guard. At present the establishment consists of three officers and about 90 men, who mount guard by turns. The officers have a lieutenant's pay; the sergeants, corporals, drummers, and common soldiers, the same with those of the army. Their arms are the same with those of the king's forces; but when called upon to quell mobs, they use Lochaber axes, a part of the ancient Scottish armour now in use only among themselves.\n\nThe militia or trained band of the city consist of 16 companies of 100 men each. They were in use to trained turn out every king's birthday; but only the officers' bands now remain, who are chosen annually. They consist of 16 captains and as many lieutenants and ensigns; the provost, as has already been mentioned, being the colonel.\n\nThe town guard are paid chiefly by a tax on the trading people; these being the only persons formerly subject to watching and warding. This tax, how-\nEdinburgh, ever, amounts only to £1250l., and as the expense of the guard amounts to £1400l., the magistrates are obliged to defray the additional charge by other means.\n\nBut in the year 1805, in consequence of a new system of police being established, the city guard was reduced to one lieutenant, two sergeants, two corporals, two drummers, and thirty men, the lord provost for the time being to be captain, without pay, and the company to be armed and clothed at the expense of the city, but their pay to be defrayed out of the general fund raised under the new police act; and the duty of this company is to attend upon his majesty's commissioner to the general assembly of the church of Scotland, the magistrates and town council, the supreme courts of justice, and to act in general for the support of the new system of police.\n\nThe system of police above alluded to, was established in 1805 by act of parliament, under the authority of which the city and suburbs are divided into six districts or wards for the more convenient execution of the purposes to which the act extends. The regulations included under this system of police relate to cleaning and lighting the streets and passages in the city and suburbs, apprehending and punishing vagrants and disorderly persons, suppressing common begging, preventing nuisances and obstructions, and for other purposes connected with the preservation of peace and good order. The management of the whole affairs under this system of police is entrusted to the general and resident commissioners. The general commissioners appointed by the act, are, the lord provost and magistrates of the city of Edinburgh, with the lord president of the court of session, the lord justice clerk, the lord chief baron of the court of exchequer, the law officers of the crown, and several other public characters, in conjunction with the whole resident commissioners in the different wards. There are to be seven resident commissioners in each ward, the two highest in the list to go out, and two others to be elected in their stead annually; the commissioners to be occupiers of houses valued at twenty pounds sterling of free rent yearly, excepting in two wards, where occupying a house of twelve pounds rent is a sufficient qualification. In each ward there are to be elected by the resident commissioners, with the approbation of the general commissioners, an inspector, and such a number of officers of police and watchmen as may be necessary, the officers of police and watchmen upon duty having the authority and possessing the powers given by the law of Scotland to the office of constable.\n\nThe general commissioners have the power of choosing a superintendent or master of police for the whole city and suburbs included in the act, and to appoint a clerk who shall do the duty of clerk to the general meetings, as well as to the court of police to be held by the superintendent. The general commissioners also are authorized to fix the number of officers and watchmen to be employed in the different wards. The superintendent of police having been appointed by the commissioners, is to receive from the sheriff depute of the county of Edinburgh the authority of a sheriff substitute, as well as a commission of sheriff depute within the city and liberties from the lord provost who is principal sheriff within these bounds, that the superintendent acting as master or judge of police may have the full powers of a magistrate in the execution of his duty. By the powers with which the superintendent is invested, he may commit offenders to the tolbooth or to bridewell for a period not exceeding 60 days, and impose fines for offences not exceeding 40 shillings sterling, and give judgment in damages for any sum not exceeding three pounds sterling with the expenses in either case. From the sentences of the superintendent there is no appeal to the sheriff depute of the county, or to the lord provost as sheriff principal within the city. The superintendent of police is also the billet-master within his bounds, and the inspectors of wards are billet-masters within their several wards. The inspectors also have the powers of procurator fiscaux with respect to all prosecutions for offences committed within their bounds.\n\nThe expenses necessary to carry the above act into execution, are to be defrayed from a fund raised by assessment on the inhabitants of three per cent. on the free rent of houses, shops or warehouses, and for the expenses of clothing and alimenting the persons committed to bridewell a farther assessment not exceeding ½ per cent. of the free rent of such houses, &c. For the purpose of ascertaining rents, surveyors are appointed; and if the rent fixed by them should be over-rated, an appeal may be made to a committee of the general commissioners specially appointed.\n\nThe office of the superintendent of police is in the Lawnmarket. The operation of the act has only continued for a few months (September 1805) and although some complaints have been made of its rigorous execution, arising probably from such unavoidable and unforeseen circumstances as frequently occur in the establishment of a new system, yet there is every reason to hope, that it will prove highly beneficial for the preservation of peace and good order in the city and suburbs over which it extends.\n\nThe number of inhabitants in the city of Edinburgh is somewhat uncertain, and has been very variously calculated. By a survey made in the year 1775, it appears that the number of families in the city, Canongate, and other suburbs, and the town of Leith, amounted to 13,806. The difficulty therefore is to fix the number of persons in a family. Dr Price fixes this number at 4½; Mr Maitland, at 5½; and Mr Arnot, at 6½; so that, according to this last gentleman, the whole number of inhabitants is 82,836; to which he thinks 1,400 more may be added for those in the garrison, hospitals, &c.\n\nThe following table exhibits a comparative view of the population of the city of Edinburgh and suburbs taken in different years. The last enumeration made in 1801 by act of parliament is supposed to be considerably defective in the real amount of the inhabitants, as an alarm was industriously spread that it was done with a view to the imposition of new taxes. This, it appeared, induced many to conceal the names and number of the individuals in their families,\n\n| Year | Population |\n|------|------------|\n| 1678 | 35,500     |\n| 1722 | 40,420     |\n| 1755 | 57,195     |\n| 1775 | 70,430     |\n| 1791 | 84,886     |\n| 1801 | 82,560     |\n\nThere\nThere are in Edinburgh 14 incorporations, capable of choosing their own deacons, viz. The royal college of surgeons; the corporations of goldsmiths, skinners, furriers, hammermen, wrights and masons, tailors, bakers, butchers, shoemakers, weavers, waukers, bonnet-makers, and merchant company.\n\nThe markets of Edinburgh are plentifully supplied with all sorts of provisions. Fresh butcher meat, as well as fowl and fish, if the weather permit, may be had every day; and no city can be better supplied with garden stuffs. The Edinburgh strawberries particularly are remarkably large and fine. A striking instance of the plenty of provisions with which Edinburgh is supplied was observed in the year 1779, when several large fleets, all of them in want of necessaries, arrived in the Forth, to the amount of about 500 sail, and having on board at least 20,000 men; yet the increased consumption of provisions, which certainly ensued upon the arrival of so many strangers, made not the least increase in the rate of the markets, insomuch that several victualling ships sent down by the navy board returned without opening their hatches. The city mills are let to the corporation of bakers in Edinburgh; and the bread made in the city is remarkable for its goodness.\n\nEdinburgh is supplied with water brought for some miles in pipes, and lodged in two reservoirs, from whence it is distributed through the city both to public wells and private families. A revenue accrues to the town from the latter, which must undoubtedly increase in proportion as the city extends in magnitude.\n\nThere are but few merchants in Edinburgh, most of them residing at the port of Leith; so that the support of the city depends on the consumption of the necessaries as well as the superfluities of life. There are five different sorts of people on whom the shopkeepers, publicans, and different trades depend: 1. The people of the law, who are a very respectable body in the city. 2. The number of young people of both sexes who come to town for their education, many of the parents of whom come along with them. 3. The country gentlemen, gentlemen of the army and navy, and people who have made their fortunes abroad, &c., all of whom come to attend the public diversions, or to spend their time in such a manner as is most agreeable to them. 4. The vast concourse of travellers from all parts. 5. Most of the money drawn for the rents of country gentlemen is circulated among the bankers or other agents.\n\nAt Edinburgh there are excellent manufactures of linen and cambrics; there are also manufactures of paper in the neighbourhood, and printing is carried on very extensively. But for some time the capital branch about Edinburgh has been building: which has gone on, and still continues to do so, with such rapidity, that the city has been increased exceedingly in its extent; and it is not uncommon to see a house built in a few months, and even inhabited before the roof is quite finished.\n\nEDINBURGHSHIRE, or MIDLOTHIAN, is bounded on the north by the frith of Forth and the river Amond, which divides it from Westlothian or Linlithgow; on the east by Haddingtonshire; on the south by the counties of Lanark, Peebles, and Berwick; and at the west corner by part of the county of Linlithgow, Edinburghshire. It extends about 30 miles in length, and its breadth varies from 16 to 20; containing in all about 360 square miles, or 230,400 English acres. The surface of the country is pleasant, having much level ground, interspersed with some hills, watered with many agreeable streams, and sheltered and decorated with woods. The arable land, which may be calculated about one third of the whole, is in a state of high cultivation, and affords excellent crops. The two great ridges of hills which pass through the county, called the Moorfoot and the Pentland hills, afford pasture; the former is far superior in quality to the latter: in these hills it is generally remarked that the north side of the hill is the finest and best pasture, contrary to what we should be apt, a priori, to imagine. Like the other parts of the country, this district experiences the consequences of an insulated situation; being subject to that instability and uncertainty, that the climate in one day exhibits the weather of every season of the year; the cold easterly winds in the spring are exceedingly detrimental to fruit, and in autumn the hours or mists from the sea, are apt to whiten and wither the corns before they are ripe. The immediate vicinity of many of the farms to the metropolis affords the opportunity of procuring street dung easily, and has been of material advantage in improving the land; it has this disadvantage, however, that by long continuance the fields become very full of weeds, particularly the fleawort or wild mustard; it is imagined that this would be obviated by throwing the field out in pasture for a few years, and afterwards liming it well before ploughing. The chief rivers of the county of Edinburgh, are the North and South Esk, which, uniting, fall into the frith of Forth at the town of Musselburgh; the Amond, which falls into the same frith at the village of Cramond, and the water of Leith, which forms the harbour of that town: all of these abound with trout. The islands of Inchkeith and Cramond, and of Inchmickery, also belong to this county. Few districts of Scotland afford more minerals than the county of Edinburgh; it abounds everywhere with coal, limestone, and freestone of superior quality; and iron ore of different species is very abundant; compound stone, called petuntse, is found in great quantity in the Pentland hills, and has been successfully employed in the manufacture of British porcelain. In the parish of Raths is found a fine species of whetstone or hone; and in the parish of Duddingston, at Brickfield, is found clay, fit for making earthen ware. The hills are composed of porphyry and basaltic whinstone, which in many places, particularly Arthur's Seat and Craig-Lockhart, exhibit regular forms. Near Glencroft, and in the Braid-hills, are found great veins of the heavy spar, or barites, which is often an attendant on metallic veins, especially of lead and copper. All the hills contain specimens of zeolites, jaspers, spars, &c. From the vicinity to the metropolis, numerous seats of nobility and gentry are everywhere to be seen. Besides the city of Edinburgh and its suburbs, in which we may include the town of Leith, this county contains several large towns and villages, as Dalkeith, Musselburgh, Liberton, Lasswade, and Gilmerton, and is divided into 31 parishes, of which the following is the population at two different periods.\nEDITOR, a person of learning, who has the care of an impression of any work, particularly that of an ancient author; thus, Erasmus was a great editor; the Louvain doctors, Scaliger, Petavius, F. Sirmond, Bishop Walton, Mr Hearne, Mr Ruddiman, &c. are likewise famous editors.\n\nEDOM, or ESAU, the son of Isaac and brother of Jacob. The name of Edom, which signifies red, was given him, either because he sold his birthright to Jacob for a mess of pottage, or by reason of the colour of his hair and complexion. Idumea derives its name from Edom, and is often called in Scripture the land of Edom. See the next article.\n\nEDOM, or IDUMEA, in Ancient Geography, a district of Arabia Petraea; a great part also of the south of Judaea was called Idumaea, because occupied by the Idumeans, upon the Jewish captivity, quite to Hebron. But the proper Edom or Idumea appears not to have been very extensive, from the march of the Israelites, in which they compassed it on the south easterly, till they came to the country of the Moabites. Within this compass lies Mount Hor, where Aaron died; marching from which the Israelites fought with King Arad the Canaanite, who came down the wilderness against them (Moses). And this is the extent of the Idumaea Propria lying to the south of the Dead Sea; but in Solomon's time extending to the Red sea, Edmund, Education.\n\n(1 Kings ix. 26.)\n\nEDMUND I. and II. See (History of) ENGLAND.\n\nEDUCATION may be defined, that series of means by which the human understanding is gradually enlightened, and the dispositions of the human heart are formed and called forth between earliest infancy and the period when we consider ourselves as qualified to take a part in active life, and, ceasing to direct our views solely to the acquisition of new knowledge or the formation of new habits, are content to act upon the principles which we have already acquired.\n\nThis comprehends the circumstances of the child in particular regard to local situation, and the manner in which the necessaries and conveniences of life are supplied to him; the degree of care and tenderness with which he is nurtured in infancy; the examples set before him by parents, preceptors, and companions; the degree of restraint or licentiousness to which he is accustomed; the various bodily exercises, languages, arts, and sciences, which are taught him, and the method and order in which they are communicated; the moral and religious principles which are instilled into his mind; and even the state of health which he enjoys during that period of life.\n\nIn different periods of society, in different climates, and under different forms of government, various institutions have naturally prevailed in the education of youth; and even in every different family, the children are educated in a different manner, according to the differences in the situation, dispositions, and abilities, of the parents. The education of youth being an object of the highest importance, has not only engaged the anxious care of parents, but has likewise often attracted the notice of the legislator and the philosopher. What our readers have therefore a right to expect from us on this article is, 1st, That we give an account of some of the most remarkable institutions for the education of youth which have been legally established or have accidentally prevailed among various nations and in various periods of society. 2ndly, That we also give some account of the most judicious and the most fanciful plans which have been proposed by those authors who have written on the subject of education. And, lastly, That we venture to present them with the result of our own observations and recollections on this important head.\n\nIn the infancy of society, very little attention can be paid to the education of youth. Before men have risen above a savage state, they are almost entirely creatures of appetite and instinct. The impulse of appetite hurries them to propagate their species. The power of instinctive affection is often, though not always, so strong as to compel them to preserve and nurture the fruit of their embraces. But even when their wants are not so urgent, nor their hearts so destitute of feeling as to prompt them to abandon their new-born infants to the ferocity of wild beasts or the severity of the elements, yet still their uncomfortable and precarious situation, their ignorance of the laws of nature, their deficiency of moral and religious principles, and their want of dexterity or skill in any of the arts of life; all these together must render them unable to regulate the education of their children with much attention and sagacity. They may relate to them the wild.\nEducation will inculcate tales, in which all their notions concerning superior beings, and all their knowledge of the circumstances and transactions of their ancestors, are continued; they may teach them to bend the bow, to point their arrows, to hollow the trunk of a tree into a canoe, and to trace the almost imperceptible path of an enemy or a wild beast over dreary mountains or through intricate forests; but they cannot impress their minds with just ideas concerning their social relations, or concerning their obligations to a Supreme Being, the framer and upholder of nature; they teach them not to repress their irregular appetites, not to restrain the fancies of passion when they exceed just bounds or are improperly directed; nor can they inform their understandings with very accurate or extensive views of the phenomena of nature. Besides, they know not how far implicit obedience to his parents' commands is to be required of the boy or youth, nor how far he ought to be left to the guidance of his own reason or humour. Among savages the influence of parental authority soon expires, nor is the parent solicitous to maintain it. As the eagle expels his young from his lofty nest as soon as they become able to support themselves in the air; so the savage generally ceases to care for his child, or assume any power over him, as soon as he becomes capable of procuring the means necessary for his own subsistence. Savages being scarce connected by any social ties, being unacquainted with the restraint of civil laws, and being unable to contribute in any great degree to the maintenance or protection of one another; each individual among them, as soon as he attains that degree of strength and dexterity which may enable him to procure the necessaries of life, stands single and alone, independent on others, and forming to submit to their commands. The parent, conscious of his inability to confer any important benefits on his child, after he has advanced even a very short way towards manhood, no longer endeavors to control his actions; and the child proud of his independence, scarce submits to ask his parents advice. And even before his reaching this period of independence, so few are the benefits which parents can bestow (being confined to supplying the necessaries of life, and communicating the knowledge of a very few of the rudest simplest arts), that children regard them with little deference, nor do they always insist on implicit submission. Want of natural affection, and consciousness of superior strength, often prompt the parent to abuse the weakness of his child. Yet though small the skill with which the savage can cultivate the understanding or form the dispositions of his child, though few the arts which he can teach him, and though not very respectful or submissive the obedience or deferences which he requires: yet there is one quality of mind which the savage is more careful to inspire than those parents who are directed in educating their children by all the lights of civilized society. That quality indeed is absolutely necessary to fit the savage for his situation; without it, the day on which he ceased to enjoy the protection of his parents would most probably be the last day of his life: That quality is Fortitude. We may perhaps think, that the hardships to which the young savage is from the period of his birth unavoidably exposed, might be enough to inspire him with fortitude; but as if these were insufficient, other means are applied to inspire him with Education, what the Stoics have regarded as the first of virtues. He is compelled to submit to many hardships unnecessary, but from a view to this. Children are therefore called to emulate each other in bearing the severest torments. Charlevoix relates, that he has seen a boy and girl bind their arms together, place a burning coal between them, and try who could longest endure without thinking the pain to which they thus exposed themselves.\n\nStill, however, the young savage owes his education rather to nature and to the circumstances in which he is placed, and the accidents which befell him, than to nature and the kindness or prudence of his parents. Nature has circumstantially endowed him with certain powers of understanding, for his sentiments, sensations, and bodily organs; he has been educated, placed in certain circumstances, and is exposed to a certain train of events; and by these means chiefly, not by the watchful industry of instructors, does he become such as he appears when he has reached the years of maturity.\n\nBut man was not designed by his wife and beneficent Creator to remain long in a savage state; the principles of his nature incline him to social life. Reason, state of distinguishing the superior advantages to be enjoyed in society, concurs with the social principle in his breast, in prompting him to seek the company and conversation of others of the human race. When men enter into society, they always unite their powers and talents, in a certain degree, for the common advantage of the social body. In consequence of this, laws come in time to be instituted; new arts are invented; progress is made in the knowledge of nature; moral duties are better understood and defined; juster ideas are gradually acquired of all our social relations; friendship, love, filial, parental, and conjugal affection, all are heightened and refined. All these advantages do not instantly result from men's entering into a social state; the improvement of the human mind, and the civilization of society, are gradual and progressive: But as it is natural for men to unite in a social state, so it is no less natural for society to be gradually improved and civilized till it attain a high degree of perfection and refinement.\n\nWhen men have attained to such knowledge and improvement as to be entitled to a more honourable appellation than that of savages, one part of their improvements generally confers in their becoming more judicious and attentive in directing the education of their youth. They have now acquired ideas of dependence and subordination; they have arts to teach, and knowledge to communicate; they have moral principles to instil; and have formed notions of their relation and obligations to superior powers, which they are desirous that their children should also entertain. Their affection to their offspring is now also more tender and constant. We observe at present in that state of society in which we live, that the poor who can scarce earn for themselves and their children the necessaries of life, are generally less susceptible of parental affection, in all its anxious tenderness, than the rich, or those whom Providence hath placed in easy circumstances; and we may make use of this fact in reasoning concerning the different degrees of the same affection felt by the savage and the member of a civilized socie-\nThe savage may be considered as the poor man, who with difficulty procures the necessaries of life even for himself; the other, as the man in affluent circumstances, who is more at leisure to listen to the voice of tender and generous affection.\n\nIn this improved state of society, the education of youth is viewed as an object of highest importance. The child is dearer to his parent; and the parent is now more capable of cultivating the understanding and rectifying the dispositions of his child. His knowledge of nature, and his dexterity in the arts of life, give him more authority over a child than what the savage can possess. Obedience is now enforced, and a system of education is adopted; by means of which the parent attempts to form his child for acting a part in social life. Perhaps the legislature interferes; the education of the youth is regarded as highly worthy of public concern: it is considered that the foolish fondness or the unnatural caprice of parents may, in the rising generation, blast the hopes of the state.\n\nIn reviewing ancient history, we find that this actually took place in several of the most celebrated governments of antiquity. The Persians, the Cretans, and the Lacedemonians, were all of them too anxious to form their youth for discharging the duties of citizens to intrust the education of the children solely to the parents. Public establishments were formed among those nations, and a series of institutions enacted, for carrying on and regulating the education of their youths: Not such as our European universities, in which literary knowledge being the sole object of pursuit, the student is maintained solely at his parents expense, and attends only if his parents think proper to send him; but of a very different nature, and on a much more enlarged plan.\n\nThe Persians, according to the elegant and accurate account delivered by Xenophon in the beginning of his Cyropaedia, divided the whole body of their citizens into four orders; the boys, the youth, the full-grown men, and those who were advanced beyond that period of life during which military service was required. For each of these orders particular halls were appropriated. Each of them was subjected to the inspection of twelve rulers. The adults and the superannuated were required to employ themselves in the performance of particular duties, suitable to their age, their abilities, and their experience; while the boys and the youth were engaged in such a course of education as seemed likely to render them worthy and useful citizens.\n\nThe boys were not employed, in their places of instruction, in acquiring literary accomplishments; for to such the Persians were strangers. They went thither to learn justice, temperance, modesty; to shoot the bow, and to launch the javelin. The virtues and the bodily exercises were what the Persians laboured to teach their children. These were the direct, and not subordinate, purposes of their system of education. The matters used to spend the greatest part of the day in dispensing justice to their scholars; who carried before them actions for thefts, robberies, frauds, and other such grounds of complaint against one another.—Such were the means by which the Persians endeavoured to instil, even in early youth, a regard for the laws of natural equity, and for the institutions of their country.\n\nTill the age of 16 or 17, the boys were baffled in acquiring those parts of education. At that period they ceased to be considered as boys, and were raised to the order of the youths. After they entered this order, the same views were still attended to in the carrying on of their education. They were still inured to bodily labour. They were to attend the magistrates, and to be always ready to execute their commands. They were led out frequently to the chase; and on such expeditions they were always headed by the king, as in time of war. Here they were taught to expose themselves fearlessly to danger; to suffer, without repining or complaint, hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and to content themselves with the coarsest, simplest fare, for relieving the necessities of nature. In short, whether at home or out on some hunting expedition, they were constantly employed in acquiring new skill and dexterity in military exercises, new vigour of mind and body, and confirmed habits of temperance, fortitude, abstinence, patience, patriotism, and noble integrity.\n\nAfter spending ten years in this manner, their course of education was completed; they were admitted into the class of the adults, and were deemed qualified for public offices. It must not escape our notice, that the citizens were not compelled to send their children to pass through this course of education in the public halls; but none except such as passed through this course of education were capable of civil power, or admitted to participate in public offices or public honours.\n\nSuch are the outlines of that system of education which Xenophon represents as publicly established among the Persians. Were we able to preserve in a translation all the manly and graceful simplicity of that enchanting author, we would have offered to the perusal of our readers the picture in which he has described it: but conscious of being inadequate to that task, we have presumed only to extract the information which it contains.\n\nPerhaps, however, this system of education did not sufficiently satisfy as the eloquent disciple of Socrates describes it among that rude and simple people. On other occasions he has commemorated such instances of their barbarity, as would tempt us to think them incapable of so much order and so much wisdom. Perhaps, as the discoverers of the new world have sometimes conferred on the inhabitants of that hemisphere, in the accounts of them with which they entertained their friends in Europe, amazing degrees of moral and political wisdom, of skill and dexterity in the arts, of industry and valour, which those uncivilized children of nature were afterwards found not to possess; so the Athenian philosopher has also ascribed to the Persians prudence and attention in regulating the education of their youth beyond what people in so rude a state can possibly exert.\n\nBut if we examine into the principles on which this system of education proceeds, without concerning ourselves whether it once actually prevailed among the Persians, or is the production of the fine imagination of Xenophon, we will find it peculiarly suitable for a nation just emerging from the rudeness and ignorance of barbarity to a knowledge of social and civil relations, and of the duties connected with such relations. They have sacrificed their independence to obtain the comfort\nEducation, comfort and security of a social state. They now glory in the appellation of citizens, and are desirous to discharge the duties incumbent on a citizen. They must inform their children in the nature of their social relations, and impress them with habits of discharging their social duties; otherwise the society will soon be dissolved, and their posterity will fall back into the same wild miserable state from which they have emerged. But perhaps the circumstances, or abilities, or dispositions of individuals, render them unequal to this weighty task. It becomes therefore naturally an object of public care. The whole social body find it necessary to deliberate on the most proper means for discharging it aright. A plan of education is then formed; the great object of which is, to fit the youth for discharging the duties of citizens. Arts and sciences are hitherto almost wholly unknown; and all that can be communicated to the youth is only a skill in such exercises as are necessary for their procuring subsistence, or defending themselves against human enemies or beasts of prey; and habits of performing those duties, the neglect of which must be fatal to the society or the individual.\n\nSuch is the system of education which we have surveyed as established among the Persians; and perhaps we may now be less suspicious than before of Xenophon's veracity. It appears natural for a people who have reached that degree of civilization in which they are described, and have not yet advanced farther, to institute such an establishment. Some such establishment also appears necessary to prevent the society from falling back into their former barbarity. It will prevent their virtue and valour from decaying, though it may perhaps at the same time prevent them from making any very rapid progress in civilization and refinement. Yet the industry, the valour, the integrity, and the patriotism which it inspires, must necessarily produce some favourable change in their circumstances; and that change in their circumstances will be followed by a change in their system of education.\n\nThe Cretans, too, the wisdom of whose laws is so much celebrated in the records of antiquity, had a public establishment for the education of their youth. Minos, whom they revered as their great legislator, was also the founder of that establishment. Its tendency was similar to that of the course of education pursued among the Persians,—to form the soldier and the citizen. We cannot present our readers with a very particular or accurate account of it; but such as we have been able to procure from the best authorities we think it our duty to lay before them.\n\nThe Cretans were divided into three classes; the boys, the youth, and the adults. Between seven and seventeen years of age, the boy was employed in learning to shoot the bow, and in acquiring the knowledge of his duties as a man and a citizen, by listening to the conversation of the old men in the public halls, and observing their conduct. At the age of seven, he was conducted to the public halls to enter on this course of education. He was taught to expose himself boldly to danger and fatigue; to aspire after skill and dexterity in the use of arms and in the gymnastic exercises; to repeat the laws and hymns in honour of the gods. At the age of seventeen he was enrolled among the youth. Here his education was still continued on the same plan. He was to exercise himself among his equals in hunting, wrestling, and the military exercises; and while thus engaged, his spirits were roused and animated by strains of martial music played on such instruments as were then in use among the inhabitants of Crete. One part of the education of the Cretan youth, in which they were particularly desirous to excel, was the Pyrrhic dance; which was the invention of a Cretan, and consisted of various military evolutions performed to the sound of instruments.\n\nSuch were the principles and arts in which the Cretan legislature directed the youth to be instructed. This course of education could not be directed or superintended by the parent. It was public, and carried on with a view to fit the boy for discharging the duties of a citizen when he should attain to manhood.\n\nIt is easy to see, that such a system of education must have been instituted in the infancy of society, before many arts had been invented, or the distinctions of rank had arisen; at a time when men subsisted in a considerable degree by hunting, and when the intercourse of nations was on such a footing, that war, instead of being occasional, was the great business of life. Such a system of life would then naturally take place, even through no sage legislator had arisen to regulate and enforce it.\n\nLycurgus, the celebrated lawgiver of Lacedemonians, thought it necessary to direct the education of youth in a particular manner, in order to prepare them for paying a strict obedience to his laws. He regarded children as belonging more properly to the state than to their parents, and wished that patriotism should be still more carefully cherished in their breasts than filial affection. The spirit of his system of education was pretty similar to that of those which we have just viewed as subsisting among the Persians and the Cretans.\n\nAs soon as a boy was born, he was submitted to the inspection of the elders of that tribe to which his parents belonged. If he was well shaped, strong, and vigorous, they directed him to be brought up, and assigned a certain portion of land for his maintenance. If he was deformed, weak, and sickly, they condemned him to be exposed, as not being likely ever to become a useful citizen. If the boy appeared worthy of being brought up, he was intrusted to the care of his parents till he attained the age of seven years; but his parents were strictly charged not to spoil either his mind or his bodily constitution by foolish tenderness. Probably, too, the state of their manners was at that time such as not to render the injunction peculiarly necessary.\n\nAt the age of seven, however, he was introduced to a public class, consisting of all the boys of the same age. Their education was committed to masters appointed by the state; and what was chiefly inculcated on them in the course of it, was submissive obedience and respect to their superiors; quickness and brevity in their conversation, and replies to such questions as were put to them; dexterity and address in performing what was commanded them; and firmness and patience in bearing every pain or hardship to which they might be exposed. One of the means used to form them to habits of activity and address, was to permit,\nEducation, nay, to direct them to commit little acts of theft; which, if they performed them so dexterously as to avoid detection, they might afterwards boast of as noble exploits: but if detected in such enterprises, the awkward artless boy was exposed both to punishment and disgrace. To avoid the punishment and disgrace incurred by being detected in an act of theft, the Spartan boy would often suffer with unshrinking fortitude the severest torments. It is related of one of them, that rather than be discovered with a young fox under his cloak, which he had stolen, he suffered the little animal to tear open his bowels. Not content with beholding the children suffer by submitting voluntarily to such hardships, the Spartans also endeavoured to form them to fortitude, by whipping them on their religious festivals, sometimes with such severity that they expired under the lash. The Lacedemonian youth were also taught such bodily exercises, and the use of such warlike weapons, as were necessary to render them expert and skilful soldiers.\n\nThey too, as well as the Cretans and Persians, among whom we have seen similar modes of education adopted, were to be citizens and soldiers; not husbandmen, mechanics, artists, merchants, &c. Their mode of education, therefore, was simple and uniform. Its aim was, to make them acquainted with the nature of their social duties, and to form them to such vigour of body and such firmness of mind as might render them fit for the station in which they were to be placed, and adequate to the part which they were to act. This establishment for education was perfectly consistent with the other parts of that legislature which was instituted by Lycurgus. Youth educated among the Lacedemonians could hardly fail to become worthy members of that singular republic. Let us not however regard the Spartans as singularly inhumane in their treatment of youth. Let us recollect, in imagination, to that period in the progress of society from rudeness to refinement, which they had reached when Lycurgus arose among them. What were then their circumstances, their arts and manners, their moral principles, and military discipline? Not very different from those which the laws of Lycurgus rendered so long stationary among them. He, no doubt, rectified some abuses, and introduced greater order and equality. But man is not to be so easily metamorphosed into a new form. As you cannot, at once, raise an acorn to a venerable oak; so neither will you be able to change the savage at once, into the citizen. All the art or wisdom of Lycurgus, even though assisted by all the influence of the prophetic Apollo, could never have established his laws among his countrymen, had not their character and circumstances previously disposed them to receive them. But, grant this, and you must, of consequence, allow, that, what to us may appear cruel and inhumane, must have affected their feelings in a different manner. The change introduced in the treatment of youth by the establishment of this system of education was probably recommended by its being more humane than what before prevailed. Corrupted as are our manners, and effeminate our modes of education; yet we would not perhaps act wisely in laying them aside, to adopt in their stead those of ancient Sparta. But the Spartan education was peculiarly well fitted to form citizens for the republic of Lycurgus; it was happily adapted to Education, the state of society in which it was introduced. And, if we should inquire by what means Lycurgus was enabled to fix the arts, the manners, and in short the civilization of his country, for so long a period, in a stationary state; we would perhaps find reason to ascribe that effect to the public establishment which he instituted for the education of youth; to his confining the Spartan citizens to the profession of arms, and affixing all servile offices to the Helots; and to his prohibiting the use of gold and silver. Among these however his establishment for education occupies the chief place. Never was any state adorned with more patriotic citizens than those of Sparta. With them every private affection seemed to be swallowed up by the amor patriae: the love of their country was at least their ruling passion. Pedestrians being rejected when he offered himself a candidate for a seat among the council of three hundred, returned home, rejoicing that there were in Sparta no fewer than three hundred whom his countrymen found reason to regard as better citizens than himself. This was not a seeming joy, assumed to conceal the pain which he suffered from the disappointment; it was heartfelt and sincere. Such were the effects of their system of education.\n\nWhen we turn our eyes from the Persians, the Cretans, and the Spartans, to the other nations of antiquity; we nowhere behold so regular a system of public education. Among the Athenians and the Romans, the laws did not descend to regulate in so particular a manner the management of the youth. These nations gradually emerged from a state of the rudest barbarity, to that polished, enlightened, and civilized state which rendered them the glory and the wonder of the heathen world: but in no part of their progress from the one state to the other do we find any such establishment subsisting among them. So various, however, are the circumstances which form and diversify the character of nations, that we cannot reasonably conclude, because no such establishments existed among the Athenians and Romans, that therefore their existence was unnatural among those nations who possessed them. But though the education of youth was managed in a different manner among these and most other nations in the ancient world, than by public establishments, which detached children from the care of their parents; yet still it was everywhere regarded as an object of the highest importance. As the manners of mankind gradually improved to a state of refinement; as the invention of arts, and the discovery of science, gradually introduced opulence and luxury; connubial, parental, and filial affection gradually acquired greater strength and tenderness. Of consequence, children experienced more of their parents' care; and that care was directed to form them for acting a becoming part in life. According to the circumstances of each nation, the arts which they cultivated, and the form of government under which they lived; the knowledge which they sought to communicate to their children, and the habits which they endeavoured to impress upon them, were different from those of other nations: And again, according to the different circumstances, tempers, abilities, and dispositions of parents, even the children of each family were brought up in a manner different from that\nThe Athenians, the Romans, the Carthaginians, conducted each of them the education of their youth in a different manner, because they had each different objects in view. But having considered the most singular establishments for education which prevailed in the ancient world, it seems unnecessary for us to descend to a particular account of the manner which every nation, or fantastic individual, thought proper to pursue in bringing up their youth. It will probably be more useful and entertaining to our readers, if we next present them with a view of some of the most judicious or fanciful plans of education which have been proposed by the writers on that subject.\n\nOne of the most respectable writers on education among the ancients is the celebrated Quintilian. He taught rhetoric in Rome during the reign of Domitian, and under several of the other emperors. When he retired from the exercise of his employment as a teacher of rhetoric, he spent his leisure in the composition of a treatise, not merely on rhetoric, but on the most proper means for educating a boy so as to render him both an eloquent orator and a good man.\n\nIn that valuable treatise, he enters into a minute detail of all that appears to him most likely to conduce to those important ends.\n\nAs soon as the boy enters the world, he would have the greatest care to be used in selecting those who are to be placed about him. Let his nurse have no impediment of speech. It will be happy for him, if his parents be persons of sense and learning. Let his tutor, at least, possess these qualifications. As soon as he attains the distinct use of his organs of speech, let him be initiated in the first elements of literature. For as he is capable of distinguishing and remembering at a very early age; so his faculties cannot possibly be employed in a more advantageous manner. And even at this early period of life, let maxims of prudence and the first principles of morals be inculcated upon his mind by the books which are put into his hands, and even by the lines which he copies in learning the art of writing. The Greek language was to the Romans in the days of Quintilian, what the Latin and Greek and French are to us at present, an acquisition held indispensably necessary to those who aspired to a liberal education; and Quintilian judges it proper that the boy should begin his application to letters with the Greek language in preference to his mother tongue.\n\nThis judicious writer next examines a question which has been often agitated. Whether a domestic or a public education is liable to the fewest inconveniences, and likely to be attended with the greatest advantages? And he is of opinion, that in a domestic education the boy is in danger of being corrupted by injudicious fondness and evil example; is not roused by the spur of emulation; and is deprived of proper opportunities for acquiring a just idea of his own power, or that activity and dexterity which he will afterwards find so necessary when he comes to act a part in life: While in a public education, which was preferred by some of the most renowned nations of antiquity, the morals are not greatly exposed to corruption, emulation is roused, friendships are formed, all the powers of the mind are called forth to act with new vigour, and the youth is prepared for performing his part on the great theatre of the world. Quintilian, therefore, wishes that parents would place their children in public seminaries of education.\n\nWhen a boy is committed to a master's care, the master's attention must be first directed to discover his dispositions and the extent of his capacity. Of his capacity he will form a favourable judgment, not from his sprightliness, nor even from his quickness of apprehension, but from his modesty, docility, and virtuous dispositions. If the boy possesses these last qualifications, the master will rejoice in him, as likely to give him satisfaction and do him honour. According to his temper and dispositions, let the boy be treated with mildness or severity; but never let severity extend to blows. Let the boy be allured and led, by the most artful and insinuating treatment, to do his duty; there will then be no occasion to punish him for neglecting it.\n\nAs Quintilian's professed object was, not merely to give general directions for forming the heart and cultivating the understanding, but to form a particular character in life, the scholar and the orator; he finds it necessary to enter into minute details concerning the manner in which the boy is to be instructed in speaking, writing, grammar, and composition; of which it does not appear necessary for us to take particular notice in this place. Music and geometry, he thinks, ought to make a part of the young orator's studies; as being useful to render him accurate in reasoning, and capable of relishing the beauties of the poets. He is also of opinion, that the boy should not be confined to one branch of study, without being allowed to attempt others till he have made himself master of that. Let several parts of literature engage his attention by turns: let him dedicate a considerable portion of his time to them. He may thus acquire habits of industrious application which will remain with him through life.\n\nWith the tender attention of a good man, this sensible and elegant writer still accompanies his pupil through the course of his studies; anxiously insists that he be placed under a master distinguished for purity of morals, and for no mean abilities in his profession; directs his memory to be stored with the noblest passages of the poets, orators, and historians; and carefully diffuses and refutes those opinions which represent genius as above industry. The remaining part of his work being employed on the principles of rhetoric, without containing any thing on the subject of education in general, it is not necessary that we should here present an analysis of it to our readers. But since Quintilian was so distinguished, not only as a rhetorician, but as an instructor of youth, and displays so much good sense and so solid a judgment, formed on long experience, in whatever he advances on the subject of education; we could not, without extreme negligence, omit taking notice of him under this article, and affording our readers an opportunity of being instructed by listening to his sentiments on this head.\n\nThe name of John Milton is so much revered in Britain, that his sentiments on any subject are interesting. Treatise on Britons. His life was dedicated to study: During a part of it, he was employed in the task of instructing youth;\nEducation; and among his other works we find a treatise on education. He had himself been educated according to that plan which has long been established in the English universities; but with that mode of education he was not satisfied. The object of his directions is chiefly to form a scholar. He considered himself as qualified to exhibit a model of \"a better education, in extent and comprehension far more large, and yet of time far shorter, and of attainment far more certain, than any that had yet been in practice.\" The following is the substance of his treatise.\n\nAs the end of learning is to cultivate our understandings, and to rectify our dispositions; therefore the design of our applying to the study of languages cannot be merely that we may commit to memory the words of which they consist, or that we may acquire a knowledge of their analogy and structure; but that we may enrich our minds with the treasures of wisdom which they contain. But in the present modes of education this design does not appear to be kept in view. The learner of Latin is burdened with rules, and themes, and verses, and orations; but no care is taken to make him master of the valuable knowledge which the classics contain. And when he advances a little farther, he is driven into the thorny paths of logic and metaphysics. So, when his studies are completed, and he is considered as having received a liberal education, he is almost as destitute of real knowledge as when he first entered a school.\n\nBut to render learning truly beneficial, instead of the school and university education which youth at present receive, let the place of both school and university be supplied by an academy, in which they may acquire all that is taught at either, except law and physic. Let the academy afford accommodation for 150 persons; 20 of whom may be servants and attendants. As many academies as are necessary may be afterwards erected on the model of this one. Let the youth who are introduced into this academy begin their studies with learning the principal rules of grammar from some good elementary book. In their pronunciation of Latin, let them be taught to follow the pronunciation of the Italians; so that the English is indistinct, and unfavourable to the genius of the language. Next, read to them some entertaining book on education; such as, the three first books of Quintilian in Latin, and Cebes, Plutarch, or some other of the Socratic discourses, in Greek; and be careful to seize every opportunity of inspiring them, by reasonable lectures and explanations, with love for learning, admiration of great and virtuous characters, and a disposition to cheerful obedience. At the same time, but at a different hour of the day, let them be instructed in the rules of arithmetic and the elements of geometry. Between supper and bedtime, instruct them in the principles of religion and the sacred history. From the writers on education let your pupils pass to the authors on agriculture, to Cato, Varro, and Columella. Before half these authors be read, they cannot but be pretty well qualified to read most of the prose authors in the Latin language; and they may now, with great propriety, learn the use of the globes, and make themselves acquainted with the ancient and modern maps. Let them, about the same time, begin the study of the Greek tongue, and proceed in it as in the Latin; they will not fail to overcome, in a short time, all the difficulties of grammar; after which they will have access to all the treasures of natural knowledge to be found in Aristotle and Theophrastus. In the same manner they may make themselves acquainted with Vitruvius, Seneca, Mela, Cellus, Pliny, and Solinus. And having thus passed through the principles of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and geography, with a general compact of physics; let them next turn their attention to mathematics, in which they may begin with the practical branch of trigonometry, which will serve as an introduction to fortification, architecture, and navigation. To teach them the knowledge of nature, and instruct them in the arts of life, let them have the affluence and instructions, not merely of masters who are acquainted only with books, but of men whose skill has been obtained by actual practice, even of artists and mechanics. Next, let the poets obtain their attention; and they will now read them with ease and pleasure. From the poets let your pupils proceed to the moralists; and, after acquainting themselves with them, they may be allowed the entertainment of some of the best Greek, Latin, and Italian dramatic compositions. From these let them proceed to politics; let them here study the law of Moses, the admirable remains of the ancient lawgivers of Greece, the Roman tables, edicts, and pandects, concluding with the institutions of their mother-country. Now let them be more particularly instructed in the principles of theology; for by this time they may have acquired the Hebrew language, together with the Chaldee and the Syriac dialect, and may therefore read the Scriptures in their original language. When their minds are thus furnished, they will be able to enter into the spirit of the noblest historians and poets. To get by heart, and repeat in a proper manner, passages from the writings of some of these, will have the happiest effects in elevating their genius. Let this stately edifice be crowned with logic and rhetoric. Far different would be the effects of such a course of education, from those produced by any which is at present pursued. We should then see abler writers, more eloquent speakers, and wiser statesmen. Similar to this, probably, was the course taught in the famous schools of Pythagoras, Plato, Ifocrates, and Aristotle. This would unite the advantages of an Athenian and a Spartan education: for our pupils should be taught the exercises of wrestling and fencing, and the whole military discipline.\n\nSuch are the ideas of our admired Milton on the subject of education. An enthusiastic admirer of the sciences, arts, and institutions of Greece and Rome; from his religious and political principles, no friend to the universities; it was natural for a man of his learning and ingenuity, in an age of innovation, and influenced by such prejudices, to form such a project as that which we have surveyed. He seems not to have reflected, that it is necessary for children to be long occupied in obtaining a familiar acquaintance with words, before they can gain from books any knowledge of things; overlooking this circumstance, and perceiving plainly that the mode of education which then prevailed confined the attention of youth almost wholly to words, he could not but regard the scheme which he proposed as likely to produce very happy effects.\nEducation effects. His observation, that the appearances of external nature are among the first objects which attract the attention of youth, which he communicates by directing his pupils to peruse the writers on agriculture and natural history as near the beginning of their studies as possible; if not altogether just, yet must be allowed to be nearly so. Perhaps human actions and passions, and the series of events which happen around us, are, by the time at which we begin our application to learning, the objects which most frequently and strongly engage our attention: But the appearances of external nature are at least the next object of our regard.\n\nMr Locke, whose abilities and noble design to be useful to the world his country is so much indebted, has written, among other things, on the education of youth. He was capable of thinking for himself; but more desirous of rendering himself useful, than of being admired for singularity. He is therefore an author to whom we ought to listen, at least, with respectful attention. If Quintilian and Milton had been employed as teachers of youth, Mr Locke had been conversant with the world, had inquired into the principles of human nature, and had no doubt endeavoured to examine without prejudice the effects of those modes of education which he disapproves. When we consider, that, to render himself useful to the rising generation, he could descend from the heights of science to translate the fables of Æsop, and to perform other humble tasks in literature, which a philosopher of less benevolence and virtue would have disdained; we cannot but look with veneration and gratitude on so exalted a character. In his Treatise on Education, the two great objects which Mr Locke keeps in view are, 1st, To preserve and strengthen the bodily constitution; 2dly, To inform the understanding with useful knowledge, and to cherish good dispositions in the heart.\n\nIn his directions on the first of these heads, he seems extremely anxious to prevent parents and others in whose hands children are placed, from injuring them by ill-directed tenderness. Plain fare, simple and light clothing, abstinence from physic and from strong liquors, he earnestly recommends as the most judicious means for preserving and confirming the health of the child. In all his gratifications let the strictest moderation be observed. If you permit him to indulge pretty freely in sleep, at least cause him to get up at an early hour in the morning. In one thing, however, few parents will be willing to comply with Mr Locke's advice. He not only directs that the child's feet be frequently bathed in cold water, but even expresses a wish, that his shoes were always kept in such a condition as to admit water freely. This he thinks likely to fortify the constitution of the body in such a manner, as to render him less liable, in the course of life, to such diseases as arise from any unusual exposure to wetness or cold, than others whose feet have been more carefully kept dry. Though he had prosecuted his studies with a design to enter into the profession of physic, yet an unfavourable opinion did he entertain of the effects produced by medical preparations on the human constitution, that he earnestly insists on the parent to beware of administering any of them to his child. From the desire which Mr Locke discovers to have children exposed to hardships, and restrained from indulgence, in order to confirm the health and invigorate the constitution, we may conjecture him to have been an admirer of that severe mode of education which usually prevails in the earlier periods of the existence of society. He seems to have thought, that if a boy be brought up like a Huron or a Spartan, he must necessarily become robust and healthy; without reflecting, that of those children who are subjected to such a course of education, too great a proportion are unable to survive it: such is the natural delicacy of the human frame.\n\nWhen he turns his attention to the cultivating of the understanding, and the forming of the dispositions of the powers of the mind, Mr Locke still deferentially claims the regard of the parent and the preceptor. With a virtuous indignation he reproaches that negligence and folly by which we generally corrupt the heart and spoil the temper of children, even in that period of infancy; so as to render them incorrigible when they advance farther in life. Their appetites are pampered, all their desires are gratified: and if we are at any time disposed to refuse what they ask, they have an all-powerful engine to compel our compliance with their wishes. They afflict us with tears; and we then yield to their requests, however hurtful to themselves or inconvenient to us. We often studiously instruct them in vicious tricks, and call forth their evil passions. At so early an age, their rage or cunning can scarcely injure us; and we reflect not that habits of peevishness and deceit must be peculiarly hurtful to themselves.\n\nBut though all the foolish desires of children ought not to be gratified, and though we should carefully avoid leading them into any bad habit; yet it is not necessary nor prudent to treat them with harshness or severity. Let them be formed to obedience from their earliest years; let them be accustomed to submit implicitly to the direction of those on whom they depend. But beware of fouling their temper and depressing their spirits by harshness: and, on the other hand, remember that it is no less improper to give the boy a habit of neglecting his duty, except when he is allured to it by the hopes of reward. As he advances towards manhood, and attains the use of reason, you may admit him to greater familiarity, and allow him to follow his own inclinations more than at an earlier period: and if, instead of indulging all his freaks in childhood, you have carefully accustomed him to obedience and submission, without enforcing these by improper means, he will now be able to regulate his conduct with some degree of prudence.\n\nBut while caution is to be used in bestowing rewards and inflicting punishments, still rewards and punishments are indissolubly necessary in the management of the child. Inspire your boy with a sense of shame, and with a generous thirst for praise. Caress and honour him when he does well: treat him with neglect when he acts amiss. This conduct will produce much better effects than if you were at one time to chide and beat him; at another, to reward him with a profusion of sweetmeats and playthings.\n\nThink not that children are to be taught propriety of conduct by loading their memory with rules, dir-\nEducation, rectifying them how to act on every particular occasion.\n\nBurden them not with rules, but imparts them with habits.\n\nBe not desirous of forming them at too early an age, to all that politeness and propriety of manners which you wish to distinguish them when they become men. Let them be taught an easy, graceful carriage of body; but give yourself no concern, though they now and then blunder against the prejudices of good breeding; time will correct their awkwardnesses.\n\nWith regard to that important question, whether children ought to be sent to a public school, or are likely to be better trained up in a domestic education? so impossible is it for one master to extend his attention to a number of boys, and so likely is the contagion of vice to be caught among the crowd of a public school, that a private seems more favourable than a public education to virtue, and scarce less favourable to learning.\n\nWhen you resolve to give your son a domestic education, be careful to regulate that domestic education in a judicious manner. Keep him at a distance from evil example: choose the most favourable lessons for communicating instruction: strictly enforce obedience; but never by blows, except in case of obstinacy which you find otherwise incurable. If his engagements in life prevent the parent from superintending and directing his son's education personally, let him commit him to the care of a virtuous and judicious tutor. Let the tutor be rather a man of experience in the world than of profound learning; for it is more necessary that the pupil be formed for conducting himself with prudence in the world, and be fortified against those temptations to which he will be exposed when he enters upon active life, than that his head be stuffed with Latin and logic.\n\nHere Mr Locke, notwithstanding that his own mind was stored with the treasures of Grecian and Roman literature, takes occasion to declare himself pretty freely against that application to ancient learning, which was then indispensably required in the education of youth. He considers languages and philosophy as rather having a tendency to render the youth unfit for acting a prudent and becoming part in life than forming for it; and he therefore infers that these should be but in a subordinate degree the objects of his attention.\n\nLet the tutor encourage the child under his care to a certain degree of familiarity; let the pupil be accustomed to give his opinion on matters relative to himself: let him be taught justice, by finding injustice to others prejudicial to himself; let him be taught liberality, by finding it advantageous; let him be rendered superior to teasing his parents or tutor with complaints, by finding his complaints unfavourably received. That you may teach him to restrain every foolish or irregular desire, be sure never to indulge his wishes, save when you find the indulgence proper for him, and convenient for yourself. Curiosity, however, is a principle which ought to be industriously roused in the breast of the child, and cherished there by meeting always the readiest gratification. However you may oppose the boy's inclinations in other things, yet refuse him not a proper portion of recreation: let him indulge in play, while he continues to play with keenness and activity; but suffer him not to loiter about in littlest indolence. To restrain your child from fooling, Education, hardy courage, point out to him the dangers to which it exposes him: to raise him above timorous cowardice, and inspire him with manly fortitude, accustom him from the earliest period of life to an acquaintance with such things as he is most likely to be afraid of: subject him now and then to pain, and expose him to danger; but let such trials be judiciously conducted.\n\nIdleness or curiosity sometimes leads children to cruelty in their treatment of such animals as are placed within their power. Dogs, cats, birds, and butterflies, often suffer from their inhumanity. But when they seem inclined to such cruelty, let them be carefully watched, and let every means be used to awake their hearts to generous sensibility. Allow them to keep tame birds, dogs, &c., only on condition of their using them with tenderness. Perhaps this unhappy disposition to cruelty is occasioned, or at least fostered, by people's laughing when they behold the impotent efforts of children to do mischief; and often going so far as even to encourage them in maltreating those creatures which are within their reach. We entertain them, too, with stories of fighting and battles; and represent characters distinguished for atrocious acts of inhumanity as great and illustrious. But let such practice be carefully refrained from, if you wish to inspire your child with generous and humane sentiments. Teach him gentleness and tenderness, not only to brute animals, but also to servants and companions.\n\nCuriosity is to be roused and cherished in the breast of the child: but by what means? Answer his inquiries readily: though his questions be put in awkward language, let not that hinder you from attending to the objects of them. Curiosity is natural to the human mind; and if you repress not the curiosity of the child, he will often be moved by its impulse to the pursuit of knowledge. Let him find his engenders in the pursuit of knowledge, a source of applause and esteem. Avoid the folly of those who sport with the credulity of children, by answering their questions in a ludicrous or deceitful manner.\n\nYou must, however, not only listen with obliging attention to his questions, and strive to gratify his curiosity; but even whenever he attempts to reason on such subjects as are offered to his observation, be careful to encourage him: praise him if he reasons with any degree of plausibility; even if he blunders, beware of ridiculing or laughing at him. With regard to the boy's playthings: while you indulge him freely in innocent diversions, give him such playthings as may be necessary in the amusements in which he engages, provided they be such as he cannot make himself; but it will be still better for him to exercise his dexterity and ingenuity in making them himself.\n\nAfter throwing out these things concerning the general principles on which education should be carried on, Mr Locke next proceeds to those particular parts of knowledge in which he thinks every young gentleman ought to be instructed. In virtue, wisdom, breeding, and learning, he comprehends all that is necessary to enable his pupil to act a respectable part in life.\n\nIn forming the boy to virtue, the first thing to be done is to inform him of the relation subsisting between human creatures and a supreme independent Being, their creator, preserver, and governor; and to teach him,\nEducation, that obedience and worship are due to that Being. But when you inform the child of the existence of an invisible Being, beware of impressing his mind with any notions concerning spirits or goblins, which may render him incapable of bearing darkness or solitude. In infancy our minds are, by the indiscrimination of those about us, generally impressed with such prejudices concerning a thousand frightful forms, ever ready to assail or haunt us under the shade of night, that we become incapable of manly fortitude during the course of life: the folder who will boldly face death in the field of battle, shall perhaps tremble and take to flight at the rustling of a few leaves, or the grunting of a hog in the dark. But were the imaginations of children not crazed with wild stories concerning spirits and hobgoblins, darkness would be no more alarming to them than light. After informing the child of the existence of a Deity, and teaching him to pray to him; next labour to impress his mind with a veneration for truth, and habituate him to a strict adherence to it on every occasion. Endeavour also to render him gentle and good-natured.\n\nThe best means you can use to teach him wisdom or prudence in conducting himself in the ordinary business and intercourse of life, is to teach him to despise the mean shifts of cunning. The rest must be learned by actual experience in life.\n\nThe decencies of life, comprehended under the word Good Breeding, form no inconsiderable part of a good education. In teaching these, two things are to be attended to: Inspire the youth with a disposition to please and oblige all with whom he is conversant; next, teach him how to express that disposition in a becoming manner. Let boisterous roughness, haughty contempt of others, censoriousness, impertinent railing, and a spirit of contradiction, be banished from his temper and behaviour. At the same time, beware of leading him to regard the mere forms of intercourse as a matter of the highest importance. Remember that genuine good breeding is only an easy and graceful way of expressing good sense and benevolence in his conversation and deportment.\n\nMr Locke, when he comes to give his opinion concerning those parts of learning which are proper to be taught a young gentleman, and the manner in which they ought to be communicated, advises to initiate the child in the art of reading, without letting him know that he is engaged about a matter of any importance, or learning an accomplishment which you are solicitous that he should acquire. Present it to him in the form of an amusement, or teach him to consider it as an high honour to be permitted to learn his alphabet; otherwise he will turn from it with disgust. When by insinuating arts you have allured him to apply to reading, put into his hands such books as are plain, entertaining, and instructive. Insist not on his reading over the Bible: instead of gaining any advantage from an indiscriminate perusal of it at this period of life, he is likely to acquire the most confused notions of religion, and an indifference for the sacred volume during the rest of life: yet it may be highly proper to cause him to peruse some of its beautiful historical pages, and to familiarize him with its elegant and simple moral precepts. After learning to read his mother tongue, the boy's attention ought to be next directed to the art of writing. The safest way to teach him that art, is to get a plate engraved, after the model of any hand which you think most proper for his imitation. With this plate get a number of copies cast with red ink; the letters of these the learner may trace with his pen filled with black ink: and he will thus in a short time, and without much trouble to you or himself acquire a decent hand. As drawing is useful on many occasions in life, if the boy be not naturally incapable of acquiring it, he may with great propriety dedicate some part of his time and attention to that art.\n\nWhen the scholar has attained a tolerable degree of skill in writing, and in reading and speaking his native language, he must next begin an acquaintance with other languages. Among these, the first object of his study will naturally be the Latin. Yet let none waste their time in attempting to acquire a knowledge of Latin, but such as are designed for some of the learned professions, or for the life of a gentleman without a profession. To these last it may be useful; to others it is wholly unserviceable. But in learning the Latin tongue, a much happier method than burdening and perplexing him with rules of grammar, would be to make him speak it with a tutor who was sufficiently master of it for that purpose. Thus might he spend that time which is usually occupied in acquiring this language, in learning some other necessary branches of education. But if you cannot conveniently have the boy taught the language by the way of conversation, let the introductory books be accompanied with an English version, which he may have easy recourse to for the explanation of the Latin. Never perplex him with grammatical difficulties. Reflect that, at his age, it is impossible to enter into the spirit of those things. Render everything as easy and pleasing as possible; for the attention will not fail to wander, even though you labour not to render the talk disagreeable. Skill in grammar may be useful; but it is to those whose lives are to be dedicated to the study of the dead languages: that knowledge which the gentleman and the man of the world may have occasion to derive from the treasures contained in the ancient languages, may be acquired, without a painful study of prology or syntax. As the learning of any language is merely learning words; if possible, let it be accompanied with the acquisition of some real knowledge of things; such as the nature of plants, animals, &c., their growth and propagation. But if you cannot or will not give your boy a private education, and are still resolved to send him to school, to be whipped through the usual course of Greek and Latin; at least act with so much good sense and humanity, as to insist that he be not burdened and tormented with the composition of Latin themes and verses. Neither let his memory be oppressed with whole pages and chapters from the classics. Such ridiculous exercises have no tendency, whatever prejudice may urge to the contrary, to improve him either in the knowledge of languages or of nature.\n\nMr Locke seems to wish that the French language, which in his days had attained to higher refinement and a more regular analogy than any of the other modern languages of Europe—he seems to wish that the French were learned along with the Latin: and he wishes the study of these languages to be accompanied with the study of arithmetic, geography, history, and chronology. Let these branches of knowledge be communicated\nEducation communicated to the learner in one of the two languages; and he will thus acquire the language with greater facility. He next points out the advantages of the branches of knowledge which he recommends as proper to be learned together with the languages; but on that head he says nothing singular. One method which he recommends for facilitating the study of language is, to put into the youth's hands, as soon as he has acquired a tolerable knowledge of chronology, some of the most entertaining Latin historians; the interesting nature of the events which they relate will not fail to command his attention, in spite of the difficulty which he must find in making out their meaning. The Bible and Tully's Offices will be his best guides in the study of ethics. The law of nature and nations, as well as the civil and political institutions of his country, will form to him an important object, which he ought to study with the most careful attention. Rhetoric and logic, though generally regarded as objects of great importance in a liberal education, can neither of them contribute much with all their rules and terms, to render him an acute reasoner or an eloquent speaker; and it is therefore unnecessary for him to honour them with very particular attention. Tully and Chillingworth will be more beneficial in teaching him to reason and to persuade, than all the treatises on rhetoric and logic which he can possibly peruse, or all the lectures on those arts which he can gain opportunities to hear. In every art and every science practice and experience are infinitely better than rules. Natural philosophy, as contributing to inspire the breast with warmer sentiments of devotion, and serving also to many useful purposes in life, ought to make a part in the young gentleman's studies. But the humble experimental writers on that subject are to be put into his hands in preference to the lofty builders of systems. As for Greek, our pupil is not to be a professed scholar, but a gentleman and a man of the world; and therefore it does not appear necessary that Greek should make a part in the system of his education. But in none of these studies will the pupil ever attain any proficiency, unless he be accustomed to method and regularity in the prosecution of them. In languages, let him gradually ascend from what is simplest to what is most difficult; in history, let him follow the order of time; in philosophy, that of nature.\n\nDancing, as contributing to ease and gracefulness of carriage, ought to make part in our young gentleman's education. Fencing and riding being fashionable, cannot well be denied him. As he is likely, in the course of life, to have some leisure hours on his hands, and to be sometimes disposed to active recreation, let him learn some mechanical trade, with the exercise of which he may agreeably fill up some of those hours. If he is to possess any property, let him not be unskilled in the management of accounts. Travel, instead of being useless, appears more likely to be hurtful to the understanding and morals of the traveller, unless deferred to a later period than that at which young men are usually sent out to complete their education by traversing through foreign countries.\n\nHere Mr Locke concludes his work with observing, that he does not offer it to the world as a full or comprehensive treatise on the subject of education, but merely as the outlines of what occurred to him as most proper to be observed in breeding up a young gentleman not intended for any learned profession or mechanical employment, but for acting a respectable part in life at the head of a competent hereditary fortune.\n\nIn considering the sentiments of this respectable philosopher on the subject of education, we perceive, that as he was, on the one hand, superior to those prejudices which render us incapable of distinguishing the defects or absurdities of any custom or institution which has long prevailed; so, on the other hand, he was free from that filly vanity which dupes those who are subject to its influence to affect novelty and singularity of sentiment on every subject which they consider. Though a member of one of the universities, he hesitates not to declare himself against a very laborious attention to classical learning; and his reasoning is, through the whole of his treatise, rather plain and solid than subtle or refined.\n\nYet, however we respect the soundness of his understanding or the benevolence of his intentions, we cannot avoid observing, that his opinions are not always such as experience justifies. He had no doubt taken notice of some instances in which the too great anxiety of parents about the preservation of their children's health was the very means of rendering their constitution feeble and tender through the course of life; and from that circumstance might be led to propose those expedients which he mentions for preserving the health and strengthening the constitution of children. But a little more observation or inquiry would have easily convinced him, that some of his expedients, instead of strengthening the child's constitution, would in all probability shorten his days.\n\nHe had perhaps seen some of the heroes of classical literature, who were familiar with Demosthenes and Cicero, and had Homer and Virgil at their finger ends,—he had been some of those gentlemen so overloaded with their cargo of Greek and Latin as to be unfit for the ordinary business and intercourse of life; and such instances might tempt him to forget the advantages which he himself, and a long series of philosophers, patriots, and statesmen, with whose names the annals of our country are adorned, had derived from a regular classical education. But as we are afterwards to deliver our own sentiments on the subject, we will not here extend our observations on Mr Locke to a greater length.\n\nAn author more distinguished than Mr Locke for tenderness of sentiment, singularity, eloquence, and whimsy, has presented the public with a work on the subject of education, in which, with unexampled boldness, he inveighs against all the established modes, as well as reprobates whatever had been advanced by former writers on the subject; and at the same time, delineates a plan of education which he would persuade us is infinitely superior to those which he explodes. This writer is the amiable and pathetic Rousseau: And though he be often vain, paradoxical, and whimsical; yet the charm of genius and sentiment which adorns his writings will at least engage our attention while he unfolds his opinions.\n\nHe sets out with observing, that our business in the management of bringing up of children should be, to second and to call forth nature; and that, instead of this, we almost always oppose\nEducation oppose her intentions and operations. As soon as the child sees the light, he is wrapped in swathing bands. His limbs are thus restrained from that free motion which is necessary to their growth and vigour; and even the internal parts of his frame are rendered incapable of their proper functions. Mothers are too proud or indolent, or too fond of gaiety and dissipation, to submit to the talk of nursing their own children. The poor infants are committed to some hireling nurse, who not being attached to them by natural affection, treats them with negligence or inhumanity. But is that mother capable of any delicacy of sentiment, who can permit another to fuckle her child, and to share with her, or perhaps wholly supplant her, in the filial affection of that child?\n\nAgain, When parents undertake the care of their infant children, they often injure them by mistaken tenacies. They pamper them with delicate meats, cover them with warm clothes, and anxiously keep them at a distance from all that has the appearance of danger: not attending to the economy of nature, who subjects us in infancy to a long train of epidemical distempers, and exposes us during the same period to innumerable dangers; the design of which doublets is, to teach us a prudent concern for our own safety, and to strengthen and confirm our constitutions.\n\nA child no sooner enters into life, than it begins to cry; and during a great part of infancy continues frequently to shed tears. We either attempt to soothe it into good nature, or seek to silence it by harsher means; and it is thus we infuse into its infant mind those evil passions which we afterwards presume to impute to nature.\n\nAs the mother generally disdains to nurse her own child, so the father is seldom at leisure to take any share in the management of his education: he is put into the hands of a tutor. But that tutor whose time and attention can be purchased for money is unworthy of the charge. Either be yourself your son's preceptor, or gain a friend whose friendship to you shall be his sole motive to undertake the task.\n\nAfter a few preliminary observations to the above purport, our author introduces his Emilius; in whose education he delineates that plan which he prefers. The preceptor whom he would assign Emilius must be young; and must dedicate his attention to Emilius alone, from the time when his pupil enters the world till he attain the full age of manhood. Emilius, to receive the full benefit of his preceptor's system of education, and to afford full scope to it, must possess a genius of the middle class; no prodigy of parts, nor singularly dull; he must have been born to affluent circumstances and an elevated rank in life. His preceptor is invested with the rights, and takes upon him the obligations, of both father and mother. Emilius is, when put into the hands of his preceptor, a well-shaped, vigorous, and healthy child. The first care of the preceptor is to provide him with a nurse, who, as he is new born, must be newly delivered? it is of still higher importance that she be clean, healthy, virtuous, and of mild dispositions. While fumbling her charge, she shall feed plentifully, chiefly on a vegetable diet. The child must be frequently bathed, in cold water if possible; if you begin with warm, however, use it by degrees colder and colder, till at length he is able to bear it entirely cold. He is not to be wrapped in swaddling clothes or rollers, or bound with staysbands; but put in good warm blankets, and in a roomy cradle: let him stretch and move his limbs at freedom, and crawl about on hands and knees at his pleasure. The greatest care must now be taken to prevent the child from contracting any habits whatever: suffer him not to use one arm more than another, or to eat or sleep at stated hours. Prepare him for the enjoyment of liberty, by preferring to him the exercise of his natural abilities, unfettered by any artificial habits.\n\nAs soon as the child begins to distinguish objects, let his education begin. Some objects are naturally agreeable, others frightful. Accustom him to look upon any object that may come in his way without being affrighted. Children are at first ignorant of local relations, and learn to distinguish them only by experience; and while Emilius is yet an infant, incapable of speaking or walking, he may be assisted in acquiring the knowledge of these.\n\nIn his feeble helpless condition, the child must feel many wants and much uneasiness; tears are the language which nature has given him to make known his distresses and wants. When the child cries, it would be much more prudent and humane to examine what he suffers or stands in need of, than as is usually done, to rock or sing him asleep; or, when these means succeed not, to threaten or use him brutally.\n\nIn managing children, as nature has endowed them with no superfluous powers, we ought not to confine them from the free use of those which they are able to exert. It is our duty to supply their deficiency both of mental and bodily powers; but while we are ready to administer on every occasion to their real wants, we must beware of gratifying their caprice or unreasonable humours. In order to distinguish between their natural and fantastic wants, we must study the language and signs by which they express their wishes and emotions. Though crying be the means which nature has given infants to enable them to procure relief or assistance, yet when they cry they are not always in need of either. They often cry from obstinacy or habits of peevishness. But if, instead of attempting to soothe them by diverting their attention to other objects, we would on such occasions entirely neglect them, they would soon cease to indulge in such fits of crying.\n\nWhen children begin to speak, we are usually anxious about their language and articulation, and are every moment correcting their blunders. But instead of hoping to teach them purity or correctness of speech by such means as these; let us be careful to speak easily and correctly before them, and allow them to express themselves in the best manner they can. By such means we will be much more likely to obtain our wishes in this matter. When they speak, let us not listen with such solicitude as to relieve them from the necessity of using an open distinct articulation.\n\nWhen the child attains the power of expressing himself in artificial language, he may then be considered as having reached the second period of infancy. He needs not now to make known his wants by tears, and should therefore be discouraged from the use of them. Let his tears be entirely neglected. He now begins to run about, and you are anxious to prevent him from hurting himself; but your anxiety can only render him peevish.\npeevish or timid. Remove him from any very alarming danger, and then suffer him to run about at his pleasure. He will now and then bleed, and hurt himself; but he will become bold, lively, and cheerful.\n\nIn regulating the conduct of your child, let him know that he is dependant; but require not of him an implicit submission to your will. Let his unreasonable desires be opposed only by his natural inability to gratify them, or by the inconveniences attending the gratification. When he asks what is necessary or reasonable, let him instantly obtain it; when he asks what is unreasonable or improper, lend a deaf ear to all his entreaties and demands. Beware of teaching him to establish his authority over you by means of the forms of politeness. A child will scarce take the trouble to address you with \"If you please,\" unless he has been made to regard these as a set of magic syllables, by the use of which he may subject every person to his will. His \"If you please\" then means I please; pray, with him, stands for do. Though you put in his mouth the words of humility, his tone and air are those of authority that will be obeyed.\n\nSacrifice not the present happiness of your child for the sake of any distant advantage.\n\nBe not too anxious to guard him against natural evil. The liberty which he enjoys while he is now and then permitted to expose himself to blows, or cold, or wetness, is more than a sufficient compensation for all that he thus suffers.\n\nSeek not to impress him with ideas of duty or obligation. Till children reach the years of discretion, they are incapable of any notions of the distinctions of morality. Avoid therefore even the use of the terms, by which they are expressed in their hearing. While they continue to be affected only by sensible objects, seek not to extend their ideas beyond the sphere of sensation. Try all the powers of language, use the plaintive and most familiar methods you can contrive; you shall still be unable to give the boy at this age any just ideas of the distinction between right and wrong. He may readily conceive, that for one set of actions you will punish him, and that by another he will obtain your approbation; but farther than this his ideas of right and wrong, of virtue and vice, cannot yet be carried.\n\nThe powers of the human mind are gradually unfolded. At first, the infant is capable only of perception; by and by, his instincts and passions begin to exert their force; at length, as he advances towards manhood, reason begins to act, and he becomes able to feel the beauty of virtue and the deformity of vice.\n\nBut though you seek not to regulate his conduct by notions of duty, yet let him feel the yoke of necessity. Let him know, that as he is weaker than you, he must not, therefore, expect that you should be subject to his will; and that, as he has neither skill nor strength to control the laws of nature, and make every object around him bend to his pleasure, he cannot hope to obtain the gratification of all his wishes. Thus you teach him virtue before he knows what virtue is; and call forth his reason without misleading or perverting it. Let him feel his impotence; but forbid him not to think, that if he had power there would be no reason why he might not at pleasure even turn the world upside down.\n\nHitherto you have given your pupil no verbal instructions, nor must you yet attempt to instruct him by any other means than experience; let all his knowledge be literally of his own acquisition.\n\nLet not the parent who has observed the conduct of children brought up in the usual way be afraid that, if his child should be treated like our pupil, he would become stupid and vicious. Nature sends not human beings into the world with a predilection to vice; we sow the seeds of it in the infant heart; and by our absurd modes of treatment, we also enfeeble and pervert the powers of the understanding.\n\nBut from the hour of his birth till he attain the age of twelve, the education of Emilius shall be purely negative. Could we but bring him up healthy and robust, and entirely ignorant, till that period, the eyes of his understanding would then be open to every lesson: free from the influence of habit and prejudice, his passions would not then oppose us; and we might render him the wisest and most virtuous of men. If we can but lose time, if we can but advance without receiving any impressions whatever, our gains are unpeakable. Nature gives the powers of every mind some particular direction: but that particular bias, impressed by the hand of nature, cannot be distinguished before the period we have mentioned; and if you counteract nature, instead of seconding her views, the consequences cannot but be highly unfavourable both to the heart and the understanding of your pupil.\n\nPerhaps, in the midst of society, it may be difficult to bring up our pupil without giving him some idea of the relations between man and man, and of the morality of human actions. Let that, however, be deferred as long as possible.\n\nWere Emilius to witness a scene of anger, and to ask the cause of the appearances which he beheld, he should be told that the persons were affected with a fit of sudden illness. We might thus perhaps prevent the unhappy effects of such an example.\n\nThe first moral notions which should be communicated to the child are those of property. To communicate the ideas of property to our pupil, we will direct him to take possession of something; for instance, of a piece of ground belonging to some other person, and in a state of cultivation. Let him cultivate this spot of ground anew, sow it with seeds, and look eagerly forward to the time of harvest in the hopes of reaping the fruit of his labours. In the mean time, let the proprietor of the ground take notice of what is done, destroy your pupil's rising crop, and complain of the injustice done him. While the boy laments his loss and the disappointment of his hopes, in all the bitterness of grief, let the proprietor of the ground still insist on the injury done him, and complain of what he suffers by the purpose for which he himself had cultivated and sown the ground being frustrated. Our pupil, now sensible of the renoncement of the other's claims, will desist from his lamentations, and only beg to have some other spot assigned him which he may cultivate at his leisure without offending any person. This he will justly consider as his own property, to the productions of which raised by his own labour he has an exclusive right, and in the occupying\nof which none ought to molest him. In some such manner as this may the nature of property, the idea of which easily refers in the instance to the first occupier, and afterwards the exchange of property, be explained to him.\n\nAnother instance of the manner in which the pupil is now to be managed may not be improper in this place. He is possibly too rude and boisterous as to spoil or break whatever is within his reach. Be not angry with him, however; if he break the utensils which he has constant need of, be in no haste to supply him with others in their room; let other things be removed out of his way; if he break the windows of his apartment, let him be exposed night and day to the cold; complain not of the inconvenience yourself, but order matters so that he may feel it. After some time, let them be mended up; and if he break them again, change your method. Tell him calmly, \"These windows are mine; I took care to have them put there; and I will prevent their being again broken, by confining you in a dark room.\" Let all his endeavours to avoid this prove ineffectual. Let him be actually confined, and be liberated only on proposing and agreeing to the condition of breaking no more windows. When he proposes this condition, be ready to listen to him; observe that it is well thought on, and that it is a pity he did not think of it sooner. Consider this engagement between you as sacred; treat him as before, and you cannot fail to attain the end in view.\n\nThe moral world now opens to us. But no sooner are we able to distinguish between right and wrong, than we become disposed to conceal those instances in which we act wrong. Lying is therefore a vice of which your pupil is now apt to be guilty; you cannot always prevent, but you can punish; but let the punishments which you inflict appear to the child only the natural consequences of his conduct. If he is in any instance convicted of a lie, let his affections no longer gain credit. By this means, sooner than by precepts, or any other species of punishment, will you be able to reclaim him from the habit of lying.\n\nThe methods generally taken to render children virtuous are preposterous and foolish. To render them generous and charitable, we give them money, and bid them bestow it in alms, while we ourselves give nothing; but the parent or master, and not the child, should bestow the alms. Example might produce the wished-for effect. Besides, children are strangers to the value of money. A gingerbread cake is more to them than a hundred guineas. Though you teach them to give away money, till you persuade them to part readily with those things which they value most, you do not inspire them with generosity. Would you make them liberal by showing them that the most liberal is always best provided for? this is to covetousness, not liberality. Example is the only means by which you can, at this period, hope to teach your pupil any of the virtues.\n\nThe only lesson of morality that can with any propriety be inculcated on children, is to injure no person. Even the positive precept of doing good, must be considered as subordinate to this negative one of doing no harm. The most virtuous and the most excellent of characters, is the man who does the least harm to his fellow creatures.\n\nIn a public education, it will be necessary to attempt the communication of moral instruction at an earlier period than in a private one. In a private education, it will always be best to allow the moral powers of children to ripen as much as possible before you endeavour to inform and direct them by precepts.\n\nThere is an inequality among geniuses; and fond mothers and fathers may be duped to plead for exceptions in favour of such of their children as they view with a partial eye. \"This boy's mind is more capacious, his powers are riper, than those of others.\" But however great the seeming disparity of geniuses may be, it is at bottom but incon siderable. Let the age of children be therefore regarded as a common measure by which their treatment is to be regulated.\n\nHowever quick and tenacious the memories of children may seem, they can derive little advantage from the exertions of memory till such time as judgment begins to act. All the knowledge that they acquire in the course of the usual system of education, is merely the knowledge of words. The languages, geography, chronology, in short all that they are taught, and called to display so ostentatiously at this period of life, serve no other purpose than to fill their minds with words.\n\nHistory is esteemed a proper thing to be put into the hands of children. But except you wish to soon, how far fine their attention to the external and physical actions, proper to it is almost nothing they can acquire by the perusal of it. And if divested of the moral distinctions of actions, of the workings of the passions, and the complication of interests, what is there to render history entertaining? We may indeed easily teach them to repeat the words kings, emperors, wars, conquests, revolutions, laws; but of the things which you use these words to denote, you will find they are hitherto incapable of forming any clear ideas.\n\nBut the mere knowledge of words is not science; make your pupil acquainted with things, and he will not fail to acquire their names. Emilius must never be let to get any composition by heart, not even fables: be careful to place before him those scenes and objects, the images of which it may be useful for him to have impressed on his memory; but by no other means seek to assist him to improve that faculty.\n\nEmilius shall not even learn to read till he attain the age of twelve: for, before that period, it can be of no benefit to him; and the labour would only make him unhappy during that period of life which is naturally the golden part of our days. But when he has attained the proper age, matters shall be so ordered, that he shall find his ignorance of letters an inconvenience. A card shall be sent him, which being unable to read, he will apply to some of those about him. They may be unwilling to oblige him, or otherwise engaged. If, at length, it is read to him, that may be when it is now too late to take advantage of some agreeable invitation which it contained. This may be two or three times repeated. At length he becomes eager to learn to read; and accomplishes that almost without assistance.\n\nThe principle on which we proceed, is to leave the pupil almost wholly under his own direction, seemingly at\nEducation, at least; to lead him to acquire new accomplishments, solely from the desire of increasing his powers, and extending his influence; and humbly to follow nature, not to force her.\n\nAs we are desirous of cultivating his understanding, the means which we employ for that purpose is, to cultivate those abilities on which it depends; he is always active and in motion. Let us first make him a man in point of health and vigour, and he will soon become a man in understanding.\n\nBy our constant attention to the welfare of children, we render it unnecessary for them to attend to it themselves. What occasion has your son or pupil to observe whether the aspect of the sky threaten rain, when he knows that you will take care to have him sheltered from a shower? or to regulate the length of his excursions, when he is sure that you will not suffer him to lose his dinner?\n\nWhile matters are so ordered that Emilius thinks himself subject only to his own will, though all his motions are regulated according to your pleasure; instead of becoming fantastic and capricious, he infallibly acquires the habit of keeping utility in view in all his actions.\n\nThe first objects which engage the attention of children are the appearances of the material world around them: our first study is a kind of experimental philosophy; our instruments and instructors are our hands, our feet, and our eyes. By exercising these bodily organs, the boy will acquire more real knowledge even in the period of childhood, than if he should dedicate nine-tenths of his time to books, from the age of six to sixty. All who have examined, with any sagacity, the characters, circumstances, and manners of the ancients, have agreed in attributing to their gymnastic exercises that superior strength of body and mind which renders them objects of admiration to the moderns.\n\nOur pupil's clothes cannot be too light and easy. If tight and close, they fetter and confine his joints and limbs, and likewise obstruct the circulation of the blood; if accustomed to warm clothing, he will soon become incapable of bearing cold.\n\nIn every thing let him be habituated to what is plain and hardy. Let his bed be coarse and hard, his clothes plain, his fare simple. Infants must be freely indulged in sleep; but as Emilius is now advanced beyond infancy, he must be accustomed at times to go to bed late and get up early, to be sometimes hastily waked from sleep; and thus to prepare himself for what he may afterwards have occasion to submit to in the course of life.\n\nAs this period is in a particular manner that of exercise, and Emilius is encouraged to take as much exercise as he chooses: we must endeavour to prompt, but without seeming to direct him to such as are most proper. Swimming, though not generally attended to, is yet one of the first which a boy ought to learn. It may, on many occasions in life, be of the greatest advantage, by enabling us to save our own life or the life of others. Emilius shall be taught to swim; he shall be taught whatever can really enlarge the sphere of his power: \"could I teach him to fly in the air, I would make him an eagle; if to bear the fire, a salamander.\"\n\nTo exercise the senses is not merely to make use of them; it is to learn to judge by them. Call not your pupil to exert all his strength on every occasion; but let him learn to judge of the truth of the information which he receives from one sense, by having recourse to the evidence of another.\n\nIt is not impossible to improve the senses to a higher degree of perfection than that which they usually attain. Blind men generally possess the sense of touch in a more exquisite degree, than we who have also eyes to guide and inform us. But they acquire this superior delicacy and acuteness of sensation, only by their finding it necessary to have more frequent recourse to the information of that sense. Here is then a wide field for improvement and agreeable exercise to our pupil.\n\nWhat a variety of useful diversions might he be led to entertain himself with in the course of the night, and ghosts. The hours of darkness are generally hours of terror, not only men, but also to the brute animals. Even reason, knowledge, and courage, are not always sufficient to render us superior to the terror which darkness inspires.\n\nThis timidity is usually attributed to the tales of ghosts and goblins with which we are frightened in infancy. But it originates from another cause: our ignorance of what is passing around us, and our inability to distinguish objects during that period of darkness. The passion of fear was implanted by nature in the human breast, in order that it might serve to put us on our guard against danger. But in consequence of our being subject to the influence of that passion, when we are ignorant of what surrounds us, imagination calls up dangers on all hands. And such is the cause from which our terror in darkness naturally arises.\n\nBut the only way to free our pupil from this tyranny of imagination, is to oppose to it the power of habit. A bricklayer or tyler is never giddy on looking down from the roofs of houses. Neither will our pupil be alarmed by the terrors of darkness, if he be accustomed to go frequently abroad under night. It is easy to contrive a number of little amusements, the agreeableness of which may, for a time, overcome our pupil's aversion for darkness; and thus may a habit be at length impressed.\n\nLet us give yet another instance of the means by which children may be led to do what we wish, without our imposing any restraint on their will. Suppose Emilius is lazy and inactive, and we wish to make him learn to run. When walking out with the young flibbertigibbet after dinner, I would sometimes put a couple of his favourite cakes in my pocket; of these each of us should eat one in the course of our walk. After some time I would show him I had put a third cake in my pocket. This he would not fail to ask after finishing his own: no says I, I can eat it myself, or we will divide it—or stay, we had better let these two little boys there run a race for it. Accordingly I propose the race to the boys; who readily accept the conditions, and one of them carries off the prize. After seeing this several times repeated, Emilius begins to think himself qualified to obtain the third cake as well as any of the little boys, and to look upon running as an accomplishment of some consequence. He seeks an opportunity\nAs children naturally imitate almost whatever they behold, they are often disposed to attempt drawing. In this our pupil might be obliged, not merely for the sake of the art, but to give him a steady hand and a good eye. But he should draw from nature, not from other drawings or from prints. Were he to draw the likeness of a horse, he should look at the animal; if to attempt a representation of a house, he should view the house itself. In this method he will, no doubt, scratch for a long time without producing any likeness; but he will acquire what we proposed as the ends of his attempting to draw; namely, steadiness of hand and justness of sight, by this method, sooner than by any other.\n\nGeometry, when taught in the usual way, is certainly above the capacity of children; they cannot go along with us in our reasonings: Yet they are not totally incapable of acquiring even this difficult science; if, when they are prosecuting their amusements, you lead them insensibly to observe the properties of the circle, the triangle, and the square, and place them now and then in circumstances when they may have occasion to apply their knowledge of these to real uses in life.\n\nA child has been taught the various relations between the outlines, surfaces, and contents of bodies, by having cakes set before him, cut into all manner of regular solids; by which means he was led to master the whole science of Archimedes, by studying which form contained the greatest quantity.\n\nThere is a period between infancy and the age of puberty, at which the growth and improvement of our faculties exceed the increase of our desires. About 12 or 13, when the appetite for the sex has not yet begun to make itself felt, when unnatural wants are yet unknown, no false appetites yet acquired; at that period, though weak as a man, as a child the youth is strong.\n\nThis interval, when the individual is able to effect more than is necessary for the gratification of his wishes, contains the most precious moments of his life, which ought to be anxiously filled up in an useful manner. This is the best time for employment, for instruction, for study.\n\nNow, let us begin to consider what is useful; for, hitherto, we have only inquired what was necessary. In entering on our studies, we will make no account of any but such as instinct directs us to pursue: those which the pedant and the pretended philosopher are impelled to pursue solely from the desire of attracting the admiration of mankind, are unworthy of our notice.\n\nThe earth which we inhabit, and the sun by whose beams we are enlightened, are the first objects which claim our attention. We will therefore direct the attention of our pupil to the phenomena of nature. We will lead him to the knowledge of geography, not by maps, spheres, and globes: we will lead Emilius out on some beautiful evening to behold the setting sun. Here we take particular notice of such objects as mark the place of his going down. Next morning we visit the spot to contemplate the rising of the Education glorious luminary. After contemplating for some time the successive appearances which the scene before us affords, and making Emilius observe the hills and the other surrounding objects, I stand silent a few moments, affecting to be occupied in deep meditation: At last I address him thus: \"I am thinking, that when the sun set last night, it went down yonder; whereas this morning you see he is risen on the opposite of the plain here before us. What can be the meaning of this?\" I say nothing more at this time, but rather endeavour to direct his attention to other objects.\n\nThis is our first lesson on cosmography.\n\nOur last observation was made about Midsummer; we will next view the rising sun on some fine morning in the middle of winter. This second observation shall be made on the very same spot which we chose for the former. When Emilius and I perceive the sun now emerging above the horizon, we are struck at the change of the place of his rising. By such lessons as these may the pupil be gradually taught a real, not a seeming, acquaintance with the relative motions of the sun and the planets and with geography.\n\nDuring the first period of childhood, the great object of our system of education was to spend our time as idly as possible, in order that we might avoid employing it to an ill purpose: but our views are now changed with our pupil's progress in life; and we have scarce enough of time for the accomplishment of our necessary pursuits. We therefore proceed as quickly as possible in making ourselves acquainted with the nature of the bodies around us, and the laws by which their motions and appearances are regulated. We keep to this study at present, as being necessary for the most important purposes in life, and as being the most suitable to the present state of our pupil's powers. We still begin with the most common and obvious phenomena of nature, regarding them as mere facts; and, advancing from these, we come to generalize by degrees.\n\nAs soon as we are so far advanced as to be able to give our pupil an idea of what is meant by the word useful, we have attained a considerable influence over his future conduct. On every occasion after this, a frequent question between us will be, Of what use is this? This shall be the instrument by means of which I shall now be able to render him absolutely submissive to my wishes. However, I will allow him to make use of it in his turn, and will be careful not to require of him to do or learn anything the utility of which he cannot comprehend.\n\nBooks only teach people to talk about what they do not understand. Emilius shall have as little recourse as possible to books for instruction. Yet if we can find a book in which all the natural wants of man are displayed in a manner suitable to the understanding of a child, and in which the means of satisfying those wants are gradually displayed with the same ease and simplicity; such a book will be worthy of his most attentive study. There is such a book to be found; but it is neither Aristotle, nor Pliny, nor Buffon; it is Robinson Crusoe. Emilius shall have the adventures of Robinson put into his hands: he shall.\nEducation shall imitate his example; even affect his dress; and, like Robinson, learn to provide for himself without the aid of others.\n\nAnother employment of Emilius at this period shall be, to visit the shops of various artisans; and when he enters a shop, he shall never come out without lending a hand to the work, and understanding the nature and the reason of what he sees going forward.\n\nStill, however, we are careful to afford not a hint concerning those social relations the nature of which he is not yet able to comprehend.\n\nThe value and importance of the various arts are ordinarily estimated, not according to their real utility, but by a very injudicious mode of estimation: those which contribute in a particular manner to the gratification of the fantastic whims of the rich, are preferred to those which supply the indispensable necessities of life. But Emilius shall be taught to view them in a different light. Robinson Crusoe shall teach him to value the stock of a petty ironmonger above that of the most magnificent toy-shop in Europe. Let us establish it as a maxim, that we are to lead our pupil to form just notions of things for himself, not to dictate to him ours. He will estimate the works both of nature and art by their relation to his own convenience; and will therefore regard them as more precious than gold—a shoemaker or a mason, as a man of more importance than the most celebrated jeweller in Europe.\n\nThe intercourse of the arts consists in the reciprocal exchange of industry; that of commerce, in the exchange of commodities; and that of money, in the exchange of bills and cash. To make our pupil comprehend the nature of these, we have now only to generalize and extend to a variety of examples those ideas of the nature of property, and of the exchange of property, which we formerly communicated to him. The nature of money, as bearing only a conventional value, which it derives from the agreement of men to use it as a sign for facilitating commerce, may be now explained to Emilius, and will be easily comprehended by him. But go no farther: seek not yet to explain to the child in what manner money has given rise to the numerous chimeras of prejudice and caprice; nor how countries which abound most in gold and silver, come to be the most destitute of real wealth.\n\nStill our views are directed to bring up our pupil in such a manner that he may be qualified to occupy any place in the order of society into which even the caprice of fortune can throw him. Let us make him a man; not a slave, a lord, or a monarch. How much superior the character of a king of Syracuse turned schoolmaster at Corinth, of a king of Macedon become a notary at Rome, to an unhappy Tarquin incapable of supporting himself in a state of independence when expelled from his kingdom!\n\nWhatever be our situation in the world, we can contribute nothing but our personal abilities to society. To exert them is therefore the indispensible duty of every one who enjoys the advantages of a social state; and to cultivate them in our pupil to the best purpose, ought to be the great aim of every course of education. Emilius has already made himself familiar with all the labours of husbandry; I can therefore bid him cultivate the land which he inherits from his father. But if it should be lost, what shall be his resource? He shall learn a trade, that he may be provided against such an accident. And he shall not be a politician, a painter, a musician, or an architect; to gain employment for his talents in any of these arts, would cost him no less trouble than to regain his lost estate. He shall learn some simple mechanical art: he will then need only to step into the first shop he sees open, to perform his day's labour, and receive his wages.\n\nIt may be here proper to take notice of a mistake into which people generally fall in determining the trade or profession in which they are to place their children. Some accident disposes the child to declare himself for a particular employment: the parent regards that as the employment to which his talents are fitted by the design of nature; and permits him to embrace it without inquiring whether another would have been more suitable or advantageous. But because I am pleased with my occupation, I am not on that account necessarily qualified for it. Inclinations do not confer abilities. It requires more careful and accurate observation than is generally imagined, to distinguish the particular taste and genius with which nature has endowed the mind of a child. We view him carelessly, and of consequence we are apt to mistake casual inclination for original disposition.\n\nBut Emilius needs not now to hesitate about the occupation which he is to choose. It is to be some mechanical employment. All the distinction we have now to make is, to prefer one that is cleanly and not likely to be injurious to his health. We shall make choice of that of a joiner. We cannot dedicate all our time to the trade; but at least for two days in the week we will employ ourselves in learning our trade. We will have no workshop erected for our convenience, nor will we have a joiner to wait on us in order to give us the necessary instructions: but for the two days in every week which we dedicate to the purpose of learning a trade, we will go to our master's workshop; we will rise before him in the morning; work according to his orders; eat at his table; and, after doing ourselves the honour of supping with his family, return to our own hard mattresses at night. We shall be treated only according to the merit of our performances. Our master shall find fault with our work when clumsily or negligently done, and be pleased with it only when well executed.\n\nWhile my pupil has been accustomed to bodily exercise and manual labour, his education has been hitherto conducted in such a manner as to give him insensibly a taste for reflection and meditation. Before he has been long a workman, therefore, he will begin a trade to become more sensible of that inequality of ranks which takes place in the order of society. He will therefore take notice of his own dependence, and of my apparent wealth, and will be desirous to know why I contribute not my personal exertions to society. I put off the question with telling him, that I befoye my fulness of wealth on him and the poor; and will take to make a bench or table every week, that I may not be quite useless to the public.\n\nAnd now, when about to enter the most critical period of life, when just on the brink of that age at which the heart and blood begin to feel the impulse of\nEducation, a new appetite, what progress has our pupil made? what knowledge has he acquired? All his science is merely physical. Hitherto he has scarcely acquired any ideas of moral relations; but the essential relations between men and things he has attentively studied. He knows the general qualities of certain bodies; but upon those qualities he has not attempted to reason. He has an idea of abstract space by means of geometrical figures; of abstract quantity, by means of algebraical signs. He has no desire to find out the essence of things; their relations alone interest him. He values nothing external but from its relation to himself. The general consent of mankind, or the caprice of custom, have not yet given anything a value in his eyes; utility alone is his measure of estimation. He is laborious, temperate, patient, resolute, and bold. His imagination never exaggerates danger. He scarcely knows as yet what death is; but should it approach him, he is prepared to submit to necessity. He is virtuous in everything relative merely to himself. He is prepared to become a virtuous member of society as soon as he shall be made acquainted with the nature of his social relations. He is free from vice and error as far as is possible for human nature. He considers himself as unconnected with others; requires nothing from anyone, and thinks none has a right to require anything of him. Sure a youth arrived thus at his fifteenth year has not mispent the period of his infancy.\n\nBut now our pupil has reached the most critical period of life. He now feels the influence of the passion for the sex; and as soon as we become subject to the influence of that passion, we are no longer unocial beings. The want of a mistress soon produces the want of a friend.\n\nAs hitherto we have been careful not to force or anticipate nature, so even now our attention must be directed to divert the impulses of that dangerous appetite which now begins to make itself felt. To confine the growing passions within proper limits, let it be our care to defer as long as possible the time at which they begin to display themselves. For this purpose, let us cautiously guard our words and actions in the presence of our pupil. Let us be careful to give him no premature instructions.\n\nTo excite and cherish that sensibility of mind which now first begins to show itself, to extend the care of the youth beyond himself, and to interest him in the welfare of his fellow creatures, let us be careful to put such objects in his way as have a tendency to call forth and refine the feelings. It is not possible for the human heart to sympathize with those who are happier than ourselves; our sympathy is moved only by the sight of misery. We pity in others only those distresses to which we ourselves are liable; and our pity for the misfortunes of others is measured, not by the quantity of the evil, but by the supposed sensibility of the sufferer. Let these observations serve to direct us in what manner we are to form the minds of children to humanity and compassion.\n\nIn prosecution of our design, to retard rather than accelerate the growth of the passions, let us, when that critical period which we have so much feared comes on, exclude him as much as possible from the intercourse of society, where so many objects appear to inflame the appetites. Let us be circumspect in the choice of his companions, his employment, his pleasures. Let all our care be directed to nourish his sensibility without inflaming his desires. As his moral powers now begin to unfold themselves; in cultivating them let us proceed not by way of lecture, or by directing his attention to books, but still by leading him to acquire experience. At length the period will arrive for communicating to him some religious instruction. When he knows the nature of his relations to society, he may be informed of his relation to, and dependence upon, a Deity.\n\n[The creed of the Savoyard curate, containing those sentiments concerning religious matters which Rousseau seems to propose as the most proper to be inculcated on his pupil, comes next in the order of the work; but it does not appear to be so closely connected with the subject of education as to render it proper for us to give a view of it in this place. The sentiments which he there advances, the reasonings which he urges, are evidently hostile to revealed religion; and the power of his eloquence has adorned flighty and superficial arguments with such a charm, that even the sternest believer, if not absolutely detestable of taste and feeling, must read them with delight.]\n\nAnd now, notwithstanding all my arts, I can no longer keep back that moment which I have endeavoured to defer to as late a period as possible. As soon as I perceive that it has certainly arrived, I no longer treat Emilus as my pupil or disciple, but as my friend. His affections are now expanded beyond himself; his moral powers have begun to exert themselves, and have received some cultivation; he also is become capable of religious sentiments, and instructed in the nature of his relation to a supreme Being. Besides, it is now requisite, if we consider the period to which nature has conducted him, that he should no longer be treated as a simple child. Hitherto ignorance has been his guardian, but now he must be restrained by his own good sense.\n\nNow is the time for me to give him in my accounts; to show him in what manner his time and mine have been employed; to acquaint him with his station and mine, with our obligations to each other, his moral relations, the engagements he has entered into with regard to others, the degree of improvement which he has attained, the difficulties he will hereafter meet with, and the means by which he may surmount them;—in a word, to point out to him his critical situation, and the new perils which surround him; and to lay before him all the solid reasons which should engage him to watch with the utmost attention over his conduct, and to be cautious of indulging his youthful desires.\n\nBooks, solitude, idleness, a sedentary and effeminate life, the company of women and young people, employed to be what he must carefully avoid at this age. He has preferably learned a trade, he is not unskilled in agriculture; the purity of these may be means, but not our only means, for preserving him from the impulse of sensual desire. He is now too familiar with these; he can exercise them without taking the trouble to reflect; and while his hands are busy, his head may be engaged about something quite different from that in which he is employed. He must have some new exercise which may at once fix his attention and cause him to exert his bodily powers.\nWe can find none more suitable for this purpose than hunting. Now, therefore, Emilius shall eagerly join in the chase; and though I do not wish him to acquire that cruelty of disposition and ferocity of temper which usually distinguish those who dedicate their lives to that barbarous diversion, yet at present it may have the happiest effects in suspending the influence of the most dangerous of passions.\n\nWhen I have now conducted my pupil so far; have informed him of what I have done for him, and of the difficulty of his situation; and have resigned my authority into his hands; he is so sensible of the dangers to which he is exposed, and of the tender solicitude with which I have watched over him, that he still wishes to continue under my direction. With some feigned difficulty I again resume the reins. My authority is now established. I may command obedience; but I endeavour to guard against the necessity of using it in this manner.\n\nTo preserve him from indulging in licentious pleasures, I let him know that nature has designed us for living in a state of marriage, and invite him to go in search of a female companion. I will describe to him the woman whom he is to consider as worthy of his attachment in the most flattering colours. I will array her in such charms, that his heart shall be hers before he has once seen her. I will even name her: her name shall be Sophia. His attachment to this imaginary fair one will preserve him from all the allurements of unlawful love. Besides, I take care to inspire him with such reverence for himself, that notwithstanding all the fury of his desires, he will not condescend to pursue the enjoyments of debauchery. And though I may now sometimes intrust him to his own care, and not seek to confine him always under my eye; yet still I will be cautious to watch over his conduct with careful circumspection.\n\nBut as Emilius is to be shortly introduced to his Sophia, it may perhaps be proper for us to inquire into her character, and in what manner she has been brought up.\n\nThere is a natural difference between the two sexes. The difference in the structure of their bodies shows them to be destined by nature for different purposes in life, and must necessarily occasion a distinction between their characters. It is vain to ask which of them merits the pre-eminence: each of them is peculiarly fitted to answer the views of nature. Woman is naturally weak and timid, man strong and courageous; the one is a dependent, the other a protector. As the guardian of her virtue, and a restraint on her desires, woman is armed with native modesty. Reason is the guide and governor of man. When a man and a woman are united by conjugal vows, a violation of those vows is evidently more criminal in the woman than in the man. The wife ought to be answerable for the genuineness of the offspring with which she has been intrusted by nature. It is no doubt barbarous and wicked for the husband to defraud his wife of the only reward which she can receive for the severe duties of her sex: but the guilt of the faithless wife is still more atrocious; and the consequences of her infidelity are still more unhappy.\n\nBut if nature has established an original distinction between the characters of the two sexes; has formed them for different purposes, and assigned them different duties; it must follow, that the education of the one sex ought to be conducted in a manner different from that of the other. The abilities common to the two sexes are not equally divided between them; but if that share which nature has distributed to woman be scantier than what she has bestowed on man, yet the deficiency is more than compensated by the qualities peculiar to the female. When the woman confines herself to assert her proper rights, she has always the advantage over man; when she would usurp those of the other sex, the advantage is then invariably against her.\n\nBut we require not that woman should be brought up in ignorance. Let us consider the delicacy of her sex, and the duties which she is destined to perform; and to these we may accommodate the education which we bestow upon her. While boys like whatever is attended with motion and noise, girls are fond of such decorations as please the eye. Dolls are the favourite plaything of the sex in their infant years. This is an original taste, of the existence of which we have the plainest evidence. All therefore that we ought to do is, to trace and bring it under proper regulation. Allow the girl to decorate her baby in whatever manner she pleases; while employed about that, she will acquire such skill and dexterity in those arts which are peculiar to her sex, that with scarce any difficulty she will acquire needle work, embroidery and the art of working lace. Her improvements may even be extended as far as designing, an art somewhat connected with taste in dress; but there is no reason that their skill in this art should be carried farther than to the drawing of foliage, fruits, flowers, drapery, and such parts of the art as bear some relation to dress. Always assign reasons for the employment which you give to young girls, but be sure you keep them constantly busy. They ought to be accustomed to laborious industry, as well as to bear the abridgement of their liberty. Use every art to prevent their work from becoming disagreeable to them. For that purpose, let the mother be careful to make herself agreeable. A girl who loves her mother or her aunt, will work cheerfully by them all day; while she to whom her mother is not dearer than all the world besides, seldom turns out well. Never suffer girls, even at their diversions, to be entirely free from restraint, nor allow them to run from one amusement to another. If you now and then detect your daughter using a little artifice to excuse herself from obedience, reflect that artifice is, in a certain degree, natural to the fair sex; and as every natural inclination, when not abused, is upright and good, why should it not be cultivated? In order to give girls proper notions of dress, let them be taught to consider splendour and elegance of dress, as designed only to conceal the natural defects of the person; and to regard it as the noblest triumph, the highest praise, of beauty, to shine with unborrowed lustre in the simplest attire. Forbid not young women to acquire those arts which have a tendency to render them agreeable. Why refuse them the indulgence of learning to dance, to sing, and to study such other accomplishments as afterwards enable them to entertain their husbands? Girls are more disposed to prattle, and at an earlier age, than boys. We may now and then find it necessary to restrain their volubility. But the proper question to them on such occasions is not, as to boys,\nAt this early period, when they are yet strangers to the distinction between good and evil, and therefore unable to form a just judgment concerning any person's conduct, we ought to restrain them carefully from saying what may be disagreeable to those with whom they converse.\n\nGirls are no less incapable than boys of forming distinct notions of religion at an early age. Yet, and even for that very reason, religious instruction should be communicated to them much sooner than to the youth of the other sex. Were we to wait the period when their mental faculties arrive at maturity, we might perhaps lose the happiest time, from our inability to make a right distinction. Since a woman's conduct is subject to public opinion, her belief ought therefore to depend, not on reason, but on authority. Every girl ought to follow the religion of her mother, every married woman that of her husband. They cannot derive a rule of faith from their own inquiry. Let us therefore seek, not so much to instruct them in the reasons of our belief, as to give them clear distinct notions of those articles which we require them to believe. Be more careful to instruct her in those doctrines which have a connexion with morality, than in those mysterious articles which we are required to believe, though we cannot comprehend them.\n\nSuch are the principles on which the education of Emilius's unknown mistress has been conducted.\n\n[Notwithstanding the merit of that part of this treatise in which the author entertains us with the courtship between his Emilius and Sophia, it does not appear to be intimately connected with the subject of education as to render it proper for us to present our readers with a view of it. We therefore pass over the courtship, to give a view of our author's sentiments concerning the advantages to be derived from travelling, and the manner in which it ought to be directed.]\n\nWhen Emilius has formed a firm attachment to Sophia, and by his affinities has been so fortunate as to gain her affections, his great wish now is, to be united with her in the bonds of marriage. But as he is still young, is but imperfectly acquainted with the nature of those duties incumbent on him as a member of a particular society, and is even ignorant of the nature of laws and government, I must separate him from his Sophia, and carry him to gain a knowledge of these things, and of the character and circumstances of mankind, in various countries, and under various forms of civil government, by travelling. Much has been said concerning the propriety of sending young people to travel, in order to complete their education. The multiplicity of books is unfavourable to real knowledge. We read with avidity, and think that by reading we render ourselves prodigiously wise. But we implore on ourselves: the knowledge which we acquire from books is a false species of knowledge, that can never render us truly wise.\n\nTo obtain real knowledge, you must observe nature with your own eyes, and study mankind. But to gain this knowledge by travelling, it is not necessary that we should traverse the universe. Whoever has seen ten Frenchmen has beheld them all; and whoever has surveyed and compared the circumstances and manners of ten different nations may be said to know mankind.\n\nTo pretend that no advantages may be derived from travelling, because some of those who travel return home without having gained much real improvement, would be highly unreasonable. Young people who have had a bad education, and are sent on their travels without any person to direct or superintend their conduct, cannot be expected to improve by visiting foreign countries. But they whom nature has adorned with virtuous dispositions, and have been so happy as to receive a good education, and go abroad with a real desire of improvement, cannot but return with an increase of virtue and wisdom. In this manner shall Emilius conduct his travels. To induce him to improve in the most attentive manner that time which he should spend in travelling, I would let him know, that as he had now attained an age in which it might be proper for him to form some determination with regard to the plan of his future life, he ought therefore to look abroad into the world, to view the various orders in society, to observe the various circumstances of mankind under different forms of government, and in different parts of the globe; and to choose his country, his station, and his profession. With these views should Emilius set out on his travels: and with these views, in the course of our travels, we should inquire into the origin of society and government, into the nature of those principles by means of which men are united in a social state, into the various circumstances which have given rise to so many different forms of government, and into the necessary relation between government and manners. Our stay in the great towns should be but short: for as in them corruption of manners has risen to a great height, and dissipation reigns, a long stay in any great town might be fatal to the virtuous dispositions of Emilius. Yet his attachment to Sophia would alone be sufficient to save him from the dangers to which his virtue is exposed. A young man must either be in love, or be a debauchee. Instances may be pointed out in which virtue has been preserved without the aid of love; but to such instances I can give little credit.\n\nEmilius, however, may now return to his Sophia. His understanding is now much more enlightened than his when he set out on his travels. He is now acquainted with several forms of government, their advantages and defects, with the characters of several different nations, and with the effects which difference in circumstances may be expected to produce on the characters of nations. He has even been so fortunate as to get acquainted with some persons of merit in each of the countries which he has visited. With these advantages gained, and with affection unchanged and unabated, he returns to his Sophia. After having made him acquainted with the languages, the natural history, the government, the arts, customs, and manners, of so many countries, Emilius eagerly informs me that the period which we had destined for our travels is now expired. I ask, What are then his purposes for life? He replies, that he is satisfied with the circumstances in which nature has placed him, and with my endeavours to render him independent on fortune, and wishes only for his Sophia to be happy. After giving him a few advices\nadvises for the regulation of his conduct in life, I conduct him to his Sophia, and behold him united with her in marriage. I behold him happy; with affectionate gratitude he blesses me as the author of his happiness; and I thus receive the reward of all the pains with which I have conducted his education.\n\nSuch are the outlines of the system of education proposed by this singular and original genius. For originality of thought, affecting sentiment, enchanting description, and bold vehement eloquence, this book is one of the noblest pieces of composition, not only in the French language, but even in the whole compass of ancient and modern literature. The irregularity of his method, however, renders it a very difficult task to give an abridged view of his work. He conducts his pupil, indeed, from infancy to manhood: But instead of being merely a system of education, his work is besides a treasure of moral and philosophical knowledge. He has chosen a path, and follows it from the bottom to the summit of the hill: yet whenever a flower appears on the right or left hand, he eagerly steps aside to pluck it; and sometimes, when he has once stepped aside, a new object catches his eye and seduces him still farther. Still, however, he returns. His observations are in many places loyally thrown together, and many things are introduced, the want of which would by no means have injured either the unity or the regularity of his work. If we attempt to review the principles on which he proceeds in reprobating the prevalent modes of education, and pointing out a new course, his primary and leading one seems to be, that we ought to watch and second the designs of nature, without anticipating her. As the tree blossoms, the flowers blow, and the fruit ripens at a certain period; so there is a time fixed in the order of nature for the sensitive, another for the intellectual, and another for the moral powers of man to display themselves. We in vain attempt to teach children to reason concerning truth and falsehood, concerning right and wrong, before the proper period arrive: We only confound their notions of things, and load their memories with words without meaning; and thus prevent both their reasoning and moral powers from attaining that strength and acuteness of which they are naturally capable. He attempts to trace the progress of nature; and to mark in what manner she gradually raises the human mind to the full use of all its faculties. Upon the observations which he has made in tracing the gradual progress of the powers of the human mind towards maturity, his system is founded.\n\nAs it is impossible to communicate to the blind any just ideas of colours, or to the deaf of sounds: so it must be acknowledged, that we cannot possibly communicate to children ideas which they have not faculties to comprehend. If they are, for a certain period of life, merely sensitive animals, it must be folly to treat them during that period as rational and moral beings. But is it a truth that they are, during any part of life, guided solely by instinct, and capable only of sensation? Or, how long is the duration of that period? Has nature unkindly left them to be, till the age of twelve, the prey of appetite and passion? So far are the facts of which we have had occasion to take notice, concerning the history of infancy and childhood, from leading to such a conclusion, that to us it appears undeniable Education, that children begin to reason very soon after their entrance into life. When the material world first opens on their senses, they are ignorant of the qualities and relations of surrounding objects: they know not, for instance, whether the candle which they look at be near or at a distance; whether the fire with which they are agreeably warmed may also affect them with a painful sensation. But they remain not long in this state of absolute ignorance. They soon appear to have acquired some ideas of the qualities and relative situation of bodies. They cannot, however, acquire such ideas, without exerting reasoning powers in a certain degree. Appearances must be compared, and inferences drawn, before knowledge can be gained. It is not sensation alone which informs us of the relative distances of bodies; nor can sensation alone teach us, that the same effects which we have formerly observed will be again produced by the same cause.\n\nBut if children appear capable of reasoning at a very early period, they appear also to be at a very early period subject to the influence of the passions: they are angry or pleased, merry or sad, friends or enemies, even while they hang at the breast; instead of being selfish, they are naturally liberal and social. And if we observe them with candid attention, we will find that the passions do not display themselves sooner than the moral sense. As nature has wisely ordered, that we should not see, and hear, and feel, without being able to compare and draw inferences from our perceptions; so it is a no less certain and evident law of nature, that the passions no sooner begin to agitate the human breast, than we become able to distinguish the beauty and the deformity of virtue and vice. The child is not only capable of gratitude and attachment to the person who treats him with kindness; he is also capable of distinguishing between gratitude and ingratitude, and of viewing each with proper sentiments. He cries when you refuse to gratify his desires; but he boldly infers that he is injured when you use him cruelly or unjustly. It is indeed impossible to attend to the conduct of children during infancy, without being convinced that they are, even then, capable of moral distinctions. So little are they acquainted with artificial language, that we and they do not then well understand each other. But view their actions; consider those signs by which nature has taught them to express themselves. Our limbs, our features, and our senses, are not gradually and by piecemeal bestowed as we advance towards maturity; the infant body comes not into the world mutilated or defective: why then, in point of mental abilities, should we be for a while brutes, without becoming rational and moral beings till the fulness of time be accomplished? All the differences between the phenomena of manhood and those of infancy and childhood may be accounted for, if we only reflect, that when children come into the world, they are totally unacquainted with all the objects around them; with the appearances of nature, and the institutions of society; that they are sent into the world in a feeble state, in order that the helplessness occasioned by their ignorance may attract the notice and gain the affluence of those who are able to help them; and that they attain not full strength in the powers, either of mind or body, nor\nEducation, nor a sufficient acquaintance with nature, with artificial language, and with the arts and institutions of society, till they arrive at manhood.\n\nEven Rousseau, notwithstanding the art with which he lays down his system, cannot avoid acknowledging indirectly, on several occasions, that our social dispositions, our rational and our moral powers, display themselves at an earlier period than that at which he wishes us to begin the cultivation of them.\n\nBut though the great outlines of his system be merely theory, unsupported by facts, nay plainly contradictory to facts; yet his observations on the impropriety or absurdity of the prevalent modes of education are almost always just, and many of the particular directions which he gives for the conducting of education are very judicious. He is often fanciful, and often deviates from the common road, only to show that he is able to walk in a separate path. Yet why should he be opposed with so much virulence, or branded with so many reproachful epithets? His views are liberal and extensive; his heart seems to have glowed with benevolence; his book contains much observation of human actions; displays an intimate acquaintance with the motives which sway the human heart; and if not a perfect system for education, is yet superior to what any other writers had before done upon the subject. It is surely true, that we ourselves often call forth evil passions in the breasts of children, and impress them with bad habits: it is no less true that we put books in their hands, and load their memory with words, when we ought rather to direct their attention to things, to the phenomena of nature, and the simplest arts of life. The form in which he has chosen to communicate his sentiments on the subject of education renders the perusal of it more pleasing, and his precepts more plain, than they would otherwise have been: it is nearly that dramatic form with which we are so much delighted in some of the noblest compositions of the ancients.\n\nAfter viewing the public establishments for education which existed in some of the most renowned states of antiquity; and after listening to the sentiments of the experienced Quintilian, the learned Milton, the judicious Locke, and the bold fanciful Rousseau, on this interesting subject; it may now be proper to lay before the reader our own sentiments concerning the education of youth under a few distinct heads.\n\nIndeed, if we were disposed to give abridgments of all the books which have been written on the subject of education, or even to hint at all the various modes which have been recommended by teachers or theorists; we might swell this article to an amazing size: Nay, were we only to take notice of the many elegant and sensible writers who have of late endeavoured to call the attention of the public to this subject, we might extend it to an immoderate length. A Kames, a Priestley, a Knox, a Madame de Sillery, and a Berquin, might well attract and fix our attention. But as, among such a crowd of writers, every thing advanced by each cannot be original; and even of those things which are original, only a certain, and that perhaps even a moderate, proportion, can be just and judicious; and as they often either borrow from one another, or at least agree in a very friendly manner, though in some things they profess a determined hostility; therefore\n\nwe shall content ourselves with having taken notice of four of the most respectable writers on the subject.\n\nIn prefenting to our readers the result of our own observations and reflections, we shall throw our thoughts nearly under the following heads. The management of children from their birth till they attain the age of five or six; from that period till the age of puberty; and from that age till manhood; private and public education; religion and morals; the languages; natural philosophy; the education of people of rank and fortune; education of persons designed for a mercantile employment; and for the other humbler occupations in active life not particularly connected with literature; education of the female sex; foreign travel; knowledge of the world; and entrance into active life. We do not pretend to be able to include under these heads everything worthy of notice in the subject of education: but under these we will be able to comprehend almost everything of importance that has occurred to us on the subject.\n\nI. On the Management of Infants from the Time of their Birth till they attain the Age of five or six.\n\nThe young of no other animal comes into the world in so helpless a state, or continues so long to need assistance, as that of the human species. The calf, the lamb, and the kid, are vigorous and lively at the instant of their birth; require only, for a very short period, nourishment and protection from their respective dams; and soon attain such degrees of strength and activity as to become entirely independent. The infancy of the oviparous animals is not of longer continuance: And, indeed, whatever department of the animal world we may choose to survey, we still find that no species is subject to the same severe laws as man during the first period of life.\n\nYet the character and the views of man are so very different from those of the other animals, that a more careful attention to these may perhaps induce us to regard this seeming severity rather as an instance of the peculiar kindness of the Author of nature. From every observation which has been hitherto made on the powers and operations of the inferior animals, we are led to consider them as guided and actuated chiefly, if not solely, in reply to instinct, appetite, and sensation: their views extend not beyond the present moment; nor do they acquire helplessness of infancy, new knowledge or prudence as they advance in life. But the character of the human race is much more exalted. We have also powers and organs of sensation, instincts and appetites; but these are the most ignoble parts of our nature: our rational faculties and moral powers elevate us above the brutes, and advance us to an alliance with superior beings. These rational faculties and moral powers render us capable of social life, of artificial language, or art, of science, and of religion. Now, were one of the species to come into the world full grown, possessed of that bodily strength and vigour which distinguishes manhood, his ignorance would still render him inadequate to the duties of life; nay, would even render him unable to procure means for his subsistence: while his manly appearance would deprive him of the compassion and benevolent affluence of others; and his strength and vigour would also render him less docile and obedient than is necessary, in order that\nEducation. that he may receive instruction in the duties and arts of life. Again, were the period of infancy as short to the human species as to the other animals; were we to be no longer subjected to a parent's authority, or protected by his care, than the bird or the quadruped; we should be exposed to the dangers and difficulties of the world before we had acquired sufficient knowledge or prudence to conduct us through them, before we had gained any acquaintance with the ordinary phenomena of nature, or were able to use the language or practice the arts of men in a social state.\n\nSince then, it is by the benevolence of nature that we are feeble and helpless at our entrance into life, and that our progress towards maturity is slow and gradual; since nature has destined us to be for a considerable time under the care and authority of our parents; and since the manner in which we are managed during that early part of life has so important an influence on our future character and conduct: it is therefore incumbent on parents to direct that tenderness, which they naturally feel for their offspring, in such a manner as to second the views of nature.\n\nWhen children come into the world, instinct directs them to receive nourishment from the breast, and to claim attention to their pains and wants by crying. We attend to their signs, and strive to render them as easy as we can. They are walked, clothed with such garments as we think most suitable, and fuddled either by their mother or by some other woman who is considered as proper for the purpose. The absurd mode of swaddling up infants in such a manner as to confine them almost from all motion, and leave scarce a limb at liberty, which has been so often exclaimed against and represented as highly injurious to the symmetry and vigour of the human frame, is now almost entirely laid aside; and therefore we need not raise our voice against it. Still, however, there are certainly too many pins and bandages used in the dress of infants: these are unfavourable to the circulation of the blood, impede the growth, and often occasion those tears and that peevishness which we rashly attribute to the natural ill humour of the poor creatures. Their dress ought to be loose and cool, so as to press hard on no joint, nor vein nor muscle; and to leave every limb at liberty. If too heavy and close, it may occasion too copious a perspiration, and at the same time confine the matter perspired on the surface of the skin; than which nothing can be more prejudicial to the health of the child. It may also, however, be too thin and cool: for as moderate warmth is necessary to the vegetation of plants; so it is no less necessary for promoting the growth of animals: and, therefore, though the dress of infants ought to be loose and easy, yet still it should be moderately warm.\n\nIt is common for mothers in affluent or even in comfortable circumstances, to forego the pleasure of nursing their own children, that they may avoid the fatigues with which it is attended. This practice has long prevailed in various ages and among various nations: it has been often reproved with all the warmth of passion, and all the vehemence of eloquence, as dishonourable, inhuman, contradictory to the designs of nature, and destructive of natural affection: yet still it prevails; fathers and mothers are still equally deaf to the voice of nature and the declamations of philosophers. Indeed, in a luxurious age, such a practice may be naturally expected to prevail. In such an age, they who are possessed of opulence generally persuade themselves, that, to be happy, is to spend their time wholly amid diversions and amusements, without defending to useful industry, or troubling themselves about the ordinary duties of life. Influenced by such notions, they think it proper for them to manage their family affairs, and to nurse and educate their children, by proxy; nay, to do for themselves nothing that another can perform for them. It is vain to make a serious opposition to these absurd notions; the false views of happiness, the pride and the indolence produced by luxury, will still be too powerful for us. We must not hope to persuade the mother, that to receive the cares, to behold the smiles, and to mark the bodily and mental powers of her child in their gradual progress towards maturity, would be more than a sufficient compensation for all the fatigues which she would undergo in nursing and watching over him in his infant years. We need not mention, that the mutual affection between a mother and her child, which is partly the effect of instinct, depends also, in no inconsiderable degree, on the child's spending the period of infancy in its mother's arms; and that when she substitutes another in her place, the child naturally transfers its affection to the person who performs to it the duties of a mother. We need not urge these, nor the various other reasons which seem to recommend to every mother the province of fuddling her own children, and watching over their infant years; for we will either not be heard, or be listened to with contempt. Yet we may venture to suggest, that if the infant must be committed to a stranger, some degree of prudence may be employed in selecting the person to whom he is to be intrusted. Her health, her temper, and her manner of speaking, must be attended to. A number of other qualifications are also to be required in a nurse: but it is rather the business of the physician to give directions with regard to these. If her habit of body be any way unhealthy, the constitution of the infant that sucks her milk cannot but be injured: if her temper be rough or peevish, the helpless child subjected to her power will be often harshly treated; its spirit will be broken, and its temper fouled: if her pronunciation be inarticulate or too rapid, the child may acquire a bad habit when it first begins to exert its vocal organs, which will not be easily corrected.\n\nIn the milder seasons of the year, infants ought to be frequently carried abroad. Not only is the open air favourable to health, but the freshness, the beauty, the variety, and the lively colours of the scenes, have even a tendency to enliven and invigorate the powers of the mind. At this period, the faculties of the understanding and the dispositions of the heart generally acquire that particular bias, and those distinguishing features, which characterize the individual during the future part of his life, as quick or dull, mild or passionate; and which, though they be generally attributed to the original conformation of the mind by the hand of nature, yet are owing rather to the circumstances in which we are placed, and the manner in which we are treated, during the first part of life.\n\nWhen children begin to walk, our fondness disposes\nEducation us to adopt many expedients to assist them. But these seem to be improper. It is enough for us to watch over them so as to guard them from any danger which they might otherwise incur by their first attempts to move about. Those who advise us not to be too anxious to preserve children from those slight hurts to which they are exposed from their disposition to activity, before they have acquired sufficient strength or caution, certainly give a judicious piece of advice which ought to be listened to. By being too attentive to them, we teach them to be careless of themselves; by seeming to regard every little accident which befalls them as a most dreadful calamity, we inspire them with timidity, and prevent them from acquiring manly fortitude. When children begin to lip out a few words or syllables, the pleasure which we feel at hearing them aim at the use of our language, dispose us to listen to them with such attention as to relieve them from the necessity of learning an open distinct articulation. Thus we teach them to express themselves in a rapid, indistinct, and hesitating manner, which we often find it difficult, sometimes even impossible, to correct, when they are farther advanced. Would we teach them a plain distinct articulation, we ought not only to speak plainly and distinctly in their presence, but also to disregard their questions and requests, if not expressed with all the openness and distinctness of pronunciation of which they are capable.\n\nMan is naturally an imitative animal. Scarce any of our natural dispositions is displayed at an earlier period than our disposition to imitation. Children's first amusements are dramatic performances, imitative of the arts and actions of men. This is one proof among others, that even in infancy our reasoning faculties begin to display themselves; for we cannot agree with some philosophers that children are actuated and guided solely by instinct in their attempts at imitation.\n\nHowever that be, the happiest use might be made of this principle which discovers itself so early in the infant mind. Whatever you wish the child to acquire, do in his presence in such a manner as to tempt him to imitate you. Thus, without forcing his mind by restraint during this gay innocent period of life, you may begin even now to cultivate his natural powers. Were it impossible at this time to communicate any instruction to the boy, without banishing that sprightly gaiety which naturally distinguishes this happy age, it would be best to think only how he might lose his time in the least disadvantageous manner. But this is far from being necessary. Even now the little creature is disposed to imitation, is capable of emulation, and feels a desire to please those whose kindness has gained his affection. Even now his sentiments and conduct may be influenced by rewards when prudently bestowed, and by punishments when judiciously inflicted. Why then should we hesitate to govern him by the same principles, by which the laws of God and society affect their influence on our own sentiments and conduct? Indeed, the imprudent manner in which children are too generally managed at this early period, would almost tempt us to think it impossible to instruct them, as yet, without injuring both their abilities and dispositions. But this is owing solely to the carelessness, stupidity, or capricious conduct of those under whose education they are placed.\n\nIs implicit obedience to be exacted of children? And what period of life should we begin to enforce it? Whether, as children appear to be capable both of reasoning and when of moral distinctions at a very early age; and as they to be exact are so weak, so inexperienced, so ignorant of the powers of surrounding bodies, and of the language, institutions, and arts of men, as to be incapable of supporting or conducting themselves without direction or assistance; it seems therefore proper that they be required even to submit to authority. To the necessity of nature both they and we must on many occasions submit. But if the will of a parent or tutor be always found scarce less unalterable than the necessity of nature, it will always meet with the same respectful submissive resignation. It may not perhaps be always proper to explain to children the reasons for which we require their obedience: because, as the range of their ideas is much less extensive than ours; as they do not well understand our language, or comprehend our modes of reasoning; and as they are now and then under the influence of passion and caprice, as well as people who are farther advanced in life; we are therefore likely to fail in making them comprehend our reasons, or in convincing them that they are well grounded. And as it is proper to exact obedience of children; so we should begin to require it as soon as they become capable of any considerable degree of activity. Yet we must not confine them like slaves, without allowing them to speak, to look, or to move, but as we give the word. By such treatment we could expect only to render them peevish and capricious. It will be enough, at first, if we let them know that obedience is to be exacted; and if we restrain them only where, if left at liberty, they would be exposed to imminent danger.\n\nIf then, at so early a time of life as before the age of five or six, it is possible to render children obedient, and to communicate to them instruction; what art, or what learning, ought we to teach them at that period? To give a proper answer to this question, is no easy matter. It seems at first difficult to determine, whether we ought yet to initiate them in letters. But as their apprehension is now quick, and their memory pretty tenacious, there cannot be a more favourable time for this very purpose. As soon as they are capable of a distinct articulation, and seem to possess any power of attention, we may with the greatest propriety begin to teach them the alphabet. The most artful, alluring methods may be adopted to render the horrid book agreeable; or we may use the voice of authority, and command attention for a few minutes; but no harshness, no severity, and scarce any restraint. At the same time, it will be proper to allow the little creatures to run much about in the open air, to exercise their limbs, and to cultivate those social dispositions which already begin to appear, by playing with their equals.\n\nSuch are the thoughts which have suggested themselves to us concerning the management of children in mere infancy. What an amiable little creature would the boy or girl be, who were brought up in a manner not inconsistent with the spirit of these few hints? Behold him healthy and vigorous, mild, sprightly, and cheerful!\nEducation ful: He is submissive and docile, yet not dull or timid; he appears capable of love, of pity, and of gratitude. His mind is hitherto, however, almost wholly uninformed: he is acquainted but with a few of the objects around him; and knows but little of the language, manners, and institutions of men: but he feels the impulse of an ardent curiosity, and all the powers of his mind are alive and active.\n\nII. On the Management of Children between the Age of five or six and the Age of Puberty.\n\nAt this period it may be proper, not only to exact obedience, and to call the child’s attention for a few minutes now and then to those things of which the knowledge is likely to be afterwards useful to him: but we may now venture to require of him a regular steady application, during a certain portion of his time, to such things as we wish him to learn. Before this time it would have been wrong to confine his attention to any particular task. The attempt could have produced no other effect than to destroy his natural gaiety and cheerfulness, to blunt the natural quickness of his powers of apprehension, and to render hateful that which you wished him to acquire. Now, however, the case is somewhat different: The child is not yet sensible of the advantages which he may derive from learning to read, for instance; or even though he were able to foresee all the advantages which he will obtain by skill in the art of reading through the course of life; yet is it the character of human nature, at every stage of life, to be so much influenced by present objects in preference to future views, that the sense of its utility alone would not be sufficient to induce him to apply to it. Even at the age of 12, of 20, of 50; nay, in extreme old age, when reason is become very peripatetic, and the passions are mortified; still we are unable to regulate our conduct solely by views of utility. Nothing could be more absurd, therefore, than to permit the child to spend his time in foolish tricks, or in idleness, till views of utility should prompt him to spend it in a different manner. No; let us begin early to habituate him to application and to the industrious exertion of his powers. By endowing him with powers of activity and apprehension, and rendering him capable of pursuing with a steady eye those objects which attract his desires, nature plainly points out to us in what manner we ought to cultivate his earlier years. Besides, we can command his obedience, we can awaken his curiosity, we can rouse his emulation, we can gain his affection, we can call forth his natural disposition to imitation, and we can influence his mind by the hope of reward and the fear of punishment. When we have so many means of establishing our authority over the mind of the boy without tyranny or usurpation; it cannot surely be difficult, if we are capable of any moderation and prudence, to cultivate his powers, by making him begin at this period to give regular application to something that may afterwards be useful.\n\nAnd if the boy must now begin to dedicate some portion of his time regularly to a certain task, what task will be most suitable? Even that to which children are usually first required to apply; continue teaching learnt at the him to read. Be not afraid that his abilities will suffer from an attention to books at so early an age. Say not Education that it is folly to teach him words before he have gained a knowledge of things. It is necessary, it is the design of nature, that he should be employed in acquiring a knowledge of things, and gaining an acquaintance with the vocal and written signs by which we denote them, at the same time. These are intimately connected; the one leads to the other. When you view any object, you attempt to give it a name, or seek to learn the name by which men have agreed to distinguish it: in the same manner, when the names of substances or of qualities are communicated to us, we are desirous of knowing what they signify. At the same time, so imperfect is the knowledge of nature which children can acquire from their own unassisted observation, that they must have frequent recourse to our affluence before they can form any distinct notions of those objects and scenes which they behold. Indeed language cannot be taught, without teaching that it is merely a system of signs, and explaining what each particular sign is designed to signify. If, therefore, language is not only necessary for facilitating the mutual intercourse of men, but is even useful for enabling us to obtain some knowledge of external nature, and if the knowledge of language has a natural tendency to advance our knowledge of things; to acquaint ourselves with it must therefore be regarded as an object of the highest importance: it must also be regarded as one of the first objects to which we ought to direct the attention of children. But the very same reasons which prove the propriety of making children acquainted with those artificial vocal signs which we use to express our ideas of things, prove also the propriety of teaching them those other signs by which we express these in writing. It is possible indeed, nay it frequently happens, that we attempt to instruct children in language in too improper a manner as to confound their notions of things, and to prevent their intellectual powers from making that improvement of which they are naturally capable; but it is also possible to initiate them in the art of reading, and in the knowledge of language, with better auspices and happier effects. The knowledge of language may be considered as the key by which we obtain access to all the stores of natural and moral knowledge.\n\nThough we now agree to confine our pupil to a certain task, and have determined that his first task shall be meant, how to learn to read; yet we do not mean to require that he be confined to this task during the greatest part of the day, or that his attention be ferociously directed to no other object. To subject him to too severe restraint would produce the most unfavourable effects on his genius, his temper, and his dispositions. It is in consequence of the injudicious management of children, while they are sometimes suffered to run riot, and at other times cruelly confined like prisoners or slaves; it is in consequence of this, that we behold so many instances of peevishness, caprice, and invincible aversion to all serious application at this period of life. But were a due medium observed, were restraint duly tempered with liberty and indulgence, nothing would be more easy than to dispose children to cheerful obedience, and to communicate to them instruction at this age. That part of their time which they are left to enjoy at liberty, they naturally dedicate to their little sports.\nEducation. The favourite sports of boys are generally active; those of girls, sedentary. Of each we may take advantage, to prepare them for the future employments of life. However, neither are the amusements of boys invariably active, nor those of girls always sedentary; for as yet, the manners and dispositions of the two sexes are distinguished rather by habit or accident than by nature. The disposition to activity which characterizes children, is no less favourable to health than to their improvement in knowledge and prudence; their active sports have a tendency to promote their growth and add new vigour to their limbs. Perhaps, even at this time, children might be enticed to learn the elements of natural philosophy and natural history amid their amusements and sports. Birds, butterflies, dogs, and other animals, are now favourite objects of their care; their curiosity is powerfully roused by the appearance of any strange object; and many of the simplest experiments of natural philosophy are so pleasing, that they cannot fail to attract the attention even of those who are least under the influence of curiosity.\n\nYet it would be improper to insist on their attention to these things as a task: if we can make them regard them as amusements, it will be well; if not, we must defer them to some happier season. They might also, by proper management, be led to acquire some skill in the arts. They build mimic houses, and fill them with suitable furniture; they construct little boats, and sail them; they will fence-in little gardens, and cultivate them; and we even see them imitate all the labours of the husbandman. Such is the pleasure which man naturally feels in exerting his powers, and in acting with design. Let us encourage this disposition. These are the most suitable amusements in which they can engage.\n\nAs the boy's attention to literary objects is still supposed to be continued, he will soon be able to read with some correctness and facility. It becomes an object of importance, and of no small difficulty, to determine what books are to be put into his hands, and in what manner his literary education is to be conducted. After the child is made acquainted with the names and powers of the letters, with their combination into syllables, and with the combination of these again into words, so that he can read with tolerable facility; it will be proper that the pieces of reading which are put into his hands be such as are descriptive of the actions of men, of the scenes of external nature, and of the forms and characters of animals. With these he is already in some degree acquainted; these are the objects of his daily attention; beyond them the range of his ideas does not yet extend; and therefore other subjects will be likely to render his talk disagreeable to him. Besides, our present object is to teach him words: in order to teach him words, we must let him know their signification; but till he have acquired a very considerable knowledge of language, till he have gained a rich fund of simple ideas, it will be impossible for him to read or to hear with understanding on any other subject but these. And let us not as yet be particularly anxious to communicate to him religious or moral instruction, otherwise than by our example, and by causing him to act in such a manner as we think most proper. Our great business at present is, to make him acquainted with our language, and to teach him in what manner we use it to express our ideas. Education. By his own observation, and by our instruction, he will soon become capable of comprehending all that we wish to communicate: But let us not be too hasty; the boy cannot long view the actions of mankind, and observe the economy of the animal and the vegetable world, without becoming capable of receiving both religious and moral instruction when judiciously communicated.\n\nAs soon as the pupil can read and spell with tolerable facility, and has acquired sufficient strength of arm and fingers to hold a pen, it may be proper to initiate him in the art of writing. If this art is not made disagreeable by the manner in which his application to it is required, he will learn it without difficulty. Children's natural disposition to imitate, particularly whatever depends on manual operation, renders this art peculiarly easy and pleasing to them, when they are not harshly forced to apply to it, nor suffered to get into a habit of performing their task with haste and negligence.\n\nIt requires indeed the most cautious prudence, the nicest delicacy, and the most artful address, to prevail with children to give a cheerful and attentive application to any appointed task. If you are too stern and rigid in enforcing application, you may seemingly obtain your object: the child sits motionless, and fixes his eye on his book or copy; but his attention you cannot command; his mind is beyond your reach, and can elude your tyranny; it wanders from the present objects, and flies with pleasure to those scenes and objects in which it has found delight. Thus you are disappointed of your purpose; and, besides, inspire the child with such aversion both to you and to those objects to which you wish him to apply, that perhaps at no future period will he view learning otherwise than with disgust.\n\nAgain, gentleness, and the arts of insinuation, will not always be successful. If you permit the child to apply just when he pleases; if you listen readily to all his pretences and excuses; in short, if you seem to consider learning as a matter not of the highest importance, and treat him with kindness while he pays but little attention and makes but slow progress; the consequences of your behaving to him in this manner will be scarce less unfavourable than those which attend imprudent and unreasonable severity. It is, however, scarcely possible to give particular directions how to treat children so as to allure them to learning, and at the same time to command their serious attention. But the prudent and affectionate parent and the judicious tutor will not always be unsuccessful; since there are so many circumstances in the condition of children, and so many principles in their nature, which subject them to our will.\n\nThe principles of arithmetic ought to make a part of the boy's education as soon as his reasoning powers appear to have attained such strength and quickness that he will be able to comprehend them. Arithmetic affords more exercise to the reasoning powers of the mind than any other of those branches of learning to which we apply in our earlier years; and if the child's attention be directed to it at a proper period, if he be allowed to proceed slowly, and if care be taken to make him comprehend fully the principles upon which each particular\nparticular operation proceeds, it will contribute much to increase the strength and the acuteness of the powers of his understanding.\n\nWhere the learned languages are regarded as an object worthy of attention, the boy is generally initiated in them about this time, or perhaps earlier. We have referred to a separate head the arguments which occur to us for and against the practice of instructing children in the dead languages; and shall therefore only observe in this place, that the study of them ought not to engross the learner's attention so entirely as to exclude other parts of education.\n\nFrom arithmetic our pupil may proceed to the practical branches of the mathematics; And in all of these, as well as in every other branch of learning, what you teach him will be best remembered and most thoroughly understood, if you afford him a few opportunities of applying his lessons to real life in life. Geometry and geography are two most important branches of education; but are often taught in such a manner, that no real benefit is derived from the knowledge of them. The means which Rousseau proposes for initiating young people in these and in several other of the arts and sciences are excellent; and if judiciously applied, could hardly fail of success.\n\nWhile boys are engaged in these and in the languages, they may also attend to and cultivate the bodily exercises; such as dancing, fencing, and horsemanship. Each of these exercises is almost absolutely necessary for one who is designed to have intercourse with the world; and besides, they have a tendency to render the powers of the body active and vigorous, and even to add new courage and firmness to the mind.\n\nWhen our pupil has acquired some knowledge of his own and of the learned languages, has gained some skill in the principles of arithmetic and of practical mathematics, and has received some instruction in the principles of morality and religion, or even before this time, it will be proper to begin him to the practice of composition. Themes, versions, and letters, the first exercises in composition which the boy is usually required to perform, none of them seems happily calculated for leading him to increase his knowledge, or to acquire the power of expressing himself with ease and elegance. Without enlarging on the impropriety or absurdity of these exercises, we will venture to propose something different, which we cannot help thinking would conduce more effectually to the end in view. It has been already observed, that the curiosity of children is amazingly eager and active, and that every new object powerfully attracts their regard; but they cannot view any object without taking notice of its most obvious qualities; any animal, for instance, without taking notice of its shape, its colour, its seeming mildness or ferocity; and they are generally pretty ready to give an account of anything extraordinary which they have observed. How easy then would it be to require them to write down an account of any new object exposed to their observation? The task would not be difficult; and every new piece of composition which they presented to us would add so much to their knowledge of nature. We might even require such specimens of their accuracy of observation and skill in language, at times when they enjoyed no opportunities of beholding new or surprising objects; a tree, a flower, a field, a house, an animal, any other simple object, should be the subject of their exercise. After some time, we might require them to describe something more various and complex. They might give an account of several objects placed in a relative situation; as, a stream, and the vale through which it flows; or, a bird, and the manner in which it constructs its nest; or, of one object successively assuming various appearances, as the bud, the flower, the apple. Human actions are daily exposed to their observation, and powerfully attract their attention. By and by, therefore, their talk should be to describe some action which had lately passed in their presence. We need not pursue this hint farther; but, if we mistake not, by these means young people might sooner, and much more certainly, be taught to express themselves with ease and correctness in writing, than by any of the exercises which they are at present caused to perform with a view to that. Besides, they would at the same time acquire much more real knowledge. The study of words would then be rendered truly subservient to their acquiring a knowledge of things.\n\nWe cannot descend to every particular of that series of education in which we wish the boy to be engaged from that period when he first becomes capable of serious application till he reach the age of puberty. It is not necessary that we should, after having given abstracts of what has been offered to the world by so many respectable writers on the subject.\n\nThe few hints which we have thrown out will be sufficient to show, in general, in what manner we wish the youth's education to be conducted during this period. Let the parent and the tutor bear in mind, that much depends on their example, with regard to the dispositions and manners of the youth; and let them carefully strive to form him to gentleness, to firmness, to patient industry, and to vigorous courage; let them, if possible, keep him at a distance from that contagion with which the evil example of worthless servants and playfellows will be likely to infect him. Now is the time for sowing the seeds of piety and virtue; if carefully sown now, they will scarce fail to grow up, and bear fruit in future life.\n\nIII. From Puberty to Manhood.\n\nThis age is every way a very important period in human life. Whether we consider the change which now takes place in the bodily constitution; or the passion which now first begins to agitate the breast, still we must regard this as a critical season to the youth. The business of those whose care he is still intrusted, is to watch over him so as to prevent the pallion for the sex from hurrying him to shameful and vicious indulgence, and from seducing him to habits of frivolity and indolence; to prevent him from becoming either the shameless rake, or the trifling coxcomb. Though so furious is the impulse of that appetite which now fires the bosom and shoots through the veins of the youth, that to restrain him from the excesses to which it leads can be no easy task; yet if his education has been hitherto conducted with prudence, if he is fond of manly exercises, active, sober,\nEducation, and temperate, and still influenced by modesty and the sense of shame; even this may through the blest- \ning of heaven be accomplished. It is impossible to give better directions than those of Rousseau for this purpose. Let the young man know his situation; set before him in a striking light the virtue which he may practice by restraining appetite, and the frightful fatal vices into which he may be hurried. But trust not to precept, nor to any views which you can lay before him, either of the disgracefulness and the pernicious consequences of vice, or of the dignity and the happy fruits of virtue. Something more must be done. Watch over him with the attention of an Argus; engage him in the most active and fatiguing sports. Carefully keep him at a distance from all such company, and such books, as may suggest to his mind ideas of love, and of the gratification at which it aims. But still all your precautions will not counteract the designs of nature; nor do you wish to oppose her designs. The youth under your care must feel the impulse of desire, and become susceptible of love. Let him then fix his affections on some virtuous young woman. His attachment to her will raise him above debauchery, and teach him to despise brutal pleasures: it will operate as a motive to dispose him to apply to such arts, and to pursue such branches of knowledge, as may be necessary for his future establishment in the world. The good sense of Rousseau on this head renders it less necessary for us to enlarge on it; especially as we are to treat of some articles separately which regard the management of youth at this period.\n\nIV. Religion and Morals.\n\nIn pointing out the general plan of education which appears to us the most proper to be pursued in order to form a virtuous and respectable member of society, we took but slight notice of the important objects of religion and morals. At what period and in what manner, ought the principles of religion and morality to be infilled into the youthful mind? It has been before observed, that children are capable of reasoning and of moral distinctions even at a very early age. But they cannot then comprehend our reasonings, nor enter into our moral distinctions; because they are strangers to our language, and to the artificial manner in which we arrange our ideas when we express them in conversation or in writing. It follows, then, that as soon as they are sufficiently acquainted with our language, it must be proper to communicate to them the principles and precepts of morality and religion. Long before this time, they are diligent and accurate observers of human actions. For a short period it is merely the external act which they attend to and observe; soon, however, they penetrate farther; conscious themselves of reflection and volition, they regard us also as thinking beings; conscious of benevolent and of unfriendly dispositions, they regard us as acting with design, and as influenced by passion; naturally imitative animals, they are disposed in their conduct to follow the example which we set before them. By our example we may teach them piety and virtue long before it can be proper to offer them religious or moral instruction in a formal manner.\n\nWe cannot presume to determine at what particular period children ought to be first informed of their relations to God and to society, and of the duties incumbent on them in consequence of those relations. That period will be different to different children, according to the pains which have been taken, and the means which have been employed, in cultivating their natural powers. Perhaps even where the most judicious maxims of education have been adopted, and have been pursued with the happiest effects, it cannot be sooner than the age of eight or nine. But even before this period much may be done. Show the child your reverence for religion and virtue; talk in his presence, and in the plainest, simplest terms, though not directly to him, of the existence of God the creator, the preserver and the governor of the world; speak of the constant dependance of every creature on the gracious care of that Being; mention with ardour the gratitude and obedience which we owe to him as our great parent and best benefactor; next, speak of the mutual relations of society; of the duties of children and parents, of masters and servants, of man to man. At length, when his mind is prepared by such discourses which have passed in his presence without being addressed to him, you may begin to explain to him in a direct manner the leading doctrines of religion. He will now be able to comprehend you, when you address him on that important subject: the truths which you communicate will make a powerful impression on his mind; an impression which neither the corruption and dissipation of the world, nor the force of appetite and passion, will ever be able to efface.\n\nSome writers on this subject have asserted, that Habit. youth are incapable of any just ideas of religion till they attain a much more advanced age; and have insisted, that, for this reason, no attempts should be made to communicate to them the articles of our creed in their earlier years. This doctrine, both from its novelty and from its pernicious tendency, has provoked the keenest opposition. It has, however, been opposed rather with keenness than with acuteness or skill. Its opponents seem to have generally allowed that children are incapable of reasoning and of moral distinctions; but they have ascribed wonderful effects to habit. Enrich the memories of children, say they, with the maxims of morality, and with the doctrines of religion; teach them prayers, and call them to engage in all the ordinances of religion. What though they comprehend not the meaning of what they learn? What though they understand not for what purpose you bid them repeat their prayers, nor why you confine them on the Lord's day from their ordinary amusements? Their powers will at length ripen, and they will then see in what they have been employed, and derive the highest advantage from the irksome tasks to which you confined them. You have formed them to habits which they will not be able to lay aside. After this they cannot but be religious at some period of life, even though you have inspired them with a disgust for the exercises of religion. Those good people have also talked of the principle of the affec- \ntion of ideas. As no man stands alone in society, say they; so no one idea exists in the mind single and unconnected with others: as you are connected with your parents, your children, your friends, your coun- \ntrymen; so the idea of a tree, for instance, is connect-\nEducation, ed with that of the field in which it grows, of the fruit which it bears, and of contiguous, dissimilar, and resembling objects. When any one set of related ideas have been often presented to the mind in connexion with one another, the mind at length comes to view them as so intimately united, that any particular one among them never fails to introduce the rest. Revisit the scenes in which you spent your earliest years; the spots and companions of your youth naturally arise to your recollection. Have you applied to the study of the classics with reluctance and constraint, and suffered much from the severity of parents and tutors for your indifference to Greek and Latin; you will, perhaps, never through the course of life see a grammar school, without recollecting your sufferings, nor look on a Virgil or Homer without remembering the stripes and confinement which they once occasioned to you. In the same manner, when religious principles are impressed on the mind in infancy in a proper manner, a happy association is formed which cannot fail to give them a powerful influence on the sentiments and conduct in a future life. But if we have advanced to manhood before being informed of the existence of a Deity, and of our relation to him; the principles of religion, when communicated, no longer produce the same happy effects: the heart and the understanding are no longer in the same state; nor will the same associations be formed.\n\nThis doctrine of the association of ideas has been introduced by an ingenious writer, distinguished for his discoveries in natural philosophy, and for his labours in controversial divinity, as an argument in behalf of the propriety of instructing youth in the principles of religion even in their earliest years. We admire, we esteem, the spirit which has prompted him to discover so much concern for the interests of the rising generation; but at the same time we will not conceal our opinion, that even this argument ought to be urged with caution. Many of the phenomena of human nature may indeed be explained, if we have recourse to the principle of association. The influence of any principle, religious or moral, depends in a great measure on the ideas and images which, in considering it, we have been accustomed to associate with it in our minds. But what are the ideas or images most likely to be associated by children with the doctrines and duties of religion, if we call them to listen to the one and perform the other at too early a period? Will they be such as may affect the influence of religion on their sentiments and conduct in the future part of life? Observe the world: Are those who, in infancy, have been most rigidly compelled to get their catechisms by rote, either the most pious or the best informed in religious matters? Indeed, when we consider what has been said of the influence of habit, and of the association of ideas, we cannot help thinking, that any arguments which on the present occasion may be adduced from either of these, tend directly to prove, not that we ought to pour in religious instruction into the minds of children, without considering whether they be qualified to receive it; but, on the contrary, that we ought cautiously to wait for and catch the proper season—that season when the youthful mind, no longer a stranger to our language, our sentiments, our views of nature, or our manner of reasoning, will be able to go along with us, when we talk to him of a supreme Being, or our condition as dependent and accountable creatures, of truth, benevolence, and justice.\n\nWe flatter ourselves, then, that our readers will readily agree with us, 1st, That the moral and reasoning powers of children begin to display themselves at a very early age, even in infancy, 2dly, That as soon as they have made themselves acquainted with the most obvious appearances of nature, and have gained a tolerable knowledge of our language and our manner of arranging our ideas in reasoning, we may with the greatest propriety begin to instruct them in the principles of religion, 3dly, That the most careful and judicious observation is necessary to enable us to distinguish the period at which children become capable of receiving religious instruction; because, if we either attempt to communicate to them these important truths too early, or defer them till towards manhood, we may fail of accomplishing the great end which we have in view.\n\nIf we can be so fortunate as to choose the happiest season for sowing the first seeds of piety in the infant mind, our next care will be to sow them in a proper manner. We must anxiously endeavour to communicate the principles of religion and morality, so as they may be easiest comprehended by the understanding of the learner, and may make the deepest impression on his heart. It would be a matter of the greatest difficulty to give particular directions on this head. The discretion of the parent or tutor must here be his guide. We are afraid that some of the catechisms commonly taught are not very happily calculated to serve the purpose for which they are intended. Yet we do not wish that they should be neglected while nothing more proper is introduced in their room. In instructing children in the first principles of religion, we must beware of arraying piety in the gloomy garb, or painting her with the forbidding features, in which she has been represented by anchorites, monks, and puritans. No; let her assume a pleasing form, a cheerful dress, and an inviting manner. Describe the Deity as the affectionate parent, the benefactor, and though the impartial yet the merciful judge of mankind. Exhibit to them Jesus Christ, the generous friend and Saviour of the posterity of Adam, who with such enchanting benevolence hath said, \"Suffer little children to come unto me.\" Represent to them his yoke as easy, and his burden as light. Inflict not on their laying long prayers or hearing tedious sermons. If possible, make the doctrines of religion to appear to them as glad tidings, and its duties as the most delightful of tasks.\n\nV. The Languages.\n\nIs the time usually spent in learning the languages usefully occupied? What advantages can our British youth derive from an acquaintance with the languages and the learning of Greece and Rome? Would we listen to many of the fathers, the mothers, and the polite tutors of the present age, they will persuade us, that the time which is dedicated to grammar-schools, and to Virgil, Cicero, Homer, and Demosthenes, is foolishly thrown away; and that no advantages\nEducation advantages can be gained from the study of classical learning. They with their children and pupils to be not merely scholars; they with them to acquire what may be useful and ornamental when they come to mingle with the world; and for this purpose, they think it much better to teach their young people to smatter out French, to dance, to fence, to appear in company with invincible assurance, and to dress in such a manner as may attract the attention of the ladies. Besides, the tenderness and humanity of those people are amazing. They are shocked at the idea of the sufferings which boys undergo in the course of a classical education. The confinement, the stripes, the harsh language, the burdens laid on the memory, and the pain occasioned to the eyes, during the dreary period spent in acquiring a knowledge of Greek and Latin, affect them with horror when they think of them as inflicted on children. They therefore give the preference to a plan of education in which less intense application is required and less severity employed.\n\nBut, again, there are others who are no less warm in their eulogiums on a classical education, and no less industrious in recommending the study of Greek and Latin, than those are eager in their endeavours to draw neglect on the polished languages of antiquity. With this second class, if an adept in Greek and Latin, you are a great and learned man; but without those languages, contemptible for ignorance. They think it impossible to inspire the youthful mind with generous or virtuous sentiments, to teach the boy wisdom, or to animate him with courage, without the assistance of the ancient philosophers, historians, and poets. Indeed their superstitious reverence for the ancient languages, and for those writers whose compositions have rendered Greece and Rome so illustrious, leads them to ascribe many other still more wonderful virtues to a classical education.\n\nWith which of these parties shall we join? or shall we mediate between them? Is it improper to call youth to the study of the languages? Is it impossible to communicate any useful knowledge without them? Or are they, though highly useful, yet not always indispensably necessary?\n\nWe have formerly taken notice of one circumstance in favour of a classical education, to which it may be proper to recall the attention of our readers. We observed, that the cultivation of classical learning has a favourable influence on the living languages. It has a tendency to preserve their purity from being debauched, and their analogy from becoming irregular. In studying the dead languages, we find it necessary to pay more attention to the principles of grammar than in acquiring our mother tongue. We learn our native language without attending much to its analogy and structure. Of the numbers who speak English through the British dominions, but few are skilled in the inflection of its nouns and verbs, or able to distinguish between adverbs and conjunctions. Delirious only of making their meaning understood, they are not anxious about purity or correctness of speech. They reject not an expression which occurs to them, because it is barbarous or ungrammatical. As they grew up they learned to speak from their mothers, their nurses, and others about them; they were soon able to make known their wants, their wishes, and their observations, in words. Satisfied with this, or called at a very early period to a life of humble industry, they have continued to express themselves in their mother tongue without acquiring any accurate knowledge of its general principles. If these people find occasion to express themselves in writing, they are scarce more studious of correctness and elegance in writing than in speaking; or, though they may aspire after those properties, yet they can never attain them. But such writers or speakers can never refine any language, or reduce it to a regular analogy. Neither can they be expected to distinguish themselves as the guardians of the purity and regularity of their native tongue, if it should before have attained a high degree of perfection. But they who, in learning a language different from their native tongue, have found it necessary to pay particular attention to the principles of grammar, afterwards apply the knowledge of grammar which they have thus acquired in using their mother tongue; and by that means become better acquainted with its structure, and learn to write and speak it with more correctness and propriety. Besides, the languages of Greece and Rome are so highly distinguished for their copiousness, their regular analogy, and for various other excellencies, which render them superior to even the chief of modern languages, that the study of them has a natural tendency to improve and enrich modern languages. If we look backwards to the 15th century, when learning began to revive in Europe, and that species of learning which began first to be cultivated was classical literature, we find that almost all the languages then spoken in Europe were wretchedly poor and barbarous. Knowledge could not be communicated, nor business transacted, without calling in the aid of Latin. Classical learning, however, soon came to be cultivated by all ranks with enthusiastic eagerness. Not only those designed to pursue a learned profession, and men of fortune whose object was a liberal education without a view to any particular profession; but even the lower ranks, and the female sex, keenly studied the languages and the wisdom of Greece and Rome. This avidity for classical learning was followed by many happy effects. But its influence was chiefly remarkable in producing an amazing change on the form of the living languages. These soon became more copious and regular; and many of them have consequently attained such perfection, that the poet, the historian, and the philosopher, can clothe their thoughts in them to the greatest advantage. Could we derive no new advantage from the study of the ancient languages, yet would they be worthy of our care, as having contributed so much to raise the modern languages to their present improved state. But they also conduce to the preservation and support of those noble structures which have been reared by their affluence. The intercourse of nations, the association of writers, the gradual introduction of provincial barbarisms, and various other causes, have a tendency to corrupt and debauch even the noblest languages. By such means were the languages of Greece and Rome gradually corrupted, till the language used by a Horace, a Livy, a Xenophon, and a Menander, was lost in a jargon unfit for the purposes of composition. But if we would not disdain to take advantage of them, the classical works in those languages might prevent\nEducation prevent that which we use from experiencing such a decline. He who knows and admires the excellencies of the ancient languages, and the beauties of those writers who have rendered them so celebrated, will be the firm enemy of barbarism, affectation, and negligence, whenever they attempt to debauch his mother tongue. We venture therefore to assert, that when the polished languages of antiquity cease to be studied among us, our native tongue will then lose its purity, regularity, and other excellencies, and gradually decline till it be no longer known for the language of Pope and Addison; and we adduce it as an argument in behalf of classical learning, that it has contributed so much to the improvement of the living languages, and is almost the only means that can prevent them from being corrupted and debased.\n\nIn those plans of education of which the study of industry, the dead languages does not make a part, proper means are seldom adopted for impressing the youthful mind with habits of industry; nor do the judgment, memory, and the other powers of the mind, receive equal improvement, as they pass not through the same exercises as in a classical education. Let us enter those academies where the way to a complete education leads not through the thorny and rugged paths of classical literature; let us attend to the exercises which the polite teachers cause their pupils to perform. Do they infuse laborious industry or intense application? No; they can communicate knowledge without requiring laborious study. They profess to allow their pupils to enjoy the sweets of idleness, and yet render them prodigies of learning. But are their magnificent promises ever fulfilled? Do they indeed cultivate the understandings of the young people intrusted to their care? They do not: their care is never once directed to this important object. To adorn them with flowery and superficial qualities, is all that those gentlemen aim at. Hence, when their pupils come to enter the world and engage in the duties of active life, they appear destitute of every manly qualification. Though they have attained the age and grown up to the size of manhood, their understandings are still childish and feeble: they are capricious, unsteady, incapable of industry or fortitude, and unable to pursue any particular object with keen, unremitting perseverance. That long series of study and regular application, which is requisite in order to attain skill in the ancient languages, produces much happier effects on the youthful mind. The power of habit is universally felt and acknowledged. As he who is permitted to trifle away the earliest part of his life in idleness or in frivolous occupations, can scarcely be expected to display any manly or vigorous qualities when he reaches a more mature age; so, on the contrary, he whose earlier days have been employed in exercising his memory and furnishing it with valuable treasures, in cultivating his judgment and reasoning powers by calling the one to make frequent distinctions between various objects, and the other to deduce many inferences from the comparison of the various objects presented to the understanding, and also in strengthening and improving the acuteness of his moral powers by attending to human actions and characters, and distinguishing between them, as virtuous or vicious, as mean or glorious: he who has thus cultivated his powers, may be naturally expected to distinguish himself when he comes to perform his part in active life, by prudence, activity, firmness, perseverance, and most of the other noble qualities which can adorn a human character. But in the course of a classical education, the powers of the mind receive this cultivation; and therefore these happy effects may be expected to follow from it. The repetitions which are required afford improving exercise to the memory, and store it with the most valuable treasures; the powers of the understanding are employed in observing the distinctions between words; in tracing words to the substances and qualities in nature which they are used to represent; in comparing the words and idioms of different languages, and in tracing the laws of their analogy and construction; while our moral faculties are at the same time improved by attending to the characters which are described, and the events and actions which are related, in those books which we are directed to peruse in order to acquire the ancient languages. We assert therefore that the study of the ancient languages is particularly useful for improving and strengthening all the powers of the mind: and, by that means, for preparing us to act our part in life in a becoming manner; and this our readers will readily agree with us in considering as a weighty argument in behalf of that plan of education.\n\nBut if, after all, classical learning is still to be given up, where shall we find the same treasures of moral and elegant wisdom, of elegance, and of useful historical knowledge, which the celebrated writers of Greece and Rome afford? Will you content yourself with the modern writers of Italy, France, and England? Or will you deign to survey the beauties of Homer and Virgil through the medium of a translation? No surely; let us penetrate to those sources from which the modern writers have derived most of the excellencies which recommend them to our notice; let us disdain to be imposed upon by the whims or the ignorance of a translator.\n\nFarther, classical learning has long been cultivated among us; and both by the stores of knowledge which it has conveyed to the mind, and the habits which it has impressed, has contributed in no small degree to form many illustrious characters. In reviewing the annals of our country, we will scarce find an eminent politician, patriot, general, or philosopher, during the two last centuries, who did not spend his earlier years in the study of the classics.\n\nYet though we have mentioned these things in favour of classical literature, and were we to descend to minute particulars might enumerate many more facts and circumstances to recommend it; we mean not to argue that it is absolutely impossible to be a wife, a great, or a good man, unless you are skilled in Greek and Latin. Means may, no doubt, be adopted to inspire the young mind with virtuous dispositions, to call forth the powers of the youthful understanding, and to improve habits of industry and vigorous perseverance, without having recourse to the discipline of a grammar school. But we cannot help thinking, for the reasons which we have stated to our readers, that a classical education is the most likely to produce these happy effects.\nAs we are afterwards to take particular notice of the course of education most suitable for those who are to occupy the humble stations in society, we shall not here inquire whether it be proper to introduce them to an acquaintance with the Greek and Latin classics.\n\nVI. On the Education of People of Rank and Fortune.\n\nThose whom the kindness of providence has placed in an elevated station, and in affluent circumstances, so that they seem to be born rather to the enjoyment of wealth and honours than to act in any particular profession or employment, have notwithstanding a certain part assigned them to perform, and many important duties to fulfil. They are members of society, and enjoy the protection of the civil institutions of that society to which they belong; they must therefore contribute what they can to the support of those institutions. The labours of the industrious poor are necessary to supply them with the luxuries of life; and they must know how to distribute their wealth with prudence and generosity among the poor. They enjoy much leisure; and they ought to know how to employ their leisure hours in an innocent and agreeable manner. Besides, as their circumstances enable them to attract the regard and respect of those who are placed in inferior stations, and as the poor are ever ready to imitate the conduct of their superiors; it is necessary that they endeavour to adorn their wealth and honours by the most eminent virtues, in order that their example may have a happy influence on the manners of the community.\n\nTheir education ought therefore to be conducted with a view to these ends. After what we have urged in favour of a classical education, our readers will naturally presume that we regard it as highly proper for a man of fortune. The youth who is destined to the enjoyment of wealth and honours, cannot spend his earlier years more advantageously than in gaining an acquaintance with the elegant remains of antiquity. The benefits to be derived from classical learning are particularly necessary to him. Care must be taken to preserve him from acquiring a haughty, fierce, imperious temper. The attention usually paid to the children of people of fortune, and the foolish fondness with which they are too often treated, have a direct tendency to inspire them with high notions of their own importance, and to render them passionate, overbearing, and conceited. But if their temper acquire that bias even in childhood, what may be expected when they advance towards manhood, when their attention is likely to be oftener turned to the dignity and importance of that rank which they occupy, and to the pitiful humility of those beneath them? Why, they are likely to be so proud, insolent, resentful, and revengeful, as to render themselves disagreeable and hateful to all who know them; and besides, to be incapable of those delightful feelings which attend humane, benevolent, and mild dispositions. Let the man of fortune, therefore, as he is concerned for the future happiness and dignity of his child, be no less careful to prevent him from being treated in such a manner as to be inspired with haughtiness, caprice, and insolence, than to prevent his mind from being soured by harsh and tyrannical usage.\n\nThe manly exercises, as they are favourable to the health, the strength, and even the morals; so they are highly worthy of engaging the attention of the young gentleman. Dancing, fencing, running, horsemanship, the management of the musket, and the motions of military discipline, are none of them unworthy of occupying his time, at proper seasons. It is unnecessary to point out the advantages which he may derive from dancing; these seem to be pretty generally understood. Perhaps our men of fortune would be ashamed to make use of their legs for running; but occasions may occur, on which even this humble accomplishment may be useful. Though we wish not to see the young man of fortune become a jockey; yet to be able to make a graceful appearance on horseback, and to manage his horse with dexterity, will not be unworthy of his station and character. If times of public danger should arise, and the state should call for the services of her subjects against any hostile attack, they whose rank and fortune place them in the most eminent stations will be first expected to stand forth; but if unacquainted with those exercises which are connected with the military art, what a pitiful figure must they make in the camp, or on the field of battle?\n\nAs the man of fortune may perhaps enjoy by hereditary right, or may be called by the voice of his fellow citizens, to a seat among the legislative body of his country; he ought in his youth to be carefully instructed in the principles of her political constitution, and of those laws by which his own rights and the rights of his fellow citizens are determined and secured.\n\nNatural philosophy, as being both highly useful and entertaining, is well worthy of the attention of all who can afford to appropriate any part of their time to scientific pursuits; to the man of fortune, a taste for natural philosophy might often procure the most delightful entertainment. To trace the wonders of the planetary systems, to mark the process of vegetation, to examine all the properties of that fine element which we breathe, to trace the laws by which all the different elements are confined to their proper functions, and above all to apply the principles of natural philosophy in the cultivation of the ground, are amusements which might agreeably and innocently occupy many of the leisure hours of the man who enjoys a splendid and independent fortune.\n\nNeither do we suppose civil history and the principles of morals to be overlooked. Without being acquainted with these, how could any just or accurate knowledge of the laws and political constitution of his country be acquired by the young gentleman? History exposes to our observation the fortune and the actions of other human beings, and thus supplies in some measure the place of experience; it teaches prudence, and affords exercise to the moral sense. When history condescends to take notice of individuals, they are almost always such as have been eminent for virtue, for abilities, or for the rank which they held in life; to the rich and great it ought to speak with peculiar efficacy, and they ought to be carefully invited to listen to its voice.\n\nSuch then is the manner in which we wish the education of young men of rank and fortune to be conducted.\nEducation ducted, in order that they may be prepared for enjoying their opulence and honours with becoming dignity. Let them be early inured to habits of vigorous industry and persevering firmness, by passing through a regular course of classical learning in a free school; let them play and converse with their equals, and not be permitted to form high ideas of their own importance, nor to domineer over servants or inferiors: Let them be carefully instructed in the principles of morality and religion: Let them be taught the manly exercises: Let them be carefully informed of the nature of the political constitution of their country, and of the extent of those civil and political rights which it secures to them and their fellow citizens: Let them be called to trace the annals of mankind through the records of history; to mark the appearances and operations of nature, and to amuse themselves by pursuing these to their general causes. We say nothing of causing the young man of fortune to learn some mechanical art: We think skill in a mechanical art might now and then afford him an innocent and pleasing amusement; but we do not consider it as absolutely necessary, and therefore do not insist on his acquiring it. With those accomplishments we hope he might become a useful member of society, might adorn the rank and fortune to which he is born, and might find wealth and high station a blest, not a curse. It is peculiarly unfortunate for our age and country, that people of rank and fortune are not so studious that their children acquire these as the more superficial accomplishments.\n\nVII. On the Education of People designed for a Mercantile Employment, and for the humbler Occupations in Life not particularly connected with Literature.\n\nWere modern literature in a less flourishing state; were the English and French languages adorned with fewer eminent poetical, historical, and philosophical compositions; we might perhaps insist on it as necessary to give the boy, who is designed for a mercantile employment, a classical education. At present this does not appear absolutely necessary; yet we do not presume to forbid it as improper. Even the merchant will scarce find reason to resent his having been introduced to the acquaintance of Plato and Cicero. But still, if the circumstances of the parent, or any other just reason, should render it inconvenient, to send the young man who is intended for trade to a free school to study the ancient languages, means may be easily adopted to make up for his loss. Confine him not to writing and accounts alone. These, though particularly useful to the merchant, have no great power to restrain the force of evil passions, or to inspire the mind with generous and virtuous sentiments. Though you burden him not with Latin and Greek, yet strive to inspire him with a taste for useful knowledge and for elegant literature. Some of the purest and most elegant of our poets, the excellent periodical works which have appeared in our language, such as the Spectator, the Adventurer, the Mirror, and the compositions of our British historians, together with some of the best translations of the classics which we possess; these you may with great propriety put into his hands. They will teach him how to think and reason justly, and to express himself in conversation or in writing with correctness and elegance: they will refine and polish his mind, and raise him above low and gross pleasures. And as no man, who has any occasion to speak or write, ought to be entirely ignorant of the principles of grammar, you will therefore be careful to instruct the young man who is destined for a mercantile occupation in the grammar of his mother tongue.\n\nA sacred regard to his engagements, and an honesty Integrity, which may prevent him from taking undue advantages or exacting unreasonable profits, are the virtues which a merchant is most frequently called to exercise: punctuality and integrity are the duties most particularly incumbent on the mercantile profession. Temptations will now and then arise to seduce the merchant to the violation of these. But if superior to every such temptation, he is one of the most illustrious characters, and is likely to be one of the most successful merchants. From his earliest years, then, labour to inspire the child whom you intend for trade with a sacred regard for truth and justice: let him be taught to view deceit and fraud, and the violation of a promise, with abhorrence and disdain. Frugality is a virtue which, in the present age, seems to be antiquated or prohibited. Even the merchant often appears better skilled in the arts of profusion than in those of parsimony. The miser, a character at no time viewed as amiable, is at present beheld with double detestation and contempt. Yet, notwithstanding these unfavourable circumstances, fear not to impress upon the young merchant habits of frugality. Let him know the folly of beginning to spend a fortune before he have acquired it. Let him be taught to regard a regular attention to confine his expenses within due bounds, as one of the first virtues which can adorn his character.\n\nFrugality and industry are so closely connected, that when we recommend the one of them to the merchant, we will be naturally understood to recommend the other also. It is easy to see, that without industrious application, no man can reasonably expect to meet with success in the occupation in which he engages; and if the merchant thinks proper to leave his business to the management of clerks and shop-keepers, it is not very probable that he will quickly accumulate a fortune. It is, therefore, no less necessary, that he who is intended for trade be early accustomed to habits of sober application, and be carefully restrained from volatility and levity, than that he be instructed in writing, arithmetic, and keeping of accounts.\n\nWith these virtues and qualifications the merchant is likely to be respectable, and not unsuccessful, while he continues to prosecute his trade: and if, by the blessing of Providence, he be at length enabled to accumulate a moderate fortune, his acquaintance with elegant literature, and the various habits which he has acquired, will enable him to enjoy it with taste and dignity. Indeed, all the advantages which a man without taste, or knowledge, or virtue, can derive from the possession of even the most splendid fortune, are so inconsiderable, that they can be no adequate reward for the toil which he undergoes, and the mean arts which he practises in acquiring it. At the head of a great fortune a fool can only make himself more ridiculous, and a man of wicked\nEducation, wicked and vicious character more generally abhorred, than if fortune had kindly concealed their crimes and follies by placing them in a more obscure station.\n\nA considerable part of the members of society are placed in such circumstances, that it is impossible for them to receive the advantages of a liberal education. The mechanic and the husbandman, who earn a subsistence by their daily labour, can seldom afford, whatever parental fondness may suggest, to favour their children with many opportunities of literary instruction. Content if they can provide them with food and raiment till such time as they acquire sufficient strength to labour for their own support, parents in those humble circumstances seldom think it necessary that they should concern themselves about giving their children learning. Happily, it is not requisite that those who are destined to spend their days in this low sphere should be furnished with much literary or scientific knowledge. They may be taught to read their mother tongue, to write, and to perform some of the most common and the most generally useful operations of arithmetic; for without an acquaintance with the art of reading, it will scarce be possible for them to acquire any rational knowledge of the doctrines and precepts of religion, or of the duties of morality; the invaluable volume of the sacred Scriptures would be sealed to them; we may allow them to write, in order that they may be enabled to enjoy the sweet satisfaction of communicating accounts of their welfare to their absent friends; and, besides, both writing and arithmetic are necessary for the accomplishment of those little transactions which pass among them. It would be hard, if even the lowest and poorest were denied the simple and easily acquired branches of education; and happily that degree of skill in them which is necessary for the labourer and the mechanic may be attained without greater expense than may be afforded by parents in the meanest circumstances. Let the youth who is born to pass his days in this humble station be carefully taught to consider honest patient industry as one of the first of virtues; let him be taught to regard the flaggard as one of the most contemptible of characters; teach him contentment with his lot, by letting him know that wealth and honour seldom confer superior happiness; yet scruple not to inform him, that if he can raise himself above the humble condition to which he was born, by honest arts, by abilities virtuously exerted, he may find some comfort in affluent circumstances, and may find reason to rejoice that he has been virtuous, industrious, and active.\n\nIn teaching him the principles of religion, be careful to show him religion as intimately connected with morality; teach him none of those mysterious doctrines, whose sole tendency is to foster that enthusiasm which naturally prevails among the vulgar, and to persuade them that they may be pious without being virtuous. Labour to inspire him with an invincible abhorrence for lying, fraud, and theft. Inspire him with a high esteem for chastity, and with an awful regard to the duties of a son, a husband, and a father. Thus may he become respectable and happy, even in his humble station and indigent circumstances; a character infinitely superior, in the eyes of both God and man, to the rich and great man who misemploys his wealth and leisure in shameful and vicious pursuits.\n\nVIII. On the Education of the Female Sex.\n\nThe abstracts which we have given of some of the most celebrated and original treatises on education, as well as our own observations on this subject, have been hitherto either relative to the education of both the sexes, or directed chiefly to the education of the male sex. But as there is a natural difference between the characters of the two sexes, and as there are certain duties peculiar to each of them; it is easy to see that the education of the boy and that of the girl cannot, ought not, to be conducted precisely in the same manner. And since the duties of the female sex are so important to society, and they form so considerable a part of our species, their education, therefore, merits the highest attention.\n\nIn infancy, the instincts, the dispositions, and the faculties of boys and girls seem to be nearly the same. They discover the same curiosity, and the same disposition to activity. For a while they are fond of the same sports and amusements. But by and by, when we begin to make a distinction in their dress; when the girl begins to be more confined to a sedentary life under her mother's eye, while the boys are permitted to ramble about without doors; the distinction between their characters begins to be formed, and their taste of the character and manners begin to become different. The boy now takes up both sexes imitates the arts and the active amusements of his father; digs and plants a little garden, builds a house in period of miniature, shoots his bow, or draws his little cart; while the girl, with no less emulation, imitates her mother, knits, sews, and dresses her doll. They are no longer merely children; the one is now a girl, the other a boy. This taste for female arts, which the girl so easily and naturally acquires, has been judiciously taken notice of by Rousseau, as affording a happy opportunity for instructing her in a very considerable part of those arts which it is proper to teach her. While the girl is busied in adorning her doll, she insensibly becomes expert at needle work, and learns how to adjust her own dress in a becoming manner. And therefore, if she be kindly treated, it will not be a matter of difficulty to prevail with her to apply to these branches of female education. Her mother or governess, if capable of managing her with mildness and prudence, may teach her to read with great facility. For being already more disposed to sedentary application than the boy of the same age, the confinement to which she must submit in order to learn to read will be less irksome to her. Some have pretended that the reasoning powers of girls begin to exert themselves sooner than those of boys. But, as we have already declared our opinion, that the reasoning powers of children of both sexes begin to display themselves at a very early period; so we do not believe that those of the one sex begin to appear or attain maturity, sooner than those of the other. But the different occupations and amusements in which we cause them to engage from their earliest years, naturally call forth their powers in different manners, and perhaps cause the one to imitate our modes of speaking and behaviour sooner than the other. However, as we wish both boys and girls to learn the art of reading at a very early age, even as soon as they are capable of\nEducation, any serious application; so we wish girls to be taught the art of writing, arithmetic, and the principles of religion and morals, in the same order in which these are inculcated on boys.\n\nWe need not point out the reasons which induce us to regard these as accomplishments proper for the female sex: they seem to be generally considered as not only suitable, but necessary. It is our most important privilege, as beings placed in a situation different from that of the inferior animals, that we are capable of religious sentiments and religious knowledge; it therefore becomes us to communicate religious instruction with no less affluency and care to the youth of the female sex than to those of our own. Besides, as the care of children during their earlier years belongs in a particular manner to the mother; she, therefore, whom nature has destined to the important duties of a mother, ought to be carefully prepared for the proper discharge of those duties, by being accurately instructed, in her youth, in such things as it will be afterwards requisite for her to teach her children.\n\nLadies have sometimes distinguished themselves as prodigies of learning. Many of the most eminent geniuses of the French nation have been of the female sex. Several of our countrywomen have also made a respectable figure in the republic of letters. Yet we cannot approve of giving girls a learned education. To acquire the accomplishments which are more proper for their sex, will afford sufficient employment for their earlier years. If they be instructed in the grammar of their mother tongue, and taught to read and speak it with propriety; be taught to write a fair hand, and to perform with readiness the most useful operations of arithmetic; if they be instructed in the nature of the duties which they owe to God, to themselves, and to society; this will be almost all the literary instruction necessary for them. Yet we do not mean to forbid them an acquaintance with the literature of their country. The periodical writers, who have taught all the duties of morality, the decencies of life, and the principles of taste, in so elegant and pleasing a manner, may with great propriety be put into the hands of our female pupil. Neither will we deny her the historians, the most popular voyages and travels, and such of our British poets as may be put into her hands without corrupting her heart or inflaming her passions. But could our opinion or advice have so much influence, we would endeavour to persuade our countrymen and countrywomen to banish from among them the novelists, those panders of vice, with no less determined severity than that with which Plato excludes the poets from his republic, or that with which the converts to Christianity, mentioned in the Acts, condemned their magical volumes to the flames. Unhappily, novels and plays are almost the only species of reading in which the young people of the present age take delight; and nothing has contributed more effectually to bring on that dilapidation of manners which prevails among all ranks.\n\nBut we will not discover so much austerity as to express a wish that the education of the female sex should be confined solely to such things as are plain and useful. We forbid not those accomplishments which are merely ornamental, and the design of which is to render them amiable in the eyes of the other sex. When we consider the duties for which they are destined by nature, we find that the art of pleasing constitutes no Education, inconsiderable part of these; and it would be wrong, therefore, to deny them those arts, the end of which is to enable them to please. Let them endeavour to acquire taste in dress: to dress in a neat graceful manner, to suit colours to her complexion, and the figure of her clothes to her shape, is no small accomplishment for a young woman. She who is rigged out by the taste and dexterity of her maid and her milliner, is nothing better than a doll sent abroad to public places as a sample of their handywork. Dancing is Dancing, a favourite exercise: nay, we might almost call it the favourite study of the fair sex: So many pleasing images are associated with the idea of dancing; dress, attendance, balls, elegance and grace of motion irresistible, admiration, and courtship; and these are so early inculcated on the young by mothers and maids, that we need not be surprised if little Misses consider her lesson of dancing as a matter of much more importance than either her book or sampler. And indeed, though the public in general seem at present to place too high a value on dancing; and though the undue estimation which is paid to it seems owing to that taste for distinction, and that rage for public amusements, which naturally prevail amid such refinement and opulence; yet still dancing is an accomplishment which both sexes may cultivate with considerable advantage. It has a happy effect on the figure, the air, and the carriage; and we know not if it be not favourable even to dignity of mind: Yet as to be even a first-rate poet or painter, and to value himself on his genius in these arts, would be no real ornament in the character of a great monarch; so any very superior skill in dancing must serve rather to disgrace than to adorn the lady or the gentleman. There are some arts in which, though a moderate degree of skill may be useful or ornamental, yet superior taste and knowledge are rather hurtful, as they have a tendency to seduce us from the more important duties which we owe to ourselves and to society. Of these, dancing seems to be one: It is said of a certain Roman lady, by an eloquent historian, \"that she was more skilled in dancing than became a modest and virtuous woman.\"\n\nMusic, also, is an art in which the youth of the female sex are pretty generally instructed; and if their voice and ear be such as to enable them to attain any excellence in vocal music, it may conduce greatly to increase their influence over our sex, and may afford a pleasing and elegant amusement to their leisure hours. The harpsichord and the spinet are instruments often touched by female hands; nor do we presume to forbid the ladies to exercise their delicate fingers in calling forth the enchanting sounds of these instruments. But still, if your daughter have no voice or ear for music, compel her not to apply to it.\n\nDrawing is another accomplishment which generally enters into the plan of female education. Girls are usually taught to aim at some scratches with a pencil: but when they grow up, they either lay it totally aside, or else apply to it with so much affluency as to neglect their more important duties. We do not consider skill in drawing, any more than skill in poetry, as an accomplishment very necessary for the ladies; yet we agree with Rouffleau, that as far as it can contribute to improve their taste in dress, it may not be improper for them.\nEducation, them to pursue it. They may very properly be taught to sketch and colour flowers; but we do not wish them to forget or lay aside this as soon as the drawing-master is dismissed: let them retain it to be useful through life. Though pride can never be lovely, even in the fairest female form; yet ought the young woman to be carefully impressed with a due respect for herself. This will join with her native modesty to be the guardian of her virtue, and to preserve her from levity and impropriety of conduct.\n\nSuch are the hints which have occurred to us on the education proper for the female sex, as far as it ought to be conducted in a manner different from that of the male.\n\nIX. Public and Private Education.\n\nOne question usually discussed by the writers on this subject has not hitherto engaged our attention. It is, Whether it be most proper to educate a young man privately, or send him to receive his education at a public school? This question has been too often agitated, and by people enjoying opportunities of receiving all the information which experience can furnish on the subject, that we cannot be expected to advance any new argument of importance on either side. Yet we may state what has been urged both on the one and the other.\n\nThey who have considered children as receiving their education in the house and under the eye of their parents, and as secluded in a great measure from the society of other children, have been sometimes led to consider this situation as particularly favourable for their acquiring useful knowledge, and being formed to virtuous habits. Though we reap many advantages from mingling in social life, yet in society we are also tainted with many vices to which he who passes his life in solitary retirement is a stranger. At whatever period of life we begin to mix with the world, we still find that we have not yet acquired sufficient strength to resist those temptations to vice with which we are there afflicted. But if we are thus ready to be infected with the contagion of vice, even at any age, no other argument can be necessary to show the propriety of confining children from those dangerous scenes in which this infection is so easily caught. And whoever surveys the state of morals in a public school with careful and candid attention, even though it be under the management of the most virtuous, judicious, and affusive teachers, will find reason to acknowledge, that the empire of vice is established there not less fully than in the great world. Nothing, therefore, can be more negligent or inhuman, than for parents to expose their children to those seductions which a great school presents, at a time when they are strongly disposed to imitate any example set before them, and have not yet learned to distinguish between such examples as are worthy of imitation, and those which ought to be beheld with abhorrence. Even when under the parent's eye, from intercourse with servants and visitors their native innocence is likely to suffer considerably. Yet the parent's care will be much more likely to preserve the manners of his child uncorrupted in his own house, than any affluence and watchfulness of his teachers in a school.\n\nThe morals and dispositions of a child ought to be the first objects of our concern in conducting his education; but to initiate him in the principles of useful knowledge is also an important object; and it will be happy, if in a private education virtue be not only better secured, but knowledge also more readily acquired, than in a public. But this actually happens. When one or two boys are committed to the care of a judicious tutor, he can watch the most favourable seasons for communicating instruction; he can awake curiosity and command attention by the gentle arts of imitation: though he strive not to inflame their breasts with emulation, which leads often to envy and inveterate hatred; yet he will succeed in rendering learning pleasing, by other means less likely to produce unfavourable effects on the temper and dispositions of his pupils. As his attention is not divided among a number, he can pay more regard to the particular dispositions and turn of mind of each of his pupils: he can encourage him who is modest and slow, and refresh the quickness and volatility of the other; and he can call forth and improve their powers, by leading them at one time to view the scenes of nature and the changes which successively undergoes through the varying seasons: at another, to attend to some of the most entertaining experiments of natural philosophy; and again alluring them artfully to their literary exercises. With these he may mix some active games; and he may assume so much of the fondness of the parent, as to join in them with his little pupils. These are certainly circumstances favourable both to the happiness and to the literary improvement of youth; but they are peculiar to a private education. Besides, in a private education, as children spend more of their time with grown-up people than in public; those, therefore, who receive a domestic education, sooner acquire our manner of thinking, of expressing ourselves, and of behaving in our ordinary intercourse with one another. For the very same reason for which girls are often observed to be capable of prudence and propriety of behaviour at an earlier age than boys, those boys who receive a family education will begin sooner to think and act like men, than those who pass their earlier days in a public seminary. And though you educate your son at home, there is no reason why he should be more accustomed to dominate over his inferiors, or to indulge a capricious or inhuman disposition, than if he were brought up among fifty boys, all of the same age, size, and rank, with himself. He may also, in a private education, exercise his limbs with the same activity as in a public one. He cannot indeed engage in those sports for which a party of companions is necessary; but still there are a thousand objects which will call forth his activity: if in the country, he will be disposed to fish, to climb for bird nests, to imitate all that he sees performed by labourers and mechanics: in short, he will run, leap, throw and carry stones, and keenly exert himself in a variety of exercises, which will produce the most favourable effects on the powers both of his mind and body. It may indeed be possible for you to oppose the delights of nature so effectually, if you take pains for that purpose, as to refresh the natural activity of your child or pupil, and cause him to pine away his time in little indolence; but you will thus do violence to his dispositions, as well as to those instincts which nature has for wise purposes implanted in his breast.\nAnd the bad consequences which may result from this management are not to be considered as the natural effects of a domestic education, but as the effects of an education carelessly or imprudently conducted.\n\nBut there is another consideration which will perhaps be still more likely than any of those which we have hitherto urged, to prevail with the fond parent to give his child a private education. As the infant who is abandoned by its mother to the care of an hireling nurse, naturally transfers its affection from the unnatural parent to the person who supplies her room and performs the duties incumbent upon her; so the boy who is banished from a parent's house at a time when he has scarcely begun to know the relation in which he stands to his father and mother, brothers or sisters, soon ceases to regard them with that fondness which he had contracted for them from living in their company and receiving their good offices. His respect, his affection, and his kindness, are bestowed on new objects, perhaps on his master or his companions; or else his heart becomes selfish and destitute of every tender and generous feeling; and when the gentle and amiable affections of filial and fraternal love are thus, as it were, torn up by the roots, every evil passion springs up, with a rapid growth, to supply their place. The boy returns afterwards to his father's house; but he returns as a stranger; he is no longer capable of regarding his parents and relations with the same tenderness of affection. He is now a stranger to that filial love which springs up in the breast of the child who is constantly sensible of the tender care of his parents, and spends his earlier years under their roof, in such a manner as to appear the effect of instinct rather than of habit. Selfish views are now the only bond which attaches him to his parents and relations; and by coming under their influence at so early a period of life, he is rendered forever incapable of all the most amiable virtues which can adorn human nature. Let the parent, therefore, who loves his child, and wishes to obtain from him a mutual return of affection, beware of excluding him from his house, and devolving the sole charge of him upon another, in his childhood.\n\nThese views represent a private education as the most favourable to virtue, to knowledge, and to the mutual affection which ought always to unite the parent and his child. But let us now listen to the arguments which are usually urged in behalf of a public education.\n\nIn the first place, it has been asserted, that a public education is much more favourable than a private, to the pupil's improvement in knowledge, and much more likely to inspire him with an ardour for learning. In a private education, with whatever affluence and tenderness you labour to render learning agreeable to your pupil, still it will be but an irksome task. You may confine him to his books but for a very short space in the course of the day, and allow him an alternation of study and recreation. Still, however, you will never be able to render his books the favourite objects of his attention. He will apply to them with reluctance and careless indifference; even while he seems engaged on his lesson, his mind will be otherwise occupied; it will wander to the scenes where he pursues his diversions, and to those objects which have attracted his desire. If the period during which you require his application be extremely short; during the first part of it, he will still be thinking of the amusements from which you have called him, and regretting his confinement; during the last, he will fondly anticipate the moment when he is to be set at liberty, and think of new amusements. Again, if you confine him during a longer period, still more unfavourable effects will follow. Peevishness, dullness, and a determined aversion to all that bears the name of literature, will be naturally impressed on his mind by such treatment. How can it be otherwise? Books possess so few of those qualities which recommend any object to the attention of children, that they cannot be naturally agreeable. They have nothing to attract and detain the eye, the ear, or any of the senses; they present things with which children are unacquainted, and of which they know not the value: children cannot look beyond the letters and words, to the things which these represent; and even though they could, yet it is much more pleasing to view scenes and objects as they exist originally in nature, than to trace their images in a faint and imperfect representation. It is vain, therefore, to hope that children will be prevailed with to pay attention to books by means of any allurements which books can of themselves present. Other means must be used; but those in a private education you cannot command. In a public seminary, the situation of matters with respect to their pupils is widely different. When a number of boys meet together in the same school, each of them soon begins to feel the impulse of a principle which enables the master to command their attention without difficulty, and prompts them to apply with cheerful ardour to tasks which would otherwise be extremely irksome. This principle is a generous emulation, which animates the breast with the desire of superior excellence, without inspiring envy or hatred of a competitor. When children are prudently managed in a great school, it is impossible for them not to feel its impulse. It renders their tasks far less agreeable than their amusements, and directs their activity and curiosity to proper objects. View the scholar at a public school, composing his theme, or turning over his dictionary; how alert! how cheerful! how indefatigable! He applies with all the eagerness, and all the perseverance, of a candidate for one of the most honourable places in the temple of fame. Again, behold and pity that poor youth who is confined to his chamber with no companion but his tutor; none whose superiority can provoke his emulation, or whose inferiority might flatter him with thoughts of his own excellence, and thus move him to persevere by industrious application the advantages which he has already gained. His book is before him; but how languid, how listless his posture! how heavy and dull his eye! Nothing is expressed in his countenance but dejection or indignation. Examine him concerning his lesson; he replies with confusion and hesitation. After a few minutes observation, you cannot fail to be convinced that he has spent his time without making any progress in learning; that his spirits are now broken, his natural cheerfulness destroyed, and his breast armed with invincible prejudices against all application in the pursuit of literary knowledge. Besides, in a school there is something more than emulation to render learning...\nThe slightest observation of life, or attention to our own conduct in various circumstances, will be sufficient to convince us, that whenever mankind are placed in circumstances of distress, or subjected to any disagreeable restraint, that which a single person bears with impatience or dejection will make a much less impression on his mind if a number of companions be joined with him in his suffering or restraint. It is deemed a piece of much greater severity to confine a prisoner in a solitary cell, than where he is permitted to mix with others in the same uncomfortable situation. A journey appears much less tedious to a party of travelers, than to him who beats the path alone. In the same manner, when a number of boys in a great school are all bullied on the same or on similar tasks, a spirit of industry and perseverance is communicated from one to another—over the whole circle; each of them insensibly acquires new ardour and vigour; even though he feel not the spur of emulation, yet, while all are busy around him, he cannot remain idle. These are facts obvious to the most careless observer.\n\nNeither are public schools so unfavourable to the virtue of their members as they have been represented to be. If the masters are men of virtue and prudence, careful to set a good example before their pupils, attentive to the particular character and behaviour of each individual among them, firm to punish obdurate and incorrigible depravity, and even to expel those who are more likely to injure the morals of others than to be reclaimed themselves, and at the same time eager to applaud and encourage amiable and virtuous dispositions wherever they appear; under the government of such masters, a public school will not fail to be a school of virtue. There will no doubt be particular individuals among the pupils of such a seminary, whose morals may be corrupt and their dispositions vicious; but this, in all probability, will arise from the manner in which they were managed before entering the school, or from some other circumstances, rather than from their being sent for their education to a public school. Again, at a public school young people enjoy much greater advantages for preparing them to enter the world, than they can possibly be favoured with if brought up in a private and solitary manner. A great school is a miniature representation of the world at large. The objects which engage the attention of boys at a school are different from those which occupy their parents; the views of the boys are less extensive, and they are not yet capable of prosecuting them by so many safe and mean arts: but, in other respects, the two scenes and the actors upon them nearly resemble each other; on both you behold contending passions, opposite interests, weaknesses, cunning, folly, and vice. He therefore who has performed his part on the miniature scene, has rehearsed as it were for the greater; if he has acquitted himself well on the one, he may be also expected to distinguish himself on the other; and even he who has not distinguished himself at school, at least enters the world with superior advantages when viewed in comparison with him who has spent his earlier days in the ignorance and solitude of a private and domestic education. Besides, when a number of boys meet at a public seminary of education, separated from their parents and relations; nearly of the same age, engaged in the same studies, and fond of the same amusements; they naturally contract friendships with one another which are more cordial and sincere than any that take place between persons farther advanced in life. A friendship is often formed between two boys at school which continues through life, and is productive of the happiest consequences to each of them. While at school, they mutually assist and encourage each other in their learning; and their mutual affection renders their talks less burdensome than they might otherwise find them. As they advance in life, their friendship still continues to produce happy effects on their sentiments and conduct: perhaps they are mutually useful to each other by interest or by personal assistance in making their way in the world; or when they are engaged in the cares and battle of life, their intercourse and correspondence with each other may contribute much to console them amid the vexations and fatigues to which they may be exposed.\n\nSuch are the chief arguments usually adduced in favour of a public education. When we compare them with those which have been urged to recommend a private education, we shall perhaps find that each has its peculiar advantages. A public education is the more favourable to the acquisition of knowledge, to vigour of mind, and to the formation of habits of industry and fortitude. A private education, when judiciously conducted, will not fail to be peculiarly favourable to innocence and mildness of disposition; and notwithstanding what has sometimes been advanced by the advocates for a public education, it is surely better to keep youth at a distance from the seductions of vice till they be sufficiently armed against them, than to expose them to them at an age when they know not what dangers they lead, and a medium between the two parties, either a private or a public education would form characters more like to angels than to those men whom we ordinarily meet in the world: but they speak with the ardour of enthusiasts; and therefore we must listen with caution both to the facts which they adduce, and to the inferences which they draw. Could we without exposing children to the contagion of a great town, procure for them the advantages of both a public and a private education at the same time, we would by this means probably succeed best in rendering them both respectable scholars and good men. If we may presume to give our opinion freely, we would advise parents never, except when some unavoidable necessity of circumstances obliges them, to expel their children from under their own roof till they be advanced beyond their boyish years: let the mother nurse her own child; let her and the father join in superintending its education: they may then expect to be rewarded, if they have acted their parts aright, by commanding the gratitude, the affection, and the respect of their child, while he and they continue to live together. Let matters be so ordered, that the boy may reside in his father's house, and at the same time attend a public school: but let the girl be educated wholly under her mother's eye.\n\nX. On\nX. On Travel.\n\nAnother question which has been often discussed comes here under our review. The philosophers of ancient Greece travelled in search of knowledge. Books were then scarce, and those few which were to be obtained were no very rich treasuries of useful information. The rhapsodies of a poet, the rude legends of some ill-informed and fabulous historian, or the theories of fanciful philosophers, were all that they could afford. Thales, Lycurgus, Solon, Plato, travelled, seeking that knowledge among more civilized nations which they could not find in their native country. In the course of their travels, they heard the lectures of celebrated philosophers; consulted the priests, who were the guardians of the traditions of antiquity, concerning the nature and origin of those traditions; and observed the institutions of those nations which were most renowned for the wisdom of their legislature. When they set out to visit foreign countries, they seem to have proposed to themselves a certain end; and by keeping that end steadily in view during the course of their travels, they gained such improvement as to be able on their return to command the veneration of their countrymen by means of the knowledge which they were enabled to communicate. Many besides the philosophers of ancient Greece have travelled for improvement, and have succeeded in their views. But ancient history does not relate to us, that travelling was considered by the Greeks or Romans as necessary to finish the education of their young men of fortune before they entered the scenes of active life. It is true, after Greece became a province of the Roman empire, and the Romans began to admire the science and elegance of Greece, and to cultivate Grecian literature, the young noblemen of Rome often repaired to Rhodes and Athens to complete their studies under the masters of philosophy and eloquence who taught in those cities. But they went thither with the same views with which our youth in modern times are sent to free schools and universities, not to acquire knowledge by the observation of nature, of the institutions, manners, and customs of nations; but merely to hear lectures, read books, and perform exercises. In modern times, a few men of reflection and experience have now and then travelled for improvement: but the greatest part of our travellers, for a long time, were enthusiastic devotees who went in pilgrimage to visit the shrine or relics of some favourite saint; soldiers, who wandered over the earth to destroy its inhabitants; or merchants, whose business as factors between widely distant countries and nations led them to brave every danger in traversing from one corner of the globe to another. But since the nations of modern Europe have begun to emerge from rudeness, ignorance, and fervile depression, they have formed one great commonwealth, the members of which are scarcely less intimately connected with each other than were the states of ancient Greece. The consequence of this mutual connexion and dependence is, that almost all the nations of Europe have frequent intercourse with one another; and as some of them are, and have long been, more enlightened and refined than others, those nations who have attained the highest degrees of civilization and refinement have naturally attracted the admiration and homage of the rest. Their language has been studied, their manners and arts have been adopted, and even their dress has been imitated. Other nations have struggled to pay the homage due to their superior merit, and to study under them as masters. Hence has arisen the practice which at present prevails among us of sending our youth to complete their education by travelling, before we introduce them to active life, or require them to engage in business. Formerly young men were not sent to travel till after they had proceeded through the forms of a regular education, and had at least attained such an age that they were no longer to be considered as mere boys. But the progress of luxury, the desire of parents to introduce their children into the world at an early age, that they may early attain to wealth and honours, and various other causes, have gradually introduced the practice of sending mere boys to foreign countries, under pretence of affording them opportunities of shaking off prejudices, of storing their minds with truly useful knowledge, and of acquiring those graceful manners and that manly address which will enable them to acquit themselves in a becoming manner when they are called to the duties of active life. How much travelling at such an early age contributes to fulfill the views of parents, a slight survey of the senate-house, the gambling-houses, the race-course, and the cockpit, will readily convince the sagacious observer.\n\nBut we wish to foster no prejudices against neighbouring nations; we entertain no such prejudices in favour of Britain, as to wish to confine our countrymen within the sea-girt isle. Let us inquire what advantages may be gained by travelling, and at what age it may be most proper to set out in pursuit of those advantages.\n\nAfter all that bookish men have urged, and notwithstanding all that they may continue vehemently to urge, in behalf of the knowledge to be derived from their beloved books; it must still be acknowledged, that books can teach us little more than merely the language of men. Or, if we should grant that books are of higher importance, and that language is the least valuable part of the knowledge which they teach, yet still we need to beware that they lead us not astray; it is better to examine nature with the naked eye, than to view her through the spectacles of books. Neither the theories or experiments of philosophers, nor the narratives of travellers, nor the relations of historians, though supported by a numerous train of authorities, are worthy of implicit credit. You retire from the world, confine yourself for years to your closet, and read volume after volume, historians, philosophers, and poets; at last you fancy that you have gained an immense store of knowledge: But leave your retirement, return into the world, compare the knowledge which you have treasured up with the appearances of nature; you will find that you have laboured in vain, that it is only the semblance of knowledge which you have acquired, and will not serve for a faithful guide in life, nor even enable you to distinguish yourself for literary merit. Compare the relations of travellers with one another; how seldom do they agree when they describe the same scenes and the same people! Turn your attention to the most respectable historians, compare\nEducation. their accounts of the same events; what disagreement! what contrariety! Where shall truth be found? Listen to the cool, the candid philosophers; what contradictory theories do they build on the same system of facts!\n\nWe agree, then, that it is better to seek knowledge by actual observation and experiment, than to receive it at second hand from the information of others. He who would gain an acquaintance with the beauties of external nature, must view them with his own eyes; he who would know the operations of the human understanding, must reflect upon what passes in his own mind; he who would know the customs, opinions, and manners of any people, must mingle with them, must observe their conduct, and listen to their conversations. The arts are acquired by actual practice; the sciences by actual observation in your own person, and by deducing inferences from your observations.\n\nIf therefore to extend our knowledge can contribute in any degree to render us happier, wiser, or better; travelling, as being more favourable to knowledge than the study of books, must be highly advantageous. Get well acquainted with your own country; with the manners, the customs, the laws, and the political situation of your countrymen: Get also a knowledge of books; for books would not be altogether useless, though they could serve no other purpose but to teach us the language in which mankind express themselves: And then, if your judgment have attained maturity; if curiosity prompt you; if your constitution be robust and vigorous, and your spirits lively; you may imitate the Solons, Homers, and Platoes, of old, and visit foreign countries in search of knowledge, and with a view to bring home something which may be of real utility to yourself and your country. You will, by this time, be so much master of the language of your own country, that you will not lose it while you are learning the languages of foreign nations; your principles of taste and of right and wrong will be so formed and fixed, that you will not despise any institution or custom or opinion merely because it prevails not in your own country; nor yet will you be ready to admire and adopt anything, merely because it prevails among a foreign nation who are distinguished for profound and extensive knowledge, or for elegance of taste and manners. No; you will divest yourself of every prejudice, and judge only by the fixed unalterable principles which determine the distinction between right and wrong, between truth and falsehood, between beauty and deformity, sublimity and meanness. Your object will not be to learn exotic vices, to mingle in frivolous amusements, or to form a catalogue of inns. Your views, your inquiries, will have a very different direction. You will attend to the state of the arts, of the sciences, of morals, manners, and government; you will also contemplate with eager delight, the grand or beautiful scenes of nature, and examine the vegetable productions of the various regions through which you pass, as well as the different tribes of animals which inhabit them; you will observe what blessings the beneficence of nature has conferred on the inhabitants of each particular division of the globe, and how far the ingenuity and industry of man have taken advantage of the kindness of nature. Thus surveying the face of the earth, and considering how advantages and disadvantages are balanced with each other through every various region and climate from one extremity of the globe to another; you will admire and revere that impartiality with which the Author of nature has distributed his benefits to the whole human race. When from the chilly climes and stubborn soil of the north, you turn your eyes to the fertile genial regions of the south, where every tree is loaded with exquisite fruits, and every vegetable is nourishing and delicious; you will be pleased to find, that the inhabitants of the north, by their superior ingenuity and vigour, are able to raise themselves to circumstances no less comfortable and respectable than those which the nations inhabiting between the tropics enjoy: when you behold the French shaking off the yoke of despotism, and aspiring to the sweets of liberty as well as their British neighbours; you will be pleased to feel, that the natural gaiety and cheerfulness of the former nation render them not incapable of the energy of the latter. You will be pleased to view the remains of antiquity, and the noble monuments of art; but you will think it below you to trifle away your time in gazing at palaces and churches, and collecting rusty medals and fragments of marble; you will seek the society of eminent men, and eagerly cultivate an acquaintance with the most distinguished artists and men of science who adorn the nations among whom you may happen to sojourn. Knowing that the knowledge which is to be acquired in great towns, is by no means an adequate compensation for the vicious habits which you are liable to contract in them; and besides, that the luxuries, the arts, the manners, the virtues, and the vices of all great towns are nearly the same, so that when you have seen one, you have seen all others; you will avoid taking up your residence for any considerable time in any of the great towns through which you have occasion to pass in the course of your travels. The traveller who has attained the previous accomplishments which we have mentioned as necessary, who sets out with the views which we have supposed him to entertain, and who conducts his travels in this manner, cannot fail to return home enriched with much useful knowledge; he cannot but derive more real improvement from travelling, than he could have gained by spending the same period of time in solitary study: when he returns to his native country, he will appear among his countrymen as more than a philosopher; a sage, and a benefactor. His knowledge is so extensive and accurate, his views are so liberal and enlarged, and he is so superior to prejudices, without being the enemy of any useful establishment, that he will be enabled to command universal esteem, by performing his part in life with becoming dignity and propriety, and perhaps to render his name illustrious, and his memory dear to future times, by some important services to the community to which he belongs, or even to mankind in general.\n\nBut though we have thus far, and we hope for obvious and solid reasons, decided in favour of travelling, it seems that as being more likely than a solitary application to read books, to furnish the mind with useful and ornamental knowledge; yet we do not see that our British youth either take care to furnish themselves with the previous knowledge which we consider as indispensably necessary in order to prepare them for travelling with advantage, or set out with proper views, or pro-\nEducation. secure their travels in a prudent judicious manner.\n\nAfter receiving a very imperfect education, in which religious and moral instruction are almost wholly neglected, and no means are used to inspire the youthful mind with solid, virtuous, manly qualities; but every art is tried to make the young man appear learned, while his mind is destitute of all useful information, and to teach him to assume the confidence of manhood before he has attained even to a moderate degree of sense and prudence;—after an education conducted in this manner, and with these views, the stripling is sent abroad to view the world, and is expected to return home a finished character, an ornament and a comfort to his parents and all his connexions. He is hitherto unacquainted, perhaps, even with the simple events of the history of his native country; and either totally ignorant of classical literature, or but very superficially instructed in it. He has not yet viewed with a differing eye the manners and customs prevailing among his countrymen; he knows not the nature of the government under which he lives, nor the spirit of those laws by which his civil conduct must be regulated. He has no fixed principles; no clear, distinct views. But to supply all his wants of this nature, he is put into the hands of a travelling governor, who is to be entirely submissive to his will, and yet to serve him both for eyes and intellect. This governor is generally either some macaroni officer, who is considered as well bred, and thought to know the world; or else, perhaps, some cringing son of literature, who having spent much time among his books, without acquiring such strength or dignity of mind as to raise him above frivolity of manners and conversation or pitiful fawning arts, is therefore regarded as happily qualified for this important charge. This respectable personage and his pupil are shipped off for France, that land of elegant dissipation, frivolity, and fashion. They travel on with eager impatience, till they reach the capital. There the young man is industriously introduced to all the gay scenes which Paris can display. He is, at first, confounded; by and by his senses are fascinated; new desires are awakened in his breast; all around him he sees the sons of dissipation wallowing in debauchery, or the children of vanity fluttering about like so many gaudy insects. The poor youth has no fixed principles: he has not been taught to regard vanity as ridiculous, or to turn from vice with abhorrence. No attempt is made to allure him to those objects, an attention to which can alone render travelling truly beneficial. Hitherto his mind had been left almost wholly uncultivated; and now the seeds of vice are plentifully sown in it. From one great town he is conveyed to another, till he visits almost every place in Europe where profligacy of manners has attained to any uncommon height. In this happy course of education he probably continues to pursue improvement till he is well acquainted with most of the post roads, the principal inns, and the great towns at least in France and Italy; and perhaps till he has worn out his constitution, and rendered his mind totally incapable of any generous sentiments or sober reflection. He then revisits his native country, to the inexplicable happiness of his parents, who now eagerly long to embrace their all-accomplished child. But how miserably are the poor folks disappointed, when they find his constitution wasted, his understanding uninformed, his heart destitute of every manly or generous sentiment: and perceive him to possess no accomplishment, but such as are merely superficial? Perhaps, however, his parents are prevented by their partiality both for their child and for the means which they have adopted in conducting his education, from viewing his character and qualifications in a true light. Perhaps they overlook all his defects, or consider them as ornaments, and regard their dear son as the mirror of perfection. But, unfortunately, though they be blind to the hideous deformity of the monster which they have formed, they cannot hinder it from being conspicuous to others; though they may view their son's character as amiable and respectable, they cannot render it useful, they cannot prevent it from being hurtful to society. Let this youth whose education has been thus wisely conducted, let him be placed at the head of an opulent fortune, advanced to a fear in the legislative body of his country, or called to act in any public character; how will he distinguish himself? As the virtuous patriot, the honest yet able statesman, the skilful general, or the learned upright judge? How will he enjoy his fortune? Will he be the friend of the poor, the steady supporter of the laws and constitution under whose protection he lives? Will he show himself capable of enjoying otium cum dignitate? If we reason by the usual laws of probability, we cannot expect that he should; and if we observe the manners and principles of our men of wealth and high birth who have been brought up in his manner, we find our reasonings confirmed.\n\nSuch are the opinions which candid observation leads us to entertain with regard to the advantages which may be gained by travelling.\n\nHe whose mind has been judiciously cultivated, and who has attained to maturity of judgment, if he set out on his travels with a view to obtain real improvements, and persist invariably in the prosecution of that view, cannot but derive very great advantages from travelling.\n\nBut again, those young men whose minds have not been previously cultivated by a judicious education, who set out without a view to the acquisition of real knowledge, and who wander among foreign nations, without attention to anything but their luxuries, their follies, and their vices, those poor young men cannot gain any real improvement from their travels.\n\nOur countrymen, who travel for improvement, do not appear to derive so much advantage from their travels as were to be wished, because they generally receive too superficial an education, set out at too early a period of life, and direct not their views to objects of real utility and importance.\n\nXI. On Knowledge of the World, and Entrance into Life.\n\nMuch has been said concerning the utility of a knowledge of the world, and the advantage of acquiring it at an early period of life. But those who have too early received too superficial an education, set out at too early a period of life, and direct not their views to objects of real utility and importance.\nEducation with, that, in order to acquire it, young people may be early made acquainted with all the vices and follies of the world, introduced into polite company, carried to public places, and not confined even from the gaming table and the stews. Some knowledge of the world may, no doubt, be gained by these means. But it is surely dearly purchased; nor are the advantages which can be derived from it so considerable, as to tempt the judicious and affectionate parent to expose his child to the infection of vanity, folly, and vice, for their sake. Carry a boy or girl into public life at the age of fourteen or fifteen; show them all the scenes of splendid vanity and dissipation which adorn London or Paris; tell them of the importance of dress, and of the ceremonies of good breeding and the forms of intercourse; teach them that fashionable indifference and assurance which give the ton to the manners of our fine gentlemen and fine ladies of the present age. What effects can you expect the scenes into which you introduce them, and the mysteries which you now teach them, to produce on the minds of the children? They have a direct tendency to inspire them with a taste for vanity, frivolity, and dissipation. If you with them to be like the foolish, the dissipated, and the gay, you are likely to obtain your purpose; but if, on the contrary, your views are to prepare them for discharging the duties of life, you could not adopt more improper means; for though they be well acquainted with all those things on which you place so much value, yet they have not thereby gained any accretion of useful knowledge. They are not now more able than before to estimate the real value of objects; nay, their judgment is now more liable than before to be misled in estimating the value of the objects around them. Luxury, vanity, and fashion, have stamped on many things an ideal value. By mingling at an early age in those scenes of the world where luxury, vanity, and fashion, reign with arbitrary sway, young people are naturally impressed with all those prejudices which they have a tendency to inspire. Instead of acquiring an useful knowledge of the world, they are rendered incapable of ever viewing the world with an unprejudiced and discerning eye. If possible, therefore, we should rather labour to confine young people from mingling in the scenes of gay and dissipated life till after they have attained maturity of age and judgment. They will then view them in a proper light, and perhaps be happy enough to escape the infectious contagion of vice.\n\nBut there is another and a more valuable knowledge of the world, which we ought industriously to communicate to them as soon as they are capable of receiving it. As soon as they are made thoroughly acquainted with the distinctions between right and wrong, between virtue and vice, between piety and impiety, and have become capable of entering into our reasonings; we ought then to inform them concerning the various establishments and institutions which exist in society; concerning the customs, opinions, and manners of mankind; and concerning the various degrees of strength or weaknesses of mind, of ingenuity or dullness, of virtuous or vicious qualities, which discriminate those characters which appear in society. We ought also to seize every opportunity which may be presented of exemplifying our lessons by instances in real life. We must point out to them those circumstances which have led Edulcoration mankind to place an undue value on some objects, while they appreciate others much below their real utility and importance. Thus let us fortify their judgments against that impression which the dazzling novelty of the scene, and the force of passion, will be apt to produce; and communicate to them a knowledge of the world, without exposing them imprudently to the contagion of its vices and follies.\n\nWhen at length the period arrives at which they must be emancipated from subjection, and committed to the guidance of their own conscience and reason, and of those principles which we have laboured to inculcate on their minds; let us warn them of the dangers to which they are about to be exposed; tell them of the glory and the happiness to which they may attain; inspire them, if possible, with disdain for folly, vanity, and vice, whatever dazzling or enchanting forms they may assume; and then dismiss them to enrich their minds with new stores of knowledge by visiting foreign nations; or, if that should be inconvenient, to enter immediately on the duties of some useful employment in active life.\n\nEDULCORATION, properly signifies the rendering substances more mild. Chemical edulcoration consists almost always in taking away acids and other saline substances; and this is effected by washing the bodies to which they adhere in a large quantity of water. The washing of diaphoretic antimony, powder of algaroth, &c. till the water comes off quite pure and infipid, are instances of chemical edulcoration.—In pharmacy, juleps, potions, and other medicines, are said to be edulcorated, by adding sugar or syrup.\n\nEDWARD, the name of several kings of England. See (History of) ENGLAND.\n\nEDWARDS, GEORGE, fellow of the royal and antiquarian societies, was born at Stratford, a hamlet belonging to Waltham in Essex, on the 3d of April 1694. After having spent some time at school, he was put apprentice to a tradesman in Fenchurch street. His master, who was eminent both for his piety and skill in the languages, treated him with great kindness; but about the middle of his apprenticeship, an accident happened which totally put a stop to the hopes of young Edwards's advancing himself in the way of trade. Dr Nicolas, a person of eminence in the physical world, and a relation of his master's, happened to die. The Doctor's books were removed to an apartment occupied by Edwards, who eagerly employed all his leisure hours, both in the day and great part of the night, in perusing those which treated of natural history, sculpture, painting, astronomy, and antiquities. The reading of these books entirely deprived him of any inclination for mercantile business he might have formerly had, and he resolved to travel into foreign countries. In 1716, he visited most of the principal towns in Holland, and in about a month returned to England. Two years after, he took a voyage to Norway, at the invitation of a gentleman who was disposed to be his friend, and who was nephew to the master of the ship in which he embarked. At this time Charles XII. was besieging Fredericksburg; by which means our young naturalist was hindered from making such excursions into the country as otherwise he would have done, for the Swedes were very careful to confine such strangers as could not give\ngive a good account of themselves. But notwithstanding all his precaution, he was confined by the Danish guard, who supposed him to be a spy employed by the enemy to get intelligence of their designs. However, by obtaining testimonials of his innocence, a release was granted. In 1718 he returned to England, and next year visited Paris by the way of Dieppe. During his stay in this country he made two journeys of 100 miles each; the first to Chalons in Champagne, in May 1720; the second on foot, to Orleans and Blois; but an edict happening at that time to be issued for securing vagrants, in order to transport them to America, as the banks of the Mississippi wanted population; our author narrowly escaped a western voyage. On his arrival in England, Mr Edwards closely pursued his favourite study of natural history, applying himself to drawing and colouring such animals as fell under his notice. A strict attention to natural, more than picturesque beauty, claimed his earliest care; birds first engaged his particular attention; and having purchased some of the best pictures of these subjects, he was induced to make a few drawings of his own; which were admired by the curious, who encouraged our young naturalist to proceed, by paying a good price for his early labours. Among his first patrons and benefactors may be mentioned James Theobalds, Esq. of Lambeth; a gentleman zealous for the promotion of science. Our artist, thus unexpectedly encouraged, increased in skill and affluence; and procured, by his application to his favourite pursuit, a decent subsistence and a large acquaintance. However, he remitted his industry in 1731; when, in company with two of his relations, he made an excursion to Holland and Brabant, where he collected several scarce books and prints, and had an opportunity of examining the original pictures of several great masters at Antwerp, Brussels, Utrecht, and other cities. In December 1733, by the recommendation of the great Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. president of the College of Physicians, he was chosen librarian, and had apartments in the college. This office was peculiarly agreeable to his taste and inclination, as he had the opportunity of a constant recourse to a valuable library, filled with scarce and curious books on the subject of natural history, which he studied assiduously. By degrees he became one of the most eminent ornithologists in this or any other country. His merit is so well known in this respect, as to render any eulogium on his performances unnecessary; but it may be observed, that he never trusted to others what he could perform himself; and often found it so difficult to give satisfaction to his own mind, that he frequently made three or four drawings to delineate the object in its most lively character, attitude, and representation. In 1743, the first volume of the History of Birds was published in quarto. His subscribers exceeding even his most sanguine expectations, a second volume appeared in 1747. The third volume was published in 1750. In 1751, the fourth volume came from the press. This volume being the last he intended to publish at that time, he seems to have considered it as the most perfect of his productions in natural history; and therefore devoutly offered it up to the great God of nature, in humble gratitude for all the good things he had received from him in this world. Our author, in 1758, continued his labours under a new title, viz. Gleanings of Natural History. A second volume of the Gleanings was published in 1760. The third part, which made the seventh and last volume of his works, appeared in 1764. Thus our author, after a long series of years, the most studious application, and the most extensive correspondence to every quarter of the world, concluded a work which contains engravings and descriptions of more than 600 subjects in natural history, not before described or delineated. He likewise added a general index in French and English; which was afterwards perfected, with the Linnaean names, by that great naturalist Linnaeus himself, who frequently honoured him with his friendship and correspondence. Some time after Mr Edwards had been appointed library keeper to the Royal College of Physicians, he was, on St Andrew's day, in the year 1750, presented with an honorary compliment by the president and council of the Royal Society, with the gold medal, the donation of Sir Godfrey Copley, Bart. annually given on that day to the author of any new discovery in art or nature, in consideration of his natural history just then completed. A copy of this medal he had afterwards engraved, and placed under the title in the first volume of his history. He was a few years afterwards elected fellow of the Royal Society, and of the Society of Antiquaries, London; and also a member of many of the academies of sciences and learning in different parts of Europe. In compliment to these honorary distinctions from such learned bodies, he presented elegant coloured copies of all his works to the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal Society, and Society of Antiquarians, and to the British museum; also to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, from whom he received the most polite and obliging letter of thanks by their then secretary Monsieur Detouchy. His collection of drawings, which amounted to upwards of 900, were purchased by the earl of Bute. They contain a great number of British as well as foreign birds, and other animals hitherto not accurately delineated or described. After the publication of the last work, being arrived at his 70th year, he found his sight begin to fail, and his hand lost its wonted steadiness. He retired from public employment to a little house which he purchased at Plaistow; previous to which, he dispensed of all the copies, as well as plates, of his works. The conversation of a few select friends, and the perusal of a few select books, were the amusement of the evening of his life; and now and then he made an excursion to some of the principal cities in England, particularly to Bristol, Bath, Exeter, and Norwich. Some years before his death, the alarming depredation of a cancer, which baffled all the efforts of medical skill, deprived him of the sight of one of his eyes; he also suffered much from the stone, to which at different periods of his life he had been subject. But in the feverish paroxysms of pain, he was scarcely known to utter a single complaint. Having completed his 80th year, emaciated with age and sickness, he died, deservedly lamented, on the 23rd of July 1773.\n\nEDYSTONE, a lighthouse in the British channel, built on rocks of the same name, which are supposed to have got this appellation from the great variety of contrary sets of the current among them, both upon the tide of flood and the tide of ebb. They are situated nearly south-\nsouth-south-west from the middle of Plymouth found, according to the true meridian; and the distance, as nearly as can be collected, is twelve miles and a half; and from the same point in the Sound to the Jetty Head, called the Barbican, in the port of Plymouth, is a mile and a half more, which makes the distance of the Eddystone from the port of Plymouth to be nearly fourteen miles.\n\n\"The promontory called Ram Head is the nearest point of land to the Eddystone, which bears from thence south scarcely one point west, distant about ten miles, and consequently by the compass is nearly south-west by south.—Those rocks are nearly in a line, but somewhat within that line which joins the Start and the Lizard Points; and as they lie nearly in the direction of vessels coasting up and down the channel, they must, before a lighthouse was established thereon, have been very dangerous, and often fatal to ships under such circumstances: and many rich ships and other vessels have, in former times, been actually lost upon those rocks, particularly such as were homeward-bound from foreign parts; it being even now a common thing, in foggy and thick hazy weather, for homeward-bound ships from long foreign voyages to make the Eddystone lighthouse as the first point of land of Great Britain; so that in the night, and nearly at high water, when the whole range of these rocks are covered, the most careful mariner might run his ship upon them, if nothing was placed there by way of warning.\n\n\"The many fatal accidents which so frequently happened, made it a thing very desirable to have a lighthouse built thereon, and that for many years before any competent undertaker appeared. At length, however, we learn, that in the year 1696 Mr Henry Winstanley, of Littlebury in the county of Essex, Gent., was not only hardy enough to undertake it, but was furnished with the necessary powers to put it in execution. This, it is supposed, was done in virtue of the general powers lodged in the master, wardens, and assistants of the Trinity-house at Deptford Strand to erect sea marks, &c. by a statute of Queen Elizabeth, whereby they are impowered 'to erect and set up beacons, marks, and signs for the sea, needful for avoiding the dangers; and to renew, continue, and maintain the same.' But whether Mr Winstanley was a proprietor or sharer of the undertaking under the Trinity-house, or only the directing engineer employed in the execution, does not now appear.\n\n\"This gentleman had distinguished himself in a certain branch of mechanics, the tendency of which is to raise wonder and surprize. He had at his house at Littlebury a set of contrivances, such as the following:—Being taken into one particular room of his house, and there observing an old flipper carelessly lying on the middle of the floor,—if, as was natural, you gave it a kick with your foot, up started a ghost before you: If you sat down in a certain chair, a couple of arms would immediately clasp you in, so as to render it impossible to disentangle yourself till your attendant set you at liberty: And if you sat down in a certain arbour by the side of a canal, you was forthwith sent out afloat to the middle of the canal, from whence it was impossible for you to escape till the manager returned you to your former place.—Whether those things were thrown to strangers at his house for money, or were done by way of amusement to those that came to visit the place, is uncertain; as Mr Winstanley is said to have been a man of some property: but it is at least certain, that he established a place of public exhibition at Hyde park corner, called Winstanley's water-works; which were thrown at stated times at one shilling each person. The particulars of those water-works are not now known; but, according to the taste of the times, we must naturally suppose a great variety of jets d'eau, &c. (a).\n\n\"The lighthouse Mr Winstanley built was begun in the year 1696, and was more than four years in building; not, (says the architect), for the greatness of the work, but for the difficulty and danger in getting backwards and forwards to the place. The difficulties were many, and the dangers not less. At length, in the third year, all the work was raised, which to the vane was eighty feet. Being all finished, with the lantern, and all the rooms that were in it, they ventured to lodge there soon after midsummer, for the greater dispatch of the work. But the first night the weather came bad, and so continued, that it was eleven days before any boats could come near them again, and not being acquainted with the height of the sea rising, they were almost all the time drowned with wet, and their provisions in as bad a condition, though they worked night and day to make shelter for themselves. In this storm they lost some of their materials, although they did what they could to save them; but the boat then returning, they all left the house to be refreshed on shore; and as soon as the weather permitted, they returned again and finished all, and put up the light on the 14th of November 1698; which being so late in the year, it was three days before Christmas before they had relief to get on shore again, and were almost at the last extremity for want of provisions; but by good providence, then two boats came with provisions, and the family that was to take care of the light.\n\n\"The fourth year, finding in the winter the effects the sea had upon the house, and burying the lantern at times, although more than 60 feet high; Mr Winstanley early in the spring encompassed the building with a new work of four feet thickness from the foundation, making all solid near 20 feet high; and taking down the upper part of the first building, and enlarging every part in its proportion, he raised it forty feet higher than it was at first; and yet the sea, in time of storms, flew up in appearance 100 feet (b) above the vane; and at times covered half the side of the house and the lantern as if they were under water.\n\n\"On the finishing this building, it was generally said, that in the time of hard weather, such was the height of\n\n(a) It appears that the exhibition of these water-works continued some years after the death of Mr Winstanley, as they were existing in the month of September 1709, being mentioned in the Tatler of that date.\n\n(b) Mr Smeaton says this is short of its real height 50 feet.\nof the seas, that it was very possible for a six-oared boat to be lifted up upon a wave, and driven through the open gallery of the lighthouse.\n\n\"In November 1703, the fabric wanted some repairs, and Mr Winstanley went down to Plymouth to superintend the performance of them. The opinion of the common people was, that the building would not be of long duration. Mr Winstanley, however, held different sentiments. Being amongst his friends previous to his going off with his workmen on account of those reparations, the danger was intimated to him; and it was said, that one day or other the lighthouse would certainly be overflown. To this he replied, 'He was so well assured of the strength of his building, he should only wish to be there in the greatest storm that ever blew under the face of the heavens, that he might see what effect it would have upon the structure.'\n\n\"In this wish he was soon gratified; for while he was there with his workmen and light-keepers, that dreadful storm began which raged the most violently upon the 26th November 1703, in the night; and of all the accounts of the kind which history furnishes as with, we have none that has exceeded this in Great Britain, or was more injurious or extensive in its devastation.\n\n\"The next morning, when the storm was abated, nothing of the lighthouse was to be seen. The following account of its destruction was printed at the time, by Daniel Defoe in a book entitled *The Storm*.\"\n\n\"The loss of the lighthouse called the Edystone, at Plymouth, is another article of which we never heard any particulars, other than this, that at night it was standing, and in the morning all the upper part of the gallery was blown down, and all the people in it perished, and, by a particular misfortune, Mr Winstanley the contriver of it; a person whose loss is very much regretted by such as knew him, as a very useful man to his country. The loss of that lighthouse is also a considerable damage, as it is very doubtful whether it will ever be attempted again; and it was a great security to the sailors, many a good ship having been lost there in former times.\n\n\"It was very remarkable, that as we are informed, at the same time the lighthouse aforesaid was blown down, the model of it in Mr Winstanley's house at Littlebury in Essex, above 200 miles from the lighthouse, fell down and was broke to pieces.\n\n\"At Plymouth they felt a full proportion of the storm in its utmost fury. The Edystone has been already mentioned; but it was a double loss, in that the lighthouse had not been long down when the Winchelsea, a homeward-bound Virginia-man, was split upon the rock where that building stood, and most of her men drowned.\"\n\n\"The great utility of Mr Winstanley's lighthouse had been sufficiently evident to those for whose use it was erected; and the loss of the Winchelsea Virginia-man, before-mentioned, proved a powerful incentive to such as were interested, to exert themselves in order for its restoration. It was not, however, begun too soon as might have been expected. In spring of the year 1706, an act of parliament passed enabling the Trinity house to rebuild, but it was no earlier than July that it was begun. The undertaker was a Captain Lovell or Lovett, who took it for the term of ninety nine years, commencing from the day that a light should be exhibited.\n\n\"To enable him to fulfil his undertaking, Captain Lovett engaged Mr John Rudyerd to be his engineer or architect; and his choice, though Mr Rudyerd does not appear to have been bred to any mechanical buildings or scientific profession, was not ill made. He at that time kept a linen-draper's shop upon Ludgate-hill. His want of experience, however, was in a degree assisted by Mr Smith and Mr Notcutt, both shipwrights from the king's yard at Woolwich, who worked with him the whole time he was building the lighthouse.\n\n\"It is not very material in what way this gentleman became qualified for the execution of the work: it is sufficient that he directed the performance thereof in a masterly manner, and so perfectly to answer the end for which it was intended. He saw the errors in the former building, and avoided them: instead of a polygon, he chose a circle for the outline of his building, and carried up the elevation in that form. His principal aim appears to have been use and simplicity; and indeed, in a building so situated, the former could hardly be acquired in its full extent without the latter. He seems to have adopted ideas the very reverse of his predecessor; for all the unwieldy ornaments at top, the open gallery, the projecting cranes, and other contrivances, more for ornament and pleasure than use, Mr Rudyerd laid totally aside: he saw, that how beautiful those ornaments might be in themselves, yet when they are improperly applied, and out of place, they shew a bad taste, and betray ignorance of its first principle, judgment.\n\n\"The building was begun in July 1706, a light was put up in it the 28th July 1708, and it was completely finished in 1709. The quantity of materials expended in the construction, was 500 tons of stone, 1200 tons of timber, 80 tons of iron, and 35 tons of lead; of timbers, screws, and rack-bolts 2500 each.\n\n\"Louis XIV. being at war with England during the proceeding with this building, a French privateer took the men at work upon it, together with their tools, and carried them to France; and the captain was in expectation of a reward for the achievement. While the captives lay in prison, the transaction reached the ears of that monarch. He immediately ordered them to be released, and the captors to be put in their place; declaring, that though he was at war with England, he was not at war with mankind; he therefore directed the men to be sent back to their work with presents; observing, that the Edystone light-house was so situated, as to be of equal service to all nations having occasion to navigate the channel that divides France from England.\n\n\"In the year 1715 Captain Lovett being dead, his property in the Edystone lighthouse was sold before a matter in chancery to Robert Welton, Esq.; Noyes, Esq. of Gray's-Inn; and —— Cheetham, Esq., an alderman of Dublin, who divided the same into eight shares. After a few years some repairs were found wanting; and in 1723, Mr Rudyerd being, we suppose, then dead, Mr John Holland, foreman shipwright in the dockyard at Plymouth, became overseer and director of the necessary reparations; which office he again executed in 1734.\"\n\"The catastrophe of this lighthouse took place on the 21st December 1755, when the light-keeper upon watch, about two o'clock in the morning, went into the lantern as usual to sniff the candles; he found the whole in a smoke; and upon opening the door of the lantern into the balcony, a flame instantly burst from the inside of the cupola: he immediately endeavoured to alarm his companions; but they being in bed, and asleep, were not ready in coming to his assistance as the occasion required. As there were always some leather buckets kept in the house, and a tub of water in the lantern, he attempted to extinguish the fire by throwing water from the balcony upon the outside cover of lead. By this time his companions arriving, he encouraged them to fetch up water with the buckets from the sea; but the height of the place, added to the conflagration which must attend such an unexpected event, rendered their efforts fruitless. The flames gathered strength every moment; the poor man with every exertion, having the water to throw four yards higher than himself, found himself unable to stop the progress of the conflagration, and was obliged to desist.\n\n\"As he was looking upward with the utmost attention to see the effect of the water thrown, a position which, phsyognomists tell us, occasions the mouth naturally to be a little open, a quantity of lead dissolved by the heat of the flames suddenly rushed like a torrent from the roof, and fell upon his head, face, and shoulders, and burnt him in a dreadful manner: from this moment he had a violent internal sensation, and imagined that a quantity of this lead had passed his throat, and got into his body. Under this violence of pain and anxiety, as every attempt had proved ineffectual, and the rage of the flames was increasing, it is not to be wondered that the terror and dismay of the three men increased in proportion; so that they all found themselves intimidated, and glad to make their retreat from the immediate scene of horror into one of the rooms below. They therefore defended as the fire approached, with no other prospect than that of securing their immediate safety, with scarcely any hopes of being saved from destruction.\n\n\"How soon the flames were seen on the shore is uncertain; but early in the morning they were perceived by some of the Cawsand fishermen, and intelligence thereof given to Mr Edwards, of Rame, in that neighbourhood, a gentleman of some fortune, and more humanity, who immediately sent out a fishing-boat and men to the relief of the distressed objects in the lighthouse (d).\n\n\"The boat and men got thither about ten o'clock, after the fire had been burning full eight hours; in which time the three light-keepers were not only driven from all the rooms and the staircase, but, to avoid the falling of the timber and red-hot bolts, &c. upon them, they were found fitting in the hole or cave on the east side of the rock under the iron ladder, almost in a state of stupification; it being then low water.\n\n\"With much difficulty they were taken off; when finding it impossible to do any further service, they hastened to Plymouth. No sooner were they let on shore, than one of the men ran away, and was never afterwards heard of. This circumstance, though it might lead to suspicions unfavourable to the man, Mr Smeaton is of opinion ought not to weigh anything against him, as he supposes it to have arisen from a panic which sometimes seizes weak minds, and prevents their acting agreeable to the dictates of right reason.\n\n\"It was not long before the dreadful news arrived at Plymouth. Alderman Tolcher and his son immediately went to sea, but found it impossible to do anything with effect. Admiral West also, who then lay in Plymouth sound, sent a flotilla properly armed, with a boat and an engine therein, which also carried out Mr Jessop the surveyor. This vessel arrived early in the day. Many attempts were made to play the engine, but the agitation of the sea prevented it from being employed with success. On the succeeding days the fire still continued, and about the 7th the destruction of the whole was completed.\n\n\"The man who has been mentioned already was named Henry Hall, of Stonehouse, near Plymouth, and though aged 94 years, being of a good constitution, was remarkably active, considering his time of life. He invariably told the surgeon who attended him, Mr Spry (now Dr Spry) of Plymouth, that if he would do anything effectual to his recovery, he must relieve his stomach from the lead which he was sure was within him; and this he not only told Dr Spry, but all those about him, though in a very hoarse voice, and the same attention he made to Mr Jessop.—The reality of the afflicting, however, then incredible to Dr Spry, who could scarcely suppose it possible that any human being could exist after receiving melted lead into the stomach; much less that he should afterwards be able to bear towing through the sea from the rock, and also the fatigue and inconvenience from the length of time he was in getting on shore before any remedies could be applied. The man, however, did not show any symptoms of being much worse or better until the fifth day after the accident, when he was thought to mend: he constantly took his medicines, and swallowed many things both liquid and solid, till the tenth or eleventh day; after which he suddenly grew worse; and on the twelfth, being seized with cold sweats and spasms, he soon after expired.\n\n\"His body was opened by Dr Spry, and in the stomach was found a solid piece of lead of a flat oval form, which weighed 7 ounces and 5 drachms. So extraordinary a circumstance appearing to deserve the notice of the philosophical world, an account of it was sent to the Royal Society, and printed in the 49th volume of their transactions, p. 477.\n\n\"The Lighthouse being thus demolished, the proprietors immediately turned their thoughts to the rebuilding of it. They had in it a term of near half a century, but some shares being settled by the marriage articles of one of the parties, some impediments arose which could not be overcome without the aid of parliament, which was soon obtained. To one of the partners, Robert Weston, Esq. the management of the business was committed,\n\n(d) This benevolent gentleman caught a cold on this occasion which cost him his life.\ncommitted, and he thought it requisite to apply to the earl of Macclesfield, then president of the Royal Society, to recommend a proper person to superintend the work. On communicating the object of his visit, Lord Macclesfield told him, that there was one of the Royal Society whom he would venture to recommend to the business; yet that the most material part of what he knew of him was, his having within the compass of the last seven years recommended himself to the Society by the communication of several mechanical inventions and improvements; and though he had at first made it his business to execute things in the instrument way (without having been bred to the trade) yet on account of the merit of his performances, he had been chosen a member of the Society, and that for about three years past, having found the business of a philosophical instrument-maker not likely to afford an adequate recompence, he had wholly applied himself to such branches of mechanics as were wanted by the proprietors; that he was then somewhere in the north of England, executing a work: and that as he had always satisfied his employers, he would not be likely to undertake what he could not perform.\n\n\"The person thus described was Mr Smeaton, who was written to by Mr Benjamin Wilson the painter, laconically informing him, that he was the person fixed upon to rebuild the Edystone lighthouse. But this intimation conveying to his mind no more than a mere notice that he might, in common with others, deliver in proposals to repair it, not knowing then that it was entirely destroyed, it afforded but little satisfaction, and he returned only a cool answer. Mr Wilson's reply was still more laconic: That the demolition was total, and that as Nathan said unto David, 'Thou art the man.'\n\n\"Mr Smeaton immediately divested himself of his engagements in the north, and arrived in London the 23rd of February 1756, and had an interview next day with the principal proprietor. The mode of rebuilding then became the subject of their deliberations, which at length ended in a determination to rebuild it with stone.\n\n\"On the 5th of April Mr Smeaton first set his foot on the Edystone rock. He immediately began to take his measures for proceeding on the work. He made all the necessary inquiries on the spot, and in the neighbourhood. He considered the nature and quality of the stone proper to be used, and from whence it might be obtained at the best and cheapest rates. He visited the quarries at Beare in Devonshire, and the Isle of Portland, and from the latter of these places he at length determined to be supplied with his materials.\n\n\"Having proceeded thus far, he returned to London, and had a meeting with the proprietors, who, for reasons highly honourable to them, confirmed their determination to rebuild with stone. He accordingly prepared his models and designs, which were approved by his employers, and directed to be exhibited to the lords of the Admiralty, and the masters of the Trinity house. To the former they were shewn; but the latter having fixed their time for viewing them at so distant a day as to hazard the progress of the work, he determined to set off for Plymouth without their inspection.\n\n\"He arrived at Plymouth the 23rd of July, 1756, and immediately began his operations. He appointed his assistants, hired his men, settled their wages, and drew up rules for their conduct. He also hired a piece of ground for a work-yard. On the 3rd of August they went off to the rock, and continued to work as long as the weather would permit. The next winter Mr Smeaton determined to continue at Plymouth, to go through a course of experiments on cements. On the 3rd of June 1757, the works were resumed, and on the 12th the first stone was fixed. From this time the erection proceeded with regularity and dispatch, and with no other interruptions than what might be expected from the nature of the work, until the 9th of October 1759, when, after innumerable difficulties and dangers, a happy event was put to the undertaking, without the loss of life or limb to any one concerned in it, or accident by which the work could be said to be materially retarded.\n\n\"It now remained only to wait for a storm to try the durability of the building. The hard weather of 1759, 1760, and 1761, appeared to make no impression. The year 1762 was ushered in by a tempest of the first magnitude, the rage of which was so great, that one of those who had been used to predict its downfall was heard to say, \"If the Edystone lighthouse is now standing, it will stand to the day of judgment;\" and in reality, from this time its existence has been so entirely laid out of men's minds, that whatever storms have happened since, no inquiry has ever been made concerning it. So confident was a very intelligent friend of Mr Smeaton's of its durability, that he wrote to him, that he might for ever rid himself of any uneasy thought of the house as to its danger from wind and sea.\n\n\"The lighthouse is attended by three men, who receive £5l. a-year each, with an occasional absence in summer. Formerly there were only two, who watched alternately four hours and four hours; but one being taken ill and dying, the necessity of an additional hand became apparent. In this dilemma, the living man found himself in an awkward situation. Being apprehensive if he tumbled the dead body into the sea, which was the only way in his power to dispose of it, he might be charged with murder, he was induced for some time to let the dead body lie, in hopes that the boat might be able to land, and relieve him from the distress he was in. By degrees the body became offensive, that it was not in his power to get quit of it without help; for it was near a month before the attending boat could effect a landing; and then it was not without the greatest difficulty that it could be done, when they did land. To such a degree was the whole building filled with the stench of the corpse, that it was all they could do to get the dead body disposed of and thrown into the sea, and it was some time after that before the rooms could be freed from the noisome stench that was left.\n\n\"It is said, that while two light-keepers only were employed, on some difficulty they forbore to speak to each other. A person observing to one of them how happy they might live in their state of retirement, \"Yes,\" says the man, \"very comfortably, if we could have the use of our tongues; but it is now a full month since my partner and I have spoke to each other.\"\n\n\"To these anecdotes we shall add one more, and con-\nclude. A shoemaker was carrying out to the lighthoufe in order to be light-keeper. In their way, says the skipper to him, \"How happens it, friend Jacob, that you should choose to go out to be a light-keeper, when you can on shore (as I am told) earn half-a-crown and three shillings a-day in making leather hose (leather pipes so called); whereas the light-keeper's salary is but £1 a-year, which is scarce ten shillings a-week.\" Says the shoemaker, \"I go to be a light-keeper, because I don't like confinement.\" After this answer had produced its share of merriment, he at last explained himself by saying, that he did not like to be confined to work.\n\n\"The whole time between the first stroke upon the rock and leaving the lighthouse complete, was three years nine weeks and three days; from the 5th of December 1755, to exhibiting the light October 1759, was three years ten months and fifteen days; and the whole time of working on the rock 111 days 10 hours\" (e).\n\n**EEL.** See Muræna, Ichthyology Index.\n\n**Eel-Fishing.** See Bobbing and Sniggling.\n\nThe silver eel may be caught with several sorts of baits, as powdered beef, garden worms, minnows, hens' guts, fish garbage, &c. The most proper time for taking them is in the night, fastening your line to the bank sides, with your laying hook in the water: or a line may be thrown with good store of hooks, baited and plumbed, with a float to discover where the line lies, that they may be taken up in the morning.\n\n**Microscopic Eels.** See Animalcule, No. 8.\n\n**Eels in vinegar,** are similar to those in four parts. The taste of vinegar was formerly thought to be occasioned by the biting of these little animals, but that opinion has been justly long exploded. Mentzelius says, he has observed the actual transformation of these little creatures into flies.\n\n**Eel Spear,** a forked instrument with three or four jagged teeth, used for catching eels: that with the four teeth is best, which they strike into the mud at the bottom of the river, and if it strike against any eels it never fails to bring them up.\n\n**EFFARE,** or **EFFRAYE,** in Heraldry, a term applied to a beast rearing on its hind legs, as if it were frightened or provoked.\n\n**EFFECT,** in a general sense, is that which results from, or is produced by, any cause. See Cause.\n\n**EFFEMINATE,** womanish, unmanly, voluptuous.\n\n**EFFEMINATE** (effeminatus), according to the vulgate, are mentioned in several places of Scripture. The word is there used to signify such as were consecrated to some profane god, and prostituted themselves in honour of him. The Hebrew word *hodeh*, translated effeminatus, properly signifies consecrated, and hence was attributed to those of either sex, who publicly prostituted themselves in honour of Baal and Ashtoreth. Moses expressly forbids these irregularities among the Israelites; but the history of the Jews shows, that they were notwithstanding frequently practised. Levit. xxiii. 18.\n\n**EFFENDI,** in the Turkish language, signifies master: and accordingly is a title very extensively applied; as to the mufti and emirs, to the priests of mosques, to men of learning, and of the law. The grand chancellor of the empire is called reis-effendi.\n\n**EFFERVESCENCE,** an intestine motion excited betwixt the parts of two bodies of different natures, when they reciprocally dissolve each other. Effervescences are commonly attended with bubbles, vapours, frugal jets of the liquid, and a hissing noise; and these phenomena are occasioned by the air which at that time disengages itself. Sometimes also they are accompanied with a great degree of heat, from the decomposition of some substances and the formation of new compounds.\n\nFormerly the word fermentation was also applied to effervescences; but now that word is confined to the motion naturally excited in animal and vegetable matters, and from which new combinations among their principles take place.\n\n**EFFIGY,** the portrait, figure, or exact representation of a person.\n\n**EFFIGY,** is also used for the print or impression of a coin, representing the prince's head who struck it.\n\n**EFFIGIT,** to execute or degrade in, denotes the execution or degradation of a condemned contumacious criminal, who cannot be apprehended or seized. In France, they hang a picture on a gallows or gibbet; wherein is represented the criminal, with the quality or manner of the punishment: at the bottom is written the sentence of condemnation. Such persons as are sentenced to death are executed in effigy.\n\n**EFFLORESCENCE,** among physicians, the same with exanthema. See Exanthema.\n\n**EFFLORESCENCE,** in Chemistry, denotes the formation of a kind of mealy powder on the surface of certain bodies. Efflorescence is occasioned either by decomposition or drying. The efflorescence which happens to cobalt and martial pyrites is of the first; and that observed on the crystals of soda, Glauber's salt, &c., of the latter kind. An efflorescence is sometimes also a species of crystallization; such as the beautiful vegetations which shoot up from different saline substances. See Crystallization.\n\n**EFFLORESCENTIA,** in Botany, (from effloresco to bloom); the precise time of the year and month in which every plant shows its first flowers.\n\nSome plants flower twice a-year, as is common between the tropics; others oftener, as the monthly rose. The former are called by botanists biflora; the latter, multiflora.\n\nThe time of flowering is determined by the degree of heat which each species requires. Mezereon and snowdrop produce their flowers in February; primrose, in the beginning of March; the greater number of plants, during the month of May; corn, and other grain, in the beginning of June; the vine, in the middle of the same month; several compound flowers, in the months of July and August; lastly, meadow-saffron flowers in the month of October, and announces the speedy approach of winter.\n\nGrass of Parnassus always flowers about the time of cutting.\n\n(e) This account is extracted from a Narrative of the Building, and a Description of the Construction of the Edystone Lighthouse with Stone. By John Smeaton, Civil Engineer, F.R.S.\ncutting down the hay; and in Sweden, the different species of thistle, mountain lettuce, succory, and balsam, seldom flower till after the summer solstice: the country men even know, as by a calendar, that the solstice is past when these plants begin to produce their flowers.\n\nThe temperature of the seasons has a great influence both in accelerating and retarding the flowering of plants. All plants are earlier in warm countries; hence such as are cultivated out of their native soil, never flower till the heat of the climate, or situation into which they are removed, is equal to that under the influence of which they produced flowers in their own country. For this reason, all exotics from warm climates are later in this country than many plants which it naturally produces.\n\nIn general, we may observe, that the plants of the coldest countries, and those produced on the mountains in all climates, being of equal temperature, flower about the same time, viz., during our spring in Europe.\n\nPlants that grow betwixt the tropics, and those of temperate climates, flower during our summer.\n\nPlants of temperate climates, situated under the same parallel of latitude with certain parts of Europe, but removed much farther to the west, such as Canada, Virginia, and Mississippi, do not produce flowers till autumn.\n\nPlants of temperate climates in the opposite hemisphere to Europe, flower during our winter, which is the summer of these regions.\n\nLinnaeus and Adanson have given a sketch of the different times in which plants flower at Upsal and Paris.\n\nEFFLUVIVM, in Physiology, a term much used by philosophers and physicians, to express the minute particles which exhale from moist, if not all, terrestrial bodies, in form of sensible vapours.\n\nEFFRONTES, in church history, a sect of heretics, in 1534, who scraped their forehead with a knife till it bled, and then poured oil into the wound. This ceremony served them instead of baptism. They are likewise said to have denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit.\n\nEFFUSION, the pouring out of any liquid thing with some degree of force. In the ancient heathen sacrifices there were divers effusions of wine and other liquors, called libations.\n\nEFFUSION, or FUSION, in Astronomy, denotes that part of the sign Aquarius, represented on celestial globes and planispheres, by the water issuing out of the urn of the water-bearer.\n\nEFT, or WATER LIZARD. See Lacerta, Entomology Index.\n\nEGERIA, or ÆGERIA, a nymph held in great veneration by the Romans. She was courted by Numa Pomilius; and, according to Ovid, she became his wife. This prince frequently visited her; and that he might introduce his laws and new regulations into the state, he solemnly declared before the Roman people, that they were previously sanctified and approved by the nymph Egeria. Ovid says, that Egeria was so disconsolate at the death of Numa, that she melted into tears, and was changed into a fountain by Diana. She is reckoned by many as a goddess who presided over the pregnancy of women; and some maintain that she is the same as Lucina.\n\nEGG, in Physiology, a body formed in certain females, in which is contained an embryo or fetus of the same species, under a cortical surface or shell. The exterior part of an egg is the shell; which in a hen, for instance, is a white, thin, and friable cortex, including all the other parts. The shell becomes more brittle by being exposed to a dry heat. It is lined everywhere with a very thin but a pretty tough membrane, which dividing at, or very near, the obtuse end of the egg, forms a small bag, where only air is contained. In new laid eggs this follicle appears very little, but becomes larger when the egg is kept.\n\nWithin this are contained the albumen or white, and the vitellus or yolk; each of which have their different virtues.\n\nThe albumen is a cold, viscid, white liquor in the egg, different in consistence in its different parts. It is observed, that there are two distinct albumens, each of which is enclosed in its proper membrane. Of these one is very thin and liquid; the other is more dense and viscous, and of a somewhat whiter colour; but, in old and stale eggs, after some days incubation, inclining to a yellow. As this second albumen covers the yolk on all sides, so it is itself surrounded by the other external liquid. The albumen of a fecundated egg is as sweet and free from corruption, during all the time of incubation, as it is in new laid eggs; as is also the vitellus. As the eggs of hens consist of two liquors separated one from another, and distinguished by two branches of umbilical veins, one of which goes to the vitellus, and the other to the albumen; so it is very probable that they are of different natures, and consequently appointed for different purposes.\n\nWhen the vitellus grows warm with incubation, it becomes more humid, and like melting wax or fat; whence it takes up more space. For as the fetus increases, the albumen insensibly wastes away and condenses; the vitellus, on the contrary, seems to lose little or nothing of its bulk when the fetus is perfected, and only appears more liquid and humid when the abdomen of the fetus begins to be formed.\n\nThe chick in the egg is first nourished by the albumen; and when this is consumed, by the vitellus, as with milk. If we compare the chalaza to the extremities of an axis passing through the vitellus, which is of a spherical form, this sphere will be composed of two unequal portions, its axis not passing through its centre; consequently, since it is heavier than the white, its smaller portion must always be uppermost in all positions of the egg.\n\nThe yellowish white round spot, called cicatricula, is placed on the middle of the smaller portion of the yolk; and therefore, from what has been said in the last paragraph, must always appear on the superior part of the vitellus.\n\nNot long before the exclusion of the chick, the whole yolk is taken into its abdomen; and the shell, at the obtuse end of the egg, frequently appears cracked some time before the exclusion of the chick. The chick is sometimes observed to perforate the shell with its\nits beak. After exclusion, the yolk is gradually wasted, being conveyed into the small guts by a small duct.\n\nEggs differ very much according to the birds that lay them, as to their colour, form, bigness, age, and the different way of dressing them: those most used in food are hens eggs; of which, such as are new laid are best.\n\nAs to the preservation of eggs, it is observed that the egg is always quite full when it is first laid by the hen; but from that time it gradually becomes less and less so, to its decay: and however compact and close its shell may appear, it is nevertheless perforated with a multitude of small holes, though too minute for the discernment of our eyes, the effect of which is a daily decrease of matter within the egg, from the time of its being laid; and the perspiration is much quicker in hot weather than in cold.\n\nTo preserve the egg fresh, there needs no more than to preserve it full, and stop its transpiration; the method of doing which is, by stopping up those pores with matter which is not soluble in watery fluids: and on this principle it is, that all kinds of varnish, prepared with spirit of wine, will preserve eggs fresh for a long time, if they are carefully rubbed all over the shell: tallow, or mutton fat, is also good for this purpose; for such as are rubbed over with this, will keep as long as those coated over with varnish.\n\nArtificial Method of Hatching Eggs. See HATCHING.\n\nEGINA. See AEGINA.\n\nEGINIART, secretary to the emperor Charles the Great, was a German. He is the most ancient historian of that nation, and wrote very eloquently for a man of the 9th century. It is said, that he inflamed himself so well into the favour of Emma, daughter to Charles the Great, that he obtained from her whatever he desired. Charles the Great, having found out the intrigue, did not do as Augustus, who is thought to have banished Ovid because he believed him to be too much favoured by Julia; for he married the two lovers together, and gave them a fine estate in land.\n\nEGLANTINE. See ROSA, BOTANY Index.\n\nEGLON, a king of the Moabites, who oppressed the Israelites for 18 years (Judges iii. 12—14). Calmet confounds this servitude of the Hebrews with that under Chushan-rishathaim, making it to subsist only eight years, from the year of the world 2591 to 2599; whereas this servitude under Eglon lasted 18 years, and commenced in the year of the world 2661, and 62 years after they had been delivered by Othniel from the subjection of Chushan-rishathaim.\n\nEGRA, a town of Bohemia, formerly imperial, but now subject to the house of Austria. It contains a great number of able artificers, and is famous for its mineral waters. Wallenstein, the emperor's general, was affianced here in 1634. The French became masters of this town in 1741; but afterwards being blockaded up, they were forced to capitulate on September 7th, 1743. It is looked upon as a town of the greatest consequence in Bohemia, except Prague. It is seated on a river of the same name, in L. Leng. 12. 30. N. Lat. 50. 21.\n\nEGRET, in Ornithology, a species of ardea. See ARDEA, ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nEGYPT, an extensive country of Africa, lying between 35° and 36° of east longitude, and between 21° and 31° of north latitude. It is bounded by the Mediterranean on the north; by the Red sea and isthmus of Suez, which divide it from Arabia, on the east; by Abyssinia or Ethiopia, on the south; and by the deserts of Barca and Nubia, on the west; being 600 miles in length from north to south, and from 100 to 200 in breadth from east to west.\n\nAs a nation, the Egyptians may with justice lay claim to as high antiquity as any in the world. The names of this country was most probably peopled by Mizraim the son of Ham and grandson of Noah.—By its ancient inhabitants it was called Chemia, and is still called Chemi in the language of the Copts or native Egyptians; and this name it is supposed to have received from Ham the son of Noah. In scripture, we find it most generally named Mizraim; though in the Psalms it is styled the land of Ham.—To us it is best known by the name Egypt, the etymology of which is more uncertain.—Some derive it from Aegyptus, a supposed king of the country: others say it signifies no more than \"the land of the Copts;\" Aia in Greek signifying a country, and Aicoptos being easily softened into Aegyptus.—The most probable opinion, however, seems to be, that it received its name from the blackness of its soil, and the dark colour both of its river and inhabitants; for such a blackish colour is by the Greeks called aegyptios from aepys, and aegyps \"a vulture;\" and by the Latins, fulvuslurius. For the same reason, other names of a similar import have been given to this country by the Greeks; such as Aeria and Melambolus; the river itself was called Melo or Melas; by the Hebrews, Shiloh; and by the Europeans, Siris; all of which signify \"black.\"\n\nAncient Egypt is by some divided into two parts, the Upper and Lower Egypt: by others into three, the Upper Egypt, properly so called, or Thebais; the Middle Egypt, or Heptanomes; and the Lower Egypt, the best part of which was the Delta, or that space encompassed by the branches of the Nile. See THEBAIS, &c.\n\nThe Egyptians, like the Chinese, pretend to an extensive antiquity, pretending to have records for ten, twenty, or even fifty thousand years. Thus their history is so much involved in obscurity and fable, that for many ages it must be passed over in silence.—The first mortal king whom the Egyptians own to have reigned in that country, was Menes or Memar. At what time he reigned, it would be to a very little purpose to inquire. He had been preceded, however, by a set of immortals, who it seems left him the kingdom in a very bad situation: for the whole country, except Thebais, was a morass; the people also were entirely destitute of religion, and every kind of knowledge which could render their life comfortable and happy. Menes diverted the course of the Nile, which before that time had washed the foot of a sandy mountain near the borders of Libya, built the city of Memphis, instructed his subjects, and did other things of a similar kind which are usually attributed to the founders of kingdoms.\n\nFrom the time of Menes, the Egyptian chronology is filled with a list of 330 kings, who reigned 1500000 years, but did nothing worthy of notice.—The first distinct piece of history we find concerning Egypt, is\nthe irruption of the Shepherds, by whom the country was subdued; but whether this revolution happened during the vast interval of indolence above mentioned, or before or after, cannot be known. The affair is thus related by Manetho. It happened, in the reign of Timaus king of Egypt, that God being displeased with the Egyptians, they suffered a great revolution: for a multitude of men, ignoble in their race, took courage, and, pouring from the east into Egypt, made war with the inhabitants; who submitted to them without resistance. The shepherds, however, behaved with the greatest cruelty; burnt the cities, threw down the temples of the gods; and put to death the inhabitants, carrying the women and children into captivity. This people came from Arabia, and were called Hyksos, or king-of-shepherds. They held Egypt in subjection for 259 years; at the end of which period, they were obliged by a king of Upper Egypt, named Amosis, or Thothmes, to leave the country. This prince's father had, it seems, gained great advantages over them, and flung them up in a place called Avaris, or Avaris, containing 10,000 acres of land. Here they were closely besieged by Amosis, with an army of 400,000 men; but at last the king, finding himself unable to reduce them by force, proposed an agreement, which was readily accepted. In consequence of this agreement, the shepherds withdrew from Egypt with their families, to the number of 240,000; and, taking the way of the desert, entered Syria: but fearing the Assyrians, who were then very powerful, and masters of Asia, they entered the land of Judaea; and built there a city capable of holding so great a multitude, and called it Jerusalem.\n\nAccording to Mr Bruce, the shepherds who invaded Egypt were no other than the inhabitants of Barabra. They were, he says, carriers to the Cuthites who lived farther to the south. The latter had built the many stately temples in Thebes and other cities of Egypt; though, according to him, they had no dwelling places but holes or caves in the rocks. Being a commercial people, they remained at home collecting and preparing their articles, which were dispersed by the barabers or shepherds already mentioned. These, from the nature of their employment, lived in moveable habitations, as the Tartars do at this day. By the Hebrews, he tells us, they were called phut, but shepherds by every other people; and from the name baraber, the word Barabra is derived. By their employment, which was the dispersing the Arabian and African goods all over the continent, they had become a great and powerful people; and from their opposite dispositions and manners, became very frequently enemies to the Egyptians. To one Salatis our author ascribes the destruction of Thebes in Upper Egypt, so much celebrated by Homer for its magnificence. But this certainly cannot be the case; for Homer wrote long after the time of Joseph: and we find that even then the Egyptians had the shepherds in abhorrence, in all probability because they had been grievously oppressed by them. Mr Bruce counts three invasions of these people; the first that of Salatis already mentioned, who overthrew the first dynasty of Egyptian kings from Menes, and destroyed Thebes; the second was that of Sabaco or So; for according to him this was not the name of a single prince, but of a people, and figured as shepherds; and the third, after the building of Memphis, where 240,000 of them were besieged as above mentioned. But accounts of this kind are evidently inconsistent in the highest degree; for how is it possible that the third invasion, antecedent to the building of Jerusalem, could be posterior to the second, if the latter happened only in the days of Hezekiah?\n\nIn these early ages, however, it would seem that the kingdom of Egypt had been very powerful and its dominion very widely extended; since we find it said, that the Ba'rians revolted from Olymndyas, another Egyptian king of very high antiquity, and of whose wealth the most marvellous accounts are given.\n\nAfter an unknown interval of time from this monarch, reigned Sefotris. He was the first great warrior whose conquests are recorded with any degree of distinctness. In what age of the world he lived, is uncertain. Some chronologers, among whom is Sir Isaac Newton, are of opinion, that he is the Sefac or Shihak, who took Jerusalem in the reign of Rehoboam the son of Solomon. Others, however, place him much earlier; and Mr Whitton will have him to be the Pharaoh who refused to part with the Israelites, and was at last drowned in the Red sea. Mr Bryant endeavours to prove that no such person ever existed; but that in his history as well as that of many ancient heroes, we have an abridgment of that of the Cuthites or Babylonians, who spread themselves over great part of the then known world, and everywhere brought the people in subjection to them. His reign is reckoned the most extraordinary part of the Egyptian history; and the following seems to be the least fabulous account that can be got of it. The father of Sefotris was told in a dream, by the god Vulcan, that his son, who was then newly born, or perhaps still unborn, should be lord of the whole earth. His father, upon the credit of this vision, got together all the males in the land of Egypt that were born on the same day with Sefotris; appointed nurses and proper persons to take care of them, and had them treated like his own child; being persuaded that they who had been the constant companions of his youth would prove the most faithful ministers and soldiers. As they grew up, they were inured to laborious exercises; and, in particular, were never permitted to taste any food till they had performed a course of 180 furlongs, upwards of 22 of our miles. When the old king imagined they were sufficiently educated in the martial way he designed them to follow, they were sent by way of trial of their abilities against the Arabians. In this expedition Sefotris proved successful, and in the end subdued that people who had never before been conquered. He was sent to the westward, and conquered the greatest part of Africa; nor could he be stopped in his career till he arrived at the Atlantic ocean. Whilst he was on this expedition, his father died; and then Sefotris resolved to fulfil the prediction of Vulcan, by actually conquering the whole world. As he knew that this must take up a long time, he prepared for his journey in the best manner possible. The kingdom he divided into 36 provinces, and endeavoured to secure the affections of the people by gifts both of money and land. He forgave all who had been guilty of offences, and discharged the debts of all his soldiers. He then constituted his brother Armah\nthe supreme regent; but forbade him to use the diadem, and commanded him to offer no injury to the queen or her children, and to abstain from the royal concubines. His army consisted of 600,000 foot, 24,000 horse, and 27,000 chariots. Besides these land forces, he had at sea two mighty fleets; one, according to Diodorus, of 400 sail. Of these fleets, one was designed to make conquests in the west, and the other in the east; and therefore the one was built on the Mediterranean and the other on the Red Sea. The first of these conquered Cyprus, the coast of Phoenicia, and several of the islands called Cyclades; the other conquered all the coasts of the Red Sea; but its progress was stopped by shoals and difficult places which the navigators could not pass, so that he seems not to have made many conquests by sea.\n\nWith the land forces Sesostris marched against the Ethiopians and Troglodytes; whom he overcame, and obliged them to pay him a tribute of gold, ebony, and ivory. From thence he proceeded as far as the promontory of Diru, which lay near the straits of Babelmandel, where he set up a pillar with an inscription in sacred characters. He then marched on to the country where cinnamon grows, or at least to some country where cinnamon at that time was brought, probably some place in India; and here he in like manner set up pillars, which were to be seen for many ages after. As to his farther conquests, it is agreed by almost all authors of antiquity, that he overran and pillaged the whole continent of Asia, and some part of Europe. He crossed the Ganges, and erected pillars on its banks; and from thence he is said to have marched eastward to the very extremity of the Asiatic continent. Returning from thence, he invaded the Scythians and Thracians; but all authors do not agree that he conquered them. Some even affirm, that he was overthrown by them with great slaughter, and obliged to abandon a great part of his booty and military stores. But whether he had good or bad success in these parts, it is a common opinion that he settled a colony in Colchis. Herodotus, however, who gives the most particular account of the conquests of this monarch, does not say whether the colony was desirably planted by Sesostris: or whether part of his army loitered behind the rest, and took up their residence in that region. From his own knowledge, he affirms, that the inhabitants of that country were undoubtedly of Egyptian descent. This was evident from the personal resemblance they bore to the Egyptians, who were swarthy complexioned and frizzle haired; but more especially from the conformity of their customs, particularly circumcision.\n\nThe utmost boundary of this mighty monarch's conquests, however, was in the country of Thrace; for beyond this country his pillars were nowhere to be seen. These pillars he was accustomed to set up in every country which he conquered, with the following inscription, or one to the same purpose: \"Sesostris, kings of kings, and lord of lords, subdued this country by the power of his arms.\" Besides these, he left also statues of himself; two of which, according to Herodotus, were to be seen in his time; the one on the road between Ephesus and Phocaea, and the other between Smyrna and Sardis: they were armed after the Ethiopian and Egyptian manner; holding a javelin in one hand and a bow in the other. Across the breast they had a line drawn from one shoulder to the other, with the following inscription: \"This region I obtained by these my shoulders.\" They were mistaken for images of Memnon.\n\nThe reasons given by Sesostris for his returning into Egypt from Thrace, and thus leaving the conquest of Egypt, the world unfinished, were the want of provisions for his army, and the difficulty of the passes. Most probably, however, his return was hastened by the intelligence he received from the high priest of Egypt, concerning the rebellious proceedings of his brothers; who, encouraged by his long absence, had assumed the diadem, violated the queen, and also the royal concubines. On receiving this news, Sesostris hastened from Thrace; and at the end of nine years came to Pelusium in Egypt, attended by an innumerable multitude of captives taken from many different nations, and loaded with the spoils of Asia. The treacherous brother met him at this city; and it is said, with very little probability, that Sesostris accepted of an invitation to an entertainment from him. At this he drank freely, together with the queen and the rest of the royal family. During the continuance of the entertainment, Armais caused a great quantity of dried reeds to be laid round the apartment where they were to sleep; and as soon as they were retired to rest set fire to the reeds. Sesostris perceiving the danger he was in, and that his guards, overcharged with liquor, were incapable of afflicting him, rushed through the flames, and was followed by his wife and children. In thanksgiving for this wonderful deliverance, he made several donations to the gods, particularly to Vulcan the god of fire. He then took vengeance on his brother Armais, said to be the Danaus of the Greeks, who, being on this occasion driven out of Egypt, withdrew into Greece.\n\nSesostris now laid aside all thoughts of war, and applied himself wholly to such works as might tend to the public good, and his own future reputation. In order to prevent the incursions of the Syrians and Arabians, he fortified the east side of Egypt with a wall which ran from Pelusium through the desert to Heliopolis, for 187½ miles. He raised also an incredible number of vast and lofty mounts of earth, to which he removed such towns as had before been situated too low, in order to secure them from the inundations of the Nile. All the way from Memphis to the sea he dug canals which branched out from the Nile; and not only made an easier communication between different places, but rendered the country in a great measure impalpable to an enemy. He erected a temple in every city in Egypt, and dedicated it to the supreme deity of the place; but in the course of such a great undertaking as this necessarily must have been, he took care not to employ any of his Egyptian subjects. Thus he secured their affection, and employed the vast multitude of captives he had brought along with him; and to perpetuate the memory of a transaction so remarkable, he caused to be inscribed on all these temples, \"No one native laboured herein.\" In the city of Memphis, before the temple of Vulcan, he raised five gigantic statues, each of one store. Two of them were 30 cubits high, representing himself and his wife; the other four were 20 cubits each, and represented his\nfour sons. These he dedicated to Vulcan in memory of his above-mentioned deliverance. He raised also two obelisks of marble 120 cubits high, and charged them with inscriptions, denoting the greatness of his power, his revenues, &c.\n\nThe captives taken by Sesostris are said to have been treated with the greatest barbarity; so that at last they resolved at all events to deliver themselves from a ferocity so intolerable. The Babylonians particularly were concerned in this revolt, and laid waste the country to some extent; but being offered a pardon and a place to dwell in, they were pacified, and built for themselves a city, which they called Babylon. Towards the conquered princes who waited on him with their tribute the Egyptian monarch behaved with unparalleled insolence. On certain occasions he is said to have unharnessed his horses, and, yoking kings together, made them draw his chariot. One day, however, observing one of the kings who drew his chariot to look back upon the wheels with great earnestness, he asked what made him look so attentively at them? The unhappy prince replied, \"O king, the going round of the wheel puts me in mind of the vicissitudes of fortune: for as every part of the wheel is uppermost and lowermost by turns, so it is with men; who one day sit on a throne, and on the next are reduced to the vilest degree of slavery.\" This answer brought the insulting conqueror to his senses; so that he gave over the practice, and thenceforth treated his captives with great humanity.\n\nAt length this mighty monarch lost his flight, and laid violent hands on himself.\n\nAfter the death of Sesostris, we meet with another chain of an indeterminate length in the Egyptian history. It concludes with the reign of Amasis or Ammonis; who being a tyrant, his subjects joined Aethiopias the king of Ethiopia to drive him out.—Thus Aethiopias became master of the kingdom; and after his death follows another chain in the history, during which the empire is said to have been in a state of anarchy for five generations.—This period brings us down to the times of the Trojan war. The reigning prince in Egypt was at that time called Cetes; by the Greeks, Proteus. The priests reported that he was a magician; and that he could assume any shape he pleased, even that of fire. This fable, as told by the Greeks, drew its origin from a custom among the Egyptians, perhaps introduced by Proteus. They were used to adorn and distinguish the heads of their kings with the representations of animals or vegetables, or even with burning incense, in order to strike the beholders with the greater awe. Whilst Proteus reigned, Paris or Alexander, the son of Priam king of Troy, was driven by a storm on the coast of Egypt, with Helen, whom he was carrying off from her husband. But when the Egyptian monarch heard of the breach of hospitality committed by Paris, he seized him, his mistress, and companions, with all the riches he had brought away with him from Greece. He detained Helen, with all the effects belonging to Menelaus her husband, promising to restore them to the injured party whenever they were demanded; but commanded Paris and his companions to depart out of his dominions in three days, on pain of being treated as enemies. In what manner Paris afterwards prevailed upon Proteus to restore his mistress, we are not told; neither do we know anything further of the transactions of this prince's reign nor of his successors, except what has entirely the air of fable, till the days of Sabbaco the Ethiopian, who again conquered this kingdom. He began his reign with an act of great cruelty, causing Sabbaco, the conquered prince to be burnt alive; nevertheless, he no sooner saw himself firmly established on the throne of Egypt, than he became a new man; so that he is highly extolled for his mercy, clemency, and wisdom. He is thought to have been the So mentioned in Scripture, and who entered into a league with Hophra king of Israel against Shalmaneser king of Assyria. He is said to have been excited to the invasion of Egypt by a dream or vision, in which he was assured that he should hold that kingdom for 50 years. Accordingly, he conquered Egypt, as had been foretold; and at the expiration of the time above mentioned, he had another dream, in which the tutelar god of Thebes acquainted him, that he could no longer hold the kingdom of Egypt with safety and happiness, unless he massacred the priests as he passed through them with his guards. Being haunted with this vision, and at the same time abhorring to hold the kingdom on such terms, he sent for the priests, and acquainted them with what seemed to be the will of the gods. Upon this it was concluded, that it was the pleasure of the Deity that Sabbaco should remain no longer in Egypt; and therefore he immediately quitted that kingdom, and returned to Ethiopia.\n\nOf Anytias, who was Sabbaco's immediate successor, we have no particulars worth notice. After him reigned one Sethon, who was both king and priest of Vulcan. He gave himself up to religious contemplation; and not only neglected the military arts, but deprived them of their lands. At this they were so much incensed, that they entered into an agreement not to bear arms under him; and in this state of affairs Sennacherib king of Assyria arrived before Pelusium with a mighty army. Sethon now applied to his soldiers, but in vain; they unanimously persisted in refusing to march under his banner. Being therefore destitute of all human aid, he applied to the god Vulcan, and requested him to deliver him from his enemies. Whilst he was yet in the temple of that god, it is said he fell into a deep sleep; during which he saw Vulcan standing at his side, and exhorting him to take courage. He promised, that if Sethon would but go out against the Assyrians, he should obtain a complete victory over them. Encouraged by this assurance, the king assembled a body of artificers, shop-keepers, and labourers; and, with this undisciplined rabble, marched towards Pelusium. He had no occasion, however, to fight; for the very night after his arrival at Pelusium, an innumerable multitude of field rats entering the enemies camp, gnawed to pieces the quivers, bowstrings, and shield straps. Next morning, when Sethon found the enemy disarmed, and on that account beginning to fly, he pursued them to a great distance, making a terrible slaughter. In memory of this extraordinary event, a statue of Sethon was erected in the temple of Vulcan, holding in one hand a rat, and delivering these words; \"Whoever beholds me let him be pious.\"\n\nSoon after the death of Sethon, the form of government in Egypt was totally changed. The kingdom was divided into twelve parts, over which as many of\nthe chief nobility presided. This division, however, subsisted but for a short time. Pianmitichus, one of the twelve, dethroned all the rest, 15 years after the division had been made. The history now begins to be divested of fable; and from this time may be accounted equally certain with that of any other nation. The vast conquests of Sefotris were now no longer known; for Pianmitichus possessed no more than the country of Egypt itself. It appears, indeed, that none of the successors of Sefotris, or even that monarch himself, had made use of any means to keep in subjection the countries he had once conquered. Perhaps, indeed, his design originally was rather to pillage than to conquer; and therefore, on his return, his vast empire vanished at once. Pianmitichus, however, endeavoured to extend his dominions by making war on his neighbours; but by putting more confidence in foreign auxiliaries than in his own subjects, the latter were so much offended, that upwards of 200,000 fighting men emigrated in a body, and took up their residence in Ethiopia. To repair this loss, Pianmitichus earnestly applied himself to the advancement of commerce; and opened his port to all strangers, whom he greatly caressed, contrary to the cruel maxims of his predecessors, who refused to admit them into the country. He also laid siege to the city of Azotus in Syria, which held out for 29 years against the whole strength of the kingdom; from which we may gather, that, as a warrior, Pianmitichus was by no means remarkable. He is reported to have been the first king of Egypt that drank wine. He also sent to discover the springs of the Nile; and is said to have attempted to discover the most ancient nation in the world by the following method. Having procured two newly born children, he caused them to be brought up in such a manner that they never heard a human voice. He imagined that these children would naturally speak the original language of mankind: therefore, when, at two years of age, they pronounced the Phrygian word becos (or some found resembling it), which signifies bread, he concluded that the Phrygians were the most ancient people in the world.\n\nNechus, the son and successor of Pianmitichus, is the Pharaoh-Necho of Scripture, and was a prince of an enterprising and warlike genius. In the beginning of his reign, he attempted to cut through the isthmus of Suez, between the Red sea and the Mediterranean; but, through the invincible obstructions which nature has thrown in the way of such undertakings, he was obliged to abandon the enterprise, after having lost 120,000 men in the attempt. After this he sent a flotilla, manned with some expert Phoenician mariners, on a voyage to explore the coasts of Africa. Accordingly, they performed the voyage; sailed round the continent of Africa; and after three years returned to Egypt, where their relation was deemed incredible.\n\nThe most remarkable wars in which this king was engaged are recorded in the sacred writings. He went out against the king of Assyria, by the divine command, as he himself told Jotham; but being opposed by the king of Judea, he defeated and killed him at Megiddo; after which he set up, in that country, King Jehoiakim, and imposed on him an annual tribute of 100 talents of silver and one talent of gold. He then proceeded against the king of Assyria; and weakened him so much, that the empire was soon after dissolved. Thus he became master of Syria and Phoenicia; but in a short time, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against him with a mighty army. The Egyptian monarch, not daunted by the formidable appearance of his antagonist, boldly ventured a battle; but was overthrown with prodigious slaughter, and Nebuchadnezzar became master of all the country to the very gates of Pelusium.\n\nThe reign of Apries, the Pharaoh-Hophra of Scripture, presents us with a new revolution in the Egyptian affairs. He is represented as a martial prince, successful and in the beginning of his reign very successful. He took by storm the rich city of Sidon; and having overcome the Cypriots and Phoenicians in a sea fight, returned to Egypt laden with spoil. This success probably incited Zedekiah king of Judaea to enter into an alliance with him against Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. The bad success of this alliance was foretold by the prophet Jeremiah; and accordingly it happened. For Nebuchadnezzar having fat down with his army before Jerusalem, Apries marched from Egypt with a design to relieve the city; but no sooner did he perceive the Babylonians approaching him, than he retreated as fast as he could, leaving the Jews exposed to the rage of their merciless enemies; who were thereupon treated as Jeremiah had foretold; and by this step Apries brought upon himself the vengeance denounced by the same prophet. The manner in which God confirmed these predictions was as follows: The Cyreneans, a colony of the Greeks, being greatly strengthened by a numerous supply of their countrymen under Zedekiah, their third king Batus styled the Happy, and encouraged by the Pythian oracle, began to drive out their Libyan neighbours, and shared their possessions among themselves. Hereupon Andica king of Libya sent a submissive embassy to Apries, and implored his protection against the Cyreneans. Apries complied with his request, and sent a powerful army to his relief. The Egyptians were defeated with great slaughter; and those who returned complained that the army had been sent off by Apries in order to be destroyed, and that he might tyrannize without control over the remainder of his subjects. This thought catching the attention of the giddy multitude, an almost universal defection ensued. Apries sent one Amasis, a particular friend, in whom he thought he could confide, to bring back his people to a sense of their duty. But by this friend he was betrayed; for Amasis, taking the opportunity of the present ferment, caused himself to be proclaimed king. Apries then despatched one Patarbemis, with orders to take Amasis, and bring him alive before him. This he found impossible, and therefore returned without his prisoner; at which the king was so enraged, that he commanded Patarbemis's nose and ears to be cut off. This piece of cruelty completed his ruin; for when the rest of the Egyptians who continued faithful to Apries beheld the inhuman mutilation of so worthy and noble a person as Patarbemis was, they to a man deserted Apries, and went over to Amasis.\n\nBoth parties now prepared for war; the usurper having under his command the whole body of native Egyptians; and Apries only those Ionians, Carians, and other mercenaries whom he could engage in his service.\nvice. The army of Apries amounted only to 30,000; but, though greatly inferior in number to the troops of his rival, as he well knew that the Greeks were much superior in valour, he did not doubt of victory. Nay, so far was Apries puffed up with this notion, that he did not believe it was in the power even of any god to deprive him of his kingdom. The two armies soon met, and drew up in order of battle near Memphis. A bloody engagement ensued; in which, though the army of Apries behaved with the greatest resolution, they were at last overpowered with numbers, and utterly defeated, the king himself being taken prisoner. Amasis now took possession of the throne without opposition. He confined Apries in one of his palaces, but treated him with great care and respect. The people, however, were implacable, and could not be satisfied while he enjoyed his life. Amasis, therefore, at last found himself obliged to deliver him into their hands. Thus the prediction received its final completion: Apries was delivered up to those who fought his life; and who no sooner had him in their power, than they strangled him, and laid his body in the sepulchre of his ancestors.\n\nDuring these intestine broils, which must have greatly weakened the kingdom, it is probable that Nebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt. He had been for 13 years before this employed in besieging Tyre, and at last had nothing but an empty city for his pains. To make himself some amends, therefore, he entered Egypt, miserably harassed the country, killed and carried away great numbers of the inhabitants, so that the country did not recover from the effects of this incursion for a long time after. In this expedition, however, he seems not to have aimed at any permanent conquest, but to have been induced to it merely by the love of plunder, and of this he carried with him an immense quantity to Babylon.\n\nDuring the reign of Amasis, Egypt is said to have been perfectly happy, and to have contained 20,000 populous cities. That good order might be kept among such vast numbers of people, Amasis enacted a law, by which every Egyptian was bound once a-year to inform the governor of his province by what means he gained his livelihood; and if he failed of this, to put him to death. The same punishment he decreed to those who could not give a satisfactory account of themselves.\n\nThis monarch was a great favourer of the Greeks, and married a woman of Grecian extract. To many Greek cities, as well as particular persons, he made considerable presents. Besides these, he gave leave to the Greeks in general to come into Egypt, and settle either in the city of Naucratis, or carry on their trade upon the sea coasts; granting them also temples, and places where they might erect temples to their own deities. He received also a visit from Solon the celebrated Athenian lawgiver, and reduced the island of Cyprus under his subjection.\n\nThis great prosperity, however, ended with the death of Amasis, or indeed before it. The Egyptian monarch had some how or other incensed Cambyses king of Persia. The cause of the quarrel is uncertain; but whatever it was, the Persian monarch vowed the destruction of Amasis. In the mean time Phanes of Halicarnassus, commander of the Grecian auxiliaries in the pay of Amasis, took some private disgust; and leaving Egypt, embarked for Persia. He was a wise and able general, perfectly well acquainted with everything that related to Egypt; and had great credit with the Greeks in that country. Amasis was immediately sensible how great the loss of this man would be to him, and therefore sent after him a trusty eunuch with a swift galley. Phanes was accordingly overtaken in Lycia, but not brought back; for making his guard drunk, he continued his journey to Persia, and presented himself before Cambyses, as he was meditating the destruction of the Egyptian monarchy.\n\nAt this dangerous crisis also, the Egyptian monarch imprudently made Polycrates the tyrant of Samos his nearest enemy. This man had been the most remarkable perhaps of any recorded in history, for an uninterrupted course of success, without the intervention of one single unfortunate event. Amasis, who was at this time in strict alliance with Polycrates, wrote him a letter, in which, after congratulating him on his prosperity, he told him that he was afraid lest his successes were too many, and he might be suddenly thrown down into the greatest misery. For this reason he advised him voluntarily to take away something from his own happiness; and to cast away that which would grieve him most if he was accidentally to lose it. Polycrates followed his advice, and threw into the sea a signet of inestimable value. This, however, did not answer the intended purpose. The signet happened to be swallowed by a fish, which was taken a few days afterwards, and thus was restored to Polycrates. Of this Amasis was no sooner informed, than, considering Polycrates as really unhappy, and already on the brink of destruction, he resolved to put an end to the friendship which subsisted between them. For this purpose he despatched a herald to Samos, commanding him to acquaint Polycrates, that he renounced his alliance, and all the obligations between them; that he might not mourn his misfortunes with the sorrow of a friend. Thus Amasis left Polycrates at liberty to act against him, if he chose to do so; and accordingly he offered to assist Cambyses with a fleet of ships in his Egyptian expedition.\n\nAmasis had not, however, the misfortune to see the calamities of his country. He died about 525 years before Christ, after a reign of 44 years; and left the kingdom to his son Pflamenitus, just as Cambyses was approaching the frontiers of the kingdom. The new vaded by prince was scarce seated on the throne, when the Persians appeared. Pflamenitus drew together what forces he could, in order to prevent them from entering the kingdom. Cambyses, however, immediately laid siege to Pelusium, and made himself master of it by the following stratagem: he placed in the front of his army a great number of cats, dogs, and other animals that were deemed sacred by the Egyptians. He then attacked the city, and took it without opposition; the garrison, which consisted entirely of Egyptians, not daring to throw a dart or shoot an arrow against their enemies, lest they should kill some of the holy animals.\n\nCambyses had scarce taken possession of the city, when Pflamenitus advanced against him with a numerous army. But before the engagement, the Greeks who served under Pflamenitus, to show their indignation,\nnation against their treacherous countryman Phanes, brought his children into the camp, killed them in the presence of their father and of the two armies, and then drank their blood. The Persians enraged at so cruel a sight, fell upon the Egyptians with the utmost fury, sent them to flight, and cut the greatest part of them in pieces. Those who escaped fled to Memphis, where they were soon after guilty of a horrid outrage. Cambyes sent a herald to them in a ship from Mitylene; but no sooner did they see her come into the port, than they flocked down to the shore, destroyed the ship, and tore to pieces the herald and all the crew; afterwards carrying their mangled limbs into the city, in a kind of barbarous triumph. Not long after, they were obliged to surrender; and thus Plamenitus fell into the hands of his inveterate enemy, who was now enraged beyond measure at the cruelties exercised upon the children of Phanes, the herald, and the Mitylenian sailors.\n\nThe rapid success of the Persians struck with such terror the Libyans, Cyreneans, Barceans, and other dependents or allies of the Egyptian monarch, that they immediately submitted. Nothing now remained but to dispose of the captive king, and revenge on him and his subjects the cruelties which they had committed. This the merciless victor executed in the severest manner. On the 15th day after Memphis had been taken, Plamenitus and the chief of the Egyptian nobility were ignominiously sent into one of the suburbs of that city. The king being there seated in a proper place, saw his daughter coming along in the habit of a poor slave with a pitcher to fetch water from the river, and followed by the daughters of the greatest families in Egypt, all in the same miserable garb, with pitchers in their hands, drowned in tears, and loudly bemoaning their miserable situation. When the fathers saw their daughters in this distress, they burst into tears, all but Plamenitus, who only cast his eyes on the ground and kept them fixed there. After the young women came the son of Plamenitus, with 2000 of the young nobility, all of them with bits in their mouths and halters round their necks, led to execution. This was done to expiate the murder of the Persian herald and the Mitylenian sailors; for Cambyes caused ten Egyptians of the first rank to be publicly executed for every one of those that had been slain. Plamenitus, however, observed the same conduct as before, keeping his eyes steadfastly fixed on the ground, though all the Egyptians around him made the loudest lamentations. A little after this he saw an intimate friend and companion, now advanced in years, who having been plundered of all he had, was begging his bread from door to door in the suburbs. As soon as he saw this man, Plamenitus wept bitterly; and calling out to him by his name, struck himself on the head as if he had been frantic. Of this the spies who had been set over him to observe his behaviour, gave immediate notice to Cambyes, who thereupon sent a messenger to inquire the cause of such immoderate grief. Plamenitus answered, That the calamities of his own family confounded him, and were too great to be lamented by any outwards signs of grief; but the extreme distress of a bosom friend gave more room for reflection, and therefore extorted tears from him. With this answer Cambyes was so affected, that he sent orders to prevent the execution of the king's son; but these came too late, for the young prince had been put to death before any of the rest. Plamenitus himself was then sent into the city, and restored to his liberty; and had he not showed a desire of revenge, might perhaps have been trusted with the government of Egypt; but being discovered hatching schemes against the government, he was seized, and condemned to drink bull's blood.\n\nThe Egyptians were now reduced to the lowest degree of slavery. Their country became a province of the Persian empire; the body of Amasis, their late king, province of the Persian, was taken out of his grave; and after being mangled and afterward in a shocking manner was finally burnt. But what wards of feigned more grievous than all the rest, their god Apis the Grecian was slain, and his priests ignominiously scourged; and empire, this inspired the whole nation with such a hatred to the Persians, that they could never afterwards be reconciled to them. As long as the Persian empire subsisted, the Egyptians could never shake off their yoke. They frequently revolted indeed, but were always overthrown with prodigious loss. At last they submitted, without opposition, to Alexander the Great; after his death, Egypt again became a powerful kingdom; though since the conquest of it by Cambyes to the present time it hath never been governed but by foreign princes, agreeable to the prophecy of Ezekiel, \"There shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt.\"\n\nOn the death of Alexander the Great, Egypt, together with Libya, and that part of Arabia which Ptolemy borders on Egypt, were assigned to Ptolemy Lagus as Lagus, who was named the governor under Alexander's son by Roxana, who was title of but newly born. Nothing was farther from the intention of this governor, than to keep the provinces in trust for another. He did not, however, assume the title of king, till he perceived his authority so firmly established that it could not be shaken, and this did not happen till 19 years after the death of Alexander, when Antigonus and Demetrius had unsuccessfully attempted the conquest of Egypt.\n\nFrom the time of his first establishment on the throne, Ptolemy, who had assumed the title of Soter, reigned 20 years; which added to the former 19, make up the 39 years which historians commonly allow him to have reigned alone.—In the 39th year of his reign, he made one of his sons, named Philadelphus, partner to the empire; declaring him his successor, to the prejudice of his eldest son named Ceraunus; being excited thereto by his violent love for Berenice Philadelphus's mother. When the succession was thus settled, Ceraunus immediately quitted the court; and fled at last into Syria, where he was received with open arms by Seleucus Nicator, whom he afterwards murdered.\n\nThe most remarkable transaction of this reign was the embellishing of the city of Alexandria, which Ptolemy made the capital of his new kingdom, and of which an account is given under the article Alexandria. About 284 years before Christ, died Ptolemy Soter, in the 41st year of his reign, and 84th of his age. He was the best prince of his race; and left behind him an example of prudence, justice, and clemency which few of his successors chose to follow. Besides the provinces originally assigned to him, he added to his empire those of Coelo-Syria, Ethiopia, Pamphylia, Lycia,\nEgypt, Lycia, Caria, and some of the Cyclades. His successor, Ptolemy Philadelphus, added nothing to the extent of the empire; nor did he perform anything worthy of notice except embellishing further the city of Alexandria, and entering into an alliance with the Romans. In his time, one Magas, the governor of Libya and Cyrene, revolted; and held these provinces as an independent prince, notwithstanding the utmost efforts of Ptolemy to reduce him. At last an accommodation took place; and a marriage was proposed between Berenice, the only daughter of Magas, and Ptolemy's eldest son. The young princess was to receive all her father's dominions by way of dowry, and thus they would again be brought under the dominion of Ptolemy's family. But before this treaty could be put in execution, Magas died; and then Apamea, the princess's mother, did all she could to prevent the match. This, however, she was not able to do; though her efforts for that purpose produced a destructive war of four years continuance with Antiochus Theus king of Syria, and the acting of a cruel tragedy in the family of the latter. See Syria.\n\nAbout 246 years before Christ, Ptolemy Philadelphus died; and was succeeded by his eldest son Ptolemy, who had been married to Berenice, the daughter of Magas as above related. In the beginning of his reign, he found himself engaged in a war with Antiochus Theus king of Syria. From this he returned victorious, and brought with him 2500 statues and pictures, among which were many of the ancient Egyptian idols, which had been carried away by Cambyses into Persia. These were restored by Ptolemy to their ancient temples; in memory of which favour, the Egyptians gave him the surname of Euergetes, or the Beneficent. In this expedition he greatly enlarged his dominions, making himself master of all the countries that lie between Mount Taurus and the confines of India. An account of these conquests was given by himself, inscribed on a monument, to the following effect. \"Ptolemy Euergetes, having received from his father the sovereignty of Egypt, Libya, Syria, Phoenice, Cyprus, Lydia, Caria, and the other Cyclades, assembled a mighty army of horse and foot, with a great fleet, and elephants, out of Troglodytia and Ethiopia; some of which had been taken by his father, and the rest by himself, and brought from thence, and trained up for war; with this great force he sailed into Asia; and having conquered all the provinces which lie on this side the Euphrates, Cilicia, Pamphylia, Ionia, the Hellespont, and Thrace, he crossed that river with all the forces of the conquered countries, and the kings of those nations, and reduced Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Susiana, Persia, Media, and all the country as far as Bactria.\"\n\nOn the king's return from this expedition, he passed through Jerusalem, where he offered many sacrifices to the God of Israel, and ever afterwards expressed a great favour for the Jewish nation. At this time, the Jews were tributaries to the Egyptian monarchs, and paid them annually 20 talents of silver. This tribute, however, Onias, who was then high priest, being of a very covetous disposition, had for a long time neglected to pay, so that the arrears amounted to a very large sum. Soon after his return, therefore, Ptolemy sent one of his courtiers named Athenion to demand the money, and desired him to acquaint the Jews that he would make war upon them in case of refusal. A young man, however, named Joseph, nephew to Onias, not only found means to avert the king's anger, but even got himself chosen his receiver general, and by his faithful discharge of that important trust, continued in high favour with Ptolemy as long as he lived.\n\nPtolemy Euergetes having at last concluded a peace with Seleucus the successor of Antiochus Theus king of Syria, attempted the enlargement of his dominions on the south side. In this he was attended with such success, that he made himself master of all the coasts of the Red sea, both on the Arabian and Ethiopian sides, quite down to the straits of Babelmandel. On his return he was met by ambassadors from the Achaeans, imploring his assistance against the Eolians and Macedonians. This the king readily promised them; but they having in the mean time engaged Antigonus king of Macedon to support them, Ptolemy was so much offended, that he sent powerful succours to Cleomenes king of Sparta; hoping, by that means, to humble both the Achaeans and their new ally Antigonus. In this, however, he was disappointed; for Cleomenes, after having gained very considerable advantages over the enemy, was at last entirely defeated in the battle of Sellafia, and obliged to take refuge in Egypt. Ptolemy's dominions. He was received by the Egyptian monarch with the greatest demonstrations of kindness; a yearly pension of 24 talents was assigned him, with a promise of restoring him to the Spartan throne; but before this could be accomplished, the king of Egypt died, in the 27th year of his reign, and was succeeded by his son Ptolemy Philopater.\n\nThus we have seen the Egyptian empire brought to a very great height of power; and had the succeeding monarchs been careful to preserve that strength of empire transmitted to them by Euergetes, it is very probable that Egypt might have been capable of holding the balance against Rome, and after the destruction of Carthage prevented that haughty city from becoming mistress of the world. But after the death of Ptolemy Euergetes, the Egyptian empire, being governed only by weak or vicious monarchs, quickly declined, and from that time makes no conspicuous figure in history.\n\nPtolemy Philopater began his reign with the murder of his brother; after which, giving himself up to all manner of licentiousness, the kingdom fell into a kind of anarchy. Cleomenes the Spartan king still resided at court; and being now unable to bear the dissolute manners which prevailed there, he pressed Philopater to give him the assistance he had promised for restoring him to the throne of Sparta. This he the rather insisted upon, because he had received advice that Antigonus king of Macedon was dead, that the Achaeans were engaged in a war with the Eolians, and that the Macedonians had joined the latter against the Achaeans and Macedonians. Ptolemy, when afraid of his brother Magas, had indeed promised to assist the king of Sparta with a powerful fleet, hoping by this means to attach him to his own interest; but now when Magas was out of the way, it was determined by the king, or rather his ministers, that Cleomenes should not be assisted, nor even allowed to leave the kingdom; and this extravagant resolution produced the desperate attempt.\ntempt of Cleomenes, of which an account is given in the history of Sparta.\n\nOf the disorders which now ensued in the government, Antiochus king of Syria, furnishing the Great, took the advantage, and attempted to wrest from Ptolemy the provinces of Coelo-Syria and Palestine. But in this he was finally disappointed; and might easily have been totally driven out of Syria, had not Ptolemy been too much taken up with his debaucheries to think of carrying on the war. The discontent occasioned by this piece of negligence soon produced a civil war in his dominions, and the whole kingdom continued in the utmost confusion till his death, which happened in the 17th year of his reign and 37th of his age.\n\nDuring the reign of Philopater happened a very extraordinary event with regard to the Jews, which is mentioned in the Maccabees*. The king of Egypt, while on his Syrian expedition, had attempted to enter the temple of Jerusalem; but being hindered by the Jews, he was filled with the utmost rage against the whole nation. On his return to Alexandria, he resolved to make those who dwelt in that city feel the first effects of his vengeance. He began with publishing a decree, which he caused to be engraved on a pillar erected for that purpose at the gate of his palace, excluding all those who did not sacrifice to the gods worshipped by the king. By this means the Jews were debarred from suing to him for justice, or obtaining his protection when they happened to stand in need of it. By the favour of Alexander the Great, Ptolemy Soter, and Euergetes, the Jews enjoyed at Alexandria the same privileges with the Macedonians. In that metropolis the inhabitants were divided into three ranks or classes. In the first were the Macedonians, or original founders of the city, and along with them were enrolled the Jews; in the second were the mercenaries who had served under Alexander; and in the third the native Egyptians. Ptolemy now, to be revenged of the Jews, ordered, by another decree, that they should be degraded from the first rank, and enrolled among the native Egyptians. By the same decree it was enacted, that all of that nation should appear at an appointed time before the proper officers, in order to be enrolled among the common people; that at the time of their enrollment they should have the mark of an ivy leaf, the badge of Bacchus, impressed with a hot iron on their faces; that all who were thus marked should be made slaves; and, lastly, that if any one should stand out against this decree, he should be immediately put to death. That he might not, however, seem an enemy to the whole nation, he declared, that those who sacrificed to their gods should enjoy their former privileges, and remain in the same class. Yet notwithstanding this tempting offer, 300 only out of many thousand Jews who lived in Alexandria could be prevailed upon to abandon their religion in order to save themselves from slavery.\n\nThe apostates were immediately excommunicated by their brethren; and this their enemies construed as done in opposition to the king's order; which threw the tyrant into such a rage, that he resolved to extirpate the whole nation, beginning with the Jews who lived in Alexandria and other cities of Egypt, and proceeding from thence to Judaea and Jerusalem itself. In consequence of this cruel resolution, he commanded all the Jews that lived in any part of Egypt to be brought in chains to Alexandria, and there to be shut up in the Hippodrome, which was a very spacious place without the city, where the people used to assemble to see horse races and other public diversions. He then sent for Herman master of the elephants; and commanded him to have 500 of these animals ready against the next day, to let loose upon the Jews in the Hippodrome. But when the elephants were prepared for the execution, and the people were assembled in great crowds to see it, they were for that day disappointed by the king's absence. For, having been late up the night before with some of his debauched companions, he did not awake till the time for the show was over, and the spectators returned home. He therefore ordered one of his servants to call him early on the following day, that the people might not meet with a second disappointment. But when the person awakened him according to his order, the king was not yet returned to his senses; having withdrawn, exceedingly drunk, only a short time before. As he did not remember the order, he therefore fell into a violent passion, and threatened with death the servant who had awakened him; and this caused the show to be put off till the third day. At last the king came to the Hippodrome attended with a vast multitude of spectators; but when the elephants were let loose, instead of falling upon the Jews, they turned their rage against the spectators and soldiers, and destroyed great numbers of them. At the same time, some frightful appearances which were seen in the air so terrified the king, that he commanded the Jews to be immediately set at liberty, and restored them to their former privileges. No sooner were they delivered from this danger than they demanded leave to put to death such of their nation as had abandoned their religion; and this being granted, they despatched the apostates without excepting a single man.\n\nPhilopater was succeeded by Ptolemy Epiphanes; Ptolemy and he, after a reign of 24 years, by Ptolemy Philo-Philometor. In the beginning of his reign, a war commenced with the king of Syria, who had seized on the provinces of Coelo-Syria and Palestine in the preceding reign. In the course of this war, Philometer was either voluntarily delivered up to Antiochus or taken prisoner. But however this was, the Alexandrians despising of his ever being able to recover his liberty, raised to the throne his brother Ptolemy, who took the name of Euergetes II. but was afterwards called Phykon or \"the great-bellied,\" on account of the prominent belly which by his gluttony and luxury he had acquired. He was scarce seated on the throne, however, when Antiochus Epiphanes, returning into Egypt, drove out Phykon, and restored the whole kingdom except Pelusium, to Philometor. His design was to kindle a war betwixt the two brothers, so that he might have an opportunity of seizing the kingdom for himself. For this reason he kept to himself the city of Pelusium; which being the key of Egypt, he might at his pleasure re-enter the country. But Philometor, apprised of his design, invited his brother Phykon to an accommodation; which was happily effected by their sister Cleopatra. In virtue of this agreement, the brothers were to reign jointly, and to oppose to the utmost of their power Antiochus, whom they considered as a common\ncommon enemy. On this the king of Syria invaded Egypt with a mighty army, but was prevented by the Romans from conquering it.\n\nThe two brothers were no sooner freed from the apprehensions of a foreign enemy than they began to quarrel with each other. Their differences soon came to such a height, that the Roman senate interposed. But before the ambassadors employed to inquire into the merits of the cause could arrive in Egypt, Physon had driven Philometor from the throne, and obliged him to quit the kingdom. On this the dethroned prince fled to Rome, where he appeared meanly dressed, and without attendants. He was very kindly received by the senate; who were so well satisfied of the injustice done him, that they immediately decreed his restoration. He was reconducted accordingly; and, on the arrival of the ambassadors in Egypt, an accommodation between the two brothers was negotiated. By this agreement, Physon was put in possession of Libya and Cyrene, and Philometor of all Egypt and the island of Cyprus; each of them being declared independent of the other in the dominion allotted to them. The treaty, as usual, was confirmed with oaths and sacrifices, and was broken almost as soon as made. Physon was dissatisfied with his share of the dominions; and therefore sent ambassadors to Rome, deiring that the island of Cyprus might be added to his other possessions. This could not be obtained by the ambassadors; and therefore Physon went to Rome in person. His demand was evidently unjust; but the Romans, considering that it was their interest to weaken the power of Egypt as much as possible, without further ceremony adjudged the island to him.\n\nPhyson set out from Rome with two ambassadors; and arriving in Greece on his way to Cyprus, he raised there a great number of mercenaries, with a design to sail immediately to that island and conquer it. But the Roman ambassadors telling him, that they were commanded to put him in possession of it by fair means and not by force, he dismissed his army, and returned to Libya, while one of the ambassadors proceeded to Alexandria. Their design was to bring the two brothers to an interview on the frontiers of their dominions, and there to settle matters in an amicable manner. But the ambassador who went to Alexandria, found Philometor very averse from compliance with the decree of the senate. He put off the ambassador so long, that Physon sent the other also to Alexandria, hoping that the joint persuasions of the two would induce Philometor to comply. But the king, after entertaining them at an immense charge for 40 days, at last plainly refused to submit, and told the ambassadors that he was resolved to adhere to the first treaty. With this answer the Roman ambassadors departed, and were followed by others from the two brothers. The senate, however, not only confirmed their decree in favour of Physon, but renounced their alliance with Philometor, and commanded his ambassador to leave the city in five days.\n\nIn the meantime, the inhabitants of Cyrene having heard unfavourable accounts of Physon's behaviour during the short time he reigned in Alexandria, conceived so strong an aversion against him, that they resolved to keep him out of their country by force of arms. On receiving intelligence of this resolution, Physon dropped all thoughts of Cyprus for the present; and hastened with all his forces to Cyrene, where he soon got the better of his rebellious subjects, and established himself in the kingdom. His vicious and tyrannical conduct, however, soon estranged from him the minds of his subjects, in such a manner, that some of them entering into a conspiracy against him, fell upon him one night as he was returning to his palace, wounded him in several places, and left him for dead on the spot. This he laid to the charge of his brother Philometor; and as soon as he was recovered, took another voyage to Rome. Here he made his complaints to the senate, and showed them the scars of his wounds, accusing his brother of having employed the assassins from whom he received them. Though Philometor was known to be a man of most humane and mild disposition, and therefore very unlikely to have been concerned in so black an attempt; yet the senate, being offended at his refusing to submit to their decree concerning the island of Cyprus, heartened to this false accusation; and carried their prejudice so far, that they not only refused to hear what his ambassadors had to say, but ordered them immediately to depart from the city. At the same time, they appointed five commissioners to conduct Physon to Cyprus, and put him in possession of that island, enjoining all their allies in those parts to supply him with forces for that purpose.\n\nPhyson having by this means got together an army which seemed to him to be sufficient for the accomplishment of his design, landed in Cyprus; but being there encountered by Philometor in person, he was entirely defeated, and obliged to shelter himself in a city called Lapithos. Here he was closely besieged, and at last obliged to surrender. Every one now expected that Physon would have been treated as he deserved; but his brother, instead of punishing, restored him to the government of Libya and Cyrene, adding some other territories instead of the island of Cyprus, and promising him his daughter in marriage. Thus an end was put to the war between the two brothers; for the Romans were ashamed any longer to oppose a prince who had given such a signal instance of his justice and clemency.\n\nOn his return to Alexandria, Philometor appointed one Archias governor of Cyprus. But he, soon after the king's departure, agreed with Demetrius king of Syria, to betray the island to him for 500 talents. The treachery was discovered before it took effect; and the traitor, to avoid the punishment due to his crime, laid violent hands on himself. Ptolemy being offended with Demetrius for this attempt on Cyprus, joined Attalus king of Pergamus, and Ariarathes king of Cappadocia, in setting up a pretender to the crown of Syria. This was Alexander Balas; to whom he even gave his daughter Cleopatra in marriage, after he had placed him on the throne of Syria. But he, notwithstanding these and many other favours, being suspected of having entered into a plot against his benefactor, Ptolemy became his greatest enemy; and marching against him, routed his army in the neighbourhood of Antioch. He did not, however, long enjoy his victory; for he died in a few days after the engagement, of the wounds he had received.\n\nOn the death of Philometor, Cleopatra the queen despaired to secure the throne for her son. But some\nof the principal nobility declaring for Phycon, a civil war was about to ensue, when matters were compromised on condition that Phycon should marry Cleopatra, that he should reign jointly with her during his life, and declare her son by Philometor heir to the crown. These terms were no sooner agreed upon than Phycon married Cleopatra, and, on the very day of the nuptials, murdered her son in her arms. This was only a prelude to the cruelties which he afterwards practised on his subjects. He was no sooner seated on the throne, than he put to death all those who had shown any concern for the murder of the young prince. He then wreaked his fury on the Jews, whom he treated more like slaves than subjects, on account of their having favoured the cause of Cleopatra. His own people were treated with little more ceremony. Numbers of them were every day put to death for the smallest faults, and often for no fault at all, but merely to gratify his inhuman temper. His cruelty towards the Alexandrians is particularly mentioned under the article Alexandria. In a short time, being wearied of his queen, who was also his sister, he divorced her; and married her daughter, who was also called Cleopatra, and whom he had previously ravished. In short, his behaviour was so exceedingly wicked, that it soon became quite intolerable to his subjects; and he was obliged to fly to the island of Cyprus with his new queen, and Memphitis, a son he had by her mother.\n\nOn the flight of the king, the divorced queen was placed on the throne by the Alexandrians; but Phycon, fearing lest a son whom he had left behind should be appointed king, sent for him into Cyprus, and caused him to be assassinated as soon as he landed. This provoked the people against him to such a degree, that they pulled down and dashed to pieces all the statues which had been erected to him at Alexandria. This the tyrant supposed to have been done at the instigation of the queen, and therefore resolved to revenge it on her by killing his own son whom he had by her. He therefore, without the least remorse, caused the young prince's throat to be cut; and having put his mangled limbs into a box, sent them as a present to his mother Cleopatra. The messenger with whom this box was sent, was one of his guards. He was ordered to wait till the queen's birthday, which approached, and was to be celebrated with extraordinary pomp; and in the midst of the general rejoicing, he was to deliver the present.\n\nThe horror and detestation occasioned by this unexampled piece of cruelty cannot be expressed. An army was soon raised, and the command of it given to one Marias, whom the queen had appointed general, and enjoined to take all the necessary steps for the defence of the country. On the other hand, Phycon, having hired a numerous body of mercenaries, sent them, under the command of one Hegelocheus, against the Egyptians. The two armies met on the frontiers of Egypt, on which a bloody battle ensued; but at last the Egyptians were entirely defeated, and Marias was taken prisoner. Every one expected that the captive general would have been put to death with the severest torments; but Phycon, perceiving that his cruelties only exasperated the people, resolved to try whether he could regain their affections by lenity; and therefore pardoned Marias, and let him at liberty. Cleopatra, in the mean time, being greatly distressed by this overthrow, demanded assistance from Demetrius king of Syria, who had married her eldest daughter by Philometor, promising him the crown of Egypt for his reward. Demetrius accepted the proposal without hesitation, marched with all his forces into Egypt, and there laid siege to Pelusium. But he being no less hated in Syria than Phycon was in Egypt, the people of Antioch, taking advantage of his absence, revolted against him, and were joined by most of the other cities in Syria. Thus Demetrius was obliged to return; and Cleopatra, being now in no condition to oppose Phycon, fled to Ptolemais, where her daughter Phycon reigned the queen of Syria at that time resided. Phycon was then restored to the throne of Egypt, which he enjoyed without further molestation till his death; which happened at Alexandria, in the 29th year of his reign, and 67th of his age.\n\nTo Phycon succeeded Ptolemy Lathyrus, about 122 years before Christ; but he had not reigned long, before his mother, finding that he would not be entirely governed by her, by false promises flattered up the Alexandrians, who drove him from the throne, and placed Ptolemy on it his youngest brother Alexander. Lathyrus after this was obliged to content himself with the government of Cyprus, which he was permitted to enjoy in another quiet. Ptolemy Alexander, in the mean time, finding up, he was to have only the shadow of sovereignty, and that his mother Cleopatra was to have all the power, stole away privately from Alexandria. The queen used every artifice to bring him back, as well knowing that the Alexandrians would never suffer her to reign alone. At last her son yielded to her entreaties; but soon after, understanding that she had hired assassins to dispatch him, he caused her to be murdered.\n\nThe death of the queen was no sooner known to the Alexandrians, than, disdaining to be commanded by restored, a parricide, they drove out Alexander, and recalled Lathyrus.—The deposed prince for some time led a rambling life in the island of Cos; but having got together some ships, he, the next year, attempted to return into Egypt. But being met by Tyrrhus, Lathyrus's admiral, he was defeated, and obliged to fly to Myra in Lycia. From Myra he steered his course towards Cyprus, hoping that the inhabitants would place him on the throne, instead of his brother. But Chares, another of Lathyrus's admirals, coming up with him while he was ready to land, an engagement ensued, in which Alexander's fleet was dispersed, and he himself killed.\n\nDuring these disturbances, Apion king of Cyrenaica, the son of Ptolemy Phycon by a concubine, having bequeathed maintained peace and tranquillity in his dominions during a reign of 21 years, died, and by his will left his kingdom to the Romans; and thus the Egyptian empire was considerably reduced and circumcised.\n\nLathyrus being now delivered from all competitors, turned his arms against the city of Thebes, which had revolted from him. The king marched in person against the rebels; and, having defeated them in a pitched battle, laid close siege to their city. The inhabitants defended themselves with great resolution for three years. At last, however, they were obliged to submit, and the city was given up to be plundered by the soldiery. They left everywhere the most melancholy\nholly monuments of their avarice and cruelty; so that Thebes, which till that time had been one of the most wealthy cities of Egypt, was now reduced so low that it never afterwards made any figure.\n\nAbout 76 years before Christ, Ptolemy Lathyrus was succeeded by Alexander II. He was the son of the Ptolemy Alexander for whom Lathyrus had been driven out; and had met with many adventures. He was first sent by Cleopatra into the island of Cos, with a great sum of money, and all her jewels; as thinking that was the safest place where they could be kept. When Mithridates king of Pontus made himself master of that island, the inhabitants delivered up to him the young Egyptian prince, together with all the treasures. Mithridates gave him an education suitable to his birth; but he, not thinking himself safe with a prince who had shed the blood of his own children, fled to the camp of Sylla the Roman dictator, who was then making war in Asia. From that time he lived in the family of the Roman general, till news was brought to Rome of the death of Lathyrus. Sylla then sent him to Egypt to take possession of the throne. But, before his arrival, the Alexandrians had chosen Cleopatra for their sovereign. To compromise matters, however, it was agreed, that Ptolemy should marry her, and take her for his partner in the throne. This was accordingly done; and 19 days after the marriage, the unhappy queen was murdered by her husband, who for 15 years afterwards showed himself such a monster of wickedness, that a general insurrection at last ensued among his subjects, and he was obliged to fly to Pompey the Great, who was then carrying on the war against Mithridates king of Pontus. But Pompey refusing to concern himself in the matter, he retired to the city of Tyre, where he died some months after.\n\nWhen he was forced to shut himself up in the city of Tyre, Alexander had sent ambassadors to Rome, in order to influence the senate in his favour. But, dying before the negociation was finished, he made over by his last will all his rights to the Roman people, declaring them heirs to his kingdom: not out of any affection to the republic; but with a view to raise disputes between the Romans and his rival Auletes, whom the Egyptians had placed on the throne. The will was brought to Rome, where it occasioned warm debates. Some were for taking immediate possession of the kingdom. Others thought that no notice should be taken of such a will, because Alexander had no right to dispose of his dominions in prejudice of his successor, and to exclude from the crown those who were of the royal family of Egypt. Cicero represented, that such a notorious imposition would debauch the majesty of the Roman people, and involve them in endless wars and disputes; that the fruitful fields of Egypt would be a strong temptation to the avarice of the people, who would insist on their being divided among them; and lastly, that by this means the bloody quarrels about the Agrarian laws would be revived. These reasons had some weight with the senate; but what chiefly prevented them from seizing on Egypt at this time was, that they had lately taken possession of the kingdom of Bithynia in virtue of the will of Nicomedes, and of Cyrene and Libya by the will of Apion. They thought, therefore, that if they should, on the like pretence, take possession of the kingdom of Egypt, this might too much expose their design of setting up a kind of universal monarchy, and occasion a formidable combination against them.\n\nAuletes, who was now raised to the throne by the Character Egyptians, is said to have surpassed all the kings that went before him in the effeminacy of his manners. The new name Auletes, which signifies the flute-player, was given him because he prided himself on his skill in performing upon that instrument, and was not ashamed even to contend for the prize in the public games. He took great pleasure in imitating the manners of the Bacchanals; dancing in a female dress, and in the same measures that they used during the solemnity of their god Bacchus, and hence he had the surname of the New Dionysius or Bacchus. As his title to the crown was disputable (he being only the son of a concubine), the first care of Auletes was to get himself acknowledged by the Romans, and declared their ally. This was obtained by applying to Julius Caesar, who was at that time consul, and immensely in debt. Ledged by Caesar being glad of such an opportunity of raising the Roman money, made the king of Egypt pay pretty dear for his alliance. Six thousand talents, a sum equal to £1,625,000 sterling, were paid partly to Caesar himself, and partly to Pompey, whose interest was necessary for obtaining the consent of the people. Though the revenues of Egypt amounted to twice this sum, yet Auletes found it impossible for him to raise it without severely taxing his subjects. This occasioned a general discontent; and while the people were almost ready to take up arms, a most unjust decree passed at Rome for seizing the island of Cyprus. When the Alexandrians heard of the intentions of the republic, they preferred Auletes to demand that island as an ancient appendage of Egypt; and, in case of a refusal, to declare war against that haughty and imperious people, who, they now saw, though too late, aimed at nothing less than the sovereignty of the world. With this request the king refused to comply; upon which his subjects, already provoked beyond measure at the taxes with which they were loaded, flew to arms, and surrounded the palace. The king had the good luck to throne, and escape their fury, and immediately leaving Alexandria, flies to Rome.\n\nIn his way to that city, he landed on the island of Rhodes, where the famous Cato at that time was, being on his way to Cyprus, to put the unjust decree of the senate in execution. Auletes, desirous to confer with a man of his prudence, immediately sent to acquaint him with his arrival. He imagined, that, upon this notice, Cato would immediately come and wait upon him; but the proud Roman told the messenger, that if the king of Egypt had anything to say to Cato, he might, if he thought proper, come to his house. Accordingly the king went to pay him a visit; but was received with very little ceremony by Cato, who did not even vouchsafe to rise out of his seat when he came into his presence. When Auletes had laid his affairs before this haughty republican, he was blamed by him for leaving Egypt, the richest kingdom in the world, in order to expose himself, as he said, to the indignities he would meet with at Rome. There Cato told him, that nothing was in request but wealth and grandeur. All the riches of Egypt, he said, would not be sufficient\nEgypt sufficient to satisfy the avarice of the leading men in Rome. He therefore advised him to return to Egypt; and strive, by a more equitable conduct, to regain the affections of his people. He even offered to reconduct him thither, and employ his good offices in his behalf. But though Ptolemy was sensible of the propriety of this advice, the friends he had with him dissuaded him from following it, and accordingly he set out for Rome.\n\nOn his arrival in this metropolis, the king found, to his great concern, that Caesar, in whom he placed his greatest confidence, was then in Gaul. He was received, however, by Pompey with great kindness. He assigned him an apartment in his own house, and omitted nothing that lay in his power to serve him. But notwithstanding the protection of so powerful a man, Auletes was forced to go from house to house like a private person, soliciting the votes of the senators. After he had spent immense treasures in procuring a strong party in the city, he was at last permitted to lay his complaints before the senate; and at the same time there arrived an embassy from the Alexandrians, consisting of 100 citizens, to acquaint the senate with the reasons of their revolt.\n\nWhen Auletes first set out for Rome, the Alexandrians, not knowing what was become of him, placed on the throne his daughter Berenice; and sent an embassy into Syria to Antiochus Asiaticus, inviting him into Egypt to marry the queen, and reign in partnership with her. Antiochus was dead before the arrival of the ambassadors; upon which the same proposal was made to his brother Seleucus, who readily accepted it. This Seleucus is described by Strabo as monstrously deformed in body, and still more so in mind. The Egyptians nicknamed him Cybiotaeter, or the Scullion; a name which seemed more fit for him than any other. He was scarce settled on the throne, when he gave a signal instance of his lordly and avaricious temper. Ptolemy the first had caused the body of Alexander the Great to be deposited in a coffin of maffy gold. This the king feigned upon; and by that means provoked his wife Berenice to such a degree, that she caused him to be murdered. She then married one Archelaus, high priest of Comana in Pontus, who pretended to be the son of Mithridates the Great; but was, in fact, only the son of that monarch's general.\n\nAuletes was not a little alarmed on hearing of these transactions, especially when the ambassadors arrived, which he feared would overturn all the schemes he had laboured so much to bring about. The embassy was headed by one Dion, a celebrated Academic philosopher who had many powerful friends at Rome. But Ptolemy found means to get both him and most of his followers assassinated; and this intimidated the rest to such a degree, that they durst not execute their commission, or, for some time, even demand justice for the murder of their colleagues.\n\nThe report of so many murders, however, at last spread a general alarm. Auletes, sure of the protection of Pompey, did not scruple to own himself the perpetrator of them. Nay, though an action was commenced against one Aetius, an assailer, who had stabbed Dion the chief of the embassy above mentioned, and the crime was fully proved; yet he was acquitted by the venal judges, who had all been bribed by Ptolemy. In a short time, the senate passed a decree, by which it was enacted, that the king of Egypt should be restored by force of arms. All the great men in Rome were ambitious of this commission; which, they thought well knew, would be attended with immense profit by the few. Their contests on this occasion took up a considerable time; and at last a prophecy of the Sybil was found out, which forbade the afflicting an Egyptian monarch with an army. Ptolemy, therefore, wearied out with too long a delay, retired from Rome, where he had made himself generally odious, to the temple of Diana at Ephesus, there to wait the decision of his fate. Here he remained a considerable time; but as he saw that the senate came to no resolution, though he had solicited them by letters to do so; at last, by Pompey's advice, he applied to Gabinius the proconsul of Syria. This Gabinius was a man of a most infamous character, and ready to undertake anything for money. Therefore, though it was contrary to an express law for any governor to go out of his province without positive orders from the senate and people of Rome, yet Gabinius ventured to transgress this law, upon condition of being well paid for his pains. As a recompense for his trouble, however, he demanded 10,000 talents; that is, 1,937,500L undertakes sterling. Ptolemy, glad to be restored on any terms, agreed to pay the above-mentioned sum; but Gabinius him for a great sum would not stir till he had received one half of it. This obliged the king to borrow it from a Roman knight named Caius Rabirius Posthumus; Pompey interposing his credit and authority for the payment of the capital and interest.\n\nGabinius now set out for Egypt, attended by the famous Mark Antony, who at this time served in the army under him. He was met by Archelaus, who since the departure of Auletes had reigned in Egypt jointly with Berenice, at the head of a numerous army. The Egyptians were utterly defeated, and Archelaus taken prisoner in the first engagement. Thus Gabinius might have put an end to the war at once; but his avarice prompted him to dismiss Archelaus on his paying a considerable ransom; after which, pretending that he had made his escape, fresh sums were demanded from Ptolemy for defraying the expenses of the war. For these sums Ptolemy was again obliged to apply to Rabirius, who lent him what money he wanted at a very high interest. At last, however, Archelaus was defeated and killed, and thus Ptolemy again became master of all Egypt.\n\nNo sooner was Auletes firmly settled on the throne, than he put to death his daughter Berenice, and opposed his people with the most cruel exactions, in order to procure the money he had been obliged to borrow while in a state of exile. These oppressions and exactions the cowardly Egyptians bore with great patience, being intimidated by the garrison which Gabinius had left in Alexandria. But neither the fear of the Romans, nor the authority of Ptolemy, could make them put up an affront offered to their religion. A Roman soldier happened to kill a cat, which was an animal held sacred and even worshipped by the Egyptians; and no sooner was this supposed sacrilege known, than the Alexandrians made a general insurrection, and, gathering together in crowds, made their way through...\nEgypt through the Roman guards, dragged the soldier out of his house, and, in spite of all opposition, tore him in pieces.\n\nNotwithstanding the heavy taxes, however, which Ptolemy laid on his people, it doth not appear that he had any design of paying his debts. Rabirius, who, as we have already observed, had sent him immense sums, finding that the king affected delays, took a voyage to Egypt, in order to expolituate with him in person. Ptolemy paid very little regard to his expolitulations; but excused himself on account of the bad state of his finances. For this reason he offered to make Rabirius collector general of his revenues, that he might in that employment pay himself. The unfortunate creditor accepted the employment for fear of losing his debt. But Ptolemy, soon after, upon some frivolous pretence or other, caused him and all his servants to be closely confined. This base conduct exasperated Pompey as much as Rabirius; for the former had been in a manner security for the debt, as the money had been lent at his request, and the business transferred at a country house of his near Alba. However, as Rabirius had reason to fear the worst, he took the first opportunity of making his escape, glad to get off with life from his cruel and faithless debtor. To complete his misfortunes, he was prosecuted at Rome as soon as he returned. 1. For having enabled Ptolemy to corrupt the senate with sums lent him for that purpose. 2. For having debauched and dishonoured the character of a Roman knight, by farming the revenues, and becoming the servant of a foreign prince. 3. For having been an accomplice with Gabinius, and sharing with him the 10,000 talents which that proconsul had received for his Egyptian expedition. By the eloquence of Cicero he was acquitted; and one of the best orations to be found in the writings of that author was composed on this occasion. Gabinius was also prosecuted; and, as Cicero spoke against him, he very narrowly escaped death. He was, however, condemned to perpetual banishment, after having been stripped of all he was worth. He lived in exile till the time of the civil wars, when he was recalled by Caesar, in whose service he lost his life.\n\nAuletes enjoyed the throne of Egypt about four years after his re-establishment; and at his death left his children, a son and two daughters, under the tuition of the Roman people. The name of the son was Ptolemy, those of the daughters were Cleopatra and Arsinoe. This was the Cleopatra who afterwards became so famous, and had so great a share in the civil wars of Rome. As the transactions of the present reign, however, are so closely connected with the affairs of Rome, that they cannot be well understood without knowing the situation of the Romans at that time, we refer for an account of them to the History of Rome.\n\nWith Cleopatra ended the family of Ptolemy Lagus, Egypt's first the founder of the Grecian empire in Egypt, after it conquest by had held that country in subjection for the space of the caliph of Cairo, 294 years. From this time Egypt became a province of the Roman empire, and continued subject to the emperors of Rome or Constantinople. In the year 642, it was conquered by the Arabs under Amru Ibn al As, one of the generals of the caliph Omar. In the year 889, an independent government was set up in this kingdom by Ahmed Ebn Tolun, who rebelled against Al Mokhadi caliph of Bagdad. It continued to be governed by him and his successors for 27 years, when it was again reduced by Al Moctafi caliph of Bagdad. In about 30 years after, we find it again an independent state, being joined with Syria under Mahomet Ebn Taj, who had been appointed governor of these provinces. This government, however, was also but short-lived; for in the year 968 it was conquered by Jawhar, one of the generals of Moez Ledinillah, the Fatemite caliph of Cairo in Barbary. See Barbary, No. 34.\n\nNo sooner was Moez informed of the success of his general, than he prepared with all expedition to go and take possession of his new conquest. Accordingly he ordered all the vast quantities of gold which he and his predecessors had amassed, to be cast into ingots of the size and figure of the millstones used in hand mills, and conveyed on camels back into Egypt. To show that he was fully determined to abandon his dominions in Barbary, and to make Egypt the residence of himself and his successors, he caused the remains of the three former princes of his race to be removed from Cairo in Barbary, and to be deposited in a stately mosque erected for that purpose in the city of Cairo in Egypt. This was a most effectual method to induce his successors to reside in Egypt also, as it was become an established custom and duty among those princes frequently to pay their respectful visits to the tombs of their ancestors.\n\nTo establish himself the more effectually in his new dominions, Moez suppressed the usual prayers made in the mosques for the caliphs of Bagdad, and substituted for the his own name in their stead. This was complied with, not only in Egypt and Syria, but even throughout all Bagdad, Arabia, the city of Mecca alone excepted. The consequence was, a schism in the Mahommedan faith, which continued upwards of 200 years, and was attended with continual anathemas, and sometimes destructive wars between the caliphs of Bagdad and of Egypt.—Having fully established himself in his kingdom, he died in the 45th year of his age, three years after he had left his dominions in Barbary; and was succeeded by his son Abu Al Manfur Barar, named Aziz Billah.\n\nThe new caliph succeeded to the throne at the age of 21; and committed the management of affairs entirely to the care of Jawhar, his father's long-experienced general and prime minister. In 978, he sent this famous warrior to drive out Al Aftekin, the emir of Damascus. The Egyptian general accordingly formed the siege of that place; but at the end of two months, was obliged to raise it, on the approach of an army of Karmatians under the command of Al Hakem. As Jawhar was not strong enough to venture an engagement with these Karmatians, it was impossible for him to hinder them from effecting a junction with the forces of Al Aftekin. He therefore retreated, or rather fled, towards Egypt with the utmost expedition; but being overtaken by the two confederate armies, he was soon reduced to the last extremity. He was, however, permitted to resume his march, on condition that he paused under Al Aftekin's sword and Al Hakem's lance; and to this disgraceful condition Jawhar found himself obliged to submit. On his arrival in Egypt,\nhe immediately advised Al Aziz to undertake an expedition in person into the east, against the combined army of Turks, Karmatians, and Damascenes, under the command of Al Aftekin and Al Hakem. The caliph followed his advice; and advancing against his enemies, overthrew them with great slaughter. Al Aftekin himself escaped out of the battle; but was afterwards taken and brought to Al Aziz, who made him his chamberlain, and treated him with great kindness. Jawhar, in the mean time, was disgraced on account of his bad success; and in his disgrace he continued till his death, which happened in the year of our Lord, 990, and of the Hegira 381.\n\nThis year Al Aziz having received advice of the death of Saado'dawla prince of Aleppo, sent a formidable army under the command of a general named Manjubeckin, to reduce that place. Lulu, who had been appointed guardian to Saado'dawla's son, finding himself pressed by the Egyptians, who carried on the siege with great vigour, demanded assistance from the Greek emperor. Accordingly, he ordered a body of troops to advance to Lulu's relief. Manjubeckin, being informed of their approach, immediately raised the siege, and advanced to give them battle. An obstinate engagement ensued, in which the Greeks were at last overthrown with great slaughter. After this victory, Manjubeckin pushed on the siege of Aleppo very briskly; but finding the place capable of defending itself much longer than he at first imagined, and his provisions beginning to fail, he raised the siege. The caliph upon this sent him a very threatening letter, and commanded him to return before Aleppo. He did so; and continued the siege for 13 months; during all which time it was defended by Lulu with incredible bravery. At last, the Egyptians hearing that a numerous army of Greeks was on their way to relieve the city, they raised the siege, and fled with the utmost precipitation. The Greeks then took and plundered some of the cities which Al Aziz possessed in Syria; and Manjubeckin made the best of his way to Damascus, where he set up for himself. Al Aziz being informed of this revolt, marched in person against him with a considerable army; but being taken ill by the way, he expired, in the 21st year of his reign and 42d of his age.\n\nAl Aziz was succeeded by his son Abu Al Mansur, surnamed Al Hakem; who, being only 11 years of age, was put under the tuition of a eunuch of approved integrity.\n\nThis reign is remarkable for nothing so much as the madness with which the caliph was seized in the latter part of it. This manifested itself first by his issuing many preposterous edicts; but at length grew to such a height, that he fancied himself a god, and found no fewer than 16,000 persons who owned him as such. These were mostly the Dararians, a new sect sprung up about this time, who were led called from their chief, Mohammed Ebn Ithmael, surnamed Darari. He is supposed to have inspired the mad caliph with this impious notion; and, as Darari set up for a second Moses, he did not scruple to assert that Al Hakem was the great Creator of the universe. For this reason, a zealous Turk stabbed him in the caliph's chariot. His death was followed by a three days uproar in the city of Cairo; during which, Darari's house was pulled down, and many of his followers massacred. The feet, however, did not expire with its author. He left behind him a disciple named Hamza, who, being encouraged by the mad caliph, spread it far and wide through his dominions. This was quickly followed by an abrogation of all the Mahommedan laws, festivals, and pilgrimages, the grand one to Mecca in particular; so that the zealous Mahometans were now greatly alarmed, as justly supposing that Al Hakem designed entirely to suppress the worship of the true God, and introduce his own in its place. From this apprehension, however, they were delivered by the death of the caliph; who was assassinated, by a contrivance of his own father, in the year 1020.\n\nAl Hakem was succeeded by his son Al Thalier, who reigned 15 years; and left the throne to a son under seven years of age, named Al Moftaner Billah.—In the year 1041, a revolt happened in Syria; but Al Moftaner having sent a powerful army into that country, under the command of one Manjubeckin, he not only reduced the rebels, but considerably enlarged the Egyptian dominions in Syria.\n\nIn 1054, a Turk named Al Baffafiri, having quarrelled with the vizir of Al Kayem caliph of Bagdad, fled for attempts to Egypt, and put himself under the protection of Al Moftaner. The latter, imagining this would be a favourable opportunity for enlarging his dominions, and perhaps seizing on the city of Bagdad, supplied Baffafiri with money and troops. By this affluence, he was enabled to possess himself of Arabian Irak, and ravaged that province to the very gates of Bagdad. On this, Al Kayem wrote to Togrol Beg, or Tangerolipix, the Turkish sultan, who possessed very extensive dominions in the east, to come to his affluence. The sultan immediately complied with his request, and soon arrived at Bagdad with a formidable army and 18 elephants. Of this Baffafiri gave notice to Al Moftaner, and entreated him to exert himself further for his support against so powerful an enemy. This was accordingly done, but nothing worthy of notice happened till the year 1058. At this time Baffafiri having found means to excite Ibrahim the sultan's brother to a revolt, Togrol Beg was obliged to employ all his force against him. This gave Baffafiri an opportunity of seizing on the city of Bagdad itself; and the unfortunate caliph, according to some, was taken prisoner, or, according to others, fled out of the city. Baffafiri, on his entry, caused Al Moftaner to be immediately proclaimed caliph in all quarters of the city. Al Kayem's vizir he caused to be led on a camel through the streets of Bagdad, dreffed in a woollen gown, with a high red bonnet, and a leathern collar about his neck; a man lashing him all the way behind. Then being sewed up in a bull's hide, with the horns placed over his head, and hung upon hooks, he was beaten without ceasing till he died. The imperial palace was plundered, and the caliph himself detained a close prisoner.\n\nThis success was but short-lived; for, in 1059, To- The caliph Togrol Beg defeated his brother Ibrahim, took him pri- restored, foner, and strangled him with a bow string. He then marched to Bagdad, which Baffafiri thought proper to abandon at his approach. Here the caliph Al Kayem was delivered up by Mahras, the governor of a city called Hadiha, who had the charge of him. The caliph\ncaliph was immediately restored to his dignity; which Ballafiri no sooner understood, than he again advanced towards the city. Against him Togrol Beg sent a part of his army under some of his generals, while he himself followed with the rest. A battle ensued, in which the army of Ballafiri was defeated, and he himself killed. His head was brought to Togrol Beg, who caused it to be carried on a pike through the streets of Bagdad.\n\nThus the hopes of Al Moftaner were entirely frustrated; and from this period we may date the declension of the Egyptian empire under the caliphs. They had made themselves masters of almost all Syria; but no sooner was Ballafiri's bad success known, than the younger part of the citizens of Aleppo revolted, and set up Mahmud Azzo'dawla, who immediately laid siege to the citadel. Al Moftaner sent a powerful army against him, which Azzo'dawla entirely defeated, and took the general himself prisoner; and soon after this, he made himself master both of the city and citadel, with all their dependencies. In his new dominions he behaved with the greatest cruelty, destroying everything with fire and sword, and making frequent incursions into the neighbouring provinces, which he treated in the same manner.\n\nThis disaster was soon followed by others still more terrible. In 1066, a famine raged over all Egypt and Syria, with such fury, that dogs and cats were sold for four or five Egyptian dinars each, and other provisions in proportion. Multitudes of people died in Cairo for want of food. Nay, so great was the scarcity, that the vizir had but one servant left who was able to attend him to the caliph's palace, and to whom he gave the care of his horse when he alighted at the gate. But at his return, he was surprised to find that the horse had been carried off, killed and eaten by the famished people. Of this he complained to the caliph; who caused three of them who had carried off the horse to be hanged. Next day, however, he was still more surprised to hear, that all the flesh had been picked off the bones of the three unhappy criminals, so that nothing but the skeletons were left. And to such a degree of misery were the inhabitants, not only in Cairo but throughout all Egypt, reduced, that the carcases of those who died were sold for food at a great price, instead of being buried. All this time the caliph showed the greatest kindness and beneficence towards his unhappy subjects; inasmuch that of 10,000 horses, mules, and camels, which he had in his stables when the famine began, he had only three left when it was removed.\n\nThe famine was followed by a plague; and this by an invasion of the Turks under Abu Ali Al Hafan Naferod'dawla, the very general who had been sent against the rebel Azzo'dawla and defeated by him. He began with besieging the caliph in his own palace; and the unhappy prince, being in no condition to make resistance, was obliged to buy himself off at the expense of every thing valuable that was left in his exhausted capital and treasury. This, however, did not hinder those merciless plunderers from ravaging all the Lower Egypt from Cairo to Alexandria, and committing the most horrid cruelties through that whole tract.—This happened in the years 1067 and 1068; and in 1069 and 1070, there happened two other revolts in Syria: so that this country was now almost entirely lost.\n\nIn 1095 died the caliph Al Moftaner, having reigned 60 years; and was succeeded by his son Abul Kasem, named Al Moftali. The most remarkable transaction of this prince's reign, was his taking the city of Jerusalem from the Turks in 1098; but this Jerusalem success was only of short duration; for it was the same taken year taken by the crusaders.\n\nFrom this time to the year 1164, the Egyptian history affords little else than an account of the intestine broils and contests between the vizirs or prime ministers, who were now become so powerful, that they had in a great measure stripped the caliphs of their civil power, and left them nothing but a shadow of spiritual dignity. These contests at last gave occasion to a revolution, by which the race of Fatemite caliphs revolution was totally extinguished. This revolution was accomplished in the following manner. One Shauer, having overcome all his competitors, became vizir to Al Adel, the eleventh caliph of Egypt. He had not been long in possession of this office, when Al Dargam, an officer of rank, endeavoured to deprive him of it. Both parties quickly had recourse to arms; and a battle ensued, in which Shauer was defeated, and obliged to fly to Nuroddin prince of Syria, by whom he was graciously received, and who promised to reinstate him in his office of vizir. As an inducement to Nuroddin to assist him more powerfully, Shauer told him that the crusaders had landed in Egypt, and made a considerable progress in the conquest of it. He promised also, that, in case he was reinstated in his office, he would pay Nuroddin annually the third part of the revenues of Egypt; and would, besides, defray the whole expense of the expedition.\n\nAs Nuroddin bore an implacable hatred to the Christians, he readily undertook an expedition against them, for which he was to be so well paid. He therefore sent an army into Egypt under the command of Shauer and a general named Afadoddin. Dargam, in the meantime, had cut off so many generals whom he imagined favourable to Shauer's interest, that he thereby weakened the military force of the kingdom, and in a great measure deprived himself of the power of resistance. He was therefore easily overthrown by Afadoddin, and Shauer reinstated in the office of vizir. The faithless minister, however, no sooner saw himself firmly established in his office, than he refused to fulfil his engagements to Nuroddin by paying the stipulated sums. Upon this, Afadoddin seized Pelusium and some other cities. Shauer then entered into an alliance with the crusaders, and Afadoddin was besieged by their combined forces in Pelusium. Nuroddin, however, having invaded the Christian dominions in Syria, and taken a strong fortress called Harem, Shauer and his confederates thought proper to hearken to some terms of accommodation, and Afadoddin was permitted to depart for Syria.\n\nIn the mean time, Nuroddin, having subdued the greatest part of Syria and Mesopotamia, resolved to make Shauer feel the weight of his resentment on account of his perfidious conduct. He therefore sent back Afadoddin into Egypt with a sufficient force, to compel Shauer to fulfil his engagements; but this\nthe vizir took care to do before the arrival of Afadod-\ndin; and thus, for the present, avoided the danger.\nIt was not long, however, before he gave Nuruddin\nfresh occasion to fear this general against him. That\nprince had now driven the crusaders almost entirely\nout of Syria, but was greatly alarmed at their progress\nin Egypt; and consequently offended at the alliance\nwhich Shawer had concluded with them, and which\nhe still persisted in observing. This treaty was also\nthought to be contrived on purpose to prevent Shawer\nfrom being able to fulfill his promise to Nuruddin,\nof sending him annually a third of the revenues of Egypt.\nNuruddin therefore again despatched Afaddoddin into\nEgypt, in the year 1166, with a sufficient force, and\nattended by the famous Salahaddin, or Saladin, his\nown nephew. They entered the kingdom without op-\nposition, and totally defeated Shawer and the cru-\nsaders. They next made themselves masters of Alex-\nandria; and, after that, overran all the Upper Egypt.\nSaladin was left with a considerable garrison in Alexan-\ndria; but Afaddoddin was no sooner gone, than the\ncrusaders laid siege to that city. This at last obliged\nAfaddoddin to return to its relief. The great losses he\nhad sustained in this expedition probably occasioned\nhis agreeing to a treaty with Shawer, by which he\nengaged to retire out of Egypt, upon being paid a\nsum of money.\n\nAfaddoddin was no sooner gone, than Shawer enter-\ned into a fresh treaty with the Franks. By this new\nalliance he was to attack Nuruddin in his own domi-\nnions, as he was at that time engaged in quelling some\nrebels, which would effectually prevent his sending\nany more forces into Egypt. This treaty so provoked\nthe Syrian prince, that he resolved to suspend his other\nconquests for some time, and exert his whole strength\nin the conquest of Egypt.\n\nBy this time the crusaders had reduced Pelusium,\nand made a considerable progress in the kingdom, as\nwell as in some other countries, through the divisions\nwhich reigned among the Mahometan princes. In\nsuch places as they conquered, they put almost every\nbody to the sword, Christians as well as Mahometans;\nfelling their prisoners for slaves, and giving up the\ntowns to be plundered by the soldiers. From Pelu-\nsium they marched to Cairo; which was then in no\nposition of defense, and in the utmost confusion, by\nreason of the divisions which reigned in it. Shawer,\ntherefore, as soon as he heard of their approach, cau-\nsed the ancient quarter called Mefr to be set on fire,\nand the inhabitants to retire into the other parts. He\nalso prevailed upon the caliph to solicit the assistance\nof Nuruddin; which the latter was indeed pretty much\ninclined of himself to grant, as it gave him the fairest\nopportunity he could have wished for, both of driving\nthe crusaders out of Egypt, and of seizing the king-\ndom to himself. For this purpose he had already raised\nan army of 60,000 horse under his general Afaddoddin;\nand, on the receipt of Al Aded's message, gave them\norders to set out immediately. The crusaders were\nnow arrived at Cairo; and had to closely besiege that\nplace, that neither Shawer nor the caliph knew any\nthing of the approach of the Moslem army which was\nhastening to their relief. The vizir, therefore, find-\ning it impossible to hold out long against the enemy,\nhad recourse to his old refuge of treaties and high\npromises. He sent the enemy 100,000 dinars, and\npromised them 900,000 more, if they would raise the\nsiege; which they, dreading the approach of Afaddod-\ndin, very readily accepted.\n\nThe army of Nuruddin now approached the capital\nby hasty marches, and were everywhere received with\nrepulse by the greatest demonstrations of joy. Afaddoddin,\non his arrival at Cairo, was invited by Al Aded to the royal\npalace, where he was entertained in the most magnifi-\ncent manner, and received several presents; nor were\nSaladin and the other principal officers less magnificently\ntreated. Shawer also, confident of his perfidious\nconduct, was no less affiduous in attending punctually\nupon him. But having invited the general and some\nothers to an entertainment, he had formed a scheme of\nhaving them feasted and murdered. The plot, however,\nbeing discovered, Shawer himself had his head cut off,\nand Afaddoddin was made vizir in his stead. He did\nnot, however, long enjoy his new dignity; for he died\ntwo months and five days after his installation, being Saladin be-\nsucceeded in his office of vizir by his nephew Sala comes vizir\nof Egypt.\n\nThe new vizir was the youngest of all the grandees\nwho aspired to that office, but had already given some\nsignal proofs of his valour and conduct. What deter-\nmined the caliph to prefer him to all the rest is not\nknown; but it is certain that some of them were highly\ndispleased with his promotion, and even publicly de-\nclared that they would not obey him. In order to gain\nthese to his interest, therefore, Saladin found it neces-\nsary to distribute among them part of the vast treasures\nleft by his uncle; by which means he soon governed\nEgypt without control, as had been customary with\nthe vizirs for some time before. Soon after his being\ninstalled into the office of vizir, he gave a total defeat\nto the negroes who guarded the royal palace, and had\nopposed his election; by which means, and a strong\ngarrison he had placed in the castle of Cairo, his power\nbecame firmly established. Though he had not the\nleast intention of continuing in his allegiance to Nu-\nroddin, he did not think it prudent at first to declare\nhimself. He sent for his father, however, and the rest\nof his family, who were in Nuruddin's dominions, in\norder, as he said, to make them partakers of his gran-\ndeur and happiness. Nuruddin did not think proper\nto deny this request; though, being already jealous of\nthe great power of Saladin, he insisted that his family\nshould consider him only as one of his generals in E-\ngypt.\n\nA good understanding subsisted between Nuruddin\nand Saladin for some time, which did not a little con-\ntribute to raise the credit of the latter with the Egyp-\ntians. In 1169, Nuruddin sent him orders to omit\nthe name of Al Aded, the caliph of Egypt, in the pu-\nblic prayers, and substitute that of the caliph of Bagdad\nin its place. This was at any rate a dangerous at-\ntempt; as it might very readily produce a revolt in fa-\nvour of Al Aded; or if it did not, it gave Saladin an\nopportunity of engrossing even that small remnant of\npower which was left to the caliph. Al Aded, how-\never, was not sensible of his disgrace; for he was on\nthe deathbed, and past recovery, when Nuruddin's or-\nders were executed. After his death, Saladin seized on\nall his wealth and valuable effects; which consisted of\njewels of prodigious size, sumptuous furniture, a library\ncontaining 100,000 volumes, &c. His family he caused to be closely confined in the most private and retired part of the palace; and either manumitted his slaves, or kept them for himself, or disposed of them to others.\n\nSaladin was now arrived at the highest pitch of wealth, power, and grandeur. He was, however, obliged to behave with great circumspection with regard to Nuruddin: who still continued to treat him as his vassal, and would not suffer him to dispute the least of his commands. He relied for advice chiefly on his father Ayub; who was a consummate politician, and very ambitious of seeing his son raised to the throne of Egypt. He therefore advised Saladin to continue his fall in his resolutions; and, whilst he amused Nuruddin with feigned submissions, to take every method in his power to secure himself in the possession of so valuable a kingdom. Nuruddin himself, however, was too great a master in the art of dissimulation to be easily imposed on by others; and therefore, though he pretended to be well pleased with Saladin's conduct, he was all this time raising a powerful army, with which he was fully determined to invade Egypt the following year. But while he meditated this expedition, he was seized with a quinsy at the castle of Damascus, which put an end to his life, in the year 1173.\n\nSaladin, though now freed from the apprehensions of such a formidable enemy, dared not venture to assume the title of Sovereign, while he saw the successor of Nuruddin at the head of a very powerful army, and no less devious than able to dispossess him. For this reason his first care was to secure to himself an asylum, in case he should be obliged to leave Egypt altogether. For this purpose he chose the kingdom of Nubia; but having despatched his brother Malek Turanlihi thither, at the head of a considerable army, the latter was so much struck with the sterility and desolate appearance of the country, that he returned without attempting anything. Saladin then sent his brother into Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix, in order to subdue that country, which had been for some time held by Abdalnabi an Arabian prince. Malek entered the country without opposition; and having brought Abdalnabi to a general action, entirely defeated him, took him prisoner, and threw him into irons. He then overran and reduced under subjection to Saladin great part of the country, taking no fewer than 80 castles or fortresses of considerable strength.\n\nAfter this good fortune, Saladin, now sure of a convenient place of refuge in case of any misfortune, assumed the title of Sultan or sovereign of Egypt; and was acknowledged as such by the greater part of the states. The zeal of the Egyptians for the Fatemite caliphs, however, soon produced a rebellion. One Al Kanz, or Kanzanaddowla, governor of a city in Upper Egypt, assembled a great army of blacks, or rather swarthy natives; and marching directly into the lower country, was there joined by great numbers of other Egyptians. Against them Saladin despatched his brother Malek, who soon defeated and entirely dispersed them. This, however, did not prevent another insurrection under an impostor, who pretended to be David the son of Al Aided the last Fatemite caliph, and had collected a body of 100,000 men. But before they had time to do any great damage, they were surprised by the sultan's forces, and entirely defeated. Above 300 were publicly hanged, and a vast number perished in the field, infomuch that it was thought scarce a fourth part of the whole body escaped.\n\nAbout this time Saladin gained a considerable advantage over the crusaders, commanded by William II., king of Sicily. That prince had invaded Egypt with a numerous fleet and army, with which he laid close siege to Alexandria both by sea and land. Saladin, however, marched to the relief of the city with such surprising expedition, that the crusaders were seized with a sudden panic, and fled with the utmost precipitation, leaving all their military engines, stores, and baggage behind.\n\nIn the year 1175, the inhabitants of Damascus begged Saladin to accept the sovereignty of that city and its dependencies; being jealous of the minister, reign of Damascus, who had the tuition of the reigning prince, and who governed all with an absolute sway. The application was no sooner made, than the sultan set out with the utmost celerity to Damascus, at the head of a chosen detachment of 700 horse. Having settled his affairs in that city, he appointed his brother Saif Al Islam governor of it; and set out for Hems, to which he immediately laid siege. Having made himself master of this place, he then proceeded to Hamah. The city very soon surrendered, but the citadel held out for some time. Saladin pretended that he accepted the sovereignty of Damascus and the other places he had conquered, only as deputy to Al Malek Al Saleh, the successor of Nuruddin, and who was then under age; and that he was desirous of sending Azzoddin, who commanded in the citadel, with a letter to Aleppo, where the young prince resided. This so pleased Azzoddin, that he took the oath of fidelity to Saladin, and immediately set out with the sultan's letter. He had not, however, been long at Aleppo before he was by the minister's orders thrown into prison; upon which his brother, who had been appointed governor of the citadel Hamah in his absence, delivered it up to Saladin without further ceremony. The sultan then marched to Aleppo, with a design to reduce it; but, being vigorously repulsed in several attacks, he was at last obliged to abandon the enterprise. At the same time, Kamchegyn, Al Malek's minister or vizir, hired the chief of the Batanists, or Assassins*, to murder him. Several attempts were made in consequence of this application; but all of them, happily for Saladin, miscarried.\n\nAfter raising the siege of Aleppo, Saladin returned to Hems, which place the crusaders had invested. On his approach, however, they thought proper to retire; after which, the sultan made himself master of the strong castle belonging to that place, which before he had not been able to reduce. This was soon followed by the reduction of Baalbec; and these rapid conquests so alarmed the ministers of Al Malek, that, entering into a combination with some of the neighbouring princes, they raised a formidable army, with which they despatched to crush the sultan at once. Saladin, fearing the event of a war, offered to cede Hemsemenig, and Hamah to Al Malek, and govern Damascus only as his lieutenant; but these terms being rejected, a battle ensued; in which the allied army was utterly defeated, and the shattered remains of it shut up in the city of Aleppo. This produced a treaty, by which\nSaladin was left master of all Syria, excepting only the city of Aleppo and the territory belonging to it.\n\nIn 1176 Saladin returned from the conquest of Syria, and made his triumphal entry into Cairo. Here, having rested himself and his troops for some time, he began to encompass the city with a wall 29,000 cubits in length, but which he did not live to finish. Next year he led a very numerous army into Palestine against the crusaders. But here his usual good fortune failed him. His army was entirely defeated. Forty thousand of his men were left dead on the field; and the rest fled with so much precipitation, that, having no towns in the neighbourhood where they could shelter themselves, they traversed the vast desert between Palestine and Egypt, and scarce stopped till they reached the capital itself. The greatest part of the army by this means perished; and as no water was to be had in the desert above mentioned, almost all the beasts died of thirst before the fugitives arrived on the confines of Egypt. Saladin himself seemed to have been greatly intimidated; for in a letter to his brother Al Malek, he told him, that \"he was more than once in the most imminent danger; and that God, as he apprehended, had delivered him from thence, in order to reserve him for the execution of some grand and important design.\"\n\nIn the year 1182, the sultan set out on an expedition to Syria with a formidable army, amidst the acclamations and good wishes of the people. He was, however, repulsed with loss both before Aleppo and Al Mawfak, after having spent much time and labour in besieging these two important places.\n\nIn the mean time, a most powerful fleet of European ships appeared on the Red sea, which threatened the cities of Mecca and Medina with the utmost danger. The news of this armament no sooner reached Cairo, than Abu Bekr, Saladin's brother, who had been left viceroy in the sultan's absence, caused another to be fitted out with all speed under the command of Lulu, a brave and experienced officer, who quickly came up with them, and a dreadful engagement ensued. The Christians were defeated after an obstinate resistance, and all the prisoners butchered in cold blood. This proved such a terrible blow to the Europeans, that they never more ventured on a like attempt.\n\nIn 1183, Saladin continued to extend his conquests. The city of Amida in Mesopotamia surrendered to him in eight days; after which, being provoked by some violences committed by the prince of Aleppo, he resolved at all events to make himself master of that place. He was now attended with better success than formerly; for as his army was very numerous, and he pushed on the siege with the utmost vigour, Amoddinin the prince capitulated, upon condition of being allowed to possess certain cities in Mesopotamia which had formerly belonged to him, and being ready to attend the sultan on whatever expedition he pleased. After the conquest of Aleppo, Saladin took three other cities, and then marched against his old enemies the crusaders. Having sent out a party to reconnoitre the enemy, they fell in with a considerable detachment of Christians; whom they easily defeated, taking about 100 prisoners, with the loss of only a single man on their side. The sultan, animated by this first instance of success, drew up his forces in order of battle, and advanced against the crusaders, who had assembled their whole army at Sepphoris in Galilee. On viewing the sultan's troops, however, and perceiving them to be greatly superior in strength to what they had at first apprehended, they thought proper to decline an engagement, nor could Saladin with all his skill force them to it. But though it was found impossible to bring the crusaders to a decisive engagement, Saladin found means to harass them greatly, and destroyed great numbers of their men. He carried off also many prisoners, dismantled three of their strongest cities, laid waste their territories, and concluded the campaign with taking another strong town.\n\nFor three years Saladin continued to gain ground on Christians the crusaders, yet without any decisive advantage; but totally defeated in 1187, the fortune of war was remarkably unfavourable to them. The Christians now found themselves obliged to venture a battle, by reason of the cruel ravages committed in their territories by Saladin, and by reason of the encroachments he daily made on them. Both armies therefore being resolved to exert their utmost efforts, a most fierce and bloody battle ensued. Night prevented victory from declaring on either side, and the fight was renewed with equal obstinacy next day. The victory was still left undecided; but the third day the sultan's men finding themselves surrounded by the enemy on all sides but one, and there also hemmed in by the river Jordan, so that there was no room to fly, fought like men in despair, and at last gained a most complete victory. Vast numbers of the Christians perished on the field. A large body found means to retire in safety to the top of a neighbouring hill covered with wood; but being surrounded by Saladin's troops, who set fire to the wood, they were all obliged to surrender at discretion. Some of them were butchered by their enemies as soon as they delivered themselves into their hands, and others thrown into irons. Among the latter were the king of Jerusalem himself, Arnold prince of Al Shawboc and Al Carac, the masters of the Templars and Hospitallers, with almost the whole body of the latter. So great was the conflagration of the Christians on this occasion, that one of Saladin's men is said to have taken 30 of them prisoners, and tied them together with the cord of his tent, to prevent them from making their escape. The masters of the Templars and Hospitallers, with the knights acting under them, were no sooner brought into Saladin's presence, than he ordered them all to be cut in pieces. He called them Assassins or Batanists; and had been wont to pay 50 dinars for the head of every Templar or Hospitaller that was brought him. After the engagement, Saladin feasted himself in a magnificent tent, placing the king of Jerusalem on his right hand, and Arnold prince of Al Shawboc and Al Carac on his left. Then he drank to the former, who was at that time ready to expire with thirst, and at the same time offered him a cup of snow water. This was thankfully received; and the king immediately drank to the prince of Al Carac, who sat near him. But here Saladin interrupted him with some warmth: \"I will not (says he) suffer this cursed rogue to drink; as that, according to the laudable and generous custom of the Arabs, would secure to him his life.\" Then, turning\nturning towards the prince, he reproached him with having undertaken the expedition while in alliance with himself, with having intercepted an Egyptian caravan in the time of profound peace, and maiming the people of which it was composed, &c. Notwithstanding all this, he told him, he would grant him his life, if he would embrace Mahometanism. This condition, however, was refused; and the sultan, with one stroke of his scimitar, cut off the prince's head. This greatly terrified the king of Jerusalem; but Saladin assured him he had nothing to fear, and that Arnold had brought on himself a violent death by his want of common honesty.\n\nThe crusaders being thus totally defeated and dispersed, Saladin next laid siege to Tiberias, which capitulated in a short time. From thence he marched towards Acca or Ptolemais, which likewise surrendered after a short siege. Here he found 4000 Mahometan prisoners in chains, whom he immediately released. As the inhabitants enjoyed at present a very extensive trade, the place being full of merchants, he found there not only vast sums of money, but likewise a great variety of wares exceedingly valuable, all which he seized and applied to his own use. About the same time his brother Al Malec attacked and took a very strong fortress in the neighborhood; after which the sultan divided his army into three bodies, that he might with the greater facility overrun the territories of the Christians. Thus, in a very short time, he made himself master of Neapolis, Caesarea, Sepphoris, and other cities in the neighborhood of Ptolemais, where his soldiery found only women and children, the men having been all killed or taken prisoners. His next conquest was Joppa, which was taken by storm after a vigorous resistance. Everything being then settled, and a distribution made of the spoils and captives, Saladin marched in person against Tebrieh, a strong fortress in the neighborhood of Sidon; which was taken by assault, after it had sustained a siege of six days. No sooner was he master of this place, than he ordered the fortresses to be razed, and the garrison put to the sword. From Tebrieh the victorious sultan proceeded to Sidon itself; which, being deserted by its prince, surrendered almost on the first summons. Berytus was next invested, and surrendered in seven days. Among the prisoners Saladin found in this place the prince of a territory called Hobeiil, who by way of ransom delivered up his dominions to him, and was of consequence released. About the same time, a Christian ship, in which was a nobleman of great courage and experience in war, arrived at the harbour of Ptolemais, not knowing that it was in the hands of Saladin. The governor might easily have secured the vessel; but neglecting the opportunity, she escaped to Tyre, where the above-mentioned nobleman, together with the prince of Hobeiil, contributed not a little to retrieve the affairs of the Christians, and enable them to make a stand for four years after.\n\nSaladin in the mean time went on with his conquests. Having made himself master of Ascalon after a siege of 14 days, he next invested Jerusalem. The garrison was numerous, and made an obstinate defense; but Saladin having at last made a breach in the walls by sapping, the besieged desired to capitulate. This was at first refused; upon which the Christian ambassador made the following speech: \"If that be the case, know, O sultan, that we who are extremely numerous, and have been retrained from fighting like men in despair only by the hopes of an honourable capitulation, will kill all our wives and children, commit all our wealth and valuable effects to the flames, massacre 5000 prisoners now in our hands, leave not a single beast of burden or animal of any kind belonging to us alive, and level with the ground the rock you esteem sacred, together with the temple Al Akfa. After this we will fall out upon you in a body; and doubt not but we shall either cut to pieces a much greater number of you than we are, or force you to abandon the siege.\" This desperate speech had such an effect upon Saladin, that he immediately called a council of war, at which all the general officers declared, that it would be most proper to allow the Christians to depart unmolested. The sultan therefore allowed them to march out freely and securely with their wives, children, and effects; after which he received ten dinars from every man capable of paying that sum, five from every woman, and two from every young person under age. For the poor who were not able to pay anything, the rest of the inhabitants raised the sum of 30,000 dinars.\n\nMost of the inhabitants of Jerusalem were escorted by a detachment of Saladin's troops to Tyre; and soon after, he advanced with his army against that place. As the port was blocked up by a squadron of five men of war, Saladin imagined that he should easily become master of it. But in this he found himself mistaken. For, one morning by break of day, a Christian fleet fell upon his squadron, and entirely defeated it; nor did a single vessel escape their pursuit. A considerable number of the Mahometans threw themselves into the sea during the engagement; most of whom were drowned, though some few escaped. About the same time Saladin himself was vigorously repulsed by land; so that, after calling a council of war, it was thought proper to raise the siege.\n\nIn 1188, Saladin, though his conquests were not so rapid and considerable as hitherto, continued still superior to his enemies. He reduced the city of Laodicea and some others, together with many strong castles; but met also with several repulses. At last he took the road to Antioch; and having reduced all the fortresses that lay in his way, many of which had been deemed impregnable, Bohemond prince of Antioch was so much intimidated, that he desired a truce for seven or eight months. This Saladin found himself obliged to comply with, on account of the prodigious fatigues his men had endured, and because his auxiliaries now demanded leave to return home.\n\nAll these heavy losses of the Christians, however, proved in some respects an advantage, as they were thus obliged to lay aside their animosities, which had originally proved the ruin of their affairs. Those who had defended Jerusalem, and most of the other fortresses taken by Saladin, having retreated to Tyre, formed there a very numerous body. This proved the means of preserving that city, and also of re-establishing their affairs for the present. For, having received powerful succours from Europe, they were enabled in 1189 to take the field with 30,000 foot and 2000 horse. Their first attempt was upon Alexandretta; from whence they dislodged a strong party of Mahometans, and made\nthemselfes masters of the place with very little loss. They next laid siege to Ptolemais; of which Saladin had no sooner received intelligence, than he marched to the relief of the place. After several skirmishes with various success, a general engagement ensued, in which Saladin was defeated with the loss of 10,000 men. This enabled the Christians to carry on the siege of Ptolemais with greater vigour; which place, however, they were not able to reduce for the space of two years.\n\nThis year the sultan was greatly alarmed by an account that the emperor of Germany was advancing to Constantinople with an army of 260,000 men, in order to assist the other crusaders. This prodigious armament, however, came to nothing. The multitude was so reduced with sickness, famine, and fatigue, that scarce 1000 of them reached the camp before Ptolemais. The siege of that city was continued, though with bad success on the part of the Christians. They were repulsed in all their attacks, their engines were burnt with naphtha, and the besieged always received supplies of provisions in spite of the utmost efforts of the besiegers; at the same time that a dreadful famine and pestilence raged in the Christian camp, which sometimes carried off 200 people a-day.\n\nIn 1191, the Christians received powerful succours from Europe. Philip II. of France, and Richard I. of England (from his great courage furred named Caur de Lion) arrived at the camp before Ptolemais. The latter was esteemed the bravest and most enterprising of all the generals the crusaders had; and the spirits of his soldiers were greatly elated by the thoughts of acting under such an experienced commander. Soon after his arrival, the English sunk a Mahometan ship of vast size, having on board 650 soldiers, a great quantity of arms and provisions, going from Berytus to Ptolemais. Of the soldiers and sailors who navigated this vessel, only a single person escaped; who being taken prisoner by the English, was despatched to the sultan with the news of the disaster. The besieged still defended themselves with the greatest resolution; and the king of England happening to fall sick, the operations of the besiegers were considerably delayed. On his recovery, however, the attacks were renewed with such fury, that the place was every moment in danger of being taken by assault. This induced them to send a letter to Saladin, informing him, that if they did not receive succours the very next day, they would be obliged to submit. As this town was the sultan's principal magazine of arms, he was greatly affected with the account of their distress, especially as he found it impossible to relieve them. The inhabitants, therefore, found themselves under a necessity of surrendering the place. One of the terms of the capitulation was, that the crusaders should receive a very considerable sum of money from Saladin, in consequence of their delivering up the Mahometan prisoners they had in their hands. This article Saladin refused to comply with; and, in consequence of his refusal, Richard caused 3000 of those unfortunate men to be slaughtered at once.\n\nAfter the reduction of Ptolemais, the king of England, now made generalissimo of the crusaders, took the road to Acrelon, in order to besiege that place; after which, he intended to make an attempt upon Jerusalem itself. Saladin proposed to intercept his passage, and placed himself in the way with an army of 300,000 men. On this occasion was fought one of the greatest battles of that age. Saladin was totally defeated, with the loss of 40,000 men; and Acrelon soon fell into the hands of the crusaders. Other sieges were afterwards carried on with success, and Richard even approached within sight of Jerusalem, when he found, that by reason of the weakened state of his army, and the divisions which prevailed among the officers who commanded it, he should be under the necessity of concluding a truce with the sultan. This was accordingly done in the year 1193; the term was, three years, three months, three weeks, three days, and three hours; soon after which the king of England set out on his return to his own dominions.\n\nIn 1193 Saladin died, to the inexpressible grief of all true Mahometans, who held him in the utmost veneration. His dominions in Syria and Palestine were shared out among his children and relations into many petty principalities. His son Othman succeeded to the crown of Egypt; but as none of his successors possessed the enterprising genius of Saladin, the history from that time till the year 1250 affords nothing remarkable. At this time the reigning sultan Malek Al-Mamouls Salek was dethroned and slain by the Mamelucks or Mamelouks, as they are called, a kind of mercenary soldiers' masters who served under him. In consequence of this revolution, the Mamelouks became masters of Egypt, and chose a sultan from among themselves.—The Mamelouks are thought to have been young Turks or Tartars, sold to private persons by the merchants, from whom they were bought by the sultan, educated at his expense, and employed to defend the maritime places of the kingdom. The reason of this institution originally was, that the native Egyptians were become cowardly, treacherous, and effeminate, from a long course of slavery, that they were unfit for arms. The Mamelouks, on the contrary, made most excellent soldiers; for having no friends but amongst their own corps, they turned all their thoughts to their own profession. According to M. Volney, they came originally from Mount Caucasus, and are distinguished by the flaxen colour of their hair. Here they were found by the crusaders, and were by them called Mameluck, or more correctly Mamelouks. The expedition of the Tartars in 1227 proved indirectly the means of introducing them into Egypt. These horrible conquerors, having slaughtered and massacred till they were weary, brought along with them an immense number of slaves of both sexes, with whom they filled all the markets in Asia. The Turks, taking advantage of the opportunity, purchased about 12,000 young men, whom they bred up in the profession of arms, in which they soon attained to great perfection; but becoming mutinous, like the Roman pretorian bands, they turned their arms against their masters, and in 1250 depoed and murdered the caliph, as has been already related.\n\nThe Mamelouks having got possession of the government, and neither understanding nor putting a value upon any thing besides the art of war, every species of learning decayed in Egypt, and a great degree of barbarism was introduced. Neither was their empire of long duration notwithstanding all their martial abilities. The reason of this was, that they were originally only\nnot attempt the total extermination of the race of Mamlouks, though this would have been quite agreeable to the maxims of Turkish policy; but in the present case he seems to have recollected, that if he established a pacha in Egypt with the same powers with which he invested those of other parts, he would be under strong temptations to revolt by reason of the distance from the capital. He therefore proposed a new form of government, by which the power being distributed among the different members of the state, should preserve an equilibrium, so that the dependence of the whole should be Selim upon himself. With this view, he chose from among the Mamlouks who had escaped the general massacre, a divan, or council of regency, consisting of the pacha and chiefs of the seven military corps. The former was to notify to this council the orders of the Porte, to send the tribute to Constantinople, and provide for the safety of government both external and internal; while, on the other hand, the members of the council had a right to reject the orders of the pacha, or even of deposing him, provided they could assign sufficient reasons. All civil and political ordinances must also be ratified by them. Besides this, he formed the whole body into a republic; for which purpose he issued an edict to the following purport: \"Though, by the help of the Almighty, we have conquered the whole kingdom of Egypt with our invincible armies; nevertheless our benevolence is willing to grant to the 24 fangiacs (a) of Egypt a republican government, with the following conditions.\n\n\"I. That our sovereignty shall be acknowledged by the republic; and in token of their obedience, our lieutenant shall be received as our representative: but to do nothing against our will or the republic; but, on the contrary, shall cooperate with it for its welfare on all occasions. Or if he shall attempt to infringe any of its privileges, the republic is at liberty to suspend him from his authority, and to send to our Sublime Porte a complaint against him, &c.\n\n\"II. In time of war, the republic shall provide 12,000 troops at its own expense, to be commanded by a fangiac or fangiacs.\n\n\"III. The republic shall raise annually and send to our Sublime Porte the sum of 560,000 allany (b), accompanied by a fangiac, who shall have a satisfactory receipt, &c.\n\n\"IV. The same sum to be raised for the use of Medina, and Kaba or Mecca.\n\n\"V. No more troops of Janizaries shall be kept by the republic in time of peace than 14,000; but in time of war they may be increased to oppose our and the republic's enemies.\n\n\"VI. The republic shall send annually to our granary, out of the produce of the country, one million of caliz (c) or measures of corn, viz. 600,000 of wheat and 400,000 of barley.\n\n\"VII. The republic, fulfilling these articles, shall have a free government over all the inhabitants of Egypt,\n\n(a) These fangiacs are the governors of provinces.\n(b) Each of these coins is in value about half-a-crown English; and the tribute since that time has been augmented to 800,000 allany, or about 100,000 sterling.\n(c) Each caliz weighs 25 oca, and each oca is equal to two pounds ten ounces English avoirdupois weight.\nEgypt, independent of our lieutenant, but shall execute the laws of the country with the advice of the mollah or high priest under our authority and that of our successors.\n\n\"VIII. The republic shall be in possession of the mint as heretofore; but with this condition, that it shall be under the inspection of our lieutenant, that the coin may not be adulterated.\n\n\"IX. That the republic shall elect a sheik bellet out of the number of beys, to be confirmed by our lieutenant; and that the said sheik bellet shall be our representative, and shall be esteemed by all our lieutenants, and all our officers both of high and low rank, as the head of the republic; and if our lieutenant is guilty of oppression, or exceeds the bounds of his authority, the said sheik bellet shall represent the grievances of the republic to our Sublime Porte: but in case any foreign enemy or enemies disturb the peace of the republic, we and our successors engage to protect it with our utmost power until peace is re-established, without any cost or expense to the republic.\n\n\"Given and signed by our clemency to the republic of Egypt.\"\n\nThus the power of the Mamlouks still continued in a very considerable degree, and by degrees increased so much as to threaten a total loss of dominion to the Turks. During the last 50 years, the Porte having relaxed from its vigilance, such a revolution has taken place, that the Turkish power is now almost reduced to nothing. But in order to understand this, we must consider the way in which the race of Mamlouks is continued or multiplied in Egypt. This is not in the ordinary way, by marriage. On the contrary, M. Volney affirms us, that \"during 350 years in which there have been Mamlouks in Egypt, not one of them has left sufficient issue; all their children perish in the first or second decent. Almost the same thing holds good with regard to the Turks; and it is observed, that they can only secure the continuance of their families by marrying women who are natives, which the Mamlouks have always disdained. The means by which they are perpetuated and multiplied are the same by which they were first established, viz. by slaves brought from their original country. From the time of the Moguls this commerce has been continued on the banks of the Cuban and Phasis in the same manner as it is carried on in Africa, by the wars among the hostile tribes, and the misery or avarice of the inhabitants, who sell their children to strangers. The slaves thus procured are first brought to Constantinople, and afterwards dispersed through the empire, where they are purchased by the wealthy. When the Turks subdued Egypt (says M. Volney), they should undoubtedly have prohibited this dangerous traffic; their omitting which seems about to dispose of them of their conquest, and which several political errors have long been preparing.\n\n\"For a considerable time the Porte had neglected the affairs of this province; and in order to restrain the pachas, had suffered the divan to extend its power till the chiefs of the janizaries and azabs were left without control. The soldiers themselves, become citizens by the marriages they had contracted, were no longer the creatures of Constantinople; and a change introduced into their discipline still more increased these disorders. At first the seven military corps had one common treasury; and though the society was rich, individuals, not having anything at their own disposal, could effect nothing. The chiefs, finding their power diminished by this regulation, had interest enough to get it abolished, and obtained permission to possess distant property, lands, and villages. And as these lands and villages depended on the Mamlouk governors, it was necessary to conciliate them, to prevent their oppressions. From that moment the beys acquired an ascendancy over the soldiers, who till then had treated them with disdain; and this could not but continually increase, since their governments procured them considerable riches. These they employed in creating themselves friends and creatures. They multiplied their slaves; and after emancipating them, employed all their interest to promote them to various employments, and advance them in the army. These upstarts, retaining for their patrons the same superstitious veneration common in the East, formed factions implicitly devoted to their pleasure.\" Thus, about the year 1746, Ibrahim, one of Authority the kiayas (D) of the janizaries, rendered himself inburghed by reality master of Egypt; having managed matters so Kiaya well, that of the 24 beys or tangiacs eight were of his houchehold. His influence too was augmented by always leaving vacancies in order to enjoy the emoluments himself; while the officers and soldiers of his corps were attached to his interest; and his power was completed by gaining over Rodoan, the most powerful of all the colonels, to his interest. Thus the pacha became altogether unable to oppose him, and the orders of the fultan were less respected than those of Ibrahim. On his death in 1757, his family, i.e. his enfranchised slaves, continued to rule in a despotic manner. Waging war, however, among each other, Rodoan, and several other chiefs were killed; until, in 1766, Ali Bey, who had been a principal actor in the disturbances, overcame his enemies, and for some time rendered himself absolute master of Egypt.\n\nOf this man there are various accounts. The following is that given by M. Volney. He begins with Ali Bey observing, that the private history of the Mamlouks in general must be subject to great uncertainty, by reason of their being generally carried off from their parents at a time of life when they can remember but little or nothing of their parents; and he remarks, that they are likewise unwilling to communicate the little they may happen to remember. It is most commonly supposed, however, that Ali Bey was born among the Abazans, a people of Mount Caucasus; from whom, next to the Circassians, the slaves most valued by the Turks, and other nations who deal in that commodity, are to be obtained. Having been brought to a public sale at Cairo, he is Ali Bey was bought by two Jew brothers named Isaac and Yousef, who made a present of him to Ibrahim educated by Ibrahim Kiaya.\n\n(D) These were the commanding officers of the janizaries, azabs, &c. who after the first year laid down their employments, and became veterans, with a voice in the divan.\nKiaya. At this time he is supposed to have been about 13 or 14 years old, and was employed by his patron in offices similar to those of the pages belonging to European princes. The usual education was also given him; viz., that of learning to manage a horse well; fire a carbine and pistol; throw the djerid, a kind of dart used in the diversions of that country, and which shall be afterwards described. He was also taught the exercise of the sabre, and a little reading and writing. In all the feats of activity just mentioned, he discovered such impetuosity, that he obtained the surname of Djendalik, or \"madman;\" and as he grew up, discovered an ambition proportionate to the activity displayed in his youth. About the age of 18 or 20, his patron gave him his freedom; the badge of which among the Turks is the letting the beard grow, for among that people it is thought proper only for women and slaves to want a beard. By his kind patron also he was promoted to the rank of kachef or governor of a district, and at last elected one of the 24 beys. By the death of Ibrahim in 1757, he had an opportunity of satisfying his ambition; and now engaged in every scheme for the promotion or disgrace of the chiefs, and had a principal share in the ruin of Rodoan Kiaya above mentioned. Rodoan's place was quickly filled by another, who did not long enjoy it; and in 1762 Ali Bey, then styled Sheik-el-Beled, having got Abdelrahman, the possessor at that time, exiled, procured himself to be elected in his room.\n\nHowever, he soon shared the fate of the rest, being condemned to retire to Gaza. This place, being under the dominion of a Turkish pasha, was by no means agreeable; for which reason Ali having turned off to another place, kept himself concealed for some time, until in 1766 his friends at Cairo procured his recall. On this he appeared suddenly in that city; and in one night killed four of the beys who were inimical to his designs, banished the rest, and assumed the whole power to himself. Still, however, his ambition was not satisfied; and he determined on nothing less than to throw off his dependence on the Porte altogether, and become sultan of Egypt. With this view he expelled the pasha, refused to pay the accustomed tribute, and in the year 1768 proceeded to coin money in his own name. The Porte being at that time on the eve of a dangerous war with Russia, had not leisure to attend to the proceedings of Ali Bey; so that the latter had an opportunity of going forward with his enterprises very vigorously. His first expedition was against an Arabian prince named Hammam; against whom he sent his favourite Mohammed Bey, under pretence that the former had concealed a treasure intrusted with him by Ibrahim Kiaya, and that he afforded protection to rebels. Having destroyed this unfortunate prince, he next began to put in execution a plan proposed to him by a young Venetian merchant, of rendering Jedda, the port of Mecca, an emporium for all the commerce of India; and even imagined he should be able to make the Europeans abandon the passage to the Indies by the Cape of Good Hope. With this view, he fitted out some vessels at Suez; and manning them with Mamlouks, commanded the bey Haffan to sail with them to Jedda, and seize upon it, while a body of cavalry under Mohammed Bey advanced against the town. Both these commissions were executed according to his will, and Ali became quite intoxicated with his success. Nothing but ideas of conquest now occupied his mind, without considering the immense disproportion between his own force and that of the grand signior. Circumstances, it must be owned, were at that time very favourable to his schemes. The sheik Daher was in rebellion against the Porte in Syria; and the pasha of Damascus had so exasperated the people by his extortions, that they were ready for a revolt.\n\nHaving therefore made the necessary preparations, Ali Bey despatched in 1770 about 500 Mamlouks to take possession of Gaza, and thus secure an entrance into Syria. Palestine. Ofman, the pasha of Damascus, however, no sooner heard of the invasion than he prepared for war with the utmost diligence, while the troops of Ali Bey held themselves in readiness to fly on the first attack. They were relieved from their embarrassment by Sheik Daher, who hastened to their assistance, while Ofman fled without even offering to make the least resistance; thus leaving the enemy masters of all Palestine without striking a stroke. About the end of February 1771, the grand army of Ali Bey arrived; which, by the representation made of it in Europe, was supposed to consist of 60,000 men. M. Volney, however, informs us, that this army was far from containing 60,000 full account of diers; though he allows that there might be two-thirds his army of that number, who were classified as follows: 1. Five thousand Mamlouks, constituting the whole effective part of the army. 2. Fifteen hundred Arabs from Barbary on foot, constituting the whole infantry of the army. Besides these, the servants of the Mamlouks, each of whom had two, would constitute a body of 10,000 men. A number of other servants would constitute a body of 2000: and the rest of the number would be made up by sutlers and other uluhal attendants on armies. It was commanded by Mohammed Bey the friend of Ali. \"But (says our author) as to order and discipline, these must not be mentioned. The armies of the Turks and Mamlouks are nothing but a confused multitude of horsemen, without uniforms, on horses of all colours and sizes, without either keeping their ranks or observing any regular order.\" This rabble took the road to Acre, leaving wherever they passed sufficient marks of their rapacity and want of discipline. At Acre a junction was formed with the troops of Sheik Daher, consisting of 1500 Safadans (the name of Sheik Daher's subjects, from Safad, a village of Galilee, originally under his jurisdiction). There were on horseback, and accompanied by 1200 Motualis cavalry under the command of Sheik Naif, and about 1000 Mogrebian infantry. Thus they proceeded towards Damascus, while Ofman prepared to oppose them by another army equally numerous and ill regulated: and M. Volney gives the following description of their operations: \"The reader must not here figure to himself a number of complicated and artificial movements: such furred methods as those which, within the last century, have reduced the science of war with us to a science of system and calculation. The Asiatics are unacquainted with the first elements of this conduct. Their armies are mere mobs, their marches ravages, their campaigns inroads, and their battles bloody frays. The strongest or the most adventurous party goes in quest of the other, which frequently flies without making any resistance. If they stand their ground, they engage pell-mell, discharge their carbines, break their spears, and hack each other with their sabres; for\nfor they have seldom any cannon, and when they have, they are but of little service. A panic frequently diffuses itself without cause; one party flies, the other shouts victory; the vanquished submit to the will of the conqueror, and the campaign often terminates without a battle.\n\nSuch, in a great measure, were the military operations in Syria in the year 1771. The combined army of Ali Bey and Sheik Daher marched to Damascus. The pachas waited for them; they approached, and, on the 6th of June, a decisive action took place: the Mamlouks and Safadins rushed on the Turks with such fury that, terrified at their courage, they immediately took to flight, and the pachas were not the last in endeavouring to make their escape. The allies became masters of the country, and took possession of the city without opposition, there being neither walls nor fortifications to defend it. The cattle alone resisted. Its ruined fortifications had not a single cannon, much less gunners; but it was surrounded by a muddy ditch, and behind the ruins were posted a few musketeers; and these alone were sufficient to check this army of cavalry. As the besieged, however, were already conquered by their fears, they capitulated the third day, and the place was to be surrendered next morning, when, at day-break, a most extraordinary revolution took place.\n\nThis was no less than the defection of Mohammed of Ali Bey's Bey himself, whom Osman had gained over in a conference during the night. At the moment, therefore, that the signal of surrender was expected, this treacherous general founded a retreat, and turned towards Egypt with all his cavalry, flying with as great precipitation as if he had been pursued by a superior army. Mohammed continued his march with such celerity, that the report of his arrival in Egypt reached Cairo only six hours before him. Thus Ali Bey found himself at once deprived of all his expectations of conquest; and what was worse, found a traitor whom he durst not punish at the head of his forces. A sudden reverse of fortune now took place. Several vessels laden with corn for Sheik Daher were taken by a Russian privateer; and Mohammed Bey, whom he designed to have put to death, not only made his escape, but was so well attended that he could not be attacked. His followers continuing daily to increase in number, Mohammed soon became sufficiently strong to march towards Cairo; and, in the month of April 1772, having defeated the troops of Ali in a rencounter, entered the city sword in hand, while the latter had scarce time to make his escape with 800 Mamlouks. With difficulty he was enabled to get to Syria by the assistance of Sheik Daher, whom he immediately joined with the troops he had with him. The Turks under Osman were at that time besieging Sidon, but raised the siege on the approach of the allied army, consisting of about 7000 cavalry. Though the Turkish army was at least three times their number, the allies did not hesitate to attack them, and gained a complete victory. Their affairs now began to wear a more favourable aspect; but the military operations were retarded by the siege of Yafa, a place which had revolted; and which, though defended only by a garden wall, without any ditch, held out for eight months. In the beginning of 1773 it capitulated, and Ali Bey began to think of returning to Cairo. For this purpose Sheik Daher had promised to furnish him with succours; and the Russians, with whom he had now contracted an alliance, made him a promise of the like kind. Ali, however, ruined everything by his own impatience. Deceived by an astrologer, who pretended that the auspicious moment when he would be highly favoured by the stars was just arrived, he himself impeded matters without waiting for the arrival of his allies. He was also farther deceived by a stratagem of Mohammed, who had by force extorted from the friends of Ali Bey letters pressing his return to Cairo, where the people were weary of his ungrateful slave, and wanted only his presence in order to expel him. Confiding in these promises, Ali Bey imprudently set out with his Mamlouks and 1500 Safadins given him by Daher; but had no sooner entered the desert which separates Gaza from Egypt, than he was attacked by a body of 1000 chosen Mamlouks who were lying in wait for his arrival. They were commanded by a young bey, named Mourad; who being enamoured of the wife of Ali Bey, had obtained a promise of her from Mohammed, in case he could bring him her husband's head. As soon as Mourad perceived the dust by which the approach of Ali Bey's armed was announced, he rushed upon him, attacked and took prisoner Ali Bey himself, after wounding him in the forehead with a sabre. Being conducted to Mohammed Bey, the latter pretended to treat him with extraordinary respect, and ordered a magnificent tent to be erected for him; but in three days he was found dead of his wounds, as was given out; though some affirm, perhaps with equal reason, that he was poisoned.\n\nAfter the death of Ali Bey, Mohammed Bey took succeeded upon him the supreme dignity; but this change of masters proved of very little service to the Egyptians. At first he pretended to be only the defender of the rights of the sultan, remitted the usual tribute to Constantinople, and took the customary oath of unlimited obedience; after which he solicited permission to make war upon Sheik Daher, the ally of Ali Bey. The reason of this request was a mere personal pique; and as soon as it was granted, he made the most diligent preparations for war. Having procured an extraordinary train of artillery, he provided foreign gunners, and gave the command of them to an Englishman named Robinson. He brought from Suez a cannon 16 feet long, which had for a considerable time remained useless against the enemy; and at length, in the month of February 1776, he appeared in Syria with an army equal in number to that which he had formerly commanded when in the service of Ali Bey. Daher's forces, despairing of being able to cope with such a formidable armament, abandoned Gaza, which Mohammed immediately took possession of, and then marched towards a fortified town named Yafa. The history of this siege gives a specimen of the Asiatic manner of conducting operations of that kind. \"Yafa (says he), situated on a part of the coast, the siege of the general level of which is very little above the sea. Yafa: a city built on an eminence, in the form of a flat specimen of a garlaf, in height about 130 feet perpendicular. The method of houses, distributed on the declivity, appear rising above each other, like the steps of an amphitheatre. On the town's summit is a small citadel, which commands the town; the bottom of the hill is surrounded by a wall without a rampart, of 12 or 14 feet high, and two or three in thickness.\"\nthicknes. The battlements on the top are the only tokens by which it is distinguished from a common garden wall. This wall, which has no ditch, is environed by gardens, where lemons, oranges, and citrons, grow in this light soil to a most prodigious size. The city was defended by five or six hundred Safadians and as many inhabitants, who, at the fight of the enemy, armed themselves with their sabres and muskets; they had likewise a few brass cannon, 24 pounds, without carriages; these they mounted as well as they could, on timbers prepared in a hurry; and supplying the place of experience by hatred and courage, they replied to the summons of the enemy with menaces and cannon shot.\n\n\"Mohammed, finding he must have recourse to force, formed his camp before the town; but so little acquainted with the business in which he was engaged, that he advanced within half cannon shot. The bullets, which flew upon the tents, apprizing him of his error, he retreated; and, by making a fresh experiment, was convinced he was still too near. At length he discovered the proper distance, and set up his tent, in which the most extravagant luxury was displayed: around it, without any order, were pitched those of the Mamlouks, while the Barbary Arabs formed huts with the trunks and branches of the orange and lemon trees, and the followers of the army arranged themselves as they could: a few guards were distributed here and there; and, without making a single entrenchment, they called themselves encamped.\n\n\"Batteries were now to be erected; and a spot of rising ground was made choice of to the south-eastward of the town, where, behind some garden walls, eight pieces of cannon were pointed, at 200 paces from the town; and the firing began, notwithstanding the musquetry of the enemy, who, from the tops of the terraces, killed several of the gunners.\n\n\"It is evident that a wall only three feet thick, and without a rampart, must soon have a large breach in it; and the question was not how to mount, but how to get through it? The Mamlouks were for doing it on horseback; but they were made to comprehend that this was impossible; and they consented, for the first time, to march on foot. It must have been a curious sight to see them, with their huge breeches of thick Venetian cloth, embarrassed with their tucked-up benichers, their crooked sabres in hand, and pistols hanging at their sides, advancing and tumbling among the ruins of the wall. They imagined that they had conquered every difficulty when this obstacle was surmounted; but the besieged, who formed a better judgment, waited till they arrived at the empty space between the city and wall; where they affailed them from the terraces and windows of the houses with such a shower of bullets, that the Mamlouks did not so much as think of setting them on fire, but retired under a persuasion that the breach was utterly impracticable, since it was impossible to enter it on horseback. Morad Bey brought them several times back to the charge, but in vain.\n\n\"Six weeks passed in this manner; and Mohammed was distracted with rage, anxiety, and despair. The besieged however, whose numbers were diminished by the repeated attacks, became weary of defending alone the cause of Daher. Some persons began to treat with the enemy; and it was proposed to abandon the place, on the Egyptians giving hostages. Conditions were agreed upon, and the treaty might be considered as concluded, when, in the midst of the security occasioned by this belief, some Mamlouks entered the town; numbers of others followed their example, and attempted to plunder. The inhabitants defended themselves, and the attack recommenced; the whole army then rushed into the town, which suffered all the horrors of war; men, women and children, young and old, were all cut to pieces, and Mohammed, equally mean and barbarous, caused a pyramid formed of the heads of these unfortunate sufferers to be raised as a monument of his victory.\"\n\nBy this disaster the greatest terror and consternation were everywhere diffused. Sheik Daher himself fled, and Mohammed soon became master of Acre also. Here he behaved with his usual cruelty, and abandoned the city to be plundered by his soldiers. The French merchants claimed an exemption, and it was procured with the utmost difficulty: nor was even this likely to be of any consequence; for Mohammed, informed that the treasures of Ibrahim kiaya of Daher had been deposited in that place, made an immediate demand of them, threatening every one of the merchants with death if the treasures were not instantly produced. A day was appointed for making the search; but before this came, the tyrant himself died of a malignant fever after two days' illness. His death was no sooner known than the army made a precipitate retreat, such as has been already mentioned from Damascus. Sheik Daher continued his rebellion for some time, but was at last entirely defeated, and his head sent to Constantinople by Haflan Pacha the Turkish high-admiral.\n\nThe death of Mohammed was no sooner known in Egypt, than Morad Bey hastened to Cairo in order to dispute the sovereignty with Ibrahim Bey, who had that time been intrusted with the government on his departure to the year from that place for Syria. Preparations for war were made on both sides; but at last, both parties finding that the contest must be attended with great difficulty, as well as very uncertain in the event, thought proper to come to an accommodation, by which it was agreed that Ibrahim should retain the title of Sheik El Beled, and the power was to be divided between them. But now the beys and others who had been promoted by Ali Bey, perceiving their own importance totally annihilated by this new faction, resolved to shake off the yoke, and therefore united in a league under the title of the House of Ali Bey. They conducted their matters with so much silence and dexterity, that both Morad and Ibrahim were obliged to abandon Cairo. In a short time, however, they returned and defeated their enemies though three times their number; but notwithstanding this success, it was not in their power totally to suppress the party. This indeed was owing entirely to their unskilfulness in the art of war, and their operations for some time were very trifling. At last, a new combination having been formed among the beys, five of them were sentenced to banishment in the Delta. They pretended to comply with this order, but took the road of the Desert of the Pyramids, through which they were pursued for three days to no purpose. At last they arrived safe at Minia, a village situated on the Nile, 40 leagues above Cairo.\nHere they took up their residence, and being masters of the river, soon reduced Cairo to distress by intercepting its provisions. Thus a new expedition became necessary, and Ibrahim took the command of it upon himself. In the month of October 1783 he set out with an army of 3000 cavalry; the two armies soon came in sight of each other, but Ibrahim thought proper to terminate the affair by negotiation. This gave such offence to Morad, who suspected some plot against himself, that he left Cairo. A war between the two rivals was now daily expected, and the armies continued for 25 days in sight of each other, only separated by the river. Negotiations took place; and the five exiled beys, finding themselves abandoned by Morad, took to flight, but were pursued and brought back to Cairo. Peace seemed now to be re-established; but the jealousy of the two rivals producing new intrigues, Morad was once more obliged to quit Cairo in 1784. Forming his camp, however, directly at the gates of the city, he appeared so terrible to Ibrahim, that the latter thought proper in his turn to retire to the desert, where he remained till March 1785. A new treaty then took place; by which the rivals agreed to share the power between them, though there was certainly very little probability that such a treaty would be long observed. Since that time we have no accounts of any remarkable transaction in Egypt; nor indeed can we reasonably expect anything of consequence in a country where matters are managed, as M. Volney expresses himself, by a series of \"cabals, intrigues, treachery, and murders.\"\n\nOf late Egypt has been visited by several travellers, all of whom have published descriptions of the country, its productions, inhabitants, &c. The latest are M. Savary, M. Volney, the baron de Tott, and Mr Bruce; and from the accounts published by those gentlemen the following geographical description is principally compiled.\n\nThis country is still divided into two principal parts, called the Upper and Lower Egypt. According to M. Savary, the former is only a long narrow valley beginning at Syene and terminating at Cairo. It is bounded by two chains of mountains running from north to south, and taking their rise from the last cataract of the Nile. On reaching the latitude of Cairo they separate to the right and left; the one taking the direction of Mount Colzoum, the other terminating in some sand banks near Alexandria; the former being composed of high and steep rocks, the latter of sandy hillocks over a bed of calcareous stone. Beyond these mountains are deserts bounded by the Red Sea on the east, and on the west by other parts of Africa; having in the middle that long plain which, even where widest, is not more than nine leagues over. Here the Nile is confined in its course between these impenetrable barriers, and during the time of its inundation overflows the country all the way to the foot of the mountains; and Mr Bruce observes that there is a gradual slope from the bed of the river to those mountains on both sides. The baron de Tott says, that the mountains four leagues from the Nile, and facing Cairo, \"are only a ridge of rocks of about 40 or 50 feet high, which divide Egypt from the plains of Libya; which ridge accompanies the course of the river, at a greater or lesser distance, and seems as if only intended to serve as a bank to the general inundation.\"\n\nLower Egypt, according to M. Savary, comprehends all the country between Cairo, the Mediterranean, the isthmus of Suez and Libya. \"This immense plain (says he) presents on the borders of its parching sands a strip of lands cultivated along the canals of the river, and in the middle a triangular island to which the Greeks gave the name of Delta; at the top of the angle of which the baron de Tott informs us the rocks of Libya and the coasts of Arabia open and recede from each other towards the east and west, parallel to the Mediterranean. This great extent of country, from the kingdom of Barca to Gaza, is either overflowed by the river, or capable of being so; which thus fertilizes in a high degree a tract of country seemingly devoted to perpetual barrenness on account of the want of rain and the heat of the climate.\n\nAccording to the testimonies of both Mr Bruce and M. Volney, the coast of Egypt is extremely low, that gyptian it cannot be discovered at sea till the mariners come within a few leagues of it. In ancient times the sailors pretended to know when they approached this country, by a kind of black mud brought up by their founding line from the bottom of the sea; but this notion, though as old as the days of Herodotus, has been discovered to be a mistake by Mr Bruce, who found the mud in question to arise while the vessel was opposite to the deserts of Barca. All along the coast of Egypt a strong current sets to the eastward.\n\nIn former times Egypt was much celebrated for its fertility; and there is great reason to believe, that were the same pains bestowed upon the cultivation of the land as in former times, the distribution of the waters of the Nile in a proper manner, the same fertility would still be found to remain. The cause of decrease in the produce of Egypt we shall describe in the words of M. Savary. \"The canals,\" says he, speaking of the Delta, \"which used to convey fertility with their waters, are now filled. The earth no longer watered, and continually exposed to the burning ardour of the sun, is converted into a barren land. In those places where formerly were seen rich fields and flourishing towns, on the Pelusiac, the Tanitic, and the Mendelian branches, which all strike out from the canal of Damietta, nothing is to be found at this day but a few miserable hamlets, surrounded by date trees and by deserts. These once navigable canals are now no more than a vain resemblance of what they were: they have no communication with the lake Menzall, but what is merely temporary, on the swelling of the Nile; they are dry the remainder of the year. By deepening them by removing the mud deposited by the river since the Turks have made themselves masters of Egypt, the country they pass through would be again fertilized, and the Delta recover a third of its greatness.\"\n\nConcerning this island it has been the opinion of a savant's great many, even from very ancient times, that it was produced by the mud brought down by the inundations of the Nile; and this opinion we find adopted in the strongest manner by M. Savary. His account of the supposed rise of the Delta, and indeed of the greatest part of Egypt, is to the following purpose.\nIn those early ages where history has not fixed any epoch, a certain people descended from the mountains near the cataracts into the valley overflowed by the Nile, and which was then an uninhabitable morass overgrown with reeds and canes. In what manner, or from what motive, these people were induced to descend from their ancient habitations to such a place, or how they found means to penetrate into a morass which he expressly tells us was impenetrable, we are not informed, neither is it to our present purpose to inquire. At that time, however, the sea bathed the feet of those mountains where the pyramids are built, and advanced far into Libya. It covered also part of the isthmus of Suez, and every part of what we now call the Delta formed a great gulf. After many ages the Egyptians, by what means is unknown, at least not specified by our author (though they ought to have been so), as the country it seems was then overflowed not only by the river but by the ocean), formed canals to carry off the stagnant waters of the Nile; opposed strong dykes to its ravages; and, tired of dwelling in the caverns of rocks, built towns and cities upon spots elevated either by nature or art. Already the river was kept within its bounds, the habitations of men were out of the reach of its inundations, and experience had taught the people to foresee and announce them. One of the kings of Egypt undertook to change the course of the river. After running 250 leagues between the barriers already mentioned, meeting with an insurmountable obstacle to the right, it turned suddenly to the left; and taking its course to the southward of Memphis, it spreads its waters through the sands of Libya. The prince we speak of caused a new bed to be dug for it to the east of Memphis; and by means of a large dyke obliged it to return between the mountains, and discharge itself into the gulf that bathes the rock on which the castle of Cairo is built. The ancient bed of the river was still to be seen in the time of Herodotus, and may even be traced at this day across the deserts, passing to the westward of the lakes of natrum. The Arabs still below it name the Babr Belama, \"or sea without water,\" and it is now almost choked up. To the labours of this monarch Egypt is indebted for the Delta. A reflux of the sea was occasioned by the enormous weight of the waters of the Nile, which precipitated themselves into the bottom of the gulf. Thus the sands and mud carried along with them were collected into heaps; and thus the Delta, at first very inconsiderable, rose out of the sea, of which it repelled the limits. It was a gift of the river, and it has since been defended from the attacks of the ocean by raising dykes around it. Five hundred years before the Trojan war, according to Herodotus, the Delta was in its infancy; eight cubits of water being then sufficient to overflow it. Strabo tells us, that boats passed over it from one extremity to the other; and that its towns, built upon artificial eminences, resembled the islands of the Egean sea. At the time that Herodotus visited this country, 15 cubits were necessary to cover all the Lower Egypt; but the Nile then overflowed the country for the space of two days journey to the right and left of the island. Under the Roman empire 16 cubits performed the same effect. When the Arabs came to have the dominion, 17 cubits were requisite; and at this day 18 are necessary to produce a plentiful crop; but the inundation stops at Cairo and the neighbouring country, without being extended over the Lower Egypt. Sometimes, however, the Nile rises to 22 cubits; and the cause of this phenomenon is the mud for so many years accumulated on the island. Here, in the space of 3284 years, we see the Delta elevated 14 cubits. Our author wrote in 1777, and informs us that he twice made the tour of the island during the time of the inundation. \"The river (says he) flowed in full streams in the great branches of Roletta and Damietta, as well as in those which pass through the interior part of the country; but it did not overflow the lands, except in the lower parts, where the dykes were pierced for the purpose of watering the plantations of rice. We must not, however, imagine, as several travellers pretend, that this island will continue to rise, and that it will become unfruitful. As it owes its increase to the annual settling of the mud conveyed thither by the Nile, when it ceases to be overflowed it will no longer increase in height, for it is demonstrated that culture is not sufficient to raise land.\n\n\"It is natural to imagine that the Delta has increased in length as well as in height; and of this we may look upon the following fact to be a remarkable proof. Under the reign of Ptolemy, the Milesians, with 30 vessels, landed at the mouth of the Bolbitine branch of the Nile, now called that of Roletta, where they fortified themselves. There they built a town called Metelis, the same as Faouie, which, in the Coptic vocabularies, has preserved the name of Melis. This town, formerly a seaport, is now nine leagues distant from the sea; all which space the Delta has increased in length from the time of Ptolemy to the present. Homer, in his Odyssey, puts the following words in the mouth of Menelaus. 'In the stormy sea which washes Egypt there is an island called Pharos. Its distance from the shore is such, that a vessel with a fair wind may make the passage in a day.' From the way in which he speaks of this island in other places, also, we may suppose that the island of Pharos, in his time, was not less than 20 leagues distant from the Egyptian coast, though now it forms the port of Alexandria; and this sentiment is confirmed by the most ancient writers.\n\n\"What prodigious changes great rivers occasion on the surface of the globe! How they elevate, at their mouths, islands which become at length large portions of the continent! It is thus that the Nile has formed almost all the Lower Egypt, and created out of the waters the Delta, which is 90 leagues in circumference. It is thus that the Meander, constantly repelling the waves of the Mediterranean, and gradually filling up the gulf into which it falls, has placed in the middle of the land the town of Miletus, formerly a celebrated harbour. It is thus that the Tigris and the Euphrates, let loose from the Armenian hills, and sweeping with them in their course the sands of Mesopotamia, are imperceptibly filling up the Persian gulf.\"\n\nThese are the reasons assigned by Mr. Savary for Mr. Bruce's thinking that the Delta, as well as the greatest part of reasons for the Lower Egypt, had been produced by the Nile; but this opinion is violently contested by other authors, particularly Mr. Bruce, who has given a pretty long dissertation upon it, as well as many occasional\nfional remarks through the course of his work. He begins with observing, 1. That the country of Egypt is entirely a valley bounded by rugged mountains; whence it might seem natural to imagine that the Nile, overflowing a country of this kind, would be more ready to wash away the soil than add to it. 2. It is observed by Dr Shaw, and the same is confirmed by our author, that there is a gentle slope from the middle of the valley to the foot of the mountains on each side; so that the middle, in which is the channel of the Nile, is really higher than any other part of the valley. Large trenches are cut across the country from the channel of the river, and at right angles with it, to the foot of the mountains. 3. As the river swells, the canals become filled with water, which naturally descending to the foot of the mountains, runs out at the farther end, and overflows the adjacent level country. 4. When the water, having attained the lowest ground, begins to stagnate, it does not acquire any motion by reason of the canal's being at right angles with the channel of the Nile, unless in the case of excessive rains in Ethiopia, when the water by its regurgitation again joins the stream. In this case, the motion of the current is communicated to the whole mass of waters, and every thing is swept away by them into the sea. 5. It has been the opinion of several authors, that there was a necessity for measuring the height of the inundation on account of the quantity of mud brought down annually by the waters, by which the landmarks were so covered, that the proprietors could not know their own grounds after the river subsided. But whatever might be the reason of this covering of the landmarks in ancient times, it is certain that the mud left by the Nile could not be so in the time of Herodotus, or during any period of time assigned by that historian; for he assigns only one foot of increase of soil throughout Egypt in an hundred years from the mud left by the river; the increase during one year, therefore, being only the hundredth part of a foot, could not cover any landmark whatever. Besides, the Egyptian lands are at this day parted by huge blocks of granite, which frequently have gigantic heads at the end of them; and these could not, at the rate mentioned by Herodotus, be covered in several thousand years. 6. The Nile does not now bring down any great quantity of mud; and it is absurd to suppose that it can at present bring down as much as it did soon after the creation, or the ages immediately succeeding the deluge. Throughout Abyssinia, according to the testimony of our author, the channel of every torrent is now worn to the bare rock, and almost every rivulet runs in a hard stony bed, all the loose earth being long ago washed away; so that an annual and equable increase of the earth from the sediment of the waters is impossible. 7. Our author made a great number of trials of the water of the Nile during the time of its inundation in different places. At Bafboch, when just coming down from the cultivated parts of Abyssinia, and before it enters Scenar, the sediment is composed of fat earth and sand, and its quantity is exceedingly small. At the junction of the Nile and Attaboras the quantity of sediment is very little augmented; consisting still of the same materials, but now mostly sand. At Syene the quantity of sediment was almost nine times greater than before; but was now composed almost entirely of sand, with a very small quantity of black earth. The conclusion of our author's experiments, however, is different from what we should have been led to expect from those just mentioned. \"The experiment at Rosetta (says he) was not so often repeated as the others; but the result was, that in the strength of the inundation the sediment consisted mostly of sand; and towards the end, was much the greater part earth. I think these experiments conclusive, as neither the Nile coming fresh from Abyssinia, nor the Attabara, though joined by the Mareb, likewise from the same country, brought any great quantity of soil from thence.\"\n\n8. Our author goes on to observe, that had the Nile brought down the quantities of mud which it has been said to do, it ought to have been most charged with it at Syene; as there it contained the whole that was to be conveyed by it into Egypt. Instead of this, however, the principal part of the sediment at this place was sand; and this is very naturally accounted for from the vast quantities of sand taken up by the winds in the deserts between Gooz and Syene. Here our traveller frequently saw vast pillars of this kind of sand, which is so fine and light as to form an impalpable powder, traversing the desert in various directions. Many of these were driven upon the river; and when it became calm in the evening, fell down into it entirely; thus affording materials for the many sandy islands to be met with in the Nile.\n\n9. Mr Bruce adopts the opinion of those who suppose that there has been a continual decrease of water since the creation of the world. In this case, therefore, if the land of Egypt had been continually increasing in height while the water that was to cover it decreased; then must have been frequent famines on account of the want of a sufficient inundation. But so far is this from being the case, that, according to the testimony of several Arabian MSS., there had not, when Mr Bruce was in Egypt, been one scarce season from the lowness of the inundation for 34 years; though during the same space they had three times experienced a famine by too great an abundance of water, which carried away the millet.\n\n10. If there had been such an increase of land as Herodotus and others suppose, it must now have been very perceptible in some of the most ancient public monuments. This, however, is by no means the case. The base of every obelisk in Upper Egypt is to this day quite bare and visible. Near Thebes there are still extant two colossal statues, plainly designed for kilometers, and which ought by this time to have been almost covered with earth; but notwithstanding the length of time these have remained there, they are still bare to the very base.\n\nThe strongest argument which the advocates for the opinions of increase of land of Egypt can make use of is, that various authors have determined the measures by which the quantity of inundation is determined are smaller now than in former times; and these small measures are said to have been introduced by the Saracens. On this Mr Bruce very justly observes, that such an expedient could not have answered any good purpose; as no decrease of the measure could have augmented the quantity of corn produced by the ground. M. Savary observes, that, to render his calculation concerning the growth of land in Egypt absolutely exact, it would be necessary to determine the\nthe precise length of the Greek, Roman, and Arabian cubit; and even to know the different alterations which that measure had undergone among these people: But this nicety he thinks needless; looking upon the general fact to be fully established by what he had said before. Mr Bruce, however, has treated the subject with much greater accuracy. He observes, that from the situation of Canopus, the distance between Egypt and Cyprus, and the extension of the land to the northward, it appears that no addition of any consequence has been made to it for 3000 years past. The only argument left for the increase of land therefore must be taken from the nilometer. The use of this instrument was to determine the quantity of inundation, that so it might be known whether the crop would be sufficient to enable the people to pay the taxes exacted of them by the sovereign or not. The first step was to know what space of ground was overflowed in a given number of years; and this being determined by mensuration, the next thing was to ascertain the produce of the ground upon an average. Thus becoming acquainted with the greatest and least crops produced, together with the exact extent of ground overflowed, they were furnished with all the necessary principles for constructing a nilometer; and nothing now remained but to erect a pillar in a proper place, and divide it exactly into cubits. This was accordingly done; the pillar was first divided into cubits, and these again were subdivided into digits. The first division of this kind was undoubtedly that mentioned in Scripture, and called the cubit of a man; being the length of the arm from the middle of the round bone in the elbow to the point of the middle finger; a measure still in use among all rude nations. As no standard could be found by which this measure might be exactly determined, authors have differed very much concerning the true length of the cubit when reduced to our feet and inches. Dr Arbuthnot reckons two cubits mentioned in Scripture; one of them containing one foot nine inches and \\(\\frac{8}{9}\\) of an inch; the other one foot and \\(\\frac{24}{75}\\) of a foot; but Mr Bruce is of opinion that both of these are too large. He found, by mensuration, the Egyptian cubit to be exactly one foot five inches and three-fifths of an inch; and Herodotus mentions, that in his time the cubit used for determining the increase of the Nile was the Samian cubit, about 18 of our inches. The latter also informs us, that in the time of Moeris, the minimum of increase was 8 cubits, at which time all Egypt below the city of Memphis was overflowed; but that in his time 16 or at least 15 cubits were necessary to produce the same effect. But to this account Mr Bruce objects, that Herodotus could have no certain information concerning the nilometer, because he himself says that the priests, who alone had access to it, would tell him nothing of the matter. Herodotus also informs us, that in the time of Moeris, great lakes were dug to carry off the waters of the inundation; and this superfluous quantity Mr Bruce supposes to have been conveyed into the desert for the use of the Arabs, and that by such a vast drain the rise of the water on the nilometer would undoubtedly be diminished. But even granting that there was such a difference between the rise of the water in the time of Moeris and in that of Herodotus, it does not appear that anything like it has appeared ever since. Strabo, who travelled into Egypt 400 years after the time of Herodotus, found that eight cubits were then the minimum, as well as in the time of Moeris. From some passages in Strabo, however, it appears that it required a particular exertion of industry to cause this quantity of water produce a plentiful crop; but there is not the least reason to suppose, that the very same industry was not necessary in the time of Moeris; so that still there is not any increase of land indicated by the nilometer. About 100 years afterwards, when the emperor Adrian visited Egypt, we are informed from unquestionable authority, that 16 cubits were the minimum when the people were able to pay their tribute; and in the fourth century, under the emperor Julian, 15 cubits were the standard; both which accounts correspond with that of Herodotus. Lastly, Procopius, who lived in the time of Justinian, informs us, that 18 cubits were then requisite for a minimum.\n\nFrom these accounts, so various and discordant, it is no increase obvious that no certain conclusion can be drawn. It of land in is not indeed easy to determine the reason of this difference in point of fact. The only conjecture we can reasonably offer is, that as it appears that by proper care a smaller potted quantity of water will answer the purpose of producing a plentiful crop, so it is not unreasonable to suppose that at different periods the industry of the people has varied so much as to occasion the disagreement in question. This would undoubtedly depend very much upon their governor; and indeed Strabo informs us that it was by the care of the governor Petronius, that such a small quantity of water was made to answer the purpose. The conclusion drawn by Mr Bruce from the whole of the accounts above related, is, that from them it is most probable that no increase of land has been indicated by the nilometer from the time of Moeris to that of Justinian.\n\nOn the conquest of Egypt by the Saracens, their nor barbarous and stupid caliph destroyed the nilometer, more mo causing another to be built in its stead, and afterwards fixed the standard of paying tribute considerably below what it had usually been. The Egyptians were thus kept in continual terror, and constantly watched the new nilometer to observe the gradual increase or decrease of the water. On this he ordered the new nilometer to be destroyed, and another to be constructed, and all access to it to be denied to the people. Which prohibition is still continued to Christians; though our author found means to get over this obstacle, and has given a figure of the instrument itself. That the people might not, however, be supposed to remain in total ignorance of their situation, he commanded a proclamation to be daily made concerning the height of the water, but in such an unintelligible manner that nobody was made any wiser; nor, according to our author, is the proclamation understood at this day. From his own observations, however, Mr Bruce concludes, that 15 cubits are now the minimum of inundation, and as this coincides with the accounts of it in the times of Herodotus and Adrian, he supposes with great probability, that the same quantity of water has been necessary to overflow this country from the earliest accounts to the present time.\n\nIt now remains only to take notice of what is said by M. Savary concerning the former distance of the island of Pharos from the land to which it is now joined.\nWith regard to his other assertions concerning the city of Metelis having been once a sea port, M. Volney proves that he has quoted Strabo unfairly, and consequently no stress is to be laid upon them. The principal, indeed the only, evidence which therefore remains, is the passage already quoted from Homer, viz. that \"the island of Pharos is as far distant from one of the mouths of the Nile as a vessel can sail in one day before the wind.\"\n\n\"But (says M. Volney) when Homer speaks of the distance of this island, he does not mean its distance from the shore opposite, as that traveller (M. Savary) has translated him, but from the land of Egypt and the river Nile. In the second place, by a day's sail we must not understand that indefinite space which the vessels, or rather the boats, of the ancient Greeks, could pass through in a day; but an accurate and determined measure of 540 stadia. This measure is ascertained by Herodotus, and is the precise distance between Pharos and the Nile, allowing, with M. d'Anville, 27,000 toises to 540 stadia. It is therefore far from being proved, that the increase of the Delta or of the continent was so rapid as has been represented; and, if we were disposed to maintain it, we should still have to explain how this shore, which has not gained half a league from the days of Alexander, should have gained eleven in the far shorter period from the time of Menelaus to that conqueror. The utmost extent of the encroachment of this land upon the sea, however, may be learned from the words of Herodotus; who informs us, that \"the breadth of Egypt, along the sea coast, from the gulf of Plinthus to the lake Serbonis near Mount Cæsus, is 3600 stadia; and its length from the sea to Heliopolis 1500 stadia.\" Allowing therefore the stadium of Herodotus to be between 50 and 51 French toises, the 1500 stadia just mentioned are equal to 76,000 toises; which, at the rate of 57,000 to a degree, gives one degree and near 20 minutes and a half. But from the astronomical observations of M. Niebuhr, who travelled for the king of Denmark in 1761, the difference of latitude between Heliopolis, now called Matara, and the sea, being one degree 29 minutes at Damietta, and one degree 24 minutes at Rosetta, there is a difference on one side of three minutes and a half, or a league and a half encroachment; and eight minutes and a half, or three leagues and a half on the other.\"\n\nThus the dispute concerning the augmentation of the land of Egypt by the Nile seems to be absolutely decided; and the encroachments of it on the sea so trifling, that we may justly doubt whether they exist, or whether we are not entirely to attribute the apparent differences to those which certainly take place betwixt the ancient and modern mensuration. M. Volney gives a very particular description of the face of the country; but takes notice of the inconveniences under which travellers labour in this country, by which it is rendered extremely difficult to lay any thing certain with regard to the nature of the soil or mineral productions. These arise from the barbarity and superstition of the people, who imagine all the Europeans to be magicians and sorcerers, who come by their magic art to discover the treasures which the genii have concealed under the ruins. So deep-rooted is this opinion, that no person dares walk alone in the fields, nor can he find any one willing to accompany him; by which means he is confined to the banks of the river, and it is only by comparing the accounts of various travellers that any satisfactory knowledge can be acquired.\n\nAccording to this author, the entrance into Egypt at Rosetta presents a most delightful prospect, by the account of perpetual verdure of the palm trees on each side, the face of orchards watered by the river, with orange, lemon, and the count other fruit trees, which grow there in vast abundance; try, and the same beautiful appearance is continued all the way to Cairo. As we proceed farther up the river, he says, that nothing can more resemble the appearance of the country than the marshes of the Lower Loire, or the plains of Flanders: instead, however, of the numerous trees and country housetops of the latter, we must imagine some thin woods of palms and cypress trees, with a few villages of mud-walled cottages built on artificial mounds. All this part of Egypt is very low and flat, the declivity of the river being so gentle, that its waters do not flow at a greater rate than one league in an hour. Throughout the country nothing is to be seen but palm trees, single or in clumps, which become more rare in proportion as you advance; with wretched villages composed of huts with mud walls, and a boundless plain, which at different seasons is an ocean of fresh water, a miry morass, a verdant field, or a dusty desert; and on every side an extensive and foggy horizon, where the eye is wearied and disgusted. At length, towards the junction of the two branches of the river, the mountains of Cairo are discovered on the east; and to the south-west three detached masses appear, which from their triangular form are known to be the pyramids. We now enter a valley which turns to the southward, between two chains of parallel eminences. That to the east, which extends to the Red sea, merits the name of a mountain from its steepness and height, as well as that of a desert from its naked and savage appearance. Its name in the Arabic language is Moharatum, or the lewa mountain. The western is nothing but a ridge of rock covered with sand, which has been very properly termed a natural mound or earthen wall. In short, that the reader may at once form an idea of this country, let him imagine on one side a narrow sea and rocks; on the other, immense plains of sand; and in the middle, a river, flowing through a valley of 150 leagues in length and from three to seven wide, which at the distance of 30 leagues from the sea separates into two arms; the branches of which wander over a soil almost free from obstructions, and void of declivity.\n\nFrom comparing his own observations with those of other travellers, our author concludes, that the basis of all Egypt from Abydos (the ancient Syene) to the Mediterranean, is a continued bed of calcareous stone of whitish hue, and somewhat soft, containing the same kind of shells met with in the adjacent seas, and which forms the immense quarries extending from Saouadi to Manfalout for the space of more than 25 leagues, according to the testimony of Father Sicard.\n\nAs this country has been more recently visited by men of eminent abilities and profound research, who appear to have examined every object that presented itself with a philosopher's eye, we beg leave to add to the testimonies of the authors already mentioned, the substance of the French general Reynier's account of the face of the country. He informs us, that the barriers by which Egypt is inclosed must be strong, because they have been planted by the hand of nature.\nIt is separated from Asia by deserts of considerable extent; and should an hostile army attempt to approach it on that side, it would have to take its route through marshy grounds below its general level, and presenting to the traveller little else than brackish water. Its flat shores towards the Mediterranean, and the mouths of the Nile gorged up with mounds of sand, present to an enemy very few places which will be found proper for the debarkation of troops. Immense deserts constitute its natural boundaries on the west, on which account it has nothing to dread but the incursions of the Arabs from Barbary. A desert also separates Egypt from the Red Sea, which gives no flattering invitations to an enemy to invade it from that quarter, the two ports of that sea being destitute of resources, and Egypt itself being the only country from which a hostile army could procure provisions and camels, sufficient to enable it to cross the desert.\n\nIn upper Egypt, a chain of mountains present themselves to the eye of the traveller on either side of the Nile. The valley between these mountains, through which the course of the river is directed, is nearly five leagues broad, which the periodical inundations of the river completely cover. This valley alone is inhabited, and susceptible of cultivation. The eastern chain of mountains, by which the Nile is separated from the Red Sea, surpasses that on the west in respect of height, terminating by precipices towards the valley, affuming in different places the appearance of an immense wall, broken irregularly by narrow valleys, which have owed their origin to the sudden and temporary torrents of winter, and serve for passes over these stupendous mountains. The western chain, by which the valley of the Nile is separated from that of Oualis, has in general a gradual and gentle declivity, although it becomes more abrupt towards Siout, and is steep from the angle formed by the Nile towards Hennuh, till it reaches Syene, at which place the mountains have a more considerable height, affording but a narrow passage to the river.\n\nThe distance between these two chains of mountains is increased as you approach Cairo, the eastern chain terminating near the extremity of the Red Sea, without the appearance of any junction with the Arabian mountains, which have a similar termination. The western chain declines towards Fayyum, taking a north-west direction near Grand Cairo, and forming the Mediterranean coast in a direction to the west. Lower Egypt lies between these two great chains of mountains and the sea, which has most probably been formed, at least in a great measure, by the slime or mud which the river Nile deposits, as it is intersected by its branches, and a vast number of canals.\n\nThe seven branches by which the Nile anciently emptied itself into the Mediterranean, are at present reduced to two, viz., those of Damietta and Rosetta. There are now no vestiges of the other five, except a canal or two, which are only navigable during a part of the year. It is not improbable, that when all the branches of the Nile were entire and distinct, each of them contained about the same quantity of water. The cutting of canals to effect the equilibrium of the water, the channels of which were afterwards neglected, would diminish the quantum of water in one branch and increase it in another. The salt water mingling with the fresh, would destroy the fecundity of the ground in some places, and thus induce the inhabitants to search for habitations where they might find the earth more fertile.\n\nIt has already been observed, that the principal part of Lower Egypt owes its existence to the deposition of mud or earth by the Nile, which also formed the banks at the different mouths of that river. The mud of the Nile would first cover the low ground nearest to its bed or channel, and the increase of land from the deposition of mud would be more gradual in its progress in distant parts, from which circumstance would arise the formation of lakes. These in their turn would be gradually filled up by the land growing out of the deposited mud of the river, which of consequence would increase the boundaries of Lower Egypt, by taking from the sea; but as it is natural for the sea to resist such encroachments, it is probable that the ground formed by the deposited mud of the Nile will no longer continue to increase in one direction without diminishing in another. The experience of centuries past has fully evinced, that the sea has actually taken more from the extent of Egypt than has been compensated by the mud of the Nile. By the simple operation of natural causes it may be safely concluded, that if nature and art do not cooperate; if the water is permitted to increase, and the channels of the different branches are allowed to be augmented, the sea will continue to snatch new lands from the inhabitants, which appears to be the inevitable doom of Egypt, while it continues in the hands of a people who are ignorant and uncultivated.\n\nA large proportion of the land formerly watered by the branches of the Nile, anciently denoted the Pelusiac, Tanitic, and Mendesian branches, is now the bed of Lake Menzaleh. Lake Bourlos is not far from the mouth of what was formerly called the Sebennitic branch, and Lake Maadich is near the mouth of the ancient Canopic. Lake Mareotic was at too great a distance from the Nile to be filled up with the mud which it deposits, the waters of which were diverted from the lake, by a canal which had been cut for the conveyance of water to the city of Alexandria; and having no communication with the sea, its waters of consequence were gradually evaporated. It still, however, contained a moving sand and a brackish mud, which receiving the rain in winter, and a small portion of the waters from the Nile by the canals of Bohireh, it exhibits the appearance of a marsh during the greater part of the year. There are also a few lakes which owe their origin to the redundant waters of the Nile, diffusing themselves over hollow places in which they are confined, and only disappear by the gradual process of evaporation.\n\nIn addition to the branches and chief canals already mentioned, there are numerous canals in Lower Egypt by which it is intersected. These convey the waters of the inundation, which dykes in different districts serve to retain. By these waters the more elevated grounds are fertilized, and other cantons in succession, after which they are poured into the lakes, or are lost in the sea. The dwelling of this remarkable river commences about the summer solstice, reaching its utmost extent in the autumnal equinox; and after appearing for a few days in all its native majesty, it gradually begins.\ngins to subside. In point of time there is a difference of fifteen days, and sometimes twice that period, with respect to the rise and fall of the Nile; but it may be affirmed in general, that Lower Egypt cannot be safely passed during any more of the year than from the beginning of February to the end of August. At this time the great branches alone contain water, on which passage boats are always to be met with.\n\nIt is obvious from this succinct account of the general face of the country, that no invading army could carry on any military operations in Lower Egypt during more than seven months in the year. It may perhaps be admitted with truth, that the confines of the desert might be traversed during the five remaining months; but the villages in that direction are ill qualified to grant those necessary supplies to an army which, after crossing the desert, must be in want of every thing. No communication could be kept open from the desert with the interior, from September to December inclusive. At this period, therefore, an enemy could not carry on any military operations in the interior but by water. Nor would an army destined to defend Egypt find itself free from very considerable embarrassment during the continuance of the inundation; for as a considerable part of its movements would unavoidably be made on that element, they would be from the nature of things both tedious and difficult.\n\nMr Bruce has given us a particular account of the sources from whence were derived the vast quantities of marble met with in the remains of ancient buildings in this country. These he discovered during his journey from Kenne to Coffeir on the Red sea, before he took his expedition to Abyssinia. He gives a most dismal idea of the deserts through which he passed. What houles he met with were constructed like those M. Volney mentions, of clay, being no more than six feet in diameter, and about ten in height. The mountains were the most dreary and barren that can be imagined; and the heat of the sun so great, that two sticks rubbed together only for half a minute would take fire and flame. In these burning regions no living creature was to be met with, even the poisonous serpents and scorpions not being able to find subsistence. The first animal he saw was a species of ants in a plain called Hamra from the purple colour of its sand; and it was remarkable that these insects were of the same colour with the sand itself. No water was anywhere to be met with on the surface; though at a place called Legeta there were some draw-wells, the water of which was more bitter than salt itself. At Hamra the porphyry mountains and quarries begin, the stone of which is at first soft and brittle; but the quantity is immense, as a whole day was taken up in passing by them. These porphyry mountains begin in the latitude of nearly 24 degrees, and continue along the coast of the Red sea to about 22° 30', when they are succeeded by the marble mountains; these again by others of alabaster, and these last by basaltic mountains. From the marble mountains our author selected twelve kinds, of different colours, which he brought along with him. Some of the mountains appeared to be composed entirely of red and others of green marble, and by their different colours afforded an extraordinary spectacle. Not far from the porphyry mountains the cold was so great, that his camels died on his return from Abyssinia though the thermometer stood no lower than 42 degrees.\n\nNear to Coffeir he discovered the quarries whence the ancients obtained those immense quantities of marble with which they constructed so many wonderful works. The first place where the marks of their operations were very perceptible, was a mountain much higher than any they had yet passed, and where the stone was so hard that it did not even yield to the blows of a hammer. In this quarry he observed that some ducts or channels for conveying water terminated; which, according to him, flows that water was one of the means by which these hard stones were cut. In four days, during which our author travelled among these mountains, he says, that he had \"passed more granite, porphyry, marble, and alabaster, than would build Rome, Athens, Corinth, Syracuse, Memphis, Alexandria, and half a dozen such cities.\" It appeared to him that the passageways between the mountains, and which he calls defiles, were not natural but artificial openings; where even whole mountains had been cut out, in order to preserve a gentle slope towards the river. This desert our author supposes not to be above one foot in 50; so that the carriages must have gone very easily, and rather required something to retard their velocity than any force to pull them forward. Concerning the mountains in general, he observes, that the porphyry is very beautiful to the eye, and is discovered by a fine purple sand without any glofs. An unvariegated marble of a green colour is generally met with in the same mountain; and where the two meet, the marble becomes soft for a few inches, but the porphyry retains its hardness. The granite has a dirty brown appearance, being covered with sand; but on removing this, it appears of a gray colour with black spots, with a reddish cast all over it. The granite mountains lie nearer to the Red sea, and seem to have afforded the materials for Pompey's pillar. The redness above mentioned seems to go off on exposure to the air; but re-appears on working or polishing the stone farther. The red marble is next to the granite, though not met with in the same mountain. There is also a red kind with white veins, and vast quantities of the common green serpentine. Some samples of that beautiful marble named Isabella were likewise observed; one of them of that yellowish cast called quaker colour, the other of the blueish kind named dove colour. The most valuable kind is that named verde antico, which is found next to the Nile in the mountains of serpentine. It is covered by a kind of blue flaky stone, somewhat lighter than a flate, more beautiful than most kinds of marble, and when polished having the appearance of volcanic lava. In these quarters the verde antico had been uncovered in patches of about 20 feet square. There were small pieces of African marble scattered about in several places, but no rocks or mountains of it; so that our author conjectures it to lie in the heart of some other kind. The whole is situated on a ridge with a descent to the east and west; by which means it might easily be conveyed either to the Nile, or Red sea, while the hard gravel and level ground would readily allow the heaviest carriages to be moved with very little force.\n\nTravellers have talked of an emerald mine in these deserts; but from the researches of Mr Bruce, it does not exist.\nnot appear to have any existence. In the Red Sea indeed, in the latitude of $25^\\circ 3'$, at a small distance from the south-western coast, there is an island called the Mountain of Emeralds; but none of these precious stones are to be met with there. Here, as well as on the continent, there were found many pieces of a green pellucid substance; but veined, and much softer than rock crystal, though somewhat harder than glass. A few yards up the mountain he found three pits, which are supposed to have been the mines whence the ancients obtained the emeralds; but though many pieces of the green substance above mentioned were met with about these pits, no signs of the true emerald could be perceived. This substance, however, he conjectures to have been the *fumaragus* of the Romans. In the mountains of Caffre, as well as in some places of the deserts of Nubia, our author found some rocks exactly resembling petrified wood.\n\nThe only metal said by the ancients to be produced in Egypt is copper. On the road to Suez are found great numbers of those stones called Egyptian flints and pebbles, though the bottom is a hard, calcareous, and porous stone. Here also M. Volney tells us, that the stones above mentioned, and which resemble petrified wood, are to be met with. These, he says, are in the form of small logs cut slanting at the ends, and might easily be taken for petrifications, though he is convinced that they are real minerals.\n\nF. Sicard mentions two lakes, from the water of which is produced annually a great quantity of salt containing much mineral alkali; and M. Volney informs us, that the whole soil of this country is impregnated with salt; so that, upon digging to some depth in the ground, we always meet with brackish water impregnated in some degree with the mineral alkali as well as with common salt. The two lakes mentioned by Sicard are situated in the desert to the west of the Delta; and are three or four leagues in length, and about a quarter of a league in breadth, with a solid and stony bottom. For nine months in the year they are without water; but in the winter time there oozes out of the earth a reddish violet coloured water, which fills the lakes to the height of five or six feet. This being evaporated by the return of the heat, there remains a bed of salt two feet thick and very hard, which is broken into pieces with iron bars; and no less than 30,000 quintals are procured every year from these lakes. So great is the propensity of the Egyptian soil to produce salt, that even when the gardens are overflowed for the sake of watering them, the surface of the ground, after the evaporation and absorption of the water, appears glazed over with salt. The water found in the wells contains mineral alkali, marine salt, and a little nitre. M. Volney is of opinion, that the fertile mould of Egypt, which is of a blackish colour, differs essentially from that of the other parts; and is derived from the internal parts of Ethiopia along with the waters of the Nile. This seems to contradict what he had before advanced against M. Savary concerning the increase of the land of Egypt by means of the waters of this river; but there is no reason at all to suppose this kind of earth to be of a foreign origin; it being always the result of vegetation and cultivation. Even the most barren and sandy spots in the world, if properly watered, and such vegetables planted in them as would grow there, in time would be covered with this black earth as well as others; and of this kind of artificial formation of soil, travellers give us a remarkable instance in the garden of the monks at Mount Sinai, where the country is naturally as barren as in any place of the world. \"The monks of Sinai (says Dr Shaw), in a long process of time, have covered over with dung and the sweepings of their convent near four acres of naked rocks; which produce as good cabbage, roots, salad, and all kinds of pot herbs, as any soil and climate whatsoever. They have likewise raised olive, plum, almond, apple, and pear trees, not only in great numbers, but of excellent kinds. The pears, particularly are in such esteem at Cairo, that there is a present of them sent every year to the bakhaw and persons of the first quality. Neither are their grapes inferior in size and flavour to any whatsoever: it being fully demonstrated, by what this little garden produces, how far an indefatigable industry can prevail over nature; and that several places are capable of culture and improvement which were intended by nature to be barren, and which the lazy and slothful have always suffered to be so.\"\n\nFrom this general account of the country, we may reasonably conclude, that the natural fertility of Egypt is not diminished in modern times, provided the same pains were taken in the cultivation of it as formerly; but this is not to be expected from the present degenerate race of inhabitants. \"The Delta (says M. Savary) is at present in the most favourable state for agriculture. Washed on the east and west by two rivers formed by the division of the Nile, each of which is as large and more deep than the Loire, intersected by innumerable rivulets; it presents to the eye an immense garden, all the different compartments of which may be easily watered. During the three months that the Thebais is under water, the Delta possesses fields covered with rice, barley, vegetables, and winter fruits. It is also the only part of Egypt where the same field produces two crops of grain within the year, the one of rice, the other of barley.\"\n\nThe only cause of all this fertility is the Nile, without which the whole country would soon become an uninhabitable desert, as rain falls very seldom in this part of the world. It flows with a very gentle stream through the flat country, and its waters are very muddy, so that they must have time to settle, or even require filtration before they can be drunk. For purifying the water, Method of the Egyptians, according to M. Volney, use bitter almonds, with which they rub the vessel containing it, and then the water becomes light and good; but on what principle this ingredient acts we cannot pretend to determine. Unglazed earthen vessels filled with water are kept in every apartment; which by a continual evaporation through their porous substance, render the contained fluid very cool even in the greatest heats. The river continues muddy for six mouths: and during the three which immediately precede the inundation, the stream being reduced to an inconsiderable depth, becomes heated, green, fetid, and full of worms. The Egyptians in former times paid divine honours to the Nile, and still hold it in great veneration. They believe its waters to be very nourishing, and that they are superior\nThis river, livelled by the rains which fall in Abyssinia, begins to rise in Egypt about the month of May; but the increase is inconsiderable till towards the end of June, when it is proclaimed by a public crier through the streets of Cairo. About this time it has usually risen five or six cubits; and when it has risen to 16, great rejoicings are made, and the people cry out Waffah Allah, that is, that God has given them abundance. This commonly takes place about the latter end of July, or at farthest before the 20th of August; and the sooner it takes place, so much the greater are the hopes of a good crop. Sometimes, though rarely, the necessary increase does not take place till later. In the year 1705, it did not rise to 16 cubits till the 19th of September; the consequence of which was that the country was depopulated by famine and pestilence.\n\nWe may easily imagine that the Nile cannot overflow the whole country of itself in such a manner as to render it fertile; for which reason there are innumerable canals cut from it across the country, it has already been observed, by which the water is conveyed to distant places, and almost every town or village has one of these canals. In those parts of the country where the inundation does not reach, and where more water is required than it can furnish, as for watering of gardens, they must have recourse to artificial means for raising it from the river. In former times they made use of Archimedes's screw; but that is now disused, and in place of it they have chosen the Persian wheel. This is a large wheel turned by oxen, having a rope hung with several buckets which fill as it goes round, and empty themselves into a cistern at the top. Where the banks of the river are high, they frequently make a basin in the side of them, near which they fix an upright pole, and another with an axle across the top of that, at one end of which they hang a great stone, and at the other a leatheren bucket; this bucket being drawn down into the river by two men, is raised by the descent of the stone, and emptied into a cistern placed at a proper height. This kind of machine is used chiefly in the upper parts of the country, where the raising of water is more difficult than in places near the sea. When any of the gardens or plantations want water, it is conveyed from the cisterns into little trenches, and from thence conducted all round the beds in various rills, which the gardener easily stops by raising the mould against them with his foot, and diverts the current another way as he sees occasion.\n\nThe rise of the inundation is measured, as has already been observed, by an instrument adapted for the purpose, and called mikesas, which we translate nilometer. Mr Bruce informs us, that this is placed between Geeza and Cairo, on the point of an island named Rhoda, about the middle of the river, but somewhat nearer to Geeza. It is a round tower with an apartment, in the middle of which is a cistern neatly lined with marble. The bottom of this cistern reaches to that of the river, and there is a large opening by which the water has free access to the inside. The rise of the water is indicated by an octagonal column of blue and white marble, on which are marked 20 pecks or cubits of 22 inches each. The two lowermost of these have no subdivisions; but each of the rest is divided into 24 parts called digits; the whole height of the pillar being 36 feet 8 inches.\n\nWhen the river has attained its proper height, all the canals are opened, and the whole country laid under water. During the time of the inundation a certain vor, which the tical motion of the waters takes place; but notwithstanding this, the Nile is so easily managed, that many fields lower than the surface of its waters are preserved from injury merely by a dam of moistened earth not more than eight or ten inches in thickness. This method is made use of particularly in the Delta when it is threatened with a flood.\n\nAs the Nile does not always rise to a height sufficient for the purposes of agriculture, the former sovereigns of Egypt were at vast pains to cut proper canals in order to supply the deficiency. Some of these are still preserved, but great numbers are rendered useless through the indolence or barbarity of their successors. Those which convey the water to Cairo, into the province of Fayoom, and to Alexandria, are best taken care of by government. The last is watched by an officer appointed for that purpose, whose office it is to hinder the Arabs of Bashiria, who receive this superfluous water, from turning it off before Alexandria be provided for, or opening it before the proper time, which would hinder the increase of the river. In like manner, that which conveys the water to Fayoom is watched, and cannot be opened before that of Cairo, which is called the Canal of Trajan. A number of other canals, only taken care of by those who derive advantage from them, proceed from that arm of the Nile which runs to Damietta, and fertilize the province of Sharkia; which, making part of the isthmus of Suez, is the most considerable of Egypt, and the most capable of a great increase of cultivation. The plains of Gaza which lie beyond, and are possessed by the Arabs, would be no less fertile, were it not for the excessive inclination these people have to destroy, so that they make war even with the spontaneous productions of the earth. A number of other canals run through the Delta; and the vestiges of those which watered the provinces to the eastward and westward, show that in former times these were the best cultivated parts of Egypt. \"We may also presume (says the baron de Tott), from the extent of the ruins of Alexandria, the construction of the canal, and the natural level of the lands which encompass the lake Mareotic, and extend themselves westward to the kingdom of Barca, that this country, at present given up to the Arabs, and almost deserted, was once sufficiently rich in productions of every kind to furnish the city of Alexander with its whole subsistence.\"\n\nThe air and climate of Egypt are extremely hot, and not only from the height of the sun, which in summer approaches to the zenith, but from the want of rain and air from the vicinity of those burning and sandy deserts which lie to the southward. In the months of July and August, according to M. Volney, Reaumur's thermometer stands, even in the most temperate apartments, at the height of 24 or 25 degrees above the freezing point; and in the southern parts it is said to rise still higher. Hence, he says, only two seasons should be distinguished in Egypt, the cool and the hot, or spring and summer. The latter continues for the greatest part\nof the year, viz. from March to November or even longer; for by the end of February the sun is intolerable to a European at nine o'clock in the morning. During the whole of this season, the air seems to be inflated, the sky sparkles, and every one sweats profusely, even without the least exercise, and when covered with the lightest dress. This heat is tempered by the inundation of the Nile, the fall of the night dews, and the subsequent evaporation; so that some of the European merchants, as well as the natives, complain of the cold in winter. The dew we speak of does not fall regularly throughout the summer, as with us; the parched state of the country not affording a sufficient quantity of vapour for this purpose. It is first observed about St John's day (June 24th), when the river has begun to swell, and consequently a great quantity of water is raised from it by the heat of the sun, which being soon condensed by the cold of the night air, falls down in copious dews.\n\nIt might naturally be imagined, that as for three months in the year Egypt is in a wet and marshy situation, the excessive evaporation and putrefaction of the stagnating waters would render it very unhealthy. But this is by no means the case. The great dryness of the air makes it absorb vapours of all kinds with the utmost avidity; and these rising to a great height, are carried off by the winds either to the southward or northward, without having time to communicate any of their pernicious effects. This dryness is so remarkable in the internal parts of the country, that flesh meat exposed to the open air does not putrefy even in summer, but soon becomes hard and dry like wood. In the deserts there are frequently dead carcases thus dried in such a manner, and become so light, that one may easily lift that of a camel with one hand. In the maritime parts, however, this dryness of the air is not to be expected. They discover the same degree of moisture which usually attends such situations. At Rofetta and Alexandria, iron cannot be exposed to the air for 24 hours without rusting. According to M. Volney, the air of Egypt is also strongly impregnated with salts; for which opinion he gives the following reason: \"The stones are corroded by natrum (mineral alkali or soda), and in moist places long crystallizations of it are to be found, which might be taken for saltpetre. The wall of the Jesuits garden at Cairo, built with earth and bricks, is everywhere covered with a crust of this natrum as thick as a crown piece: and when this garden has been overflowed by the waters of the kaidj (canal), the ground, after they have drained off, appears sparkling on every side with crystals, which certainly were not brought thither by the water, as it shows no sign of salt either to the taste or by distillation.\"—But whatever may be the quantity of salt contained in the earth, it is certain that M. Volney's opinion of its coming thither from the air cannot be just. The salt in question is excessively fixed, and cannot be diffused into the air without the violent heat of a glasshouse furnace; and even after this has been done, it will not remain diffused through the atmosphere, but quickly falls back again. No experiments have ever shown that any salt was or could be diffused in the air, except volatile alkali, and this is now known to be formed by the union of two permanently elastic fluids; and it is certain that a saline air would quickly prove fatal to the animals who breathed it. The abundance of this kind of salt in Egypt therefore only shows, that by some unknown operation the heat of the sun forms it from the two ingredients of earth and water, though we do not yet understand the manner, nor are able to imitate this natural operation.\n\nTo this saline property of the earth M. Volney attributes the excessive quickness of vegetation in Egypt, which is so great, that a species of gourd called karra will, in 24 hours, send forth shoots of four inches in length; but for the same reason, in all probability, it is that no exotic plant will thrive in Egypt. The merchants are obliged annually to send to Malta for their garden seeds; for though the plants thrive very well at first, yet if the seed of them is preserved, and sown in the second year, they always come up too tall and flender.\n\nBy reason of the great dryness of the air, Egypt is exempted from the phenomena of rain, hail, snow, thunder, and lightning. Earthquakes are also seldom heard of in this country; though sometimes they have been very fatal and destructive, particularly one in the year 1112. In the Delta, it never rains in summer, and very seldom at any other time. In 1761, however, such a quantity of rain unexpectedly fell, that a great number of houses, built with mudwalls, tumbled entirely down by being soaked with the water, to which they were unaccustomed. In the Higher Egypt the rain is still less frequent; but the people, sensible of the advantages which accrue from it, always rejoice when any falls, however insufficient to answer the purpose. This deficiency of rain is supplied by the inundation and dews already mentioned. The latter proceed, as has already been said, partly from the waters of the inundation and partly from the sea. At Alexandria, after sunset, in the month of April, the clothes exposed to the air on the terraces are soaked with them as if it had rained. These dews are more or less copious according to the direction of the wind. They are produced in the greatest quantity by the westerly and northerly winds, which blow from the sea; but the south and south-east winds, blowing over the deserts of Africa and Arabia, produce none.\n\nThe periodical return of winds from a certain quarter is a very remarkable phenomenon in this country. When the sun approaches the tropic of Cancer, they shift from the east to the north; and, during the month of June, they always blow from the north or north-west. They continue northerly all the month of July, varying only sometimes towards the east, and sometimes the contrary way. About the end of this month, and during the whole of August and September, they blow directly from the north, and are but of a moderate strength, though somewhat weaker in the night than in the day. Towards the end of September they return to the east, though they do not absolutely fix on that point, but blow more regularly from it than any other except the north. As the sun approaches the southern tropic, they become more variable and tempestuous, blowing most commonly from the north, north-east, and west, which they continue to do throughout the months of December, January, and February; and, during that season, the vapours raised from the Mediterranean condense into mist, or even sometimes\nEgypt sometimes into rain. Towards the end of February, and in the succeeding month, they more frequently blow from the south than from any other quarter. During some part of the month of March and in that of April, they blow from the south, south-east, and south-west; sometimes from the north and east, the latter becoming most prevalent about the end of that month, and continuing during the whole of May.\n\nIt is to the long continuance of the north winds, formerly called the Eteian winds, that Egypt probably owes its extreme dryness, as well as part of the inundation by which it is fertilized. From the month of April to July, there appear to be two immense currents in the atmosphere, the under one blowing from the north, and the upper from the south. By the former the vapours are raised from the Mediterranean and southern parts of Europe, where they are carried over Abyssinia, dissolving there in immense deluges of rain; while by the latter the superfluous vapours, or those raised from the country of Abyssinia itself, are carried northward toward the sources of the Euphrates. Here the clouds coming from the south, descending into the lower part of the atmosphere, dissolve in like manner into rain, and produce an inundation of the Euphrates similar to that of the Nile, and immediately succeeding it. Mr Bruce had an opportunity of attaining this fact in the month of June 1768; for at that time, while on a voyage from Sidon to Alexandria, he observed great numbers of thin white clouds moving rapidly from the south, and in direct opposition to the Eteian winds.\n\nBesides the ordinary winds here spoken of, Egypt is infested with the destructive blasts common to all warm countries which have deserts in their neighbourhood. These have been distinguished by various names, such as poisonous winds, hot winds of the desert, Samsel, the wind of Damascus, Kamjin, and Simoon. In Egypt they are denominated \"winds of 50 days,\" because they most commonly prevail during the 50 days preceding and following the equinox; though, should they blow constantly during one half of that time, an universal destruction would be the consequence. Of these travellers have given various descriptions. M. Volney says, that the violence of their heat may be compared to that of a large oven at the moment of drawing out the bread. They always blow from the south; and are undoubtedly owing to the motion of the atmosphere over such vast tracts of hot land, where it cannot be supplied by a sufficient quantity of moisture. When they begin to blow, the sky loses its usual serenity, and assumes a dark, heavy, and alarming aspect, the sun himself laying aside his usual splendor, and becoming of a violet colour. This terrific appearance seems not to be occasioned by any real haze or cloud in the atmosphere at that time, but solely to the vast quantity of fine sand carried along by those winds, and which is so excessively subtle that it penetrates everywhere. The motion of this wind is always rapid, but its heat is not intolerable till after it has continued for some time. Its pernicious qualities are evidently occasioned by its excessive avidity of moisture. Thus it dries and shrivels up the skin; and by doing the same to the lungs, will in a short time produce suffocation and death. The danger is greatest to those of a plethoric habit of body, or who have been exhausted by fatigue; and putrefaction soon takes place in the bodies of such as are destroyed by it. Its extreme dryness is such, that water sprinkled on the floor evaporates in a few minutes; all the plants are withered and stripped of their leaves; and a fever is instantly produced in the human species by the suppression of perspiration. It usually lasts three days, but is altogether insupportable if it continue beyond that time. The danger is greatest when the wind blows in squalls, and to travellers who happen to be exposed to its fury without any shelter. The best method in this case is to stop the nose and mouth with a handkerchief. Camels, by a natural instinct, bury their noses in the sand, and keep them there till the squall is over. The inhabitants, who have an opportunity of retiring to their houses, instantly shut themselves up in them, or go into pits made in the earth, till the destructive blast be over.\n\nThe description of a blast of this kind which overtook Mr Bruce in the desert of Nubia is still more terrible than that just given from M. Volney. We have already mentioned something of the pillars of moving land raised by the winds in the desert. These were observed by our traveller on this occasion in all their terrific majesty. Sometimes they appeared to move slowly; at other times with incredible swiftness, so that they could not have been avoided by the fleetest horse. Sometimes they came so near, that they threatened destruction to the whole company. Frequently the tops, when arrived at an immense height, so that they were lost in the clouds, suddenly separated from the bodies, and dispersed themselves in the air; and sometimes the whole column broke off near the middle, as if it had received a cannon shot; and their size was such, that at the distance of about three miles, they appeared ten feet in diameter. Next day they appeared of a smaller size, but more numerous, and sometimes approached within two miles of the company. The sun was now obscured by them, and the transmission of his rays gave them a dreadful appearance resembling pillars of fire. This was pronounced by the guide to be a sign of the approaching Simoon or hot wind; and he directed, that when it came, the people should fall upon their faces and keep their mouths on the sand, to avoid the drawing in this pernicious blast with their breath. On his calling out that the Simoon was coming, Mr Bruce turned for a moment to the quarter from whence it came, which was the south-east. It appeared like a haze or fog of a purple colour, but less bright than the purple part of the rainbow; seemingly about 20 yards in breadth, and about 12 feet high from the ground. It moved with such rapidity, that before he could turn about and fall upon his face, he felt the vehement heat of its current upon his face; and even after it passed over, which was very quickly, the air which followed was of such a heat as to threaten suffocation. Mr Bruce had unfortunately inspired some part of the pernicious blast; by which means he almost entirely lost his voice, and became subject to an asthmatic complaint, from which he did not get free for two years. The same phenomenon occurred twice more on their journey through this desert. The second time, it came from the south a little to the east; but it now seemed to have a shade of blue along with the purple, and its edges were less perfectly defined; resembling rather a thin smoke, and having\nving about a yard in the middle tinged with blue and purple. The third time, it was preceded by an appearance of sandy pillars more magnificent than any they had yet observed; the sun shining through them in such a manner as to give those which were nearest a resemblance of being spangled with stars of gold. The simoom which followed had the same blue and purple appearance as before, and was followed by a most suffocating wind for two hours, which reduced our travelers to the lowest degree of weakness and delirium.\n\nIt was remarkable that this wind always came from the south-east, while the sandy pillars, which prognosticated its approach, affected to keep to the westward, and to occupy the vast circular space inclosed by the Nile to the west of their route, going round by Chagre towards Dongola. The heaps of sand left by them when they fell, or raised by the whirlwinds which carried them up, were 12 or 13 feet high, exactly conical, tapering to a fine point, and their bases well proportioned.\n\nThe inhabitants of Egypt may now be distinguished into four distinct races of people.\n\nI. The Arabs, who may be subdivided into three classes. 1. The poverty of those who settled here immediately after the conquest of the country by Amrou Ebn Al As, the khalif Omar's general. 2. The Magrebians, or Western Arabs, who at different times have migrated from the countries to the westward of Egypt, and are descended from the Saracen conquerors of Mauritania. 3. The Bedouins, or Arabs of the desert, known to the ancients by the name of Scenites, or dwellers in tents. The first of these classes are now found among the husbandmen and artisans; and are distinguished from the others by being of a more robust habit of body, as well as of a larger stature than the others. They are in general five feet four inches high; and many of them attain two or three inches more, and are muscular without being fleshy. Their countenances are almost black, but their features are not disagreeable; and as those of the country do not ally themselves in marriage but with the people of their own tribe, their faces have all a strong resemblance to each other. This is not the case with such as live in towns, by reason of their promiscuous marriages. The second class are more numerous in the Said, where they have villages and even distinct sovereigns of their own. Like the former, they apply themselves to agriculture and mechanical occupations. The Bedouins pass their lives among the rocks, ruins, and sequestered places where they can find water; sometimes uniting in tribes and living in low smoky tents, and shifting their habitations from the desert to the banks of the river and back again, as best suits their convenience. Their time of inhabiting the desert is the spring; but after the inundation they take up their residence in Egypt, in order to profit by the fertility of the country. Some farm lands in the country, which they cultivate, but change annually. In general, all these Bedouins are robbers, and are a great terror to travellers as well as to the husbandmen; but though their number is estimated at not less than 30,000, they are dispersed in such a manner that they cannot attempt any thing of consequence.\n\nII. The Copts are descendants of those inhabitants of Egypt whom the Arabs subdued, and who were composed of original Egyptians, Persians and Greeks. M. Volney is of opinion that their name of Copts is only an abbreviation of the Greek word Aiguptios, an Egyptian. They are principally to be met with in the Said, though some also inhabit the Delta. They have all a yellowish dusky complexion, puffed-up visage, swollen eyes, flat noses, and thick lips; and in fact the exact countenance of a mulatto. M. Volney, from a view of the sphynx, and finding its features to be such as is just now described, concludes, that the ancient Egyptians were real negroes; which he thinks is likewise confirmed by a passage in Herodotus, where he concludes, that the inhabitants of Colchis were descended from the Egyptians, \"on account of the blackness of their skins and frizzled hair.\" M. Volney also remarks, that the countenance of the negroes is such as exactly represents that state of contraction assumed by our faces when strongly affected by heat. The eye-brows are knit, the cheeks rise, the eye-lids are contracted, and the mouth distorted; and this state of contraction to which the features of the negroes are perpetually exposed in the hot climates they inhabit, is become particularly characteristic. Excessive cold and snow produces the same effect; and hence this kind of countenance is also common among the Tartars; while, in the temperate climates, the features are proportionably lengthened, and the whole countenance expanded.\n\nThe Copts profess the Christian religion, but follow the heresy of the Eutychians, whence they have been persecuted by the Greeks; but having at last got the better of their adversaries, they are become the depositaries of the registers of the lands and tribes. At Cairo they are called writers; and are the intendants, secretaries, and collectors for government. The head of their class is writer to the principal chief; but they are all hated by the Turks, to whom they are slaves, as well as by the peasants whom they oppress. Their language bears a great resemblance to the Greek; but they have five letters in their alphabet, as well as a number of words in their language, which may be considered as the remains of the ancient Egyptian. There are found to bear a near resemblance to the dialects of some of the neighbouring nations, as the Arabic, Ethiopian, Syriac, &c., and even of those who lived on the banks of the Euphrates. The language of the Copts, however, has fallen into disuse for upwards of 300 years. On the conquest of the country by the Saracens, the latter obliged the people to learn their language; and about the year 722 the use of the Greek tongue was prohibited throughout the whole of their empire: the Arabic language then of course became universal; while the others, being only met with in books, soon became totally neglected. The true Coptic, therefore, though there is a translation of the scriptures and many books of devotion written in it, is understood by nobody, not even the monks and priests.\n\nIII. The Turks, who have the title of being masters of Egypt, but are chiefly to be met with at Cairo, where they possess the religious and military employments. Formerly they possessed also the posts under government; but they are now occupied by the fourth race of inhabitants, viz.\n\nIV. The Mamouks. Of the origin of these we have already given some account; we have only, therefore,\nfore, to relate some of the most remarkable particulars concerning their constitution and government, manners, &c.\n\nThese people, as has already been mentioned, are the real masters of Egypt; and in order to secure themselves in the possession of the country, they have taken several precautions. One of the principal of these is the degradation of the two military corps of azabs and janizaries, both of which were formerly very formidable. They have been able to effect this only in consequence of the corrupt and wretched government of the Turks; for before the revolt of Ibrahim Kiaya, the Turkilh troops, which ought to have consisted of 40,000, were reduced to less than half that number through the avarice and malversation of their officers. Their degradation was completed by Ali Bey; who having first displaced all the officers who gave him any umbrage, left their places vacant, and so reduced the consequence of the whole, that the azabs and janizaries are now only a rabble of vagabonds, who dread the Mamlouks as much as they meanest of the populace. The principal body of the Mamlouks reside at Cairo; but many of them are dispersed through the country, in order to keep up their authority, collect the tribute, and oppress the people: yet it should seem very easy for the Porte to dispossess them of this usurped authority, as their number is supposed not to exceed 8500, including among them a great many youth under 20 years of age.\n\nThe Mamlouks are all horsemen; and as war is accounted the only honourable employment among them, it is reckoned disgraceful to walk on foot, none but cavalry being accounted soldiers. The other inhabitants are allowed only the use of mules and asses; and the same mark of indignity is imposed upon Europeans; though by proper management and liberal presents, this may be got over. In the year 1776 Lord Algernon Percy, afterwards Lord Louvaine, and the earl of Charlemont, obtained permission to ride upon horseback. The Mamlouks, however, are not incited to this continual appearance on horseback merely by their supposed superiority to the rest of the inhabitants; it is rendered necessary by their dres, which is extremely unwieldy and cumbersome. It consists of a wide shirt of thin yellowish-colored cotton; over which is a gown of Indian linen, or some of the light stuffs of Damascus or Aleppo. Over this is a second covering of the same form and wideness, with sleeves reaching down to the ends of the fingers. The former covering is called antari; and the latter caftan. The caftan is usually made of silk or some finer stuff than the under garments; and both of them are fastened by a long belt, which divides the whole dress into two bundles. Over all these they have a third, named djouka, consisting of cloth without lining, and made nearly similar to the others, but that the sleeves are cut in the elbow. This coat is lined, sometimes even in summer, with fur; and as if all this was not sufficient, they have an outer covering called the beniche, which is the cloak or robe of ceremony; and so completely covers the body, that even the ends of the fingers are not to be seen. Thus, when the beniche and other accoutrements are on, the whole body appears like a long sack, with a bare neck and bald head covered with a turban thrust out of it. This turban is called a kaouk; and is of a cylindrical form, yellow, and turned up on the outside with a roll of mullin artificially folded up. On their feet they have a fock of yellow leather reaching up to the heels, flippers without any quarters, which consequently are always ready to be left behind in walking. Lastly, to complete this extraordinary dress, they have a kind of pantaloons or trousers, long enough to reach up to the chin, and so large that each of the legs is big enough to contain the whole body; but that they may walk more at their ease under such a number of impediments, they tie all the loose parts of their dress with a running girth. \"Thus swaddled (says M. Volney), we may imagine the Mamlouks are not very active walkers; and those who are not acquainted by experience with the prejudices of different countries, will find it scarcely possible to believe that they look on this dress as exceedingly commodious. In vain we may object that it hinders them from walking and encumbers them unnecessarily on horseback; and that in battle a horseman once dismounted is a lost man. They reply, It is the custom, and every objection is answered.\"\n\nIn the accoutrements of their horses, the Mamlouks are almost equally absurd. The saddle is a clumsy piece of furniture, weighing with the saddle-cloths not less than 25 pounds; while the weight of the stirrups is never less than 9 or 10 pounds, nay, frequently exceeds 13. On the back-part of the saddle rises a truquim about eight inches in height, while a pommel before projects four or five inches, in such a manner as to endanger the breast of the horseman if he should happen to stoop. Instead of a stuffed frame, they have three thick woollen coverings below the saddle; the whole being fastened by a surcingle, which, instead of a buckle, is tied with leather thongs in very complicated knots, and liable to slip. Instead of a crupper they have a large martingale which throws them upon the horse's shoulders. The stirrups are made of copper, longer and wider than the foot, having circular edges an inch high in the middle, and gradually declining toward each end. The edges are sharp, and used instead of spurs, by which means the poor animal's sides are much wounded. The weight of the furniture has already been mentioned; and is the more ridiculous as the Egyptian horses are very small. The bridle is equally ill contrived, and greatly injures the horse's mouth, especially by reason of the violent method they have of managing the animal. Their usual way is to put the horse to a full gallop, and suddenly stop him when at full speed. Thus checked by the bit, he bends in his hind legs, stiffens the fore ones, and moves along as if he scarce had joints in his body: yet notwithstanding all these disadvantages, our author acknowledges that they are vigorous horsemen, having a martial appearance which pleases even strangers.\n\nIn the choice of their arms they have shown themselves more judicious. Their principal weapon is an English carbine about 30 inches long; but so large in bore, that it can discharge 10 or 12 balls at a time, which can scarcely fail of doing great execution even from the most unskillful hand. Besides two large pistols carried in the belt, they have sometimes a heavy mace at the bow of the saddle for knocking down their enemy; and by the shoulder belt they suspend a crooked sabre measuring 24 inches in a straight line from the hilt.\nEgypt: hilt to the point, but so at least in the curve. The reason of the preference given to the crooked blade is, that the effect of a straight one depends merely on the force with which it falls, and is confined to a small space, but that of a crooked one is continued longer by the action of the arm in retiring. The Mamlouks commonly procure their sabres from Constantinople, or other parts of Europe; but the beys rival each other in those of Persia and such as are fabricated of the ancient steel of Damascus. For these they frequently pay as high as 40l. or 50l. sterling; but though it must be allowed that the edge of these weapons is exquisitely keen, yet they have the defect of being almost as brittle as glass. The whole education and employment of the Mamlouks consists in the exercise of these weapons, or what is conducive to it; so that we should imagine they might at last become altogether irresistible. Every morning the greater part of them exercise themselves in a plain near Cairo, by firing their carbines and pistols in the most expeditious manner, having an earthen vessel for a mark to shoot at; and the person who breaks it is highly applauded by the beys who attend in order to encourage them. Here also they exercise themselves in the use of the sabre, as well as of the bow and arrows; though they do not any longer make use of these last in their engagements. Their favourite diversion is throwing the dyerid; a word properly signifying a reed, but which is generally made use of to signify any staff thrown by the hand after the manner of the Roman pilum. In this exercise they make use of the branches of the palm-tree freshly stripped. These branches, which have the form of the stalk of an artichoke, are about four feet long, and weigh five or six pounds. With these the cavaliers enter the lists, riding full speed, and throwing them afterwards at each other from a considerable distance. As soon as the assailant has thrown his weapon, he turns his horse, and his antagonist pursues in his turn. The diversion, however, frequently turns out very serious, as some are capable of throwing these weapons with force sufficient to wound their antagonists mortally. Ali Bey was particularly dexterous at this kind of sport, and frequently killed those who opposed him. All their military exercises, however, are by no means sufficient to render the Mamlouks formidable in the field. In their engagements they have neither order, discipline, nor even subordination; so that their wars are only scenes of robbery, plunder, and tumultuary encounters, which begin very often suddenly in the streets of Cairo without the least warning. If the contention happens to be transferred to the country, it is still carried on in the same manner. The strongest or most daring party pursues the other. If they are equal in courage, they will perhaps appoint a field of battle, and that without the least regard to advantages of situation, but fighting in platoons, with the boldest champions at the head of each. After mutual defiances, the attack begins, and every one chooses out his man. After discharging their fire-arms, if they have an opportunity they attack with their sabres; and such as happen to be dismounted are helped up again by their servants; but if nobody happens to be near, the servants will frequently kill them for the sake of the money they carry about them. Of late, however, the ordinary Mamlouks, who are all slaves to the rest, seem convinced that their patrons are the persons principally interested; for which reason they reasonably enough conclude that they ought to encounter the greatest dangers. Hence they generally leave them to carry on the dispute by themselves; and being always sure of finding a master who will employ them, they generally return quietly to Cairo until some new revolution takes place.\n\nThe mode of living among the Mamlouks is exceedingly expensive, as may easily be conceived from what has already been related. There is not one of them who does not cost above 100l. sterling annually, and many of them upwards of 200l. At every return of the fast of Ramadan, their masters must give them a new suit of French and Venetian clothes, with stuffs from India and Damascus. Frequently they require new horses and harnesses; they must likewise have pistols and sabres from Damascus, with gilt stirrups, and saddles and bridles plated with silver. The chiefs are distinguished from the vulgar by the trinkets and precious stones they wear; by riding Arabian horses of 200l. or 300l. value, wearing shawls of Cashmere in value from 25l. to 50l. each, with a variety of peltries, the cheapest of which costs above 20l. Even the European merchants have given into this kind of extravagance; so that not one of them looks upon his wardrobe to be decently furnished unless it be in value 500l. or 600l.\n\nAnciently it was customary for the women to adorn their heads with sequins; but this is now rejected as not sufficiently expensive. Instead of these, diamonds, emeralds, and rubies, are now substituted; and to these they add French stuffs and laces. In other respects the character of the Mamlouks is almost the worst that can be imagined. Without affection, tie, or kind, they give themselves up without controul to the most enormous vices; and, according to M. Volney, they are at once ferocious, perfidious, seditious, base, deceitful, and corrupted by every species of debauchery, not excepting even the unnatural vice; of which he tells us not one is free, this being the very first lesson each of them receives from his master, all being originally slaves, as has already been mentioned.\n\nAs these are the present governors of Egypt, we may easily judge that the condition of the common people cannot be very agreeable. The greater part of the lands indeed are in the hands of the Mamlouks, beys, and professors of the law, the property of all others being very precarious. Contributions are to be paid, or damages repaired, every moment; and there is neither right of succession nor inheritance for real property, but every thing must be purchased from government. The peasants are allowed nothing but what is barely sufficient to sustain life. They cultivate rice and corn indeed, but are not at liberty to use either. The only food allowed them is dora or Indian millet, from which they make a kind of tasteful bread; and of this, with water and raw onions, confits all their fare throughout the year. They esteem themselves happy, therefore, if along with these they can sometimes procure a little honey, cheese, four milk, or a few dates. They are very fond of flesh meat and fat; neither of which, however, they have an opportunity of tasting except at extraordinary festivals. Their ordinary\nEgyptian dress consists of a shirt of coarse blue linen, and a clumsy black cloak; with a sort of black bonnet over their heads; and over all they wear a long red woollen handkerchief. Their arms, legs, and breasts, are naked, and most of them do not even wear drawers. They live in mud-walled huts of the most miserable construction, where they are exposed to the inconveniences of smoke, heat, and unwholesome air; to all which are to be added the continual fears they live in of being robbed by the Arabs, oppressed by the Mameluks, or some other grievous calamity. The only conversation is concerning the intestine troubles and misery of the country, murders, bandoleros, and executions. Here sentence of death is executed without the least delay or form of trial. The officers who go the rounds in the streets either by night or day, are attended by executioners, who carry along with them leather bags for receiving the heads they cut off in these expeditions. Even the appearance of guilt is not necessary to infer a capital punishment; for frequently nothing more is requisite than the possession of wealth, or being supposed to possess it. In this case the unfortunate person is summoned before some bey; and when he makes his appearance, a sum of money is demanded of him. If he denies that he possesses it, he is thrown on his back, and receives two or three hundred blows on the soles of the feet, nay perhaps is put to death without any ceremony. The only security of those who possess any wealth in this country therefore is, to preserve as great an appearance of poverty as possible.\n\nThough the climate of Egypt is far from being unhealthy; yet there are not a few diseases which seem to be peculiar to it, and to have their origin either from the constitution of the atmosphere, or the manner of living of the inhabitants. One of these till lately has been supposed to be the plague; which opinion we find supported by Dr Mead, who has endeavoured to assign a natural reason why it should take its origin in this country. But it is now universally agreed, that the plague never originates in the interior parts of Egypt, but always begins at Alexandria, passing successively from thence to Rosetta, Cairo, Damietta, and the rest of the Delta. It is likewise observed, that its appearance is always preceded by the arrival of some vessel from Smyrna or Constantinople; and that if the plague has been very violent in either of these cities, the danger of Egypt is the greater. On proper inquiry, it is found to be really a native of Constantinople; from whence it is exported by the absurd negligence of the Turks, who refuse to take any care to prevent the spreading of the infection. As they sell even the clothes of the dead without the least ceremony, and ships laden with this pernicious commodity are sent to Alexandria, it is no wonder that it should soon make its appearance there. As soon as it has reached Cairo, the European merchants shut themselves up with their families in their khans or lodgings, taking care to have no further communication with the city. Their provisions are now deposited at the gate of the khan, and are taken up by the porter with iron tongs; who plunges them into a barrel of water provided for the purpose. If they have occasion to speak to any person, they take care to keep at such a distance as to avoid touching or even breathing upon each other.\n\nBy these precautions they certainly escape the general calamity, except by accident; and it not long ago happened that the disease was conveyed by a cat into the dwellings of the French merchants in Cairo; by which two were infected, and one died. In this manner they are imprisoned for three or four months, without any other amusement than walking on their terraces in the evenings, cards, or conversation with one another. There is a remarkable difference between the plague at Constantinople and in Egypt. In the former, it is most violent in summer; and in the latter in winter, ending there always in the month of June. It is also remarkable, that the water-carriers of Egypt, whose backs are constantly wet from the nature of their occupation, never have the plague. It appears in Egypt every fourth or fifth year, when it makes such ravages as would depopulate the country, were it not for the vast concourse of strangers which arrive here every year from all parts of the Turkish empire.\n\nA malady which seems in reality to be peculiar to Egypt is blindness. This is so common at Cairo, as Mr Volney informs us, that out of 100 people whom he has met on the street, he might reckon 20 quite blind; 10 without the sight of one eye; and 20 others with their eyes red, purulent, or blemished. Almost every one, says he, wears a fillet, a token of an approaching or convalescent ophthalmia. In considering the causes of this disorder, he reckons the sleeping upon terraces to be a principal one. The south wind, he says, cannot be the cause; otherwise the Bedouins would be equally subject to it with the Egyptians themselves; but what is with the greatest probability to be assigned as the cause, according to our author, is the very poor and little nutritive food which the natives are obliged to use. \"The cheese, sour-milk, honey, confection of grapes, green fruits, and raw vegetables (says he), which are the ordinary food of the people, produce in the stomach a disorder which physicians have observed to affect the sight; the raw onions, especially, which they devour in great quantities, have a peculiar heating quality, as the monks of Syria made me remark on myself. Bodies thus nourished, abound in corrupted humours, which are constantly endeavouring a discharge. Diverted from the ordinary channels, by habitual perspiration, these humours fly to the exterior parts, and fix themselves where they find the least resistance. They therefore naturally attack the head, because the Egyptians, by having it once a week, and covering it with a prodigiously hot head-dress, principally attract to it the perspiration; and if the head receives even so slight an impression of cold on being uncovered, this perspiration is suppressed, and falls upon the teeth, or still more readily on the eyes as being the tenderest part. It will appear the more probable that the excessive perspiration of the head is a principal cause, when we reflect that the ancient Egyptians, who went bare-headed, are not mentioned by physicians as being so much afflicted with ophthalmies; though we are informed by historians that some of the Pharaohs died blind. The Arabs of the desert also, who cover the head but little, especially when young, are also very little subject to them.\" In this country blindness is often the consequence of the small-pox, a disorder very frequent and very fatal.\nE G Y\n\n[631]\n\nE G Y\n\ntal among the Egyptians; and no doubt the more dangerous on account of their absurd method of treating it, of which it is needless to enter into any discussion in this place. They are not unacquainted with inoculation; but seem not to be sensible of its advantages, as they very seldom practise it.\n\nTo the same cause, viz. unwholesome food, M. Volney ascribes the general deformity of the beggars, and the miserable appearance of the children; which he says are nowhere so wretched. \"Their hollow eyes, pale and puffed faces, swollen bellies, meagre extremities, and yellow skins, make them always seem as if they had not long to live. Their ignorant mothers pretend that this is the effect of the evil eye of some envious person, who has bewitched them; and this ancient prejudice is still general in Turkey: but the real cause is the badness of their food. In spite of the talismans, therefore, an incredible number of them perish; nor is any city more fatal to the population of the neighbouring country than Grand Cairo.\n\nThe venereal disease, which, for reasons best known to themselves, the inhabitants call the big fed evil, is so general at Cairo, that one half of the inhabitants are infected. It is extremely difficult to cure, though the symptoms are comparatively very mild, inasmuch that people who are infected with it will frequently live to the age of 80; but it is fatal to children born with the infection, and exceedingly dangerous to such as emigrate to a colder climate.\n\nBesides these, there are two uncommon diseases met with in Egypt, viz. a cutaneous eruption which returns annually; and a swelling of the testicles, which often degenerates into an enormous hydrocele. The former comes on towards the end of June or beginning of July, making its appearance in red spots and pimples all over the body, occasioning a very troublesome itching. The cause of this distemper, in M. Volney's opinion, is the corruption of the waters of the Nile, which towards the end of April become very putrid, as has already been observed. After this has been drunk for some time, the waters of the inundation, which are fresh and wholesome, tend to introduce some change in the blood and humours; whence a cutaneous eruption is the natural consequence.\n\nThe hydrocele most commonly attacks the Greeks and Copts; and is attributed to the quantity of oil they make use of, as well as to their frequent hot-bathing. Our author remarks, that \"in Syria as well as in Egypt, constant experience has shown, that brandy distilled from common figs, or from the fruit of the fycamore tree, as well as from dates and the fruit of the nopal, has a most immediate effect on the testicles, which it renders hard and painful the third or fourth day after it has been drunk; and if the use of it be not discontinued, the disorder degenerates into a confirmed hydrocele. Brandy distilled from dried raisins has not the same effect: this is always mixed with aniseeds; and is very strong, being distilled three times. The Christians of Syria and the Copts of Egypt make great use of it; the latter especially drink whole bottles of it at their supper. I imagined this an exaggeration; but I have myself had ocular proofs of its truth, though nothing could equal my astonishment that such excellent drinks do not produce instant death, or at least every symptom of the most insensible drunkenness.\"\n\nIn the spring season malignant fevers prevail in this country; concerning which our author mentions no remarkable particular, but that eggs are a kind of poison, and that bleeding is very prejudicial. He recommends a vegetable diet, and the bark in very large quantity.\n\nNotwithstanding the opprobrium which the Egyptians commerce labour under, a very considerable trade is carried on of Cairo from Cairo. This flourishing state of commerce is owing to three causes. 1. That all the commodities consumed in Egypt are collected within the walls of that city. 2. That the Mamouks and all the people of property reside in that place, and there spend their whole revenues. 3. By the situation of this city it is a centre of circulation; corresponding with Arabia and India, by the Red Sea; with Abyssinia and the interior parts of Africa, by the Nile; and with Europe and the Turkish empire, by means of the Mediterranean. A caravan comes here annually from Abyssinia, bringing from 1000 to 1200 slaves, with gum, ivory, gold-dust, ostrich-feathers, parrots, and monkeys.—Another, which sets out from the extreme parts of Morocco, takes in pilgrims for Mecca from all that country as far south as the mouth of the river Senegal. It consists of not fewer than three or four thousand camels; and, passing along the coasts of the Mediterranean, collects likewise the pilgrims from Algiers, Tripoli, and Tunis, arriving at last at Alexandria by the way of the desert. Proceeding thence to Cairo, it joins the Egyptian caravan; and then setting out both together, they take their journey to Mecca, from whence they return in one hundred days; but the Morocco pilgrims, who have still 600 leagues to go, are upwards of a year in returning. The commodities they bring along with them are, India stuffs, shawls, gums, perfumes, pearls, and principally coffee. Besides the profits of this merchandise, considerable sums arise from the duties paid by pilgrims, and the sums expended by them.\n\nThe caravans above-mentioned are not the only means by which these commodities are brought to Cairo. They arrive also at Suez, to which port the southerly winds bring in the month of May six or eight and twenty sail of vessels from Jedda. Small caravans likewise arrive from time to time from Damascus with silk and cotton stuffs, oils, and dried fruits. During the proper season there are also a number of vessels in the road of Damietta, unloading hogsheads of tobacco from Latakia, vast quantities of which are consumed in this country. For this commodity rice is taken in exchange; while other vessels bring clothing, arms, furs, passengers, and wrought silk, from Constantinople. There are other vessels which come from Marseille, Leghorn, and Venice, with cloths, cochineal, Lyons stuffs and laces, grocery ware, paper, iron, lead, Venetian sequins, and German dailers. These are conveyed to Rofetta in barks called by M. Volney dervish, but which seem to be the same mentioned by Mr Bruce under the name of canja, and which are particularly described by him. He informs us, that there is a peculiarity in the form of this vessel which makes it useful for navigating the river Nile; and that is, that the keel...\nkeel is not straight, but a portion of a parabola, whose curve is almost insensible to the eye. Hence, as sand-banks are very common in the Nile, and vessels are apt to strike them when the water becomes low, the middle of the canja will be aground while the extremities are afloat, and thus by means of oars and other affluence, it is always possible to get clear; but were the keel straight, this would be altogether impossible, by reason of the vast sails those vessels carry, which would urge them on with too much force to be recovered. The accommodation on board these vessels is much better than what could be expected; but they are liable to the depredations of robbers, who either swim under water in the day-time, or upon goats' skins during the night: though these seldom attack any boats where there are Europeans, whom they dread on account of their skill in firearms.\n\nFrom so many sources we need not wonder that the commerce of Cairo should be in a very flourishing state. In 1783, according to the report of the commissioner-general of the customs, it amounted to no less than 6,250,000l.; but notwithstanding this show of wealth, the trade carried on at Cairo contributes very little to the enriching of the people. This will readily appear, when we consider, that great part of the coffee and other merchandise brought from India is exported to foreign countries, the value being paid in goods from Turkey and other European countries; while the country consumption confines entirely, or mostly, in articles of luxury already finished, and the produce given in return is mostly in raw materials.\n\nSchemes have frequently been projected of enlarging the commerce of Egypt by cutting through the isthmus of Suez, and thus joining the Mediterranean and Red seas by a canal. This is looked upon by M. Volney as impracticable. He owns, indeed, that no objection can arise from the distance, which is not more than 18 or 19 leagues; neither does any obstacle arise from mountains, or the inequality of levels, the whole being a sandy barren plain. The difficulty, which he considers as insuperable, proceeds from the nature of the corresponding coasts of the Mediterranean and Red seas; both of which are low and sandy, where the waters form lakes, shoals, and morasses, so that ships cannot come within a considerable distance of either; and it would be scarce possible to cut a permanent canal amidst these shifting sands: not to mention, that the shore is destitute of harbours, which must be entirely the work of art. The country, besides has not a drop of fresh water, which it would therefore be necessary to bring as far as from the Nile. The best method of effecting this junction, therefore, is by means of the river itself; and for this the ground is perfectly well calculated. This has been already done by several Egyptian princes, particularly Sefoltris; and the canal is said to have been 170 feet wide, and deep enough for large vessels. After the Grecian conquest it was renewed by the Ptolemies, then by Trajan, and lastly by the Arabs. Part of it still remains, running from Cairo to the north-east of the Berket-el-Hadji, or Lake of the Pilgrims, where it loses itself. At present the commerce with Suez is only carried on by means of caravans, which set out towards the end of April or beginning of May, or in the months of July and August; waiting the arrival of the vessels, and setting out on their departure. The caravans are very numerous; that with which M. Volney travelled consisting of 5000 or 6000 men and 3000 camels. The country is as desert and barren as possible, without a single tree or the smallest spot of verdure; so that every necessary for those who accompany the caravan must be carried on the backs of the camels, wood and water not excepted.\n\nThe custom-houses of Egypt are in the hands of the Christians of Syria. Formerly they were managed by Jews; but these were completely ruined by the extortions of Ali Bey in 1769. The Syrian Christians came from Damascus somewhat more than 50 years ago; and having by their economy and industry gained possession of the most important branches of commerce, they were at length enabled to form the custom-houses, which is an office of great consequence. There were at first only three or four families of them; but their number has since increased to more than 500, and they are reckoned very opulent.\n\nFrom what has already been said concerning the Low state of the Egyptians, we may naturally conclude, of the arts that the arts and all kinds of learning are at a very low and languishing among them. Even the most simple of the mechanical professions are still in a state of infancy. The work of their cabinet-makers, gun-smiths, and locksmiths, is extremely clumsy. There are manufactures of gunpowder and sugar; but the quality of both is very indifferent. The only thing in which they can be said to arrive at any degree of perfection is the manufacture of silk stuffs; though even these are far less highly finished than those of Europe, and likewise bear a much higher price. One very extraordinary art indeed is still extant among the Egyptians, and appears to have existed in that country from the most remote antiquity; and that is a power of enchanting the most deadly serpents in such a manner, that they shall allow themselves to be handled, nay even hurt in the severest manner, without offering to bite the person who injures them. Those who have this art are named Psylli; to which article we refer for an account of what has been said on the subject by ancient and modern travellers.\n\nThe long and bloody war to which the revolution of War in France gave rise, induced the government of that country to leave no measure unattempted, by which the grandeur, independence, and commerce of Great Britain might be as much injured as possible, if not utterly destroyed. The conquest of Egypt was therefore projected, as a preparatory step towards the subjugation of the East Indies, to be effected by reaching the Indian ocean through the isthmus of Suez. This was a daring, a desperate undertaking; and no military character of which France could boast, was considered as equal to its successful execution but the hero of Marengo. He accordingly embarked at Toulon, as commander-in-chief of the army of the east, which amounted to about 40,000 men, and having compelled Malta to surrender in the course of his voyage, he steered for the coast of Egypt, and arriving at Alexandria on the 1st of July 1798, he carried it by assault taken by the French.\n\nIt is well known that while Bonaparte continued in Italy, he strictly prohibited his troops from committing acts of rapine and plunder, of which, however, they were\nwere guilty at Alexandria, and consequently it is to be presumed that the commander in chief could not then prevent it. If he could, he was unquestionably blind to his own interest not to do so, since nothing was more unlikely to conciliate the affections of the Egyptians.\n\nCairo next surrendered to the victors on the 23rd of the same month. The French general attacked one of the enemy's forts at Lambabe on the 25th, when 300 of the enemy were killed; but this was only a prelude to the memorable battle of the pyramids, which was fought on the following day, and seemed for the present to decide the fate of Egypt. The Mamlouks lost 2000 men; and 400 camels, together with their baggage and 50 pieces of cannon, fell into the hands of the conquerors. Thus far Bonaparte appeared to be the favourite of fortune, by whom he was never to be deserted; but he soon found that the race is not always to the swift, or the battle to the strong. He experienced a reverse of an irreparable nature; and as it does not appear that he entertained the smallest apprehension of it, it gave a trait of ferocity to his subsequent conduct which he had never before exhibited.\n\nAdmiral Nelson appeared off the mouth of the Nile on the 1st of August, with a naval force equal to that of the French admiral, and although the fleet of the latter was stationed and defended as to render an attack extremely hazardous, the British hero was determined to attempt it; and in this he succeeded to the utmost of his wishes. He captured nine sail of the line belonging to the enemy, L'Orient, the admiral's flag ship of 120 guns, having blown up during the desperate and bloody engagement. The loss on the part of the French must have been immense, since Ganteaume mentions 3100 made prisoners, whom the British commander returned; of this number there were 800 wounded. The British had about 202 killed, besides fifteen officers, and 678 wounded.\n\nAfter Grand Cairo surrendered to the French, Bonaparte formed his victorious army into three divisions, one of which was commanded by General Desaix, whose destination was Upper Egypt, in pursuit of the flying Mamlouks; the second division he left for the defence of Cairo, and marched in person at the head of the third in pursuit of Ibrahim Bey, who had taken his route towards Syria with a rich caravan. To render abortive, if possible, the designs of Bonaparte, Britain formed an alliance with the Sublime Porte, and the chief preparations for carrying the concerted plan into effect, were made in Syria, under the care and direction of the pacha Djezzar. The frontiers of Egypt towards Syria were to be attacked by an army from Asia Minor, the operations of which were to be favoured by making a strong diversion towards the mouths of the Nile, and by various assaults in Upper Egypt with the remains of Mourad Bey's army. Sir Sidney Smith left Portsmouth to superintend the execution of this extensive plan, and grant every assistance in his power by the maritime force under his command.\n\nIn the mean time care was taken to block up the harbour of Alexandria with four sail of the line and five frigates, under the command of Commodore Hood, as he found it impracticable to burn or destroy the French fleet of transports, without the assistance of a land force sufficient to attack Alexandria. Of the light vessels which had been sent him by the combined fleet of Turks and Russians the commodore had made no use; and he also found the report to be without foundation, that the vessels in the old port belonging to the French, were burnt. It was in order to destroy the preparations of the pacha Djezzar, and disconcert the plans of Sir Sidney Smith, that General Bonaparte thought of leaving Egypt and marching into Syria. The result of this expedition, as we have already hinted, was fatal to the French interest, although Bonaparte perhaps never undertook an enterprise with more rational expectations of ultimate success.\n\nThe town of Jaffa, (anciently Joppa), was obstinately defended, but at last surrendered to the superior tactics of European soldiers. From this place the French general marched with his army in three divisions against St Jean d'Acre, which put an effectual period to his hitherto triumphant career. The pacha was powerfully encouraged by Sir Sidney Smith to make an obdurate resistance to the attack of Bonaparte; and to animate him still more with the hopes of being able to hold out, and force the assailants in the illuse to raise the siege, he sent him a French engineer of distinguished merit, by whose instrumentality Sir Sidney Smith had been enabled to effect his escape from prison. Although the fortrefs was completely repaired by Colonel Philippeaux (the name of the engineer), yet it is more than probable that it could not have long held out against the skill and intrepidity of Bonaparte, if his heavy artillery had not been intercepted by the British on their way from Damietta and Rosetta. After a desperate and bloody siege of about 61 days continuance, the French commander was obliged to abandon the hope of making Acre surrender. In the course of his retreat back again to Egypt, Bonaparte's army ravaged the whole country, burnt the harvests, destroyed the defences of the different ports, the magazines, and every resource of which the Turks might have availed themselves in approaching the frontiers of Egypt. He reached Grand Cairo in 26 days after raising the siege of Acre.\n\nSir Sidney Smith, with indefatigable zeal and activity, continued to execute the remaining parts of the plan of operations against Egypt, which was seconded by the increasing zeal of the Turks in the prosecution of the same design. The troops destined to make an attack upon Alexandria were assembled in the different ports in the island of Rhodes, by Seid Mutapha Pacha, the enterprise being conducted by European officers. The combined fleet of Turkey and Britain only waited the arrival of a convoy, previous to their sailing for Egypt, which the captain pacha, who then lay at anchor in the Dardanelles, was to despatch to Rhodes. During the absence of General Bonaparte, no method had been left unattempted, in order to ruin the interest of the French, and kindle a spirit of rebellion in the minds of the people. This plan succeeded to a certain extent, but the presence of Bonaparte restored tranquillity. His army no doubt suffered severely in its march to Syria; but with such zeal, and activity did he turn his attention to the re-establishment of its organization, that it was in a condition to undertake active operations in the short period of three weeks, although, according to very high authority, it had been completely buried in the burning sands of the desert.\n\nWhile Bonaparte was in the vicinity of the pyramids,\nminds, intended to pursue Mourad Bey in his retreat to Fayoum, he received intelligence from Alexandria, that a Turkish fleet of 100 sail had come to anchor in the bay of Aboukir, from which 3000 troops had landed on the shore of the peninsula, and carried the fort of Aboukir by assault. He accordingly gave directions to his officers to march their forces towards the place of landing, and the first rendezvous of the army was appointed to be at Rhamanich, situated on the left side of the Nile. The advanced guard under the command of General Murat, took the route to Gizeh, and General Menou's moveable column, together with the park of artillery and the staff, formed a junction at Rhamanich on the 20th of July. After the French army quitted its post at the village of Birket, it assembled at the wells between Alexandria and Aboukir; and Bonaparte fixed his head quarters at the former place.\n\nThe Turkish army was about 15,000 strong, and receiving daily reinforcements. When Bonaparte came in sight of it, he instantly formed his columns to attack it, and General d'Ettigny carried the entrenched height of the enemy, by which their right was supported, at the point of the bayonet. Their two wings were cut off from retreating by General Murat, who marched up to the centre of the enemy with a body of cavalry. By this manoeuvre 2000 men perished by water, or were killed by the fire of the republicans. As Bonaparte found that the chief strength of the Turkish army was at the centre, he changed his position as the nature of the ground rendered it necessary. By a variety of experienced movements, in which the French lost several brave officers, the Turks were at length thrown into the utmost confusion, retreated in every direction, and threw themselves into the sea. The majority of them were at too great a distance from the vessels, to be saved in this manner from a watery grave. After this battle, the fort of Aboukir was summoned to surrender, which was defended with the most desperate fury, as the Turks had no idea of capitulating with arms in their hands. General Menou conducted the siege with great vigour and address, and after bombarding it for eight days, till it exhibited nothing but a heap of ruins, the son of the pasha and 2000 men laid down their arms, and were made prisoners of war. In the fort the republicans found 1800 men killed, and 300 wounded. It is said that Sir Sidney Smith witnessed this melancholy reverse of fortune on the part of the Turks, without having it in his power, as at Acre, to grant them relief, or to animate them by his courageous example.\n\nThe next day Bonaparte returned to Alexandria, where he learned the dismal situation of French affairs on the continent of Europe, particularly in Italy and on the Rhine, and the violent commotions which were agitating the interior of France. This determined him to quit Egypt, and return to his own country, full of the idea of vesting in his own person the sovereign authority, to which he has at length attained, both in name and reality. General Berthier alone was his confidential friend, to whom he communicated his future designs. Admiral Gantheaume was ordered to get ready two frigates with the utmost expedition, without informing that officer what was to be their destination, and brought with him Generals Lafay, Marmont, Murat, and Andreossi, together with Monge and Berthollet of the institute; Besieres and his guides received sealed notes, which were not to be opened till a certain day, and certain hour, and at a particular point of the sea-shore. They were found to contain orders for immediate embarkation; and another packet which was to be opened on the day after the sailing of the frigates, contained the nomination of General Kleber to the chief command, and Dufaix to that of Upper Egypt.\n\nBy dispatches from General Kleber subsequent to the departure of Bonaparte, it appears that Mourad Bey having dropped down the Nile to El-Ganayur, was repulsed by a division of the army of Upper Egypt, under the command of General Morand. Being overtaken in his flight by this division, his camp was surprised at Samahna, a vast number of Mameluks were entirely cut off; 200 camels with spoils, 100 horses, and a prodigious quantity of military implements fell into the hands of the republicans, and it was with the utmost difficulty that the bey effected his escape. Thus finally defeated, Mourad wandered through the inhospitable deserts of Upper Egypt, in search of an asylum and the means of subsistence. As this man was such an indefatigable enemy to the French, Dufaix resolved to exterminate him if possible, and for this purpose two columns of infantry mounted on dromedaries were immediately organized, the one commanded by Dufaix in person, and the other by Adjutant-general Boyer, who came up with Mourad on the 19th of October in the defeat of Sediman, after a forced march of three days. The Mameluks fought with determined valour and intrepidity, animated with the hopes of gaining possession of the dromedaries. Their attack was met with such vigour on the part of the republicans, that the Mameluks and Arabs were soon put to flight, and pursued back to the deserts by their intrepid conquerors.\n\nOn the 24th of September, a Turkish fleet of 18 vessels came to anchor before Damietta, which was so rapidly increased by constant reinforcements, that it amounted to 53 about the end of the subsequent month. The naval commander of this fleet was Sir Sidney Smith on board the Tyger. On the 1st of November 4000 Turks effected a landing, who were attacked by General Verdier at the head of 1000 men, and lost, in this apparently unequal contest, no fewer than 3000 men killed, 800 prisoners, including Ismael Bey, the second in command, 32 stand of colours, and five pieces of cannon. After a number of subsequent battles and inferior skirmishes which the republicans fought with various success, they seemed willing to evacuate Egypt upon certain conditions, which met with the approbation of Sir Sidney Smith; but they were afterwards rejected by a species of policy for which it is difficult to account, and fresh obstacles were thrown in the way of the proposed evacuation. This was an event much to be desired by the republicans, according to the opinion of some, while the French denied that the necessity of such a measure ever existed. According to them, they had still 20,000 effective men in that quarter of the globe, and liberally shared in the affections of the inhabitants, by whom they were affixed.\n\nThe gallant and experienced Kleber, who succeeded Bonaparte\nBonaparte in the chief command of the army of the Egyptian Affiliation of Kleber.\n\nBonaparte in the chief command of the army of the Egyptian Affiliation of Kleber, was treacherously assassinated by a janillery, while presenting the general with a memorial for his perusal, on which the chief command devolved on Menou, but not till some other generals, and Reynier in particular, had refused to accept of it. Suspicions fell heavily on General Menou, who, it was supposed, had hired the assassin, as it was well known that a variance subsisted between Kleber and Menou; but it is only doing justice to the latter to declare, that the dying assertions of the murderer sufficiently evinced the contrary. He was most probably hired by the grand vizier himself; but who advised the vizier to the adoption of such an infamous, cowardly measure, we must leave to our readers to find out. The assassin was impaled alive, his right hand burnt off, and his body left to be devoured by birds of prey. Three sheikhs who were privy to his designs, but did not divulge them, were beheaded.\n\nLieutenant Wright was dispatched to Cairo by Sir Sidney Smith, with propositions respecting the evacuation of Egypt to General Menou, whose answer the combined powers expected with anxiety, as the grand vizier was determined to advance against the enemy at the head of 30,000 men, should Menou evince himself determined not to evacuate Egypt. He soon gave them to understand that no overtures of accommodation which they could make to him would be received. He accordingly recommenced hostilities, and marched against Syria with the principal part of his army; a measure which proved abortive under the auspices of Bonaparte, by the prompt and gallant exertions of Sir Sidney Smith. The determination of Menou in such a perilous situation, was no doubt owing in a great measure to the accession of strength which he received from the different beys who joined him, as the best means of securing their independence, having been informed that the Sublime Porte was determined on the conquest of Egypt, and the destruction of the Mamlouks. The aid of Mourad Bey was of some importance to Menou, and it formed a junction of a very singular nature, having formerly been such a determined enemy of the French. Menou strongly fortified Alexandria, Damietta, and Rosetta, and not only finished the lines which Colonel Bromley had begun at Aboukir, but made to these several important additions, putting every place into such a state of defence as seemed to bid defiance to any attack from the Turks.\n\nIn the mean time Britain was not idle, but active in the organization of an army destined to invade Egypt, and compel the French troops to evacuate that country, which was too contiguous to her inevitable possessions in the East Indies; and the command of it was given to that gallant and highly respectable officer, the late general Sir Ralph Abercromby, who appeared off Aboukir in the beginning of March, 1801. The weather proving unfavourable for some days, Sir Ralph did not begin to land his troops till the 8th, at an early hour in the morning. The French having marched from Alexandria, took their station on the heights of Aboukir, to prevent the landing of the British forces. An action soon commenced between the hostile armies, which lasted for two hours, but the republicans were obliged to retreat, having only 4,000 men to oppose to three times that number. The loss of the French on this occasion was estimated at 3,000, and that of the British about 1,500 men, in killed, wounded, and prisoners.\n\nAfter this, few actions of importance occurred till the memorable 21st of March, on which day a battle was fought about four miles from Alexandria. A false attack on the left of the British army was the commencement of hostilities, but the French were still more anxious to turn the right of their opponents, which they attempted in vain. With the same success they made an attack upon the central division. About 200 prisoners fell into the hands of the British, but as their cavalry was much inferior to that of the enemy, whose retreat was also covered by cannon on the opposite hills, they could not pursue their advantages. The loss of the British at this time was very considerable, but the most irreparable part of it was the loss of the commander in chief, who was mortally wounded on the 21st, and died on the 28th of the same month. He was succeeded by General Hutchinson, the second in command, to whom was committed the completion of the plans which his worthy predecessor had concerted. He attacked the French on the 19th of May, near Rhamanich, and forced them to retire towards Cairo. He had 4,000 British troops under his command, and an equal number of Turks under the capitain pacha. He then directed his route towards Cairo, from which the army of the grand vizier was distant only four leagues, in a north-east direction. A reinforcement of 2,000 British troops reached Aboukir about the 6th of May.\n\nBy the advice of Colonel Murray and some other British officers then in the camp of the grand vizier, his highness obtained a victory over 4,000 French, with 9,000 chosen troops, not encumbered with the women and useless attendants so commonly met with in the camps of eastern generals. The whole of Damietta soon fell into the hands of the allies, and the successor of Mourad Bey declared in favour of the British, joining Sir J. Hutchinson with 1,500 cavalry, that kind of force of which the British commander stood in greatest need. In a short time after, the French evacuated Cairo, which was taken possession of by the combined Turkish and British army. The republicans were not made prisoners, but were, by stipulation, to be conveyed to the nearest ports belonging to France, at the expense of Great Britain. Alexandria still held out, which Menou was determined to defend to the last, notwithstanding the idea of receiving reinforcements appeared altogether groundless. He was at length, however, obliged to surrender, and thus the whole of Egypt was in possession of the allies. As the joyful news of peace between Great Britain and France had spread over the country prior to this intelligence, it did not excite half the interest in the mind of Britons which it would otherwise have done.\n\nFor a description of those stupendous and almost indestructible monuments of human grandeur, the pyramids, so often taken notice of and described by travelers, see the article Pyramids.\n\nEGYPTIANS, or Gypsies.

It being customary for the Israelites to send a present or tribute to the king of Moab; in the year of the world 2579, being the last year of their servitude, Ehud was appointed to carry it, who having a design either to free his country from this oppression, or perish in the attempt, had for this purpose provided himself with a dagger which had two edges, and which he had concealed on his right side, (Judges iii. 15, &c.). After he had delivered the present, pretending he had something of great importance to communicate to the king, he obtained a private audience of him; when taking his opportunity, he stabbed him with the poniard to the heart, and so shutting the door after him, had time to make his escape; for as the king was a very corpulent man, his attendants supposed that he was either reposing or easing himself, and therefore forbore to enter his apartment until Ehud was quite gone. As soon as he came to Mount Ephraim, he gathered together the Israelites that lay nearest him, acquainted them with what he had done; and then securing the fords of Jordan that none of them might escape, he fell upon the Moabites, and subdued them.\n\nEIA, or EI, in our old writers, is used for an island.

Ejectment of late years is become an action in the place of many real actions, as writs of right, formetons, &c. which are very difficult, as well as tedious and expensive; and this is now the common action for trial of titles, and recovering of lands, &c. illegally held from the right owner; yet where entry is taken away by diftents, fines, recoveries, diftentions, &c. an ejectment shall not be brought; whereby we find that all titles cannot be tried by this action.\n\nThe method of proceeding in the action of ejectment is to draw up a declaration, and feign therein a lease for three, five, or seven years, to him that would try the title; and also feign a casual ejector or defendant; and then deliver the declaration to the ejector, who serves a copy of it on the tenant in possession, and gives notice at the bottom for him to appear and defend his title; or that he the feigned defendant will suffer judgment by default, whereby the true tenant will be turned out of possession: to this declaration the tenant is to appear at the beginning of next term by his attorney, and consent to a rule to be made defendant, instead of the casual ejector, and take upon him the defence, in which he must confess lease, judgment, entry, and waiver, and at the trial stand upon the title only: but in case the tenant in possession does not appear, and enter into the said rule in time, after the declaration served, then, on affidavit being made of the service of the declaration, with the notice to appear as aforesaid, the court will order judgment to be entered against the casual ejector by default; and thereupon the tenant in possession, by writ habere facias possessionem, is turned out of his possession. On the trial in ejectment, the plaintiff's title is to be set forth from the person last seised in fee of the lands in question, under whom the lessor claims down to the plaintiff, proving the deeds, &c. and the plaintiff shall recover only according to the right which he has at the time of bringing his action. And here, another who hath title to the land, upon a motion made for that purpose, may be defendant in the action with the tenant in possession, to defend his title; for the possession of the lands is primarily in question, and to be recovered, which concerns the tenant, and the title thereto is tried collaterally, which may concern some other.\n\nEKRON, a city and government of the Philistines. It fell by lot to the tribe of Judah, in the first division made by Joshua (xv. 45.), but afterwards it was given to the tribe of Dan (id. xix. 43.). It was situated very near the Mediterranean, between Ashdod and Jamnia. Ekron was a powerful city, and it does not appear by history that the Jews were ever sole peaceable possessors of it: the Ekronites were the first who said that it was necessary to send back the ark of the God of Israel, in order to be delivered from those calamities which the presence of it brought upon their country, (1 Sam. v. 10.). The idol Baalzebub was principally adored at Ekron (2 Kings, i. 2. &c.)\n\nELÆAGNUS,\nELAEAGNUS, Oleaster, or Wild Olive: A genus of plants, belonging to the tetrandria clas.

See Gymnasium.\n\nELAIS, a genus of plants belonging to the natural order of Palmae. See Botany Index.\n\nELAM, in Ancient Geography, a country frequently mentioned in Scripture, and lying to the south-east of Shinar. In the time of Daniel (viii. 2.), Sufiana seems to have been part of it; and before the captivity, it does not appear that the Jews called Persia by any other name. Elymae and Elymais are often mentioned by the ancients. Ptolemy, though he makes Elymais a province of Media, yet he places the Elymae in Sufiana, near the sea-coast. Stephanus takes it to be a part of Affrya; but Pliny and Jolephorus more properly of Persia, whose inhabitants this latter tells us sprang from the Elamites. The best commentators agree, that the Elamites, who were the ancestors of the Persians, were descended from Elam the son of Shem. It is likewise allowed, that the most ancient among the inspired writers constantly intend Persia, when they speak of Elam and the kingdom of Elam. Thus, not to detain the reader with unnecessary quotations, when the prophet Jeremiah (xlix. 39.), after denouncing many judgments against this country, adds these words, \"But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam,\" faith the Lord,\" he is always understood to mean the restoration of the kingdom of the Persians by Cyrus, who subdued the Babylonians, as they before had subdued the Persians.\n\nELAPHEBOLIA, in Grecian antiquity, a festival in honour of Diana the huntress. In the celebration a cake was made in the form of a deer (ἀλέπιον), and offered to the goddess. It owed its institution to the following circumstance: When the Thessalians had been severely beaten by the Thessalians, they resolved, by the perfusion of one Deiphantus, to raise a pile of combustible materials, and burn their wives, children, and effects, rather than submit to the enemy. This resolution was unanimously approved by the women, who decreed Deiphantus a crown for his magnanimity. When everything was prepared, before they fired the pile, they engaged their enemies, and fought with such desperate fury, that they totally routed them, and obtained a complete victory. In commemoration of this unexpected success, this festival was instituted to Diana, and observed with the greatest solemnity.\n\nELAPHEBOLIUM, in Grecian antiquity, the ninth month of the Athenian year, answering to the latter part of February and beginning of March. It consisted of 30 days; and took its name from the festival elaphebolia, kept in this month, in honour of Diana the huntress, as mentioned in the preceding article.\n\nELASMIS, in Natural History, a genus of talcs, composed of small plates in form of spangles; and either flingle, and not farther fliddle; or, if complex, only flidle to a certain degree, and that in somewhat thick laminae.—Of these tales there are several varieties, some with large and others with small spangles, which differ also in colour and other peculiarities.\n\nELASTIC, in Natural Philosophy, an appellation given to all bodies endowed with the property of elasticity. See Elasticity.\n\nELASTIC Fluids. See Air, Electricity, Gas, and Elastic Vapours below.\n\nELASTIC Resin. See CAOUTCHOUC.\n\nELASTIC Vapours are such as may, by any external mechanical force, be compressed into a smaller space than what they originally occupied; restoring themselves, when the pressure is taken off, to their former state with a force exactly proportioned to that with which they were at first compressed. Of this kind are all the aerial fluids without exception, and all kinds of fumes raised by means of heat whether from solid or fluid bodies.\n\nOf these, some retain their elasticity only when a considerable degree of heat is applied to them or the substance which produces them; while others remain elastic in every degree of cold, either natural or artificial, that has yet been observed. Of the former kind are the vapours of water, spirit of wine, mercury, sal ammoniac, and all kinds of sublimable salts; of the latter, those of muriatic acid gas, hydrogen gas, nitrous gas, common air, &c.\n\nThe elastic force with which any one of these fluids is endowed has not yet been calculated, as being ultimately greater than any obstacle we can put in its way. Thus, if we compress the atmospherical air, we shall find that for some little time it will easily yield to the force we apply; but every succeeding moment the resistance will become stronger, and a greater and greater force must be applied in order to compress it further. As the compression goes on, the vessel containing the air becomes hot; but no power whatever has yet been able to destroy the elasticity of the contained fluid in any degree; for upon removing the pressure, it is always found to occupy the very same space that it did before. The case is the same with aqueous steam, to which a sufficient heat is applied to keep it from condensing into water. This will yield to a certain degree; but every moment the resistance becomes greater, until at last it will overcome any obstacles whatever. An example of the power of this kind of steam we have every day in the steam engine; and the vapours of other matters, both solid and fluid, have frequently manifested themselves to be endowed with an equal force. Thus the force of the vapours of spirit of wine has occasioned terrible accidents when the worm has been stopped, and the head of the still absurdly tied down to prevent an explosion; the vapours of mercury have burnt an iron box; and those of sal ammoniac, volatile salts, nitrous acid, marine acid, phosphorus, &c., have all been known to burst the chemical vessels which confined them with great force, in such a manner as to endanger those who stood near them. In short, from innumerable observations, it may be laid down as an undoubted fact, that there is no substance whatever capable of being reduced into a state of vapour, but what in that state is endowed with an elastic force ultimately superior to any obstacle we can throw in its way.\n\nIt hath been a kind of desideratum among philosophers to give a satisfactory reason for this astonishing\nElastic vapours, being power of elasticity in vapour, seemingly so little capable of accomplishing any great purpose when in an unconfined state. As air is that fluid in which, from the many experiments made upon it by the air-pump and otherwise, the elastic property has most frequently been observed, the researches of philosophers were at first principally directed towards it. The causes they assigned, however, were very inadequate; being founded upon a hypothesis concerning the form of the particles of the atmosphere itself, which they supposed to be either rolled up like the springs of watches, or that they consisted of a kind of elastic flakes. This was followed by another hypothesis concerning their substance, which was imagined to be perfectly elastic, and so strong that they could not be broken by any mechanical power whatever; and thus they thought the phenomenon of the elasticity of the air might be explained. But an insuperable difficulty still attended their scheme, notwithstanding both these suppositions; for it was observed, that the elastic power of the air was augmented not only in proportion to the quantity of pressure it was made to endure, but in proportion to the degree of heat applied to it at the time. Sir Isaac Newton was aware of this difficulty; and justly concluded, that the phenomena of the air's elasticity could not be solved on any other supposition but that of a repulsive power diffused all around each of its particles, which became stronger as they approached, and weaker as they removed from each other. Hence the common phenomena of the air-pump and condensing-engine received a satisfactory explanation; but still it remained to account for the power shown in the present case by heat, as it could not be denied that this element had a very great share in augmenting the elasticity of the atmosphere, and seemed to be the only cause of elasticity in other vapours. It does not appear that Sir Isaac entered into this question, but contented himself with attributing to heat the property of increasing repulsion, and ascribing this to another unexplored property called rarefaction. Thus matters stood till the great discovery made by Dr Black, that some bodies have the power of absorbing in an unknown manner the element in question, and parting with it afterwards, so that it flows out of the body which had absorbed it with the very same properties that it had before absorption. Hence many phenomena of heat, vapour, and evaporation, were explained in a manner much more satisfactory than had ever been attempted or even expected before. One of these was that remarkable property of metals becoming hot by hammering; during which operation, in the Doctor's opinion, the element of heat is squeezed out from between the particles of the metal, as water is from the pores of a sponge by pressing it between the fingers. Of the same nature is the phenomenon above-mentioned, that air when violently compressed becomes hot, by reason of the quantity of more subtle element squeezed out from among the particles. In this manner it appears that heat and the repulsive power of Sir Isaac Newton are the very same; that by diminishing the heat of any quantity of air, its elasticity is effectually diminished, and it will of itself shrink into a smaller space as effectually as by mechanical pressure. In one case we have what may be called ocular demonstration of the truth of this doctrine, viz. that by throwing the focus of a strong burning lens upon a small quantity of charcoal in vacuo, the whole will be converted into inflammable air, having even a greater power of elasticity than common air in an equal degree of heat. Here there is nothing else but heat or light to produce the elastic power, or cause the particles of charcoal which before attracted now to repel each other. In another case we have evidence equally strong, that the element of heat by itself, without the presence of that of light, is capable of producing the same effect. Thus when a phial of ether is put into the receiver of an air pump, and surrounded by a small vessel of water, the ether boils violently, and is distilled in vapour, while the water freezes, and is cooled to a great degree. The distillation of this vapour shows that it has an elastic force; and the absorption of the heat from the water shows, that this element not only produces the elasticity, but actually enters into the substance of the vapour itself; so that we have not the least reason to conclude that there is any other repulsive power by which the particles are kept at a distance from one another than the substance of the heat itself. In what manner it acts, we cannot pretend exactly to explain, without making hypotheses concerning the form of the minute particles of matter, which must always be very uncertain. All known phenomena, however, concur in rendering the theory just now laid down extremely probable. The elasticity of the steam of water is exactly proportioned to the degree of heat which flows into it from without; and if this be kept up to a sufficient degree, there is no mechanical pressure which can reduce it into the state of water. This, however, may very easily be done by abstracting a certain portion of the latent heat it contains; when the elastic vapour will become a dense and heavy fluid. The same thing may be done in various ways with the permanently elastic fluids. Thus the purest dephlogisticated air, when made to part with its latent heat by burning with iron, is converted into a gravitating substance of an unknown nature, which adheres strongly to the metal. If the decomposition is performed by means of inflammable air, both together unite into a heavy, aqueous, or acid fluid: if by mixture with nitrous air, still the heat is discernible, though less violent than in the two former cases. The decomposition indeed is slower, but equally complete, and the dephlogisticated air becomes part of the nitrous acid, from which it may be again expelled by proper means: but of these means heat must always be one; for thus only the elasticity can be restored, and the air be recovered in its proper state. The same thing takes place in fixed air, and all other permanently elastic fluids capable of being absorbed by others. The conclusion therefore which we can only draw from what data we have concerning the composition of elastic vapours is, that all of them are formed of a terrestrial substance, united with the element of heat in such a manner that part of the latter may be squeezed out from among the terrestrial particles; but in such a manner, that as soon as the pressure is taken off, the surrounding fluid rushes in, and expands them to their original bulk: and this expansion or tendency to it will be increased in proportion to the degree of heat, just as the expansion of a sponge would be exceedingly augmented, if we could contrive to convey a stream of water into\nElasticity into the heart of it, and make the liquid flow out with violence through every pore in the circumference. In this case, it is evident that the water would act as a power of repulsion among the particles of the sponge, as well as the fire does among the particles of the water, charcoal, or whatever other substance is employed. Thus far we may reason from analogy; but in all probability the internal and essential texture of these vapors will forever remain unknown. Their obvious properties, as well as some of their more latent operations in many cases, are treated of under Chemistry.\n\nIt has been imagined by some, that the artificial elastic fluids have not the same mechanical property with common air, viz. that of occupying a space inversely proportional to the weights with which they are pressed; but this is found to be a mistake. All of them likewise have been found to be non-conductors of electricity, though probably not all in the same degree. Even aqueous vapor, when intimately mingled with any permanently elastic fluid, refuses to conduct this fluid, as is evident from the highly electrical state of the atmosphere in very dry weather, when we are certain that aqueous vapor must abound very much, and be intimately mixed with it. The colour of the electric spark, though it may be made visible in all kinds of permanently elastic vapors, is very different in different fluids. Thus in inflammable and alkaline air it is red or purple, but in fixed air it appears white.\n\nELASTICITY, or Elastic Force, that property of bodies wherewith they restore themselves to their former figure, after any external pressure.\n\nThe cause or principle of this important property elasticity, or springiness, is variously assigned. The Cartesians account for it from the materia subtilis making an effort to pass through pores that are too narrow for it. Thus, say they, in bending, or compressing, a hard elastic body, e.g., a bow, its parts recede from each other on the convex side, and approach on the concave; consequently the pores are contracted or tightened on the concave side; and if they were before round, are now, for instance, oval; so that the materia subtilis, or matter of the second element, endeavouring to pass out of those pores thus tightened, must make an effort, at the same time, to restore the body to the state it was in when the pores were more patent and round, i.e., before the bow was bent; and in this consists its elasticity.\n\nOther later and more wary philosophers account for elasticity much after the same manner as the Cartesians; with this only difference, that in lieu of the subtle matter of the Cartesians, these substitute Ether, or a fine ethereal medium that pervades all bodies.\n\nOthers, setting aside the precarious notion of a materia subtilis, account for elasticity from the great law of nature attraction, or the cause of the cohesion of the parts of solid and firm bodies. Thus, say they, when a hard body is struck or bent, so that the component parts are moved a little from each other, but not quite disjointed or broke off, or separated so far as to be out of the power of that attractive force whereby they cohere; they must certainly, on the cessation of the external violence, spring back to their former natural state.\n\nOthers resolve elasticity into the pressure of the atmosphere; for a violent tension or compression, though not so great as to separate the constituent particles of bodies far enough to let in any foreign matter, must yet occasion many little vacuums between the separated surfaces; so that upon the removal of the force they will close again by the pressure of the aerial fluid upon the external parts. See Atmosphere.\n\nLastly, others attribute the elasticity of all hard bodies to the power of reflection in the air included within them; and so makes the elastic force of the air the principle of elasticity in all other bodies.\n\nThe Elasticity of Fluids is accounted for from their particles being all endowed with a centrifugal force; when Sir Isaac Newton, prop. 23, lib. 2, demonstrates, that particles, which naturally avoid or fly off from one another by such forces as are reciprocally proportioned to the distances of their centre, will compose an elastic fluid, whose density shall be proportional to its compression; and vice versa, if any fluid be composed of particles that fly off and avoid one another, and hath its density proportional to its compression, then the centrifugal forces of those particles will be reciprocally as the distances of their centres.\n\nElasticity of the Air, is the force wherewith that element dilates itself, upon removing the force whereby it was before compressed. See Air and Atmosphere.\n\nThe elasticity or spring of the air was first discovered by Galileo. Its existence is proved by this experiment of that philosopher: An extraordinary quantity of air being intruded by means of a syringe into a glass or metal ball, till such time as the ball, with this accession of air, weighs considerably more in the balance than it did before; upon opening the mouth thereof, the air rushes out, till the ball sinks to its former weight. From hence we argue, that there is just as much air gone out, as compressed air had been crowded in. Air, therefore, returns to its former degree of expansion, upon removing the force that compressed or resisted its expansion; consequently it is endowed with an elastic force. It must be added, that as the air is found to rush out in every situation or direction of the orifice, the elastic force acts every way, or in every direction.\n\nThe elasticity of the air makes a considerable article in Pneumatics.\n\nThe cause of the elasticity of the atmosphere hath been commonly ascribed to a repulsion between its particles; but this can give us only a very slight idea of the nature of its elasticity. The term repulsion, like that of attraction, requires to be defined; and in all probability will be found in most cases to be the effect of the action of some other fluid. Thus, we find, that the elasticity of the atmosphere is very considerably affected by heat. Supposing a quantity of air heated to such a degree as is sufficient to raise Fahrenheit's thermometer to 212°, it will then occupy a considerable space. If it is cooled to such a degree as to sink the thermometer to 0°, it will shrink up into less than half the former bulk. The quantity of repulsive power\npower therefore acquired by the air, while passing from one of these states to the other, is evidently owing to the heat added or taken away from it. Nor have we any reason to suppose, that the quantity of elasticity or repulsive power it still possesses is owing to any other thing than the fire contained in it. The supposing repulsion to be a primary cause, independent of all others, hath given rise to many erroneous theories, and been one very great mean of embarrassing philosophers in their accounting for the phenomena of Electricity.\n\nELATE, a genus of plants belonging to the natural order of Palmae.

It continued in the possession of the Israelites about 150 years, till in the time of Joram, the Edomites recovered it (2 Kings viii. 20.); but it was again taken from them by Azariah, and by him left to his son, (2 Kings xiv. 22.). His grandson Ahaz, however, lost it again to the king of Syria (ib. xvi. 6.); and the Syrians had it in their hands a long while, till after many changes under the Ptolemies, it came at length into the possession of the Romans.\n\nELATINE, a genus of plants belonging to the orchidaceae.

It is navigable for great ships higher than any river in Europe.\n\nELBING, a city of Polish Prussia, in the palatinate of Marienburg, situated in E. Long. 20° 0' N. Lat. 54° 15', on a bay of the Baltic sea, called the Frischeauff, near the mouth of the Vistula. The town is large, populous, and very well built. It is divided into two parts, called the old and new town, which are both of them very well fortified. The old town has a handsome tower, with a good college. The stadt-haus and the academy are good buildings, with pleasant gardens, which are worth seeing. The place has a considerable trade, especially in sturgeon, mead, cheese, butter, and corn. It is seated in a campaign level like Holland, very fruitful and populous. The inhabitants are partly Lutherans and partly Roman Catholics.

That eminence whereon the arm rests, called by us elbow, is by the Latins called cubitus, and the Greeks αγκών, and by others αγκώνας. Elbow is also used by architects, masons, &c., for an obtuse angle of a wall, building, or road, which diverts it from its right line.\n\nELCESAITES, in church history, ancient heretics, who made their appearance in the reign of the emperor Trajan, and took their name from their leader Elcefaï. The Elcefaïtes kept a mean between the Jews, Christians, and Pagans; they worshipped but one God, observed the Jewish sabbath, circumcision, and the other ceremonies of the law. They rejected the Pentateuch, and the prophets; nor had they any more respect for the writings of the apostles, particularly those of St Paul.\n\nELDERS, or Seniors, in Jewish history, were persons of the most considerable for age, experience, and wisdom. Of this sort were the 70 men whom Moses associated with himself in the government of his people; such, likewise, afterwards were those who held the first rank in the synagogue, as presidents.\n\nIn the first assemblies of the primitive Christians, those who held the first place were called elders. The word presbyter, often used in the New Testament, is of the same signification; hence the first councils of Christians were called presbyteria, or councils of elders.\n\nElders is also a denomination still retained in the Presbyterian discipline. The elders are officers, who, in conjunction with the pastors, or ministers, and deacons, compose the consistories or kirk-leissions, meeting to confer, inspect, and regulate, matters of religion and discipline. They are chosen from among the people, and are received publicly with some degree of ceremony. In Scotland, there is an indefinite number of elders in each parish; generally about 12. See Kirk-Leissions and Presbyteries.\n\nELDER. See Sambucus, Botany Index.\n\nELEA, or Elis, in Ancient Geography, a district of Peloponnesus, situated between Achaia and Messenia, reaching from Arcadia quite to the west or Ionian sea; so called from Elis, a cognominal town. See Elis.\n\nELEATIC PHILOSOPHY, among the ancients, a name given to that of the Stoics, because taught at Elea, in Latin Velia, a town of the Lucani.\n\nThe founder of this philosophy, or of the Eleatic sect, is supposed to have been Xenophanes, who lived about the 56th Olympiad, or between 500 or 600 years before Christ. This sect was divided into two parties, which may be denominated metaphysical and physical, the one rejecting, and the other approving, the appeal to fact and experiment. Of the former kind were Xenophanes, Parmenides, Melissus, and Zeno of Elea. They are supposed to have maintained principles not very unlike those of Spinoza; they held the eternity and immutability of the world; that whatever existed was only one being; that there was neither any generation nor corruption; that this one being was immoveable and immutable, and was the true God; and whatever changes seemed to happen in the universe, they considered as mere appearances and illusions of sense. However, some learned men have supposed, that Xenophanes and his followers, speaking metaphysically, understood by the universe, or the one being, not the material world, but the originating principle of\nof all things, or the true God, whom they expressly affirm to be incorporeal. Thus Simplicius represents them as merely metaphysical writers, who distinguished between things natural and supernatural; and who made the former to be compounded of different principles. Accordingly, Xenophanes maintained, that the earth consisted of air and fire; that all things were produced out of the earth, and the sun and stars out of clouds, and that there were four elements. Parmenides also distinguished between the doctrine concerning metaphysical objects, called truth, and that concerning physical or corporeal things, called opinion; with respect to the former there was one immoveable principle, but in the latter two that were moveable, viz. fire and earth, or heat and cold; in which particulars Zeno agreed with him. The other branch of the Eleatic sect were the atomic philosophers, who formed their system from an attention to the phenomena of nature; of these the most considerable were Leucippus, Democritus, and Protagoras.\n\nELECAMPANE. See INULA, BOTANY Index.\n\nELECT, (from eligo, \"I choose\") CHOSEN, in the Scriptures, is applied to the primitive Christians, in which sense, the elect are those chosen and admitted to the favour and blessing of Christianity.\n\nElect, in some systems of theology, is a term appropriated to the saints, or the predestinated: in which sense the elect are those persons who are said to be predestinated to glory as the end, and to sanctification as the means.\n\nElect is likewise applied to archbishops, bishops, and other officers, who are chosen, but not yet consecrated, or actually invested with their office or jurisdiction.\n\nThe emperor is said to be elect before he is inaugurated and crowned; a lord-mayor is elect, before his predecessor's mayoralty is expired, or the sword is put in his hands.\n\nELECTION, the choice that is made of any thing or person, whereby it is preferred to some other. There seems this difference, however, between choice and election, that election has usually a regard to a company or community, which makes the choice; whereas choice is seldom used but when a single person makes it.\n\nELECTION, in British polity, is the people's choice of their representatives in parliament. (See PARLIAMENT.) In this consists the exercise of the democratical part of our constitution: for in a democracy there can be no exercise of sovereignty but by suffrage, which is the declaration of the people's will. In all democracies, therefore, it is of the utmost importance to regulate by whom, and in what manner, the suffrages are to be given. And the Athenians were so justly jealous of this prerogative, that a stranger, who interfered in the assemblies of the people, was punished by their laws with death; because such a man was deemed guilty of high treason, by usurping those rights of sovereignty to which he had no title. In Britain, where the people do not debate in a collective body, but by representation, the exercise of this sovereignty consists in the choice of representatives. The laws have therefore very strictly guarded against usurpation or abuse of this power, by many salutary provisions; which may be reduced to these three points,\n\n1. The qualifications of the electors.\n2. The qualifications of the elected.\n3. The proceedings at elections.\n\n(1.) As to the qualifications of the electors. The true reason of requiring any qualification, with regard to property, in voters, is to exclude such persons as are in so mean a situation, that they are esteemed to have no will of their own. If these persons had votes, they would be tempted to dispose of them under some undue influence or other. This would give a great, an artful, or a wealthy man, a larger share in elections than is consistent with general liberty. If it were probable that every man would give his vote freely, and without influence of any kind; then, upon the true theory and genuine principles of liberty, every member of the community, however poor, should have a vote in electing those delegates to whose charge is committed the disposal of his property, his liberty, and his life. But since that can hardly be expected in persons of indigent fortunes, or such as are under the immediate dominion of others, all popular states have been obliged to establish certain qualifications; whereby some, who are suspected to have no will of their own, are excluded from voting, in order to let other individuals, whose will may be supposed independent, more thoroughly upon a level with each other.\n\nAnd this constitution of suffrages is framed upon a wiser principle with us, than either of the methods of voting, by centuries, or by tribes, among the Romans. In the method by centuries, instituted by Servius Tullius, it was principally property, and not numbers, that turned the scale: in the method by tribes, gradually introduced by the tribunes of the people, numbers only were regarded, and property entirely overlooked. Hence the laws passed by the former method had usually too great a tendency to aggrandize the patricians or rich nobles; and those by the latter had too much of a levelling principle. Our constitution fleers between the two extremes. Only such are entirely excluded as can have no will of their own; there is hardly a free agent to be found, but what is intitled to a vote in some place or other in the kingdom. Nor is comparative wealth, or property, entirely disregarded in elections; for though the richest man has only one vote at one place, yet, if his property be at all diffused, he has probably a right to vote at more places than one, and therefore has many representatives. This is the spirit of our constitution; not that we assert it is in fact quite so perfect as we have endeavoured to describe it; for if any alteration might be wished or suggested in the present form of parliaments, it should be in favour of a more complete representation of the people.\n\nBut to return to the qualifications; and first those of electors for knights of the shire. 1. By statute 8 Hen. VI. c. 7, and 10 Hen. VI. c. 2. (amended by 14 Geo. III. c. 58.) the knights of the shire shall be chosen of people, whereof every man shall have freehold to the value of forty shillings by the year within the county; which (by subsequent statutes) is to be clear of all charges and deductions, except parliamentary and parochial taxes. The knights of shires are the representatives of the landholders, or landed interest of the kingdom: their electors must therefore have estates in lands or tenements within the county represented.\nElection. fented. These estates must be freehold, that is, for term of life at least; because beneficial leases for long terms of years were not in use at the making of these statutes, and copyholders were then little better than villains, absolutely dependent upon their lords. This freehold must be of 40 shillings annual value; because that sum would then, with proper industry, furnish all the necessaries of life, and render the freeholder, if he pleased, an independent man: For Bishop Fleetwood, in his Chronicon Precisum, written at the beginning of the last century, has fully proved 40 shillings in the reign of Henry VI. to have been equal to 12 pounds per annum in the reign of Queen Anne; and, as the value of money is very considerably lowered since the bishop wrote, we may fairly conclude, from this and other circumstances, that what was equivalent to 12 pounds in his days, is equivalent to 20 at present. The other less important qualifications of the electors for counties in England and Wales may be collected from the statutes cited below (a); which direct, 1. That no person under 21 years of age shall be capable of voting for any member. This extends to all sorts of members as well for boroughs as counties; as does also the next, viz. 3. That no person convicted of perjury, or subornation of perjury, shall be capable of voting in any election. 4. That no person shall vote in right of any freehold, granted to him fraudulently, to qualify him to vote. Fraudulent grants are such as contain an agreement to re-convey, or to defeat the estate granted; which agreements are made void, and the estate is absolutely vested in the person to whom it is so granted. And, to guard the better against such frauds, it is further provided, 5. That every voter shall have been in the actual possession, or receipt of the profits, of his freehold to his own use for 12 calendar months before; except it came to him by descent, marriage, marriage settlement, will, or promotion to a benefice or office. 6. That no person shall vote in respect of an annuity or rent-charge, unless registered with the clerk of the peace 12 calendar months before. 7. That in mortgaged or trust estates, the person in possession, under the above-mentioned restrictions, shall have the vote. 8. That only one person shall be admitted to vote for any one house or tenement, to prevent the splitting of freeholds. 9. That no estate shall qualify a voter, unless the estate has been affected to some land-tax aid, at least 12 months before the election. 10. That no tenant by copy of court-roll shall be permitted to vote as a freeholder. Thus much for the electors in counties.\n\nAs for the electors of citizens and burgesses, these are supposed to be the mercantile part or trading interest of this kingdom. But as trade is of a fluctuating nature, and seldom long fixed in a place, it was formerly left to the crown to summon, pro re nata, the most flourishing towns to send representatives to parliament. So that as towns increased in trade, and grew populous, they were admitted to a share in the legislature. But the misfortune is, that the deserted boroughs continued to be summoned, as well as those to whom their trade and inhabitants were transferred; except a few which petitioned to be eased of the expense, then usual, of maintaining their members: four shillings a-day being allowed for a knight of the shire, and two shillings for a citizen or burgess; which was the rate of wages established in the reign of Edward III. Hence the members for boroughs now bear above a quadruple proportion to those for counties; and the number of parliament men is increased since Fortescue's times, in the reign of Henry VI. from 300 to upwards of 500, exclusive of those for Scotland. The universities were, in general, not empowered to send burgesses to parliament; though once, in 28 Edw. I. when a parliament was summoned to consider of the king's right to Scotland, there were issued writs, which required the university of Oxford to send up four or five, and that of Cambridge two or three, of their most discreet and learned lawyers for that purpose. But it was King James I. who indulged them with the permanent privilege to send constantly two of their own body; to serve for those students who, though useful members of the community, were neither concerned in the landed nor the trading interest; and to protect in the legislature the rights of the republic of letters. The right of election in boroughs is various, depending entirely on the several charters, customs, and constitutions of the respective places; which has occasioned infinite dilutes; though now, by statute 2 Geo. II. c. 24, the right of voting for the future shall be allowed according to the last determination of the house of commons concerning it; and, by statute 3 Geo. III. c. 15, no freeman of any city or borough (other than such as claim by birth, marriage, or servitude) shall be entitled to vote therein, unless he hath been admitted to his freedom 12 calendar months before.\n\n(2.) Next, as to the qualifications of persons to be elected members of the house of commons. Some of these depend upon the law and custom of parliaments, declared by the house of commons; others upon certain statutes. And from these it appears, 1. That they must not be aliens born or minors. 2. That they must not be any of the 12 judges, because they fit in the lords' house; nor of the clergy, for they fit in the convocation; nor persons attainted of treason, or felony, for they are unfit to sit anywhere. 3. That sheriffs of counties, and mayors and bailiffs of boroughs, are not eligible in their respective jurisdictions, as being returning officers; but that sheriffs of one county are eligible to be knights of another. 4. That, in strictness, all members ought to have been inhabitants of the places for which they are chosen; but this, having been long disregarded, was at length entirely repealed by statute 14 Geo. III. c. 58. 5. That no persons concerned in the management of any duties or taxes created since 1692, except the commissioners of the treasury, nor any of the officers following (viz. commissioners of prizes, transports, sick and wounded, wine licenses, navy, and victualling; secretaries or receivers of prizes; controllers of the army accounts; agents for regiments; governors of plantations, and their\n\n(a) 7 and 8 Will. III. c. 25. 10 Ann. c. 23. 2 Geo. II. c. 21. 18 Geo. II. c. 18. 31 Geo. II. c. 14. 3 Geo. III. c. 24.\nElection. their deputies; officers of Minorca or Gibraltar; officers of the excise and customs; clerks or deputies in the several offices of the treasury, exchequer, navy, victualling, admiralty, pay of the army or navy, secretaries of state, salt, stamps, appeals, wine-licenses, hackney-coaches, hawkers, and pedlars), nor any persons that hold any new office under the crown created since 1705, are capable of being elected or fitting as members. 6. That no person having a pension under the crown during pleasure, or for any term of years, is capable of being elected or fitting. 7. That if any member accepts an office under the crown, except an officer in the army or navy accepting a new commission, his seat is void; but such member is capable of being re-elected. 8. That all knights of the shire shall be actual knights, or such notable esquires and gentlemen as have estates sufficient to be knights, and by no means of the degree of yeomen. This is reduced to a still greater certainty, by ordaining, 9. That every knight of a shire shall have a clear estate of freehold or copyhold to the value of £600 per annum, and every citizen and burgess to the value of £300; except the eldest sons of peers and of persons qualified to be knights of shires, and except the members for the two universities; which somewhat balances the ascendant which the boroughs have gained over the counties, by obliging the trading interest to make choice of landed men: and of this qualification the member must make oath, and give in the particulars in writing, at the time of his taking his seat. But, subject to these standing restrictions and disqualifications, every subject of the realm is eligible of common right: though there are instances, wherein persons in particular circumstances have forfeited that common right, and have been declared ineligible for that parliament, by a vote of the house of commons, or for ever, by an act of the legislature. But it was an unconstitutional prohibition, which was grounded on an ordinance of the house of lords, and inserted in the king's writs, for the parliament held at Coventry, 6 Hen. IV. that no apprentice or other man of the law should be elected a knight for the shire therein; in return for which, our lawbooks and historians have branded this parliament with the name of parliamentum indocilem, or the lack-learning parliament; and Sir Edward Coke observes with some spleen, that there was never a good law made thereat.\n\n(3.) The third point, regarding elections, is the method of proceeding therein. This is also regulated by the law of parliament, and the several statutes referred to in the margin below (b); all which we shall blend together, and extract out of them a summary account of the method of proceeding to elections.\n\nAs soon as the parliament is summoned, the lord chancellor (or if a vacancy happens during the sitting of parliament, the speaker, by order of the house, and without such order if a vacancy happens by death in the time of a recess for upwards of 20 days) sends his warrant to the clerk of the crown in chancery; who thereupon issues out writs to the sheriff of every county, for the election of all the members to serve for that county, and every city and borough therein. Within three days after the receipt of this writ, the sheriff is to send his precept, under his seal, to the proper returning officers of the cities and boroughs, commanding them to elect their members; and the said returning officers are to proceed to election within eight days from the receipt of the precept, giving four days notice of the same; and to return the persons chosen, together with the precept, to the sheriff.\n\nBut elections of knights of the shire must be proceeded to by the sheriffs themselves in person, at the next county-court that shall happen after the delivery of the writ. The county court is a court held every month or oftener by the sheriff, intended to try little causes not exceeding the value of 40s. in what part of the county he pleases to appoint for that purpose: but for the election of knights of the shire, it must be held at the most usual place. If the county-court falls upon the day of delivering the writ, or within six days after, the sheriff may adjourn the court and election to some other convenient time, not longer than 16 days, nor shorter than 10: but he cannot alter the place, without the consent of all the candidates; and, in all such cases, 10 days public notice must be given of the time and place of the election.\n\nAnd, as it is essential to the very being of parliament that elections should be absolutely free, therefore all undue influences upon the electors are illegal, and strongly prohibited. For Mr Locke ranks it among those breaches of trust in the executive magistrate, which, according to his notions, amount to a dissolution of the government, \"if he employs the force, treasure, and offices of the society to corrupt the representatives, or openly to pre-engage the electors, and prescribe what manner of persons shall be chosen: For thus to regulate candidates and electors, and new-model the ways of election, what is it (says he) but to cut up the government by the roots and poison the very fountain of public security?\" As soon, therefore, as the time and place of election, either in counties or boroughs, are fixed, all soldiers quartered in the place are to remove, at least one day before the election, to the distance of two miles or more; and not to return till one day after the poll is ended. Riots likewise have been frequently determined to make an election void. By vote also of the house of commons, to whom alone belongs the power of determining contested elections, no lord of parliament, or lord-lieutenant of a county, hath any right to interfere in the election of commoners; and, by statute, the lord warden of the cinque-ports shall not recommend any members there. If any officer of the excise, customs, stamps, or certain other branches of the revenue, presume to intermeddle in elections, by persuading any voter or diffusing him, he forfeits 100l. and is disabled to hold any office.\n\nThus\n\n(b) 7 Hen.

III. c. 15.\nThus are the electors of one branch of the legislature secured from any undue influence from either of the other two, and from all external violence and compulsion. But the greatest danger is that in which themselves co-operate, by the infamous practice of bribery and corruption. To prevent which it is enacted, that no candidate shall, after the date (usually called the tele) of the writs, or after the vacancy, give any money or entertainment to his electors, or promise to give any, either to particular persons, or to the place in general, in order to his being elected; on pain of being incapable to serve for that place in parliament. And if any money, gift, office, employment, or reward be given, or promised to be given, to any voter, at any time, in order to influence him to give or withhold his vote, as well he that takes as he that offers such bribe forfeits 500l. and is for ever disabled from voting and holding any office in any corporation; unless, before conviction, he will discover some other offender of the same kind, and then he is indemnified for his own offence. The first instance that occurs of election bribery, was so early as 13 Eliz. when one Thomas Longe (being a simple man, and of small capacity to serve in parliament) acknowledged that he had given the returning officer and others of the borough for which he was chosen four pounds to be returned member, and was for that premium elected. But for this offence the borough was amerced, the member was removed, and the officer fined and imprisoned. But as this practice hath since taken much deeper and more universal root, it hath occasioned the making of these wholesome statutes; to complete the efficacy of which, there is nothing wanting but resolution and integrity to put them in strict execution.\n\nUndue influence being thus guarded against, the election is to be proceeded to on the day appointed; the sheriff or other returning officer first taking an oath against bribery, and for the due execution of his office. The candidates likewise, if required, must swear to their qualification, and the electors in counties to theirs; and the electors both in counties and boroughs are also compelled to take the oath of abjuration, and that against bribery and corruption. And it might not be amiss, if the members elected were bound to take the latter oath as well as the former; which, in all probability, would be much more effectual than administering it only to the electors.\n\nThe election being closed, the returning officer in boroughs returns his precept to the sheriff, with the persons elected by the majority; and the sheriff returns the whole, together with the writ for the county and the knights elected thereupon, to the clerk of the crown in chancery; before the day of meeting, if it be a new parliament, or within 14 days after the election, if it be an occasional vacancy; and this under penalty of 500l. If the sheriff does not return such knights only as are duly elected, he forfeits, by the old statutes of Henry VI. 100l.; and the returning officer in boroughs, for a like false return, 40l.; and they are besides liable to an action, in which double damages shall be recovered, by the later statutes of King William: and any person bribing the returning officer shall also forfeit 300l. But the members returned by him are the fitting members, until the house of commons, upon petition, shall adjudge the return to be false and illegal. The form and manner of proceeding upon such petition are now regulated by statute 1 Geo. III. c. 16. (amended by 11 Geo. III. c. 42. and made perpetual by 14 Geo. III. c. 15.), which directs the method of choosing by lot a select committee of 15 members, who are sworn well and truly to try the same, and a true judgment to give, according to the evidence.\n\nElection of Scots Peers.

And if any persons of such societies resign their places to others for reward, they incur a forfeiture of double the sum; and both the parties are rendered incapable of the place.

See Liberty.\n\nElection, in Theology, signifies the choice which God, of his good pleasure, makes of angels or men, for the objects of mercy and grace.\n\nThe election of the Jews was the choice God made of that people to be more immediately attached to his worship and service, and for the Messiah to be born of them. And thus particular nations were elected to the participation of the outward blessings of Christianity.\n\nElection also, in the language of some divines, signifies a predetermination to grace and glory, and sometimes to glory only. And it has been enjoined as an article of faith, that predetermination to grace is gratuitous, merely and simply so; gratia, quia gratis data. But the divines are much divided as to the point, whether election to glory be gratuitous, or whether it supposes obedience and good works, i.e. whether it be before or after the provision of our obedience.

Municipal offices in England are generally elective; in Spain, venal. Poland is an elective kingdom.\n\nElective Attraction. See Chemistry Index.\n\nElector, a person who has a right to elect or choose another to an office, honour, &c. See Election.\n\nElector is particularly, and by way of eminence, applied to those princes of Germany in whom lies the right of electing the emperor; being all sovereign princes, and the principal members of the empire.\n\nThe electoral college, consisting of all the electors of the empire, is the most illustrious and august body in Europe. Bellarmine and Baronius attribute the institution of it to Pope Gregory V. and the emperor O-\nElector. tho III. in the tenth century; of which opinion are the generality of historians, and particularly the canonists: however, the number of electors was unsettled, at least, till the 13th century. In 1356 Charles IV., by the golden bull, fixed the number of electors to seven; three ecclesiastics, viz. the archbishops of Mentz, Treves, and Cologne; and four secular, viz. the king of Bohemia, count Palatine of the Rhine, duke of Saxony, and marquis of Brandenburg. In 1648 this order was changed, the duke of Bavaria being put in the place of the count Palatine, who having accepted the crown of Bohemia was outlawed by the emperor; but being at length restored, an eighth electorate was erected for the duke of Bavaria. In 1692, a ninth electorate was created, by the emperor Leopold, in favour of the duke of Hanover, of the house of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\n\nThere is this difference between the secular and ecclesiastical electors, that the first have an active and passive voice, that is, may choose and be chosen; the last, an active only. The three archbishops are to be 30 years old before they can be advanced to the dignity; the seculars 18, before they can perform the office themselves. These last have each their vicars, who officiate in their absence.\n\nBesides the power of choosing an emperor, the electors have also that of capitulating with and deposing him; so that, if there be one suffrage wanting, a protest may be entered against the proceedings. By the right of capitulation, they attribute to themselves great privileges, as making of war, coining, and taking care of the public interest and security of the states; and the emperor promises, upon oath, to receive the empire upon these conditions.\n\nThe electors have precedence of all other princes of the empire, even of cardinals and kings; and are addressed under the title of electoral highnesses.\n\nTheir several functions are as follow. The elector of Mentz is chancellor of Germany, convokes the states, and gives his vote before any of the rest. The elector of Cologne is grand chancellor of Italy, and consecrates the emperor. The elector of Treves is chancellor of the Gauls, and confers imposition of hands upon the emperor. The count Palatine of the Rhine is great treasurer of the empire, and presents the emperor with a globe at his coronation. The elector of Bavaria is great master of the imperial palace, and carries the golden apple. The marquis of Brandenburg is grand-chamberlain, and puts the ring on the emperor's finger. The elector of Saxony is grand marshal, and gives the sword to the emperor. The king of Bohemia is grand butler, and puts Charlemagne's crown on the emperor's head. Lastly, the elector of Hanover, now king of Great Britain, is arch-treasurer, though first erected under the title of standard-bearer of the empire.\n\nELECTORATE, a term used as well to signify the dignity of, as the territories belonging to, any of the electors of Germany; such are Bavaria, Saxony, &c. See ELECTOR.\n\nELECTRIC, derived from ἐλεκτρόν, \"amber,\" in physics, is a term applied to those substances, in which the electric fluid is capable of being excited, and accumulated without transmitting it, and therefore called non-conductors. See ELECTRICITY.\n\nELECTRICITY.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nGeneral Principles.\n\nWHEN a glass tube of considerable size, perfectly clean and dry, is rubbed briskly with a dry hand, and immediately held over small pieces of paper, straws, feathers, or other light bodies, it will attract them, and after retaining them in contact with it for some time, repel them; and this attraction and repulsion will be alternately repeated several times.\n\nIf after rubbing the tube, the knuckle be presented to the closed end, a snapping noise will be heard, and the finger will receive a slight shock. When this experiment is made in the dark, a luminous spark will appear at the moment the snap is heard, between the finger and the tube.\n\nMany other substances possess the property of attracting light bodies and emitting sparks, when rubbed with certain other substances, as amber, sealing-wax, rosin, &c. As amber was first observed to possess\n\n(A) The attracting power of amber when rubbed, is said to have been known to Thales the Milesian philosopher, 600 years before Christ.\nGeneral principles from this a portion of the electric power, and are thus made capable of producing the same appearance as the electric. Thus if a metallic rod or wire pointed at one end and rounded at the other, be attached by the pointed extremity to an excited electric, or even placed very near this, the rounded extremity will attract light bodies, and emit sparks. As these substances are found to convey or conduct the electric power to any distance in proportion to their length, they are called conductors.\n\nIt is found that all bodies in nature are either electrics or conductors. Neither of these classes of bodies are, however, perfect electrics or conductors, as there are few electrics which may not under some circumstances be made to act as conductors, and on the other hand, many conductors may be so far excited as to become in some measure electrics per se (b). The following table exhibits the electrics and conductors arranged according to their degree of electrical or conducting power.\n\n**Electrics.**\n\n- Glass and all vitrifications, even the metallic vitrifications.\n- All precious stones, of which the most transparent are the best.\n- Amber.\n- Sulphur.\n- All resinous substances.\n- Wax.\n- Silk.\n- Cotton.\n- Several dry and external animal substances, as feathers, wool, hair, &c.\n- Paper.\n- White sugar, and sugar-candy.\n- Air, and other permanently elastic fluids.\n- Oils.\n- Dry and complete oxides of metallic substances.\n- The ashes of animal and vegetable substances.\n- Dry vegetable substances.\n- Most hard stones, of which the hardest are the best.\n\n**Conductors.**\n\n- Gold.\n- Silver.\n- Copper.\n- Platina.\n- Brasses.\n- Iron.\n- Tin.\n- Quicksilver.\n- Lead.\n- Semi-metals, more or less.\n- Metallic ores, more or less.\n- Charcoal, either of animal or of vegetable substances.\n- The fluids of an animal body.\n- Water (especially salt water), and all fluids, excepting the aerial, and oils.\n- The effluvia of flaming bodies.\n- Congealed water, viz. ice or snow.\n- Most saline substances, of which the metallic salts are the best.\n- Several earthy or stony substances.\n- Smoke.\n- The vapour of hot water.\n- Electricity pervades also such a vacuum, or absence of air, as is caused by the best air-pump; but not the perfect absence of air, or the torricellian vacuum, formed by boiling the quicksilver in a barometer tube.\n\nMany of the substances given in the above table are found to change their nature under certain circumstances. Thus, among the electrics, glass heated to redness, melted resins, baked wood when very hot, and heated air, are tolerably good conductors; and glass, which is usually the best electric, is sometimes from causes which have not been well ascertained a very bad electric. The excitability of glass vessels is found to differ according to the degree of rarefaction of the included air; when this is rarefied as much as possible, the external surface of the vessel cannot be excited, while the internal surface exhibits strong marks of electric power; but when the included air is considerably condensed, the internal surface shows no marks of electric power, while the external is much more excitable than usual.\n\nAmong the conductors, the conducting power of charcoal varies in proportion to the degree of heat to which it has been exposed in the making, as, when imperfectly burned, it is a bad conductor. Indeed it is worth remarking here, that wood is capable of being made an electric or a conductor several times alternately according to its state. When fresh cut, it is a good conductor; thoroughly dried by baking, it becomes, as we have seen an electric; burned to charcoal, it is again a conductor; but when reduced to ashes, it is once more made an electric.\n\nIce (c) is placed among the conductors: but in an experiment of M. Acharde, it appeared that when distilled water was gradually frozen, so that one side of the vessel retained its fluid, and therefore permitted the air to escape, the ice thus produced would not conduct, but on the contrary became a very good electric, and was employed as such. Snow is a much worse conductor than ice. Water is a conductor, and so are the secondary salts; it is found that when water is impregnated with a salt, its conducting power is much increased.\n\nWe have, after Mr Cavallo, placed the salts among conductors; but in strict propriety, this conducting power must be confined to salts in the state of crystals, as it has been proved by decisive experiments, that salts,\n\n(b) The difference between electrics and conductors was first observed by Mr Stephen Grey in 1759, but the terms conductor and electric per se, were first employed in this present sense by Dr Defaguliers.\n\n(c) The conducting power of common ice was first shown by M. Jallabert, professor of philosophy at Geneva; there seem, however, to have been various opinions respecting this fact till it was fully ascertained by Dr Priestley. Vid. Priestley's History of Electricity, Part viii. sect. 4.\nGeneral salts, when deprived of their water of crystallization, become non-conductors. The conducting power of crystallized salts is therefore probably owing to the water which they contain.\n\nElectricities are called non-conductors, as they do not readily transmit electric power; they may hence be employed to check the passage of this power, or to confine its influence. When a body communicates with a conducting substance, as the earth, a table, the human body, &c., the electric power easily passes off; but when it is supported by an electric, the power may be retained for a considerable time. In this latter case the body is said to be inflamed.\n\nWe have seen (1, 3), that fire or light appears to issue from an excited electric; and, this appearance is stronger in proportion to the size of the electric, and the degree of friction which it has undergone. When a rounded body, as the knuckle or a metallic ball, is presented to the excited electric, the fire appears to dart from it in a spark; but if the presented body be pointed, the fire will appear to issue in a stream composed of luminous rays. These rays will take a different direction, according to the substance with which the electric is rubbed, and other circumstances which will be explained hereafter. In the case of the glass tube rubbed with the hand, when a pointed body, as a needle, or wire, is presented to the tube, the luminous rays will appear like a star around the point. The same appearance will take place on presenting a point to a stick of sealing-wax rubbed with any metallic body, as a piece of tin foil; but when the sealing-wax is rubbed with a piece of woollen cloth, the rays will appear to issue from the point in a pencil diverging towards the wax. In some experiments which will afterwards be described, the stream of fire appears in an evident current in a direction from the electric in some cases, as in the tube excited as above, and towards the electric in others, as in the wax rubbed with the woollen cloth.\n\nPositive and negative electricity, when glass is rubbed with most substances, positive electricity is excited, and negative when resinous bodies are rubbed with most substances, the former is often called vitreous, and the latter resinous electricity.\n\nThe difference of these two states of the electric power may be further illustrated by the following simple experiment.\n\nLet a piece of glass (A, B, fig. 1.) be fixed in a wooden pedestal C. Through the upper extremity A, pass a wire A, D, with a rounded end at D, and from this end suspend two very fine silk threads a, b. These threads in the usual state of the instrument will hang in the parallel position a, b, but if the end of the wire to which they are attached be presented to the excited tube, the threads will diverge from each other, and take a position as at c, d. If in this diverging state they are presented to an excited stick of sealing-wax, they will collapse into their original position. Again, the threads presented first to the excited sealing-wax will diverge, but presented in this state to the excited tube will collapse, thus showing that these two states are opposite to each other, each destroying the effect produced by the other.\n\nThe following table shows what kind of electricity will be excited by rubbing various electrics with different bodies.\n\n| Substance          | Positive | Negative |\n|--------------------|----------|----------|\n| Every substance    |          |          |\n| with which         |          |          |\n| it has been        |          |          |\n| hitherto tried     |          |          |\n| Smooth glass       | Positive |          |\n| Rough glass        | Positive |          |\n| Tourmalin          | Positive |          |\n| Hare's skin        | Positive |          |\n| White silk         | Positive |          |\n| Black silk         | Positive |          |\n| Sealing-wax        | Positive |          |\n| Baked wood         | Positive |          |\n\nIt appears from (3) that the power of producing electrified electrical appearances may be communicated from any bodies excited electric to a conductor. The more perfect the conductor, the more easily does it receive the electric power. Electrics may also be made to receive this power from excited electrics, but it is communicated to these with more difficulty than to conductors. When any body, whether electric or conductor, is made to exhibit electrical phenomena, either by being excited, or by communication, it is said to be electrified.\nPART I.\n\nOF THE GENERAL PHENOMENA OF EXCITED ELECTRICITY.\n\nWHEN an electric is once excited, it will retain the electric power for a longer or shorter time according to its situation and nature. If it communicates freely with conductors, it will lose it sooner in proportion as these are more perfect; but if it be inflected, it will continue in an electrified state for a considerable time.\n\nElectrics may be excited in various modes; the greatest number of them by friction, as glass, precious stones, silk, sulphur, sealing-wax, amber, &c.; some by melting, and being allowed to cool, as sulphur, wax; or simply by heating and cooling, as the tourmaline. We shall here give an account of the general appearances exhibited by the principal electrics when excited in these several modes.\n\nFriction, as we have observed, is the most usual method of exciting electrics. These may be rubbed either by other electrics, or by conductors, but in some cases they are best excited by being rubbed with the most perfect conductors. Thus glass rubbed with silk, exhibits signs of electricity, but these are much stronger if the silk be covered with some metallic substance, as an amalgam of zinc. Dust or moisture is found very much to diminish the excitability of electrics; but oil, or any fat substance increases it. The appearances shown by electrics excited by friction, differ somewhat according to the nature of the electric, and the substance employed as a rubber; we shall describe the most remarkable of them, as they will serve hereafter to illustrate and explain the experiments which are to be introduced in the following parts of this article.\n\nCHAP. I. Of the Phenomena produced by excited glass.\n\nDr William Gilbert, a native of Colchester in Essex, and a physician in London, who published in the year 1600 a valuable treatise \"De Magnete,\" was the first, we believe, who observed the electrical property of glass when rubbed; but he discovered little more than that like amber it attracted and repelled light bodies. He found that the most transparent glass was the best electric. In the beginning of the eighteenth century, Mr Hawkesbee, to whom electricity is indebted for many improvements, made the first rational experiments on the electric power of glass. He contrived to fix a hollow globe of glass in a wooden frame, so that it could be whirled round while he rubbed it by applying his dry hand to the surface. He observed that when the air within the globe was considerably rarefied, a strong light appeared in the inside on applying his hand to the globe, and when the air was restored to its natural density, a light appeared also on the outside, appearing as if sticking to his fingers or other bodies held near the globe.\n\nHaving exhausted another globe of glass, he observed, that on bringing this near his excited globe, a light appeared within the former, and became very brilliant if the exhausted globe was kept in motion, but died away in a short time if it was suffered to remain at rest.\n\nHe coated more than half of the inside of a globe with sealing-wax of various thicknesses, and after exhausting the globe, he set it in motion. On applying his hand as a rubber, he was surprised to see the exact shape of his hand appearing on the concave surface of the wax, and that even where the coating of wax was interposed between his hand and the opposite side, though the wax was in some places an eighth of an inch in thickness.\n\nPitch or common sulphur melted answered as well as wax, but he could not produce these appearances by using melted flowers of sulphur. When he employed a very thick coating of common sulphur, he observed that there was a much greater light within the globe; but he could not so easily distinguish the figure of his hands.\n\nOn admitting a small quantity of air into the globe, the light diminished, and on the coating of sealing wax it entirely disappeared. While the globe continued exhausted, the coated part of it showed some attraction for light bodies, but if there was no wax, the globe would not attract at all; on admitting the air, the power of mechanical attraction was greater on the coated than on the uncoated part.\n\nGlass in any form is capable of excitation, but it is more easy, as well as more convenient, to employ a vessel or plate of glass than a solid rod or mass of that substance; and the thinner the vessel or plate is, the more easily it is excited. When a tube, plate, or vessel of glass is excited, it is found that one side is electrified positively and the other negatively. Both smooth and rough glass may be employed to produce electrical phenomena, but they require different rubbers. The best rubber for smooth glass is black oiled silk spread with an amalgam of zinc, made in the proportion of four or five parts of mercury to one of zinc. The best rubber for rough glass is soft new flannel. The amalgam of zinc may be most conveniently made in the following manner. Place the zinc over the fire in an iron ladle; and when the ladle is red hot, put a small quantity of tallow or suet on the zinc, which will immediately melt. It is best not to allow the zinc to melt without the addition of some fatty matter, as this metal is very easily oxidized or calcined, and thus a great part of it would be rendered unfit for the required purpose; this inconvenience is prevented by the fat which covers the surface of the melted metal, and protects it from the action of the air. When the zinc is melted, add the mercury, previously heated to the degree of boiling water; stir the mixture a little, and allow it to cool. Lastly, rub it well in a glass mortar, so as to unite the fat with it, which will prevent it from becoming hard by keeping, and will also preserve it longer from oxidation.\n\nMr Canton, who was the first person that employed an amalgam to increase the effect of friction on glass tubes,\nChap. I.\n\nELECTRICITY.\n\nGeneral Phenomena.\n\nIt had been observed by Mr Hawkesbee, that on shaking mercury in a glass vessel, in the dark, a considerable light was produced, and that this was much more remarkable when the air in the vessel was considerably rarefied. He called the light which he conceived to be emitted from the mercury, mercurial phosphorus.\n\nMr Cavallo found that, by shaking mercury in a glass tube hermetically sealed, and in which the air was pretty much rarefied, the tube was sensibly electrified on the outside; but the electricity produced was not constant, nor in proportion to the agitation. From this observation he was led to make some experiments, the results of which are very curious.\n\nHe prepared several tubes such as are represented at fig. 2, Plate CLXXXVII., about 3 inches long, and with glass tubes.\n\nThey were closed at one end, and contained each three fourths of an ounce of mercury, which being made to boil, the air within the tube was rarefied and the open end was then hermetically sealed. Having made the tube clean and a little warm, he caused the mercury to flow from the one end to the other, by gently elevating and depressing either end, alternately, while the tube was held nearly in a horizontal position. The tube was thus rendered electrical, so that the end where the mercury stood was electrified positively (p) and all the remaining part of the tube negatively. If the mercury was made to flow from the positive end to the negative, by elevating the former, the end to which it flowed became positive, while the rest of the tube acquired a negative electricity; but if in elevating the positive end where the mercury stood, that end were not touched with the hand, it became negative only in a slight degree, and if the mercury was made to flow back to it, and again retire from it, still without touching it, it became positive; whereas by touching it while elevating it, it was rendered strongly negative. The electric power was always strongest at the positive end. The electric power at either end was made much more apparent by coating each end for about two inches with tin foil, as represented in the figure, so that the tubes would sometimes emit sparks on being brought near a conductor.\n\nWe have seen (6) that when an electric is once excited, it retains the electric power for some time. Glass is one of the most remarkable electrics in this respect.\n\nMr Canton procured some very thin glass balls, about an inch and a half in diameter, with slender tubular stems of eight or nine inches in length. He electrified these balls in the inside, or semi-positive, and then sealed the stems hermetically. On examining them after some time, he found that they showed no signs of electricity; but on holding them at a small distance from the fire, they became strongly electrical, and still more so as they cooled. On repeatedly heating them, he found that the electric power diminished, but it was not impaired by keeping them for a week under water. One of them which he had heated several times before immersing it in water, and again several times after lying for a week in water, still retained a considerable degree of electric power at the end of above a month; and even at the end of six years they had not entirely lost it.\n\nMr Henley having electrified a small bottle, observed that it showed signs of electricity seventy days after, though it had stood all that time in a cupboard.\n\nOn the 5th February he excited a glass cylinder; and from that time till the 10th of March following, various methods were employed to destroy its electricity. These always succeeded at the time, and the cylinder lost all signs of electricity; but these signs returned again without any fresh excitation, and on the 10th of March the cylinder still retained considerable electric power. The marks of electricity sometimes became stronger or weaker, or even quite disappeared and returned without any evident cause. The electricity was generally strongest when the wind was northerly, or when it had returned after having been destroyed by flame; it was generally weakest when there was a fire in the room where it was kept, or when the door was left open. He repeated the excitation, but not always with the same success; for some times the cylinder would lose all signs of electricity in a fortnight, and at others in twelve hours, till it was again excited.\n\n*Phil. Trans. lxvii.\n\nChap. II. Of the Phenomena produced by excited Silk.\n\nSilk was first discovered to be an electric in the year 1729 by Mr Stephen Grey, while making experiments with his friend Mr Wheeler. These gentlemen attempted to conduct the electric power to a great distance by means of silk lines, as Mr Grey had done before by means of packthread; but they were disappointed, as they found that the silk refused to conduct.\n\n(d) The method of distinguishing between positive and negative electricity will be more fully explained hereafter, as well as the modes in which either may be produced at pleasure. But it may be proper here to show a simple mode of distinguishing these two states of the electric power, which may be done by means of the instrument described in (8). The electricity shown by excited polished glass was said to be positive; and it appeared that the threads of the instrument separated when brought near an excited tube, as also when brought near excited sealing wax, the electricity of which is negative. If, therefore, when the threads are made to diverge by excited glass, they diverge still farther, or remain stationary on being made to approach any other electrified body, the electricity of this last is positive; but if they collapse, it is negative. Again if the threads, when made to diverge by excited sealing wax, diverge still farther, or remain stationary on being made to approach another electrified body, the electricity of this is negative; but if they collapse, it is positive.\nGeneral but seemed rather to retain the electric power; no experiments of any consequence were however made on this subject, till 1759, when Mr Symmer presented to the Royal Society a series of observations which he had made on silk stockings.\n\nHe had been accustomed to wear two pairs of silk stockings; a black and a white. When these were put off both together, no signs of electricity appeared; but on pulling off the black ones from the white, he heard a snapping or cracking noise, and in the dark perceived sparks of fire between them. To produce this and the following appearances in great perfection, it was only necessary to draw his hand several times backward and forward over his leg with the stocking upon it.\n\nWhen the stockings were separated and held at a distance from each other, both of them appeared to be highly excited; the white stocking positively, and the black negatively. While they were kept at a distance from each other, both of them appeared inflated to such a degree, that they exhibited the entire shape of the leg. When two black or two white stockings were held in one hand, they would repel one another with considerable force, making an angle seemingly of 30 or 35 degrees. When a white and black stocking were presented to each other, they were mutually attracted; and if permitted, would rush together with surprising violence. As they approached, the inflation gradually subsided, and their attraction of foreign objects diminished, but their attraction of one another increased; when they actually met, they became flat, and joined close together like as many folds of silk. When separated again, their electric virtue did not seem to be in the least impaired for having once met; and the same appearances would be exhibited by them for a considerable time. When the experiment was made with two black stockings in one hand, and two white ones in the other, they were thrown into a strange agitation, owing to the attraction between those of different colours, and the repulsion between those of the same colour. This mixture of attractions and repulsions made the stockings catch at each other at greater distances than otherwise they would have done, and afforded a very curious spectacle.\n\nWhen the stockings were suffered to meet; they stuck together with considerable force. At first Mr Symmer found they required from one to 12 ounces to separate them. Another time they raised 17 ounces, which was 20 times the weight of the stocking that supported them; and this in a direction parallel to its surface. When one of the stockings was turned inside out, and put within the other, it required 20 ounces to separate them; though at that time ten ounces were sufficient when applied externally. Getting the black stockings new dyed, and the white ones washed, and whitened in the fumes of sulphur, and then putting them one within the other, with the rough sides together, it required three pounds three ounces to separate them. With stockings of a more substantial make, the cohesion was still greater. When the white stocking was put within the black one, so that the outside of the white was contiguous to the inside of the black, they raised nine pounds wanting a few ounces; and when the two rough surfaces were contiguous, they raised 15 pounds one pennyweight and a half. Cutting off the ends of the thread and the tufts of silk which had been left in the inside of the stockings, was found to be very unfavourable to these experiments.\n\nMr Symmer also observed, that pieces of white and black silk, when highly electrified, not only cohered with each other, but would also adhere to bodies with broad and even polished surfaces, though these bodies were not electrified. This he discovered accidentally; having, without design, thrown a stocking out of his hand, which stuck to the paper-hangings of the room. He repeated the experiment, and found it would continue hanging near an hour. Having stuck up the black and white stockings in this manner, he came with another pair highly electrified; and applying the white to the black, and the black to the white, he carried them off from the wall, each of them hanging to that which had been brought to it. The same experiments held with the painted boards of the room, and likewise with the looking-glass, to the smooth surface of which both the white and the black silk appeared to adhere more tenaciously than to either of the former.\n\nSimilar experiments, but with a greater variety of circumstances, were afterwards made by Mr Cigna on Turin, upon white and black ribbons. He took two white silk ribbons just dried at the fire, and extended them upon a smooth plain, whether a conducting or electric substance was a matter of indifference. He then drew over them the sharp edge of an ivory ruler, and found that both ribbons had acquired electricity enough to adhere to the plain; though while they continued there, they showed no other sign of it. When taken up separately, they were both negatively electrified, and would repel each other. In their separation, electric sparks were perceived between them; but when again put on the plain, or forced together, no light was perceived without another friction. When by the operation just now mentioned they had acquired the negative electricity, if they were placed, not upon the smooth body on which they had been rubbed, but on a rough conducting substance, they would, on their separation, show contrary electricities, which would again disappear on their being joined together. If they had been made to repel each other, and were afterwards forced together, and placed on the rough surface above mentioned, they would in a few minutes be mutually attracted; the lowermost being positively and the uppermost negatively electrified.\n\nIf the two white ribbons received their friction upon the rough surface, they always acquired contrary electricities. The upper one was negatively, and the lower one positively electrified, in whatever manner they were taken off. The same change was instantaneously produced by any pointed conductor. If two ribbons, for instance, were made to repel, and the point of a needle drawn opposite to one of them along its whole length, they would immediately rush together.\n\nThe same means which produced a change of electricity in a ribbon already electrified, would communicate electricity to one which had not as yet received it; viz. laying the unelectrified ribbon upon a rough surface, and putting the other upon it; or by holding it parallel to an electrified ribbon, and presenting a pointed\nGeneral pointed conductor to it. He placed a ribbon that was not quite dry under another that was well dried at the fire, upon a smooth plain; and when he had given them the usual friction with his ruler, he found, that in what manner forever they were removed from the plain, the upper one was negatively and the lower one positively electrified.—If both ribbons were black, all these experiments succeeded in the same manner as with the white. If, instead of the ivory ruler, he made use of any skin, or a piece of smooth glass, the event was the same; but if he made use of a stick of sulphur, the electricities were in all cases the reverse of what they had been, before the ribbons were rubbed, having always acquired the positive electricity. When he rubbed them with paper either gilt or not gilt, the results were uncertain. When the ribbons were wrapped in paper gilt or not gilt, and the friction was made upon the paper laid on the plain above mentioned, the ribbons acquired both of them the negative electricity. If the ribbons were one black and the other white, whichever of them was laid uppermost, and in whatever manner the friction was made, the black generally acquired the negative and the white the positive electricity.\n\nHe also observed, that when the texture of the upper piece of silk was loose, yielding, and retiform like that of a flocking, so that it could move and be rubbed against the lower one, and the rubber was of such a nature as could communicate but little electricity to glass, the electricity which the upper piece of silk acquired did not depend upon the rubber, but upon the body on which it was laid. In this case, the black was always negative and the white positive. But when the silk was hard, rigid, and of a close texture, and the rubber of such a nature as would have imparted a great degree of electricity to glass, the electricity of the upper piece depended on the rubber. Thus, a white silk flocking rubbed with gilt paper upon glass became negatively, and the glass positively, electrified. But if a piece of silk of a firmer texture was laid upon a plate of glass, it was always electrified positively, and the glass negatively, if it was rubbed with sulphur, and for the most part if it was rubbed with gilt paper.\n\nIf an electrified ribbon was brought near an insulated plate of lead, it was attracted, but very feebly. On bringing the finger near the lead, a spark was observed between them, the ribbon was vigorously attracted, and both together showed no signs of electricity. On the separation of the ribbon, they were again electrified, and a spark was perceived between the plate and the finger.\n\nWhen a number of ribbons of the same colour were laid upon a smooth conducting substance, and the ruler was drawn over them, he found, that when they were taken up singly, each of them gave sparks at the place where it was separated from the other, as did also the last one with the conductor; and all of them were negatively electrified. If they were all taken from the plate together, they cohered in one mass, which was negatively electrified on both sides. If they were laid upon the rough conductor, and then separated singly, beginning with the lowermost, sparks appeared as before, but all the ribbons were electrified positively, except the uppermost.—If they received the friction upon the rough conductor, and were all taken up at once, all the intermediate ribbons acquired the electricity, either of the highest or lowest, according as the separation was begun with the highest or the lowest. If two ribbons were separated from the bundle at the same time, they clung together, and in that state showed no sign of electricity, as one of them alone would have done. When they were separated, the outermost one had acquired an electricity opposite to that of the bundle, but much weaker.\n\nA number of ribbons were placed upon a plate of metal to which electricity was communicated by means of a glass globe, and a pointed conductor held to the other side of the ribbons. The consequence was, that all of them became possessed of the electricity opposite to that of the plate, or of the same, according as they were taken off; except the most remote, which always kept an electricity opposite to that of the plate.\n\n* Mem. of the Acad. of Turin, for 1763.\n\nChap. III. Of the Phenomena produced by excited Paper.\n\n1. When a single leaf of writing paper, after being warmed, is laid on a table, and rubbed briskly with a piece of caoutchouc (elastic gum or India rubber) it becomes strongly electrical; on attempting to remove it from the table, it is found to adhere as if it were beamed with some gluey substance; and if, before it is quite separated, it be suffered to return to the table, it will fly back with considerable force, and will adhere almost as strongly as at first.\n\n2. On separating it from the table immediately after rubbing, it will be strongly attracted by the table or any substance presented to it, and remain in contact for a considerable time.\n\n3. When the knuckle is presented to the paper on its being first taken from the table, a snapping noise is heard, which is more perceptible if the knuckle be made to pass successively over different parts of the paper. If this experiment is made in the dark, sparks will be seen to accompany the snapping noise.\n\n4. On employing a double piece, or two pieces of paper, these appearances will be increased. On attempting to separate the two pieces of paper, they are found to adhere strongly together, and their separation is accompanied with a crackling noise, similar to that produced by the application of the knuckle but not so loud. When quite separated, on being brought again within some inches of each other they are strongly and mutually attracted, and if, while separated, one of them be held between the other, and some contiguous substance, it will be alternately attracted by that substance, and the other piece, according as it is nearer the one or the other.\n\n5. Placing a piece of clean new flannel between the paper and the table, or between the folds of the paper, does not appear to diminish the electrical appearances produced; but rubbing the paper with flannel produces no remarkable signs of electricity.\n\n6. It is not necessary that the paper be rubbed on a table to produce these appearances; a book will answer as well, but with this difference, that if the book be in boards, the paper will produce no crackling when the knuckle is applied to it; but when the paper is double,\nGeneral the separation of the folds will be attended with the same crackling as before; whereas when the book is bound in leather, a fling sheet when rubbed will produce the crackling on the application of the knuckle, while the double piece will produce it only when its folds are separated. The adhesion of the paper to the books is in both cases much lighter than its adhesion to the table, and in the case of the book in boards it is scarcely perceptible.\n\n7. White paper of all kinds seems capable of producing these appearances, when rubbed with caoutchouc; but blotting paper whether white or red produces them in a very inferior degree, probably on account of the weakness of its texture not allowing it to be rubbed with sufficient force.\n\nIn general, the flouter the texture of the paper, the stronger will be the sparks and the attraction.\n\n8. Paper does not appear to retain its electricity for any great length of time; in general, it ceases to show any remarkable signs of electric power about 10 or 15 minutes after being excited.\n\n9. Other substances besides caoutchouc may be employed as rubbers for the excitation of paper, especially the dry hand, but none succeed so well as caoutchouc.\n\nThe electric property of paper was first discovered by Mr Grey. The paper employed by him was the kind called white pressing paper, which is of the same nature with card paper. Not only did this paper, when made as hot as his fingers could bear, produce a light when drawn briskly through his fingers; but when his fingers were held near it, a light issued from them also, attended with a crackling noise.\n\nCHAP. IV. Phenomena produced by the Tourmalin.\n\nThe electrical power of this stone, so far at least as respects its attraction of light bodies, was known to the ancients; as Theophratus speaks of a stone by him called lycurium, which agrees in all respects with the tourmalin, and which he says attracted straws, ashes, and even small cuttings of iron and copper.\n\nNothing more seems to have been known of this stone till the year 1756, when M. Æpinus made a set of experiments on this stone, which were printed in the History of the Academy of Sciences and Belles Lettres of Berlin for that year.\n\nIn 1758, the duc de Noya, in conjunction with M. Daubenton and Adamson made some experiments on the tourmalin, but they do not seem to have been so accurate as those of M. Æpinus.\n\nSoon after this stone was introduced to the notice of the English, by Dr Heberden, who procured from Holland several, with which Æpinus's experiments were repeated by Messrs Wilson and Canton.\n\nBut the most complete series of experiments on the tourmalin were made by Dr Priestley, and of these we shall here give a detailed account, as they comprise nearly all that is known on the subject.\n\n1. To ascertain the kind of electricity produced, he had always at hand a stand of baked wood with four arms projecting from it. Three of these were of glass, having threads of fine silk as it comes from the worm fastened to them, and at the end of each thread a small piece of down. From the other arm hung a fine thread about 9 or 10 inches long, while a brass arm suspended a pair of pith-balls. At the other extremity of this arm, which was pointed, a jar could be placed, to receive the electricity, and by the repulsive power of it keep the balls equally diverging with positive or negative electricity; or sometimes he suspended the balls in an uninfluenced state within the influence of large charged jars: and lastly, he had always a fine thread of trial at hand, by which he could discover whether the stone was electrical or not before he began his experiments (f).\n\n2. Before he began any experiments on the stone, also, he never failed to try how long the fine threads, which he used as electrometers, would retain their virtue; and found this to be various in various cases. When the threads would retain their electric virtue for a few minutes, he preferred them; but when this was not the case, he had recourse to the feathers, which never failed to retain it for several hours. They might be touched without any sensible loss of power, though they received their virtue very slowly. In the experiments now to be related, he made use of Dr Heberden's large tourmalin, whose convex side became positive and the flat side negative in cooling; and in all of them, when the positive or negative side of the tourmalin is mentioned, it is to be understood that which is positive or negative in cooling.\n\n3. From Mr Wilcke's experiments on the production of spontaneous electricity, by melting one substance within another, he first conjectured that the tourmalin might collect its electricity from the neighbouring air: To determine which the following experiment was made. Part of a pane of glass was laid on the standard bar of an excellent pyrometer, and upon that glass the tourmalin was placed. This bar was heated by a spirit lamp, so that the increase or decrease of heat in the tourmalin could thus be exactly determined. In this situation he observed, that whenever he examined the tourmalin, the glass had acquired an electricity contrary to that side of the stone which lay upon it, and equally strong with it. If, for example, the flat side of the stone had been presented to a feather electrified positively, as the heat was increasing, it would repel it at the distance of about two inches, and the glass would attract it at the same or a greater distance; and when the heat was decreasing, the stone would attract, and the glass repel it at the distance of four or five inches. The case was the same whichever of the sides was presented, as well as when a shilling was fastened with sealing-wax upon the glass; the electricity both of the shilling and glass being always opposite to that of the stone. When it came to the turn, the electricity was very quickly reversed; so that\n\n(f) Dr Priestley's method will be better understood, after the reader has perused Chap. I. III. and XIII. of Part III.\nGeneral that in less than a minute the electricity would be contrary to what it was before. In some cases, however, viz. where the convex surface of the tourmalin was laid upon the glass or flinting, both of these became positive as well as the stone. This he supposed to be owing to the stone touching the surface on which it lay only in a few points, and that its electricity was collected from the air; which supposition was verified: for, getting a mould of Paris plaster made for the tourmalin, and heating it in the mould, fastened to a slip of glass, he always found the mould and glass possessed of an electricity contrary to that of the stone, and equally strong with it. During the time of cooling, the mould seemed to be sometimes more strongly negative than the stone was positive; for once, when the stone repelled the thread at the distance of three inches, the mould attracted it at the distance of near six.\n\n4. On substituting another tourmalin instead of the piece of glass; it was observed, that when one of the tourmalins was heated, both of them were electrified as much as the tourmalin and glass had been. If the negative side of a hot tourmalin was laid upon the negative side of a cold one, the latter became positive, as would have been the case with a piece of glass. On heating both the tourmalins, though fastened together by cement, they acquired the same power that they would have done in the open air.\n\n5. As the tourmalins could not in this case touch in a sufficient number of points, it was now thought proper to vary the experiment by cooling the tourmalin in contact with sealing-wax, which would fit it with the utmost exactness. On turning the stone, when cold, out of its waxen cell, it was found positive, and the wax negative; the electricity of the stone being thus contrary to what would have happened in the open air. The other side, which was not in contact with the wax, acquired the same electricity that it would have done though the stone had been heated in the open air; so that both sides now became positive. In like manner the positive side of the stone, on being cooled in wax, became negative.\n\n6. On attempting to ascertain the state of the different sides of the tourmalin during the time it was heating in wax, many difficulties occurred. It was found impossible in these cases to know exactly when the stone begins to cool; besides, that in this method of treatment it must necessarily be some time in the open air before it can be presented to the electrometer; and the electricity of the sides in heating is by no means so remarkable as in cooling. In the experiments made with the tourmalin, when its positive side was buried in wax, it was generally found negative, though once or twice it seemed to be positive. On cooling it in quicksilver contained in a china cup, it always came out positive, and left the quicksilver negative; but this effect could not be concluded to be the consequence of applying the one to the other, because it is almost impossible to touch quicksilver without some degree of friction, which never fails to make both sides strongly positive though it be quite cold, and especially if the stone be dipped deep into it. At last, supposing that the stone would not be apt to receive any friction by simple pressure against the palm of the hand, he was induced to make the experiment, and found it fully to answer his expectations; for thus, each side of the stone was affected in a manner directly contrary to what would have happened in the open air.\n\n7. Fastening the convex side of the large tourmalin to the end of a stick of sealing-wax, and pressing it against the palm of the hand, it acquired a strong negative electricity, contrary to what would have happened in the open air. Thus it continued till it had acquired all the power it could receive by means of the heat of the hand; after which it began to decrease, though it continued sensibly negative to the very last. On allowing the stone to cool in the open air, its negative power constantly increased till it became quite cold.\n\n8. On heating the same flat side by means of a hot poker held near it, and then just touching it with the palm of the hand when so hot that it could not be borne for any length of time, it became positive. Letting it cool in the air it became negative, and on touching it again with the hand it became positive; and thus it might be made alternately positive and negative for a considerable time. At last, when it became so cool that the hand could bear it, it acquired a strong positive electricity, which continued till it came to the same degree of heat.\n\n9. The wax was removed from the convex, and fastened to the flat side of the stone; in which circumstances it became weakly positive after receiving all the heat the hand could give it. On letting it cool in the open air it grew more strongly positive, and continued to till it was quite cold; and thus the same side became positive both with heating and cooling.\n\n10. On heating the convex side by means of a poker, and pressing it against the palm of the hand as soon as it could be borne, it became pretty strongly negative; though it is extremely difficult to procure any appearance of negative electricity from this side; and care must be taken that a slight attraction of the electrified feather, by a body not electrified, be not mistaken for negative electricity.\n\n11. On covering the tourmalin when hot with oil and tallow, no new appearances were produced; nor did the heating of it in boiling oil produce any other effect than lessening the electricity a little; and the event was the same when the tourmalin was covered with cement made of bees-wax and turpentine. On making a small tourmalin very hot, and dropping melted sealing-wax upon it, so as to cover it all over to the thickness of a crown piece, it was found to act through this coating nearly, if not quite, as well as if it had been exposed to the open air. Thus a pretty deception may be made: for if a tourmalin be inclosed in a stick of wax, the latter will seem to have acquired the properties of the stone.\n\n12. On letting the stone cool in the vacuum of an air-pump, its virtue seemed to be diminished about one half, owing no doubt to the vacuum not being sufficiently perfect.\n\n13. On fixing a thin piece of glass opposite and parallel to the flat side of the tourmalin, and about a quarter of an inch distance from it, in an exhausted receiver, the glass was so slightly electrified, that it could not be distinguished whether it was positive or negative.\n\n14. On laying the stone upon the standard bar of the\nthe pyrometer, and communicating the heat to it by means of a spirit lamp, it was extremely difficult to determine the nature of the electricity while the heat was increasing to 70°; during which time the index of the pyrometer moved about one seventh part of an inch. But if the stone was taken off the bar, and an electrified thread or feather presented to that side which had lain next it, the convex side was always negative, and the flat one positive.\n\n14. To determine what would be the effect of keeping the tourmalin in the very same degree of heat for a considerable time together, it was laid upon the middle of the bar, to which heat was communicated by two spirit lamps, one at each extremity; and making the index move 45 degrees, it was kept in the same degree for half an hour without the least sensible variation; and it was observed, that the upper side, which happened to be the convex one, was always electrified in a small degree, attracting a fine thread at the distance of about a quarter of an inch. If in that time it was taken off the bar, though ever so quick, and an electrified feather presented to it, the flat side, which lay upon the bar, was negative, and the upper side very slightly positive, which appeared only by its not attracting the feather. On putting a piece of glass between the stone and standard bar, keeping it likewise in the same degree of heat, and for the same space of time as before, the result was the same; the glass was slightly electrified, and of a kind opposite to that of the stone itself. To avoid the inconvenience of making one side of the stone hotter than another, which necessarily took place when it was heated on the pyrometer, the following method was used. By means of two rough places which happened to be in the stone, it was tied with a silk thread which touched only the extreme edge of it; and thus being perfectly insulated, it might be held at any distance from a candle, and heated to what degree was thought necessary; while, by twisting the string, it was made to present its sides alternately, and thus the heat was rendered very equal in both. After being made in this manner so hot that the hand could scarce bear it, it was kept in that situation for a quarter of an hour. Then, with a bundle of fine thread held for some time before in the same heat, the electricity which it had acquired by heating was taken off, and it was found to acquire very little, if any; whence appeared the justness of an observation of Mr Canton's, that it is the change of heat, and not the degree of it, that produces the electric property of this stone.\n\n15. On heating the stone suddenly, it may sometimes be handled and pressed with the fingers several times before any change takes place in the electricity which it acquires by heating, though it begins to cool the moment it is removed from the fire. In this case, however, the stone must be heated only to a small degree. When the heat is three or four times as great as is sufficient to change the electricity of the two sides, the virtue of the stone is the strongest, and appears to be so when it is tried in the very neighbourhood of the fire. In the very centre of the fire the stone never fails to cover itself with ashes attracted to it from every quarter; whence it acquired its name in Dutch.\n\n16. The tourmalin often changes its electricity very slowly; and that which it acquires in cooling never fails to remain many hours upon it with very little diminution. It is even possible, that in some cases the electricity acquired by heating may be so strong as to overpower that which is acquired by boiling; so that both sides may show the same power in the whole operation. \"I am very certain (says the Doctor), that in my hands both the sides of Dr Heberden's large tourmalin have frequently been positive for several hours together, without any appearance of either of them having been negative at all. At this time I generally heated the tourmalin, by presenting each side alternately to a red hot poker, or a piece of hot glass, held at the distance of about half an inch, and sometimes I held it in the focus of a burning mirror; but I have since found the same appearance when I heated it in the middle of an iron hoop made red hot. The stone in all these cases was fastened by its edge to a stick of sealing-wax. This appearance I have observed to happen the oftener when the iron hoop has been exceedingly hot, so that the outside of the stone must have been heated some time before the inside; and also I think there is the greatest chance of producing this appearance, when the convex side of the stone is made the hotter of the two. When I heat the large tourmalin in this manner, I seldom fail to make both sides of the stone positive till it be about blood-warm. I then generally observe a ragged part of the flat side towards one end of the stone become negative first, and by degrees the rest of the flat side; but very often one part of the flat side will, in this method of treatment, be strongly positive half an hour after the other part is become negative.\"\n\nCHAP. V. Phenomena produced by excited sulphur.\n\nSulphur is one of those electrics which may be made to exhibit electrical appearances by being melted and melted on sufferer to cool again. Dr Gilbert had shown that fulphur might be rendered electric by friction; but the first person who demonstrated its excitability by melting, was Mr Wilcke, of Rothenburg in Lower Saxony, who first called this spontaneous electricity.\n\nHe melted some crude sulphur in an earthen vessel, and left it to cool after placing the vessel on a conducting substance. On taking out the sulphur when cool, he found it strongly electrical, but this was not the case when the vessel was placed on an electric.\n\nHe then melted sulphur in glass vessels, and found that both the glass and the sulphur became electrical, but the former acquired a positive, and the latter a negative electricity. When glass vessels were employed, it did not matter whether they were placed on electrics or conductors, except that the electricity produced, was stronger in the former case, and still stronger when the glass was coated with some metallic substance. The electricity of the sulphur was not produced till it began to contract, and was the strongest when the greatest degree of contraction had taken place. The electricity of the glass was always weakest when that of the sulphur was strongest, and the former was the strongest possible when the sulphur was shaken out before it had begun to contract.\n\nHe found that when melted sulphur was poured into vessels of rough glass, or into hollowed cakes of sulphur, no electricity was produced.\n\nMr Wilcke also made experiments of the same kind with melted sealing-wax, and found that when this was\nwas left to cool in vessels of smooth glass or of wood, the sealing-wax acquired a negative, and the glass or wood a positive electricity; but when it was cooled in cups of sulphur, the sealing-wax became electrified positively, and the sulphur negatively.\n\nEpinus made some experiments on melted sulphur which he cooled in metal cups. On examining them after the sulphur was cold, he found that while the sulphur remained in the cups, neither of them showed any signs of electricity; but the moment they were separated, both appeared strongly electrical. The marks of electricity disappeared however on replacing the sulphur in the cups, and returned on their being again separated. When separated, the sulphur was electrified positively, and the cups negatively; but if, before replacing the sulphur in the cups, the electricity of either was taken off, the sulphur and cups when together, would show signs of that electricity that had not been taken off.\n\nIt must be remarked here that though the electricity of the sulphur, sealing-wax, &c. in the above experiments appears to be the consequence of their cooling after being melted, it is in fact excited by a degree of friction which these substances undergo by their contraction while cooling in the cups, or by being touched with the hand in making the experiment; for it is found that if they are cooled under circumstances that prevent all friction, a very small degree of which is sufficient to excite these bodies, no electricity is produced. This appears from experiments made by M. M. Van Marum and Van Troostwyck, for the purpose of ascertaining this point, an account of which is contained in the 33rd volume of Rozier's Journal, to which we must refer our readers.\n\nThe durability of the electric power in excited sulphur is so remarkable, that Mr Grey, from some experiments which he made on this and similar substances, was led to suppose it perpetual. In particular, he poured melted sulphur into a conical drinking glass, and when it was cold he found, that on taking off the glass, the sulphur never failed to attract light bodies, and that in every state of the atmosphere; and in fair weather the glass would also attract.\n\nMr Henly, who repeated Mr Grey's experiments, says, he has never known the sulphur fail of showing signs of electricity on the removal of the glass.\n\nAlthough it be true that sulphur, as well as rosin, sealing-wax, amber, and silk, retain the electric power for a considerable time, this is, however, continually diminishing, and at length disappears altogether.\n\nOther substances, as well as sulphur and sealing-wax, become electrical by cooling after being melted. Mr Henly observed that chocolate, when first from the mill, as it cools in the tin pans into which it is received, becomes strongly electrical, and retains this property for some time after being taken out of the pans, but loses it by handling. If melted again, and left to cool as before, its electricity returns, though in a less degree; and thus it may be renewed once or twice, but still in a much smaller degree than before. But if before pouring it into the pan, it be well mixed with a little olive oil, it becomes again strongly electrical.\n\nWhen a stick of sealing-wax is broken across, each piece becomes electrified at the extremities that were contiguous, the one positively and the other negatively.\n\nWhen wood that is hard and pretty dry, is cut or shaved, the shavings are rendered electrical. This fact was first observed by Mr William Wilson, who, from wood, a number of experiments, draws the following conclusions.\n\nFrom these experiments it appears, that when very dry wood is scraped with a piece of window glass, the shavings are always positively electrified. And if chipped with a knife, the chips are positively electrified if the wood is hot, the edge of the knife not very sharp, and negatively electrified if the wood is quite cold. But if the edge of the knife is very keen, the chips will be negatively electrified whether the wood is hot or cold.\n\nThe greatest number of trials was made with the insulated knife, which was always electrified contrarily to the chips; but the surface of the wood where the chips were cut from was very seldom electrified, and when it was it, was always but weakly so, and of the same denomination as that of the weakest of the other two. Mr Wilson repeatedly found that if a piece of dry and warm wood is suddenly split asunder, the two surfaces which were contiguous are electrified, one side positive and the other negative.\n\nPowders, either of electrics or conductors, are rendered electrical by dropping them on an insulated metallic plate.\n\nThe method, as described by Mr Cavallo, is as follows:\n\n\"Inflating a metal plate upon an electric stand, such as a wine glass, and connect with it a cork-ball electrometer; then the powder required to be tried, being held in a spoon, or other thing, at about six inches above the plate, is to be let fall gradually upon it. In this manner the electricity acquired by the powder, being communicated to the metal plate, and to the electrometer, is rendered manifest by the divergence of the threads; and its quality may be ascertained in the usual manner; to be hereafter described.\n\n\"It must be observed, that if the powder is of a conducting nature, like the amalgam of metals, sand, &c., it must be held in some electric substance, as a glass phial, a plate of sealing-wax, or the like. Sometimes the spoon that holds the powder may be insulated, in which case, after the experiment, the spoon will be found possessed of an electricity contrary to that of the powder.\n\n\"In performing these experiments, care must be taken to render the powders, and whatever they are held in, as free from moisture as possible; sometimes it being necessary to make them very warm, otherwise the experiment is apt to fail. The following are the particulars which have been observed with this method, which, however, are neither numerous, nor often repeated; but they may suffice to excite the curiosity of those persons who have leisure and the opportunity of repeating them more at large and in a greater variety.\n\n\"Powder of rosin, whether it be let fall from paper, glass, or a metal spoon, electrifies the plate strongly negative; the spoon, if insulated, remaining strongly positive. Flower of sulphur produces the same effect, but in a little less degree. Pounded glass, let fall from...\"\nElectrical from a piece of paper, made dry and warm, electrifies the plate negatively, but not in so strong a degree as rosin. If it be let fall from a brass cup, it electrifies the plate positively, but in a very small degree.\n\n\"Steel-filings let fall either from a glass phial or paper, electrify the plate negatively; but brass-filings, treated in the same manner, electrify the plate positively. The amalgam of tin-foil and mercury, gunpowder, or very fine emery, electrify the plate negatively, when they are let fall upon it from a glass phial. Quick-silver, from a glass phial, electrifies the plate positively.\n\n\"Soot from the chimney, or the ashes of common pit-coal mixed with small cinders, electrify the plate negatively, when let fall from a piece of paper.\"\n\nM. Volta discovered, that when water and some other fluids are reduced to a state of vapour, by throwing the fluid on some lighted coals placed in an inflated crucible, the vapour shows signs of positive electricity, while the coals it is leaving are negatively electrified; and hence it is concluded, that all fluids in the act of evaporation become electrical, the vapour being electrified positively, and the body which it is leaving negatively; and again, that when vapour becomes condensed into a fluid, it becomes negatively electrified, leaving the bodies with which it was last in contact in a state of negative electricity.\n\nSome conductors arranged in certain ways will produce electrical appearances without friction, or communication with any electric except the air.\n\nThus if a plate of zinc, a plate of silver, or of copper, and a piece of woollen cloth moistened with some\n\nPART II.\n\nOF ELECTRICAL APPARATUS.\n\nCHAP. I. Of the Construction of Electrical Machines.\n\nWE shall first lay down the general principles on which the construction of an electrical machine and the adjusting of its several parts depends; and shall afterwards describe some of the more important machines which are now in use.\n\nThe principal parts in an electrical machine are the electric, the engine by which it is to be set in motion, the rubber, and the prime conductor.\n\nSeveral substances have, at various times been employed as electrics, as sulphur (v), rosin, polished glass, and rough glass; and they have been used of various form as globes, spheroids, cylinders, &c. The reason of this variety of form seems to be that experience had not shown what form was the most convenient; but the different substances were employed for the purpose of producing a positive or negative electricity as the nature of the experiment or the fancy of the operator might require.\n\nBut as this purpose is better answered by insulating the rubber, or allowing it to communicate freely with conductors, polished glass is almost the only substance at present employed as the electric of a machine. Globes of glass are sometimes used, but the most convenient forms are cylinders and plates.\n\nThe most convenient size for globes is from nine to twelve inches diameter. They are made with one neck, which is cemented to a strong brass cap, in order to adapt them to a proper frame. The most convenient cement for holding together the parts of electrical apparatus is made by melting together, over a gentle fire, two parts of rosin, two of bees-wax, and one of powdered red ochre. This cement is much better than rosin alone, as it serves the purposes of insulation equally well, and is much less brittle. Globes were formerly\n\n(f) The first person who constructed anything like an electrical machine was Otto Guericke, burgomaster of Magdebourg, who lived in the latter end of the 17th century. He formed a globe of sulphur by melting this substance in a glass globe, which he then broke away from it, little imagining that the glass itself would have answered his purpose much better. Vid., Experimenta Magdeburgica.\nElectrical Apparatus.\n\nPlates of glass.\n\nCylinders to be preferred.\n\nChap. I. ELECTRICITY.\n\nElectrical formerly much more used than at present; their great advantage appears to be, that by making the electric revolve on an axis nearly perpendicular, the upper part is more completely insulated; but one great disadvantage attends this motion, namely, that as the pressure is applied at a distance from the fulcrum, it in time loosens the adhesion of the strongest cement.\n\nPlates of glass are much in fashion on the continent; and they seem to attribute to this form much of the wonderful power of their machines, as of that at Haarlem, to be hereafter mentioned. Perhaps the greatest advantage of plates is that the friction may be applied to both surfaces at once; but it may be doubted, whether this be not an imaginary advantage, and this form is attended with several material inconveniences; as, 1st, Plates cannot bear any great pressure of the rubber; 2d, They cannot be inflated without very complicated machinery; 3d, As they are fixed by the centre, and the friction is applied towards the circumference, if much force be employed, there will be great danger of breaking the plate, or at least of loosening it, and thus disturbing the equability of its motions; and, 4thly, They are much more expensive than any other form, and hence, as they are much exposed to injury, the replacing of them becomes a very serious object.\n\nThe ingenious Mr Cuthbertson has contrived to obviate some of these disadvantages, and his plate machines are very conveniently managed, as well as very powerful in their effect.\n\nOn the whole, the cylindrical form seems preferable to any other, and this is now almost universally employed. The cylinders should be blown as light as possible, consistently with sufficient strength, and their surface should be as equable and free from knots or protuberances as may be; for these not only render the cylinder more liable to be broken, but prevent the risk of the rubber from being closely applied to every part of the surface. To avoid these inequalities, the cylinder should be blown at the time when the glass is in the most complete state of fusion, and this is found to be the case, when the pot is about half emptied, which happens at the London glass-houses on Wednesdays and Thursdays.\n\nThe cylinders are usually made of the best flint-glass, but it is not determined which is the best kind. In size they vary from eight inches long and four in diameter to two feet long and one foot in diameter, which is perhaps as large as they can be conveniently blown. Very small cylinders are, however, of little use, and it may be doubted whether the diameter should not be greater in proportion to their length than what is above assigned. It is of great consequence that the cylinders should have been properly annealed, or that they should be brought very gradually from the temperature of the glass-house to that of the external air; as when they have been too suddenly cooled, they are apt to fly in pieces in the act of whirling, to the great annoyance both of the experimenter and the spectators.\n\nCylinders are made with two necks; and the openings of these should be so wide as to admit the hand to clean the inner surface of the glass, which is sometimes filled by condensed vapour. These necks are cemented as above directed, to caps of brass, which are much superior to wooden caps, as they may be made much more smooth and equal.\n\nBrass caps have been objected to on account of the conducting power of the metal; but this objection is absurd, as the insulation depends on the distance between the cap and the cushion, which, as will be mentioned presently, should be as great as possible. Indeed wood, if ever so well dried, is but a very imperfect insulator, and the hardest can never be so completely polished as a metallic substance. The brass cap should be composed of two parts; one a ring to be cemented round the neck of the cylinder, with an aperture sufficient to admit of the introduction of the hand within the glass, and with a surface as extensive as possible, that the adhesion of the cement may be the more complete; the other a head or lid of brass completely polished, to be screwed into the ring, and with an orifice into which the winch or the pin on which the other end of the cylinder is supported may be screwed.\n\nIt has been thought of advantage to line the inside of the glass with some electric substance, as wax, rosin, globes &c.; this has been thought by some to increase the excitability of the glass. It seems ascertained, however, that if such a coating does not make a good cylinder better, it at least often improves a bad one. The composition most approved for coating globes or cylinders is formed of four parts of Venice turpentine, one part of rosin, and one of bees-wax, melted together and kept boiling over a gentle fire for about two hours, frequently stirring it. When a vessel is to be coated with this composition, a sufficient quantity of it, broken into small pieces, is to be put within the globe or cylinder, which is then held to the fire to melt the composition; and by constantly turning it round, the coating is to be spread equally over the surface to about the thickness of a sixpence. In doing this, care must be taken to heat the glass very gradually and equally, otherwise it is liable to be broken during the operation.\n\nThe electric is set in motion either by a simple means of winch, or by means of multiplying wheels. The former moving the electric, as being more simple, and consequently less liable to produce disorder in the motion of the machine, is generally to be preferred. The handle of the winch is sometimes made of glass, but this is unnecessary; for the glass does not shorten the interval, which is most favourable to the diffusion of the electric power.\n\nMultiplying wheels were much more common formerly than at present. The usual method of employing these is, to fix a wheel on one side of the frame of the machine, which is turned by a winch, and has a groove round its circumference.\n\nUpon the brass cap of the neck of the glass globe, or one of the necks of the cylinder, is fixed a pulley, whose diameter is about the third or fourth part of the diameter of the wheel; then a string or strap is put over the wheel, and the pulley; and by these means, when the winch is turned, the globe or cylinder makes three or four revolutions for one revolution of the wheel. The principal inconvenience attending this construction, is, that the string is sometimes so very slack, that the machine cannot work. To remedy this, the wheel should be made moveable with respect to the electric, so that, by means of a screw, it may be fixed at the proper distance; or else the pulley should have...\nElectrical have several grooves of different radiuses on its circumference.\n\nThe chief advantage of multiplying wheels, is that the arm of the operator is less fatigued by turning the machine, when these are employed, than when a simple winch is used; and as by these the motion of the electric is rendered quicker, it is supposed by some that its electric power is proportionally increased.\n\nIn some machines, instead of the pulley or string described above, there are used a wheel and pinion, or a wheel and an endless screw. This machinery requires considerable nicety in its construction, is apt to produce an unpleasant rattling, and unless frequently oiled, the constant friction of the parts against each other soon wears them away, so as to render the motion very unsteady.\n\nRubber.\n\nThe rubber (c), by which the electric is to be excited, consists of two parts. One part is a cushion, which is usually made of a piece of red badger skin, stuffed with hair or flannel. The cushion is either fixed to a piece of wood well rounded at the edges, and fastened to a support of glass, or some other insulating substance; or where two conductors are employed, it is fixed to one of these. The cushion should be made as hard as the bottom of an ordinary hair-chair, and should be so adapted to the surface of the cylinder, as to press equally on it in every part. For this purpose it is generally provided with a spring, by which means it may be the better adapted to any inequalities of the surface of the glass; in the usual construction of the cushion the spring is placed without, but Mr. Jones, instrument-maker in London made, what he considers as a great improvement on the mode of placing it. This consists in a spring placed within the rubber itself; the action of which is found to be better suited for adapting the rubber to the inequalities of the glass, than that placed entirely without the rubber. It consists of a piece of flexible iron or brass, represented edgewise by A, fig. 3.; and it is evident that it acts in a much more parallel and uniform manner than the former, which is constantly changing the pressure of the line of contact between the rubber and cylinder while it passes from the under to the upper side, thus rendering the effect insufficient and uncertain.\n\nThe length of the cushion should not exceed one-third of the length of the cylinder; for if it were longer, the inflation would be much less complete, since one end of the conductor (when the rubber is fixed to a conductor) must always be nearer to the hand by two or three inches than the cushion.\n\nThe other part of the rubber consists of a piece of black Persian silk as broad as the length of the cushion, and reaching from it over nearly one half of the cylinder. It should be sewed upon a wire, bent at both ends, and these ends are adapted to holes made on the upper edge of the wood to which the cushion is fastened; or it may be glued to the edge of the cushion; but the former mode of fixing it is to be preferred, as it can then be easily removed.\n\nThe rubber should be inflated in the most perfect manner; as, when inflation is not required, it may be easily taken off by a chain or wire hung upon it, and thus communicate with the earth or with any electrified body; but where there is no contrivance for inflating the rubber, it is impossible to perform many of the most curious experiments. In short, to construct the rubber properly, it must be made in such a manner, that the tide it touches in whirling may be as perfect a conductor as it can be made, in order to supply electricity as quick as possible; and the opposite part should be as perfect a non-conductor as possible, in order that none of the electric power accumulated upon the glass may return back to the rubber; which has been found to be the case when the rubber was not made in a proper manner (H).\n\nOf late, a considerable improvement in the rubber Wolf's has been made by M. Wolff, of Hanover. The construction and advantage of his rubbers, as applied to a plate machine similar to that of Van Marum, of which an account will be given by and by, is thus described by the author in a paper in Gilbert's Annalen der Physik for 1802, and translated in Nicholson's Journal, for February 1804, from which we have copied them.\n\nThe four rubbers are made of dry walnut wood soaked in amber varnish, and are 5½ inches long, 1½ broad, and a little more than one quarter of an inch thick. The metallic plate that communicates with the leather covered with amalgam, is only 1½ inch broad; and is fixed externally to the centre of the piece of wood. The rubbers are pressed towards the glass by means of a spring. They are covered with a piece of thick woollen, upon which is a piece of fine neat's leather. After the leather is fastened to the wood, it is wetted, and pressed between two boards, where it is kept till it is again dry. Thus it is rendered very flat, and its edge very sharp, and all its parts will apply to the surface of the glass. This piece of leather is covered with another a little broader, the rough surface of which is towards the glass, and its lower edge on the side towards which the plate moves; and its lower edge on the other side from which the plate moves, being likewise very sharp. The piece of silk is applied with accuracy to this leather. Before it is fastened on, it is heated, and bemarred first with butter of cacao, then with a large quantity of Kienmayer's amalgam (I); and after it is fastened on, it is compressed in conjunction with the wood, or pressed strongly against the machine. The leather is next covered with amber varnish, amalgam is spread over this, and after the varnish is dry, it is smoothed with a burnisher. This is repeated several times. The whole being very dry, and the rubber being pressed so as to touch the glass in all points,\n\n(g) For a long time the only rubber employed was the dry hand of the experimenter, till the middle of the 18th century, when M. Winckler, professor at Leipzig, introduced the cushion. It was long after this, however, before electricians could be persuaded that any rubber was better than the clean dry human hand. Vid. Prießnitz's Hiil. part i. loc. 7.\n\n(h) The improvement of the silk flap was first introduced by Dr. Nooth. Vide Phil. Transf. vol. lxiii.\n\n(i) He adds to this amalgam as much silver, as the mercury can dissolve in conjunction with the zinc.\nElectrical points, the leather coated with amalgam (k) is covered with a piece of fine white paper, as long as the leather, and half an inch broader, so as to cover the frame that fastens the silk to the leather; and the paper is fastened to the wood above or below, accordingly as it is on the ascending or descending side of the plate.\n\nDry paper is known to be capable of acquiring a high state of electricity, which induced me to try this substance as an immediate rubber. The following are the advantages, that by my experiments, repeated and varied in a great number of ways, I have found paper employed as a rubber to possess over every other known substance.\n\n1. The glass is not rendered dull by the friction, as happens at length, and by frequent using, when it is in immediate contact with the amalgam.\n\n2. By the immediate contact of the amalgam, the glass frequently contracts breaks here and there, that occasion a circulation of the fluid. This cannot take place in the construction I propose.\n\n3. Neither the glass nor the silk can be foiled. It is well known, that the cleanliness of the glass, as well as of the rubber and the whole machine in general, is of importance in producing an intense degree of electricity. It is true, that it has been proposed to apply the amalgam to the glass instead of the rubbers; but the greater effect, that seems to be produced by this last method, is only apparent, and consists entirely in the circulation of the fluid on the glass, while far from exciting or accumulating more of the fluid, this process and the circulation disperse it.\n\n4. The amalgam on the leather does not require to be frequently renewed. The dust of the amalgam, that is deposited on the edges of the paper, is injurious only when accumulated there in sufficient quantity to be conveyed to the glass, from which however it may easily be removed.\n\n5. The return and passage of sparks to the rubbers are rendered more difficult, as the paper sufficiently covers the borders of the rubbers, that are turned toward the axis.\n\n6. In my construction the rubbers may be larger than in the usual way, and in reality they are larger in proportion in my machine than in Van Marum's. No spark passes the axis, unless the air be very damp. I am persuaded, that, by adopting my construction, the rubbers of a plate of 32 inches, such as Van Marum's is, may be eleven inches instead of nine, in which case there would still be two inches for the diameter of the piece of wood that fastens the plate to the axis, and three inches for the distance from this piece to the rubbers; which I think would be sufficient in these circumstances; and the friction being on a larger surface of the plate, the effect must naturally be much greater. I shall try this alteration of the rubbers on large plates of Bohemian glass, as well as on English cylinders of 18 inches diameter, and 21 inches long. The electrical apparatus result I have already obtained with a small cylinder gives me reason to hope much more complete success with a large one.\n\n7. With my rubbers the friction may be rendered much greater, than with those the amalgam of which is in immediate contact with the glass, and foils it; besides, the plate turns with an uniform friction.\n\n8. The activity of the machine is extraordinarily increased by this construction. The greater freedom with which the plate moves, even under a greater pressure, and the paper's preventing the glass from being foiled, would be sufficient to produce this effect; even if the greater pressure alone did not occasion a more powerful effect than can be obtained from common machines.\n\nThe last part of a machine which we are to describe is the prime conductor.\n\nThis is a cylindrical tube, usually made of brass, copper or tinned iron, the two first of which are much the best, as they admit of more nicety in the construction, especially of being better polished. When required very large, the cylinder may be made of pate-board covered with tin-foil or gold-leaf. It is of great consequence that the conductor be made perfectly free from points or edges, and where holes are made in it, as is commonly done, for the purpose of experiment, these should have their edges perfectly smooth and even. The cylinder is closed at both ends by spherical lids or covers, made so as to fit with the greatest accuracy, but so as to be taken off, if requisite. These ends are sometimes made larger than the rest of the cylinder; but this is unnecessary, and it is much better that they should form with it one smooth and uniform surface. In some machines the conductor is placed at right angles to the glass cylinder, but it is now usually placed parallel to it. At the end or side opposite the glass, are fixed a row of metallic points, for receiving the electric power; these are generally either fixed immovably in the side or end of the conductor, or are fixed along a separate piece of strong brass wire, which is made to shut into two holes in the conductor, so that the points can be removed at pleasure. Mr Reid contrived to fix them to rings turning on an axis, the ends of which were forced into holes made in the conductor, so that the points rested on the glass, with which they were thus in perpetual contact, without disturbing its motion. It is certainly of great advantage to have the points as near the glass as possible, but this mode of fixing them is attended with the inconvenience of multiplying the protuberances on the surface of the conductor.\n\nThe size of the conductor is of some consequence; in general its length should equal that of the glass cylinder including its necks, and its diameter should be about one-third of that of the cylinder. It should be inflated\n\n(k) The amalgam mentioned by M. Wolff is formed of two parts of mercury, one part of purified zinc, and one of pewter. The zinc and pewter are melted together, and, before the mixture is quite cool, the mercury is added. The whole is then poured into a close box, shaken for some time and left to cool on a marble slab. When nearly cold, it is reduced to powder in a glass or earthen mortar, taking care not to triturate it so long as to make it turn gray. The Baron de Kienmayer, the author of this amalgam, has given a particular account of its preparation and uses in the 33rd vol. of Rozier's Journal. p. 96. q. v.\nElectrical insulated by being fixed on a pillar of glass covered with sealing-wax. For this purpose, the sealing-wax may be dissolved in alcohol (spirit of wine), and thus applied to the glass pillar; but it is better to heat the glass gradually, and then rub it over with the sealing-wax till it is covered to a sufficient thickness. Where there are two conductors, one of them supports the rubber, and is called the negative conductor; this is not furnished with points: the other, which is what we have just described, is placed opposite and parallel, on the other side of the glass, and is called the positive conductor (1).\n\nIt is proper to have several brass balls furnished with stalks, some straight, and others curved, which may be fitted into the holes in the surface of the conductor.\n\nThe balls should be of various sizes, and should be made to screw upon the ends of the stalks, some of which should be terminated by points. It is convenient also that some of the stalks be made with a joint, so that the ball or point can be placed in any position.\n\nElectrical machines should be furnished with one or more chains, by which, when inflation is not required, either of the conductors may be made to communicate with the table or with the floor.\n\nThere is also attached to the electrical machine, a stool with four glass legs or feet, for the purpose of inflating various bodies in the course of experiment, and hence called the inflating stool. This stool should be made either of baked wood or thick glass, and should be sufficiently large to support an ordinary chair, or at least so large that a person can easily stand on it.\n\n**Chap. II. Description of some particular Electrical Machines.**\n\nThe first machine which we shall describe is one invented by Dr Priestley, which has been considered by some as so ingenious, that it has been called a universal electrical machine.\n\nIt is thus described by Dr Priestley in his history. The frame consists of two strong boards of mahogany of the same length, parallel to one another, about four inches apart; and the lower is an inch on each side broader than the upper. In the upper board is a groove, reaching almost its whole length. One of the pillars, which are of baked wood, is immovable, being let through the upper board, and firmly fixed in the lower, while the other pillar slides in the groove above mentioned, in order to receive globes or cylinders of different sizes; but it is only wanted when an axis is used. Both the pillars are perforated with holes at equal distances, from the top to the bottom; by means of which globes may be mounted higher or lower according to their size; and they are tall to admit the use of two or more globes at a time, one above the other. Four of moderate size may be used, if two be fixed on one axis; and the wheel has several grooves for that purpose.\n\nIf a globe with only one neck be used, a brass arm electrical with an open socket, is necessary to support the axis beyond the pulley; and this part is also contrived to be put higher or lower, together with the brass socket in which the axis turns. The axis is made to come quite through the pillar, that it may be turned by another handle, without the wheel, if the operator chooses. The frame being screwed to the table, may be placed nearer to, or farther from the wheel, as the length of the string requires, in different states of weather. The wheel is fixed in a frame by itself, by which it may have a situation with respect to the pulley, and be turned to one side, so as to prevent the string from cutting itself. The hinder part of this frame is supported by a foot of its own.\n\nThe rubber consists of a hollow piece of copper lined with horse hair, and covered with a baile skin. It is supported by a socket, which receives the cylindrical axis of a round and flat piece of baked wood, the opposite part of which is inserted into the socket of a bent steel spring. These parts are easily separated; so that the rubber, or piece of wood that serves to inflate it, may be changed at pleasure. The spring admits of a twofold alteration of position. It may be either slipped along the groove or moved in a contrary direction; so as to give it every desirable position with respect to the globe or cylinder; and it is besides furnished with a screw, which makes it press harder or lighter, as the operator chooses.\n\nThe prime conductor is a hollow vessel of polished copper, in the form of a pear, supported by a pillar, and a firm basis of baked wood, and it receives its fire by means of a long arched wire, or rod of very soft brass, easily bent into any shape, and raised higher or lower, as the globe requires; and it is terminated by an open ring, in which are hung some sharp-pointed wires playing lightly on the globe when it is in motion. The body of it is furnished with holes and sockets, for the insertion of metallic rods, to convey the fire wherever it is wanted, and for many other purposes convenient in a course of electrical experiments. The conductor is by this means steady, and yet may be easily put into any situation. It collects the fire perfectly well, and (what is of the greatest consequence though but little attended to) retains it equally everywhere.\n\nWhen positive electricity is wanted, a wire or chain, as is represented in the figure, connects the rubber with the table, or the floor. When negative electricity is wanted, that wire is connected with another conductor, such as is represented at fig. 5, while the conductor at fig. 4 is connected by another wire or chain with the table. If the rubber be made tolerably free from points, the negative power will be as strong as the positive.\n\nIn short, the capital advantages of this machine are, that glass vessels, or any other electric body, of any size or form, may be used, with one neck or two necks.\n\n(1) M. Boze, professor at Wittemburg, first employed a prime conductor; his conductor was a tube of iron or tin, which he inflated at first by its being held by a man standing on cakes of rosin, and afterwards by suspending it by silk lines, horizontally before the globe. For a long time a gun-barrel was employed as a prime conductor.\nElectrical necks at pleasure; and even several of them at the same time if required. All the essential parts of the machine, the globe, the frame, the wheel, the rubber, and conductor, are quite separate; and the position of them to one another may be varied in every manner possible. The rubber has a complete inflation, by which means the operator may command either the positive or negative power, and may change them in an instant. The conductor is steady and easily enlarged, by rods inserted into the holes, with which it is furnished, or by the conjunction of other conductors in order to give larger sparks, &c. The wheel may be used or not at pleasure; so that the operator may either fit or stand to his work, as he pleases; and he may with the utmost ease both manage the wheel and his apparatus.\n\nThis machine is figured in Plate CLXXXVII, fig. 4, where\n\n- a.

The wire for connecting the rubber with the table.\n\nNext to Dr Priestley's machine, we shall describe one which was invented by Dr Ingenhousz, in which a plate of glass is employed instead of a globe or cylinder.\n\nThere is a circular plate of glass, about a foot in diameter, perforated in the centre by an iron axis, upon which it is turned vertically by means of a winch. It has four cushions, each above two inches long, which are situated at the opposite ends of its vertical diameter. It moves in a frame composed of a bottom board about a foot square, or a foot long and about six inches broad, upon which are raised two other smaller boards, parallel to each other, and fastened together at the top by a small wooden cross bar. By these upright boards, the axis of the plate is supported, and to them the cushions are fastened. When the machine is used, the bottom of the frame is fastened to the table by an iron crank. The conductor in this machine is made of hollow brass; and is furnished with branches extending from its extremities, and approaching very near the circumference of the plate.\n\nAn improvement on this machine is thus described by Mr Walker in his Lectures on Familiar Philosophy.\n\n\"It is made of a round plate of thick looking-glass, (fig. 6, Plate CLXXXVII.) This plate turns on an axis a, supported by the mahogany frame c c, by the handle g. The rubbers are of red leather stuffed with curled hair, and nailed to thin strips of wood, d d, one on each side of the glass, and made to press the glass very close by the screws x x; to these rubbers are attached oiled silk curtains, z z, on both sides of the glass. The conductor, w w w, is of brass and fixed to the frame, c c, by the glass supporter q, which inflates the conductor w, and terminates in the two knobs, s s; into these knobs are screwed small cylinders of brass, with a number of points that nearly touch the glass, and receive the electric matter from it; they cannot be seen in the drawing, being behind the curtains. For exciting positive electricity in all kinds of weather and situations, this is the most powerful and convenient machine ever yet invented.\"\n\nA very powerful machine, in which plates of glass are employed, is that in Teyler's museum at Haarlem, constructed by Mr John Cuthbertson. It consists of a circular plate of glass, each 65 inches in diameter, and made to turn upon the same horizontal axis, at the distance of 7½ inches from one another. These plates are excited by eight rubbers, each 15½ inches long. Both sides of the plates are covered with a resinous substance to the distance of 16½ inches from the centre, both to render the plates stronger, and likewise to prevent any of the electricity being carried off by the axis. The prime conductor consists of several pieces, and is supported by three glass pillars 57 inches in length. The plates are made of French glass, as this is found best next to the English flint which could not be procured of sufficient size. The conductor is divided into branches which enter between the plates, but collect the fluid by means of points only from one side of the plate. The force of two men is required to work this machine; but when it is required to be put in action for any length of time, four are necessary.\n\nBy this machine Van Marum made his experiments on metals, &c., which will be mentioned hereafter.\n\nWithin these few years, Dr Van Marum has constructed a new machine, of smaller dimensions, but of much greater proportional power than the preceding. It is thus described in Nicholson's Journal. Fig. 75, Pl. CXC. exhibits a perspective view of the machine, and fig. 76, 77, 78, 79, a section, exclusive of the cushions. In the view it may be observed that the cushions are each separately inflated upon pillars of glass, and are applied nearly in the direction of the horizontal diameter of the plate, instead of the vertical diameter as heretofore. The ball diametrically opposite to the handle is the prime conductor, and the semicircular piece with two cylindrical ends serves, in the position of the drawing, to receive the electricity from the plate. By the happy contrivance of altering the position of this semicircular branch from vertical to nearly horizontal, the cylindrical ends may be placed in contact with the cushions, and the prime conductor instantly exhibits negative electricity. But as it is necessary that the cushions should communicate with the ground when the positive power is wanted, and that they should be inflated when the negative power is required, there is another semicircular branch applied to the opposite side of the plate nearly at right angles to the first. That is to say, when positive electricity is wanted, this second branch denoted by I, I in the section fig. 76, is placed nearly horizontal, and forms a communication from the cushions to the ground through a metallic rod from K behind the mahogany pillar which supports the axis; but when, on the contrary, the negative power is wanted, and the branch from the prime conductor is placed in contact with the cushions, this other branch from the axis is put into the vertical situation, and carries off the electricity emitted from the plate of glass.\nThe axis of the plate B h, fig. 76, is supported by a single column A, which for that purpose is provided with a bearing-piece K, on which two brafs collar-pieces DD, represented more at large and in face in figs. 78, are fixed, and carry the axis itself. The whole of fig. 76 is reduced to one sixtieth of its real dimensions, unless contracted by the shrinking of the paper after printing; to obviate which, it may be remarked that the diameter of the plate is 34 English inches. The axis has a counterpoise O, of lead, to prevent too great friction in the collar D nearest the handle. The arc of the conductor EE, which carries the two small receiving conductors FF, is fixed to the axis G, which turns in the ball H. On the other side of the plate is seen the other arc II, of brafs wire, half an inch in diameter, fixed to the extremity of the bearing-piece K, so that it may be turned in the same manner as the arc EE. The two receiving conductors FF are six inches long, and two and a half inches in diameter. The double line P represents a copper tube terminating in a ball Q. It moves like a radius upon the stem R of the ball S, which being screwed into the conductor H, serves to confine the arm P in any position which may be required. The diameter of the ball S is only two inches, which, together with certain other less rounded parts of this apparatus, may serve to show that considerable electricity from this machine is less disposed to escape than if it had proceeded from a cylinder. The diffusion of electricity along the glass supports is prevented by a kind of cap T, of mahogany, which affords an electrical well or cavity underneath, and likewise effectually covers the metallic caps into which the glass is cemented. The lower extremity of the cap is guarded in the same manner by a hollow piece or ring V, of mahogany, which covers the metallic socket into which the glass is cemented. The three glass pillars are set in sliding-pieces, as marked on the platform of fig. 75, which are nine inches long.\n\nThe rubbers of this machine differ in no essential particular from those described by the inventor in the Journal de Physique for February 1791; and the apparatus for applying them is described in the same work for April 1789. Fig. 77 represents a section of this judicious piece of mechanism seen from above, and one-fourth of the real size. A metallic sliding-piece bb, is fitted into a corresponding face, on the ball Z, which is one of those fixed on the top of the glass pillars near the circumference of the glass plate in fig. 75. To this is affixed the piece dd, which terminates in two hinges gg, that allow the springs ee to move in the plane of the horizon. The pieces gg represent the wood-work of the cushions attached to the extremities of the springs by the hinges hh. The springs are regulated by the bolt and screw ii. The two cushions are thus made to apply to the plate equally through their whole length; the actions on the opposite sides of the plate are accurately the same; and the play of the hinges gg prevents the plate from being endangered by any strain in the direction of its axis. It is certain that, before this adequate provision was made to secure these essential requisites, it was impracticable to apply the cushions to a plate with the same safety and effect as to cylinders, which possess much strength from their figure. An ingenious workman will probably find little difficulty in constructing these rubbers from this description and drawing; but the most precise information respecting every circumstance and dimensions is to be found in the letters above quoted.\n\nThe inner extremities of the cushions are defended by the plates of gum-lac YY, which cover the three sides or edges, and prevent their attracting the electric power from the ends of the receiving conductor.\n\nThe part of the axis which moves between the collars is made of steel. The middle of the non-conducting part of the axis is a cylinder of walnut-tree aa, baked until its insulating power is equal to that of glass, and then soaked in amber varnish, while the wood still remains hot. The two extremities of this cylinder, which are of a less diameter, are forced, by strong blows, with a mallet, into the stout brafs caps b and c, in which they are retained by three iron screws dd. The cylinder aa, and the brafs caps, are covered with a layer of gum-lac eee, to preserve the insulating state of the wooden cylinder more perfectly, and to prevent the cap b from throwing flashes to the rubbers. The bottom of the cap b is screwed home on the capped extremity of the steel axis b. The base of the cap c, which is four inches in diameter, terminates in an axis one inch thick, and two in length; the extremity of which is formed into a screw. The glass plate is put on this projecting part, and secured in its place by a nut of box-wood, forced home by a key, applied in the holes ii. Two rings of felt are applied on each side of the glass, to defend its surface from the contact of the wood and the metal; and the central hole in the glass, which is two inches in diameter, contains a ring of box-wood, which prevents its immediate application to the axis.\n\nAs it is necessary that the axis G should be parallel to the axis of the plate, in order that the conductors FF may move parallel to the plate itself, the pillar M is rendered adjustable by three bearing screws RR at the bottom, which react against the strong central screw T, and this is drawn downwards by its nut. The conductors FF are also adjustable by the sliding-pieces vv, and the binding-screws ww, which also afford an adjustment to bring the axis of each small conductor parallel to the face of the glass plate. A similar adjustment may be observed at the extremities of the arc II.\n\nFig. 79 represents a section of the moving part of the branch II, one-half of its real size. A brafs plate uu is screwed to the face of the capital K by three iron screws ss. To this is screwed another ring dd, which affords a groove for the moveable ring yy, into which the arms II are fixed. This is accordingly applied in its place before the ring dd is fixed.\n\nThe wooden part of the rubbers GG, fig. 77, is covered with thin plates of iron, excepting the surface nearest to the glass. The intention of this is to maintain a more perfect communication between the rubbed part of the cushion and the earth or negative conductor, as the case may be.\n\nThe plates of gum-lac YY, are applied to the rubbers, each by means of a thin plate of brafs, to which they are affixed by heat. There are two wires riveted in the plates, which are thrust into correspondent holes in the wooden part of the cushion.\n\nThe mahogany column A ends in a square ss, upon which\nElectrical which the piece K is fitted and firmly applied, by means of the screw and nut exhibited in the section.\n\nThe following description of a useful machine is taken from Mr Cavalla, who considers it as one of the most complete with which he is acquainted.\n\nThe frame of this machine consists of the bottom board ABC, which when the machine is to be used, is fastened to the table by two iron clamps, one of which appears in the figure near C. Upon the bottom board are perpendicularly raised two strong wooden pillars KL, and AH, which support the cylinder, and the wheel. From one of the brass caps of the cylinder FF, an axle of steel proceeds, which passes quite through a hole in the pillar KL, and has on this side of the pillar a pulley I, fixed upon its square extremity. Upon the circumference of this pulley there are three or four grooves, in order to suit the variable length of the string ab, which goes round one of them, and round the groove of the wheel D. The other cap of the cylinder has a small cavity, which fits the conical extremity of a strong screw, that proceeds from the pillar H. The wheel D, which is moved by the handle E, turns round a strong axle, proceeding from almost the middle part of the pillar KL.\n\nThe rubber G of this machine is on each end two or three inches shorter than the cylinder (i.e., the cylinder exclusive of the necks), and it is made to rub about one-tenth part of the cylinder's circumference, or rather less; it consists of a thin quilted cushion of silk, stuffed with hair, and fastened by silk strings upon a piece of wood, which is properly adapted to the surface of the cylinder. And to the lower extremity of the cushion, or rather of the piece of wood to which the cushion is tied, a piece of leather is fastened, which is turned over the cushion, i.e., stands between it and the surface of the cylinder, and to the extremity of which a piece of silk or oiled silk is fastened, which covers almost all the upper part of the cylinder. Upon this leather, which reaches from the lower to almost the upper extremity of the cushion, some of the amalgam is to be worked, so as to be forced as much as possible into its substance: if mica gold is to be tried, then the leather should be new, and wherein no other amalgam has been put. This rubber is supported by two springs, screwed to its back, and from which it may be easily unscrewed, when occasion requires it. The two springs proceed from the wooden cap of a strong glass pillar, perpendicular to the bottom board of the machine. This pillar has a square wooden base, that slides in two grooves in the bottom board ABC, upon which it is fastened by a screw. In this manner the glass pillar may be fastened at any required distance, and in consequence the rubber may be made to press harder or lighter upon the cylinder. The rubber in this manner is perfectly insulated; and, when insulation is not required, a chain with a small hook may be hanged to it, so as to have a regular communication with the piece of leather; the chain then falling upon the table, renders the rubber uninsulated.\n\nFig. 7 represents the prime conductor AB belonging to this machine. This is of hollow brass, and is supported by two glass pillars varnished, that by two brass sockets are fixed in the board CC. This conductor receives the electric power through the points of the collector L, which are set at about half an inch distance from the surface of the cylinder of the machine.\n\nIf the handle E of the wheel, be turned (and on account of the rubber it should be turned always in the direction of the letters abc) this machine standing in the situation that is represented in the figure, will give positive electricity, i.e., the prime conductor will be electrified positively. But if a negative electricity be required, then the chain must be removed from the rubber, and hung to the prime conductor; for in this case the electricity of the prime conductor will be communicated to the ground, and the rubber remaining insulated, will appear strongly negative. Another conductor, equal to the conductor AB, may be connected with the insulated rubber, and then the operator may obtain as strong negative electricity from this, as he can positive from the conductor AB.\n\nThe next machine which we shall mention is one invented by Mr Nairne, which is chiefly employed for medical purposes; but a modification of which, to be presently described, will answer for most purposes of electrical experiment better than any other.\n\nThe cylinder in Mr Nairne's machine is about twelve inches long and seven in diameter; it turns upon two wooden pieces cemented on the top of two strong glass pillars, BB. These pillars are made fast into the bottom board of the machine, which is fastened to the table by means of a crank. There are grooves made in the under part of the bottom of the crank, through which the pieces FE slide. On these pieces the pillars stand by which the two conductors are supported; and in order to place these conductors nearer to the cylinder, or remove them farther from it, the pieces on which they stand are moveable inwards or outwards, and may be fixed by the two screws LL. The rubber is fastened to the conductor R; and consists of a cushion of leather stuffed, having a piece of silk glued to its under part. This last being turned over the surface of the cushion, and thus interposed between it and the glass, goes over the cylinder, and almost touches the pointed wires which are fixed on the other conductors. The conductors are of tin covered with black lacquer, each of them containing a large coated glass jar, and likewise a smaller one, or a coated tube, which are visible when the caps NN are removed. To each conductor is fixed a knob O, for the occasional suspension of a chain to produce positive or negative electricity. The part of the winch C, which acts as a lever in turning the cylinder, is of glass. Thus every part of the machine is insulated, the cylinder itself and its brass caps not excepted. And to this the inventor has adapted some flexible conducting joints, a discharging electrometer, and other utensils necessary for the practice of medical electricity.\n\nA modification of this machine is represented at fig. 9.\n\na, the handle of the cylinder.\nb, the negative, and c, the positive conductor.\nd, the silk flap of the rubber.\n\nMr Reid's portable machine, as improved by Mr Reid's Lane, is the last which we shall describe, and is represented at fig. 10. A is the glass cylinder, moved vertically by means of the pulley at the lower end of the axis.\nElectrical axis. This pulley is turned by a large wheel B, which lies parallel to the table. There are three pulleys of different dimensions marked in the figure; one of which revolves four times for every revolution of the large wheel B. The conductor C, is furnished with points to collect the fluid, and is screwed to the wire of a coated jar D, which stands in a socket between the cylinder and the wheel. This figure also shows how Mr Lane's electrometer, to be afterwards described, may be adapted to this machine.\n\nA great many other machines have been described in the Philosophical Transactions, Journal de Physique, and in various books on electricity; but those of which we have given an account are the most material.\n\n**CHAP. III. General directions for using the Electrical Machine.**\n\nIt is of the greatest consequence that the machine, as well as the table on which it stands, and everything in its neighbourhood, be perfectly free from dust; it is therefore necessary to begin by wiping every part of the machine, &c., with a clean, dry, soft linen cloth. If the weather is not warm and dry, it will be proper also to place the machine for some time before the fire, that it may be perfectly free from moisture. The cylinder if used lately and not cleaned, may have contracted spots of dirt or grease; in which case it must be rubbed with a soft rag dipped in spirit of wine. In short, very much depends on the machine being quite free from dirt and moisture.\n\nThe conductors are now to be fixed in a proper situation, so that the rubber of the negative conductor may press closely to the cylinder on one side, and the points of the positive conductor may approach on the other as near to it as possible, without touching. Then while the cylinder is made to revolve, the amalgam is to be applied to it, where it is not covered with the silk; this is best done by means of a piece of leather to which the amalgam has been previously fastened, which is a better method than by spreading it on the rubber. As the amalgam is liable to oxidation from exposure to the air, it is proper to scrape the surface of it before it is applied to the cylinder; and if any old amalgam has been left on the cushion of the rubber, this should also be scraped before using the new.\n\nAfter having made these arrangements, on whirling the cylinder in contact with the rubber, without bringing any conducting body near the former, or inflating the latter, we will perceive in the dark a stream of fire issuing from the place of contact between the rubber and the cylinder, and adapting itself to the form of the cylinder, so as to involve it in a blue flame mixed with bright sparks; the whole making a very perceptible whizzing and snapping noise. If the finger is brought near the cylinder in this situation, the flame and sparks will leave the cylinder and strike the finger; and this phenomenon will continue as long as the globe continues to be whirled round.\n\nOn applying the prime conductor, the light will vary, and be perceptible only upon the points presented to it by the cylinder; but if the finger is now brought near the conductor, a very small spark will strike it, and that at a greater or smaller distance, according to the strength of the machine. This spark, when the electricity is not very strong, appears like a straight line of fire; but if the machine acts very powerfully, it will put on the appearance of zig-zag lightning, throwing out other sparks from the corners, and strike with such force as to give considerable pain to those who receive it.\n\nIf these appearances do not take place, or if they take place only in a slight degree, soon after the applying the amalgam, spread a little oil on the palm of your hand, and let it slightly touch the cylinder as it moves round; in general this is instantly followed by a copious emission of sparks, numerous torrents of which will now pass from the edge of the silk to the knuckles. Sometimes, however, after using all these precautions, the machine does not act well, and in this case the rubber should be examined, to see if something is not wrong there. The rubber should be removed from the glass pillar or the negative conductor, to which it is fastened, by taking out the screws by which it is usually secured; it is then to be brought near the fire so that the silk may be perfectly dried, after which a little tallow or fuel should be rubbed upon the cushion, and it should then be replaced in its situation. If the silk of the rubber is fitted to the cushion by means of a wire as described in (42.) it will only be necessary to take out this wire, in order to dry the silk.\n\nWhile both conductors remain insulated, the machine will not continue to act long, or at least its action will be much less powerful; but if the negative conductor or rubber be made to communicate with the floor or a moist wall, it will in general continue its action for any length of time required.\n\nThe weather is found to have considerable influence on the action of an electrical machine; in wet weather it will neither act to powerfully, nor for so long a time as when the weather is moderately warm and dry, unless perpetual care be taken to keep every part of it warm and clean. Very hot dry weather is also unfavourable to the action of the machine, and when this happens, even the floor of the room may be too dry to serve as a conductor; it is then necessary to connect the rubber by a chain which communicates with some moist surface, as a cellar, a pump, or the like.\n\nMr Nicholson lays down the following directions for Mr Nicholson's directions for preparing the machine for experiment.\n\nClean the cylinder, and wipe the silk.\n\nGrease the cylinder, by turning it against a greased creasing the power of leather till it is uniformly obscured. I use the tallow the cylinder.\n\nTurn the cylinder till the silk flap has wiped off so much of the grease as to render it semitransparent.\n\nPut some amalgam on a piece of leather, and spread it well so that it may be uniformly bright. Apply this against the turning cylinder. The friction will immediately increase, and the leather must not be removed until it ceases to become greater.\n\nRemove the leather, and the action of the machine will be very strong.*\n\n**CHAP.

For this purpose, few tools are necessary. The principal are a turner's lathe, for turning caps, balls, pedestals, &c.; a blow-pipe with a proper lamp, for bending tubes, or opening and closing such as are of large diameter; a few files of various degrees of fineness, and various forms, as flat, half-round, rat-tail, &c.\n\nPART II.\n\nAN EXPERIMENTAL ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICITY.\n\nWe propose, in this part, to describe the principal phenomena of communicated electricity; and to illustrate these by experiments, which we shall, as nearly as can be done, class under certain general heads or principles. After recounting the experiments which illustrate each head, we shall describe the construction and explain the uses of the several electrical instruments which depend on the principle laid down. We shall also take an opportunity, in this part, of tracing the origin and progress of the more important discoveries which have been made in the experimental part of the science.\n\nAs it must be supposed that the reader is at present unacquainted with the theory of electricity, the principles to which the several experiments in this part are referred, will be merely such facts or general phenomena as have been observed in the course of experiment, independently of theory. In the following part of this article, we shall endeavour more accurately to illustrate these phenomena, and explain them according to the most generally received theory of electricity.\n\nChap. I. Of Electrical Attraction and Repulsion, and the Instruments which depend on them.\n\nAn electrified body attracts bodies brought near it, and after holding them in contact with it for some time, again repels them.\n\nVol. VII. Part II.\n\nExperiment 1.—Suspend a downy feather by a filken thread; on making it approach within a few inches of the prime conductor, while the cylinder is set in motion, it will be attracted to the conductor, and almost immediately repelled; and thus alternately attracted and repelled, as long as the machine continues to be worked.\n\nThis experiment may be thus varied in a pleasing manner. Take a glass tube, no matter whether smooth or rough, and, after rubbing it, present it to a downy feather; this will, as in the former instance, be instantly attracted, and be retained for a short time in contact with the tube; when it will be repelled. If, at the time of its repulsion, the tube be held in the air at a distance from surrounding objects, the repelled feather will float above the tube, and may be driven about the room as long as it does not touch any object in its neighbourhood. If one person hold a smooth glass tube, and another a rough tube or a stick of sealing wax, and a feather be let loose between them when excited, the feather will leap from one to the other, and thus the two persons will seem to drive it between them like a shuttlecock, whence this experiment is called the electrical shuttlecock.\n\nExperiment 2.—Let there be two metallic plates, one as Dancing c, fig. 20., supported by a stand, so that it may be placed on a table, &c., the other d provided with a hook, by which it may be hung by a chain to the prime conductor.\nELECTRICITY.\n\nPrinciples of Electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nElectricity at some distance from the other plate. Then cut some small figures of men or other objects in paper, or what is better, form them out of the dry pitch of elder, or of rushes, and lay them on the lower plate. On working the machine the figures will rise from the lower plate, and move perpetually from the one plate to the other as represented in the figure.\n\nExper. 3.—Let a solid rod of glass, as a, fig. 21, be made to pass through a bell b, perforated for the purpose, and let one end of the rod be fixed in a wooden foot, while the other supports two metallic arms, c d e f, crooking each other, and knobbled at their extremities. From each extremity let a small bell without a clapper be suspended by a metallic wire, and from each arm, at a little distance from the extremities, let the clappers of these bells be suspended by filken threads. On connecting the top of the stand with the prime conductor, and setting the machine in motion, the clappers will begin to move between the central bell and the other four so as to ring the whole five.\n\nHere the bells receive the electric power from the prime conductor, and being electrified, attract and repel the clappers which hang freely between them.\n\nExper. 4.—Tie a small body, as for instance a light piece of cork, to a silk thread about eight inches long, and holding the thread by its end, let the small body hang at the distance of about eight inches from the side of the prime conductor electrified. This small body, if the electrification of the conductor is not strong, will not be attracted. But if a finger or any conducting substance be presented to that side of the small body which is farthest from the prime conductor, then the small body will immediately move toward the prime conductor; and when this body has touched the prime conductor, it will be instantly repelled from it, on account of the repulsion existing between bodies possessed of the same kind of electricity.\n\nIndeed, if this insulated body be very near to the prime conductor, or the prime conductor strongly electrified, then the small body will be attracted without presenting to it any conducting substance; or the natural fluid belonging to that body will be all crowded on that side of it which is nearest to the prime conductor.\n\nIf this small body, instead of the silk, be suspended by a linen thread, it will be attracted at a much greater distance, than in the other case.\n\nBodies in the same state of electricity, i.e., which are all electrified positively, or all negatively, have a tendency to repel each other.\n\nExper. 1.—Stick a downy feather into one of the holes of the prime conductor. When the cylinder is moved the feather will begin to swell, and its plumes will separate to a considerable distance from each other.\n\nThis experiment may be varied, by placing the representation of a human head upon the prime conductor. When the cylinder is moved, the hair of the head will bristle up and stand erect as represented in Plate CLXXXVII fig. 22.\n\nExper. 2.—Let small balls made of cork or the pith of elder well dried, be suspended from the prime conductor by threads of an equal length. While the cylinder continues at rest, the balls will touch each other, but as soon as the machine is set in motion they will repel each other to a greater or less distance, according as the electric power produced is stronger or weaker.\n\nIt is not necessary that the threads be in contact with the prime conductor, for if the balls be brought near the conductor while the machine is in motion, they will recede from each other as before.\n\nThe same effect will be produced whether the balls are hung from the positive or the negative conductor.\n\nFrom the circumstance observed in the above experiments we deduce the following important corollary.\n\nObjects brought near an electrified body are electrified Corollary by position.\n\nThe communication of electricity from an electrified body, to another which is not in contact with it, but is only in its vicinity, may for the present be conceived by remarking that these bodies are surrounded with air. Air, although an electric, is not a very perfect electric, but is more or less also a conductor, especially when it is moist. When a body is electrified it communicates to the air in contact with it a portion of its electric power, and thus the air becomes electrified, and of course imparts to the bodies, which are surrounded by it a degree of electricity; and this the more easily as it is in a better conducting state.\n\nThe apparent action of the air in communicating electricity to a body which is surrounded by it, may be illustrated by the following experiments.\n\nInflate in a horizontal position a metallic rod about two feet long, having blunt ends, and at one of its ends suspend an electrometer, like that represented in fig. 116; then bring within three or four inches distance of its other end an excited glass tube. On the approach of the tube, the balls of the electrometer will open, and if you present towards them a body positively electrified, you will perceive that they diverge with positive electricity. If the tube be removed, the balls come together again, and no electricity remains in them, or in the metallic rod. But if while the tube is near one end of the rod, and the balls diverge with positive electricity, the other end of the rod, viz. that from which the electrometer hangs, be touched with some conductor, the cork balls will come immediately together, and they will remain so when the conductor has been removed—remove now the excited glass tube, and the balls will immediately diverge with negative electricity—which shows that the rod remains electrified negatively.\n\nIf the above experiment be made with an electric negatively electrified (for instance, a rod of sealing-wax instead of the excited glass tube) then the apparent electricities in the rod will be just the reverse of what they were before; for in this case, that end of the rod to which the electric has been presented, will be positive, and the opposite end negative; which opposite end, if touched in this state with some conducting substance, will acquire some electric power from that substance; and when, after that substance has been removed, the excited electric is also removed, the rod will remain positive.\n\nIn making this experiment, care must be taken that the end of the rod be very blunt, and that the electric be not very powerfully excited; otherwise a spark may pass from this to the rod, which renders the experiment precarious.\nTake two rods of metal, each about a foot long, furnished with knobs at both ends; and, either by silk lines or by inflating stools, inflate them, so that they may stand horizontally in one direction, and about a quarter of an inch distance from one another. To the middle of each of these rods hang an electrometer, like that represented in fig. 16. This done, take an excited glass tube, and bring it to about three inches distance from the knob of one of the rods; on doing which, the electrometers of both rods will appear electrified: keep the tube in that situation for about two seconds, then remove it. The rods now will remain electrified, as appears by the electrometers; the first, viz. that to which the excited tube had been presented, remaining negative, and the other positive.\n\nIn this experiment, if, instead of the glass tube, an electric, negatively excited, be brought near the end of one rod, then that rod will be electrified positively, and the other negatively.\n\nThis is all that we can properly explain at present with respect to the agency of the air in the production of electrical phenomena. We shall take occasion to consider this subject more fully in a future part of this article, when we shall see that a variety in the state of the air produces considerable diversity in the phenomena.\n\nOn the principle of electric repulsion and the above corollary depend the action of several instruments which are of great use in electrical experiments, and which we shall now describe.\n\nInstruments which are employed to ascertain the presence of electricity are called electroscopes. As they are generally employed to measure the degree of electricity produced, they are also called electrometers, and by this name we shall in future distinguish them.\n\nThe first electrometer appears to have been constructed by the abbe Nollet; it consisted of two threads of silk, which, as has been shown, recede from each other on the approach of an electrified body. He observed the angle of their divergency by its shadow cast on a board placed behind them. Mr Watzlitz this electrometer by appending small weights to the threads.\n\nMr Canton contrived an electrometer which is the foundation of those which are now in common use. He got a pair of balls turned in a lathe out of the dry pith of elder; these he hung by threads of the finest linen, and kept them in a narrow box with a sliding cover, where they were disposed that the threads could lie straight. When he was to use it, he held the box by the extremity of the cover, and allowed the balls to hang freely from a pin to which they were fixed.\n\nFig. 15 represents a stand supporting the electrometers DD, CC. B is the basis of it, made of common wood. A is a pillar of wax, glass, or baked wood. To the top of the pillar, if it be of wax or glass, a circular piece of wood is fixed; but if the pillar be of baked wood, that may constitute the whole. From this circular piece of wood proceed four arms of glass, or baked wood, suspending at their ends four electrometers, two of which, DD, are silk threads about eight inches long, suspending each a small downy feather at its end. The other two electrometers, CC, are those with very small balls of cork, or of the pith of elder; and they are constructed in the following manner:—\n\nA stick of glass about six inches long, covered with sealing-wax, and shaped at top in a ring: from the lower extremity of this stick of glass proceed two fine linen threads (m) cc, about five inches long, each suspending a cork or pith-ball d, about one-eighth of an inch in diameter. When this electrometer is not electrified, the threads cc hang parallel to each other, and the cork-balls are in contact; but when electrified, they repel one another, as represented in the figure. The glass stick ab serves for an insulating handle, by which the electrometer may be supported, when it is used without the stand AB.\n\nAnother species of the above electrometer is represented in fig. 16; which consists of a linen thread, having at each end a small cork-ball. The electrometer is suspended by the middle of the thread on any conductor proper for the purpose, and serves to show the kind and quantity of its electricity.\n\nFig. 17 represents the quadrant electrometer of Mr Henly, one of the most useful instruments of the kind yet discovered, as well for measuring the degree of electricity of any body, as to ascertain the quantity of a charge before an explosion; and to discover the exact time the electricity of a jar changes, when without making an explosion, it is discharged by giving it a quantity of the contrary electricity. The pillar LM is generally made of wood, the graduated arch NOP of ivory, the rod RS is made of very light wood, with a pith ball at the extremity; it turns upon the centre of the semicircle, so as always to keep near its surface; the extremity of the stem LM may either be fitted to the conductor or the knob of a jar. When the apparatus is electrified, the rod is repelled by the stem, and moves along the graduated arch of the semicircle, so as to mark the degree to which the conductor is electrified, or the height to which the charge of the jar is advanced.\n\nBeccaria recommends fixing the index between two semicircles, because when it is placed over one only, the electricity of this repels and counteracts the motion of the index. Other improvements and variations have been made in this instrument, which will be described hereafter.\n\nThe first account of Mr Henly's electrometer was given in the Phil. Trans. vol. lxiii. by Dr Priestley, who speaks of it in very high terms in a letter to Dr Franklin. He considers it as a perfect instrument for measuring degrees of electricity, but it will appear hereafter that this is not the case.\n\nThe scale in Mr Henly's quadrant is divided into equal parts; but M. Achard has already shewn that when this is the case, the angle at which the index is suspended by the electric repulsion is not a true measure of the repulsive force; to estimate which truly, scale he demonstrates that the arc of the electrometer should\n\n(m) These threads should be wetted in a weak solution of salt.\nPrinciples of Electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nThe balls of the ordinary electrometer may be made of pith or cork, but the latter must be very smooth and well polished. They are best made in a turner's lathe. They may be made of any shape, provided they are regular and free from edges. A very convenient electrometer is made of two long, slender pieces of ruff pith, made and appended to short threads of flax. These may easily be hung parallel to each other, whereas in the usual ball-electrometers the threads to which the balls are hung form an angle with each other. This parallelism of the threads is of advantage, and was considered of so much consequence by Lord Stanhope (better known to electricians by the title of Lord Mahon) that he was at great pains to suspend his balls in a parallel position.\n\nOf all the instruments by which it has been attempted to measure electricity, none have been found to answer the purpose better than that invented by Mr Benet, and which is represented in fig. 18. It consists of two slips of gold leaf, a a, suspended in a glass cylinder b. The foot, c, may be made of wood or metal, and the cap, d, should be of metal; the latter being made flat at top for the convenience of putting anything upon it that is to be electrified. The cap is about an inch wider than the diameter of the glass, and its rim about three quarters of an inch broad, hanging parallel to the glass to keep it sufficiently inflated, and to turn off the rain, when the instrument is employed in experiments on atmospheric electricity. Within this is another circular rim about half as broad as the former, lined with silk or velvet, so that it may be made to fit the outside of the glass exactly, while the cap may be easily taken off to repair any damage done to the gold leaf. From the centre of the cap hangs a thin tube somewhat longer than the depth of the inner rim, in which a small peg, f, is placed, which may be taken out occasionally. To this peg, which is rounded at one end and flat at the other, two slips of gold leaf are fastened with paste, gum water, or varnish. They are about a fifth part of an inch broad and two inches long, and are generally made tapering to a point. In one side of the cap is a small tube, g, to place wires in; h, h, are two long pieces of tin-foil fastened with varnish on opposite sides of the internal surface of the glass, where the slips of gold leaf may be expected to strike, and in connexion with the foot of the instrument. The upper end of the glass is covered and lined with sealing-wax as low as the outer rim, in order to make the insulation more complete.\n\nAn improvement on this electrometer is to make the cylinder pretty long, and to have a small additional tube of gum lac on the end of it. The slips of tinfoil reach almost to the edge of the outer rim, and are sharply pointed at the top, widening in the middle and decreasing in breadth again as they descend.\n\nThe great advantage of this instrument over the electrometers which we have described above is its extreme sensibility, which will appear from the following examples.\n\n1. On putting powdered chalk into a pair of bellows and blowing it upon the cap, this was electrified positively when the nozzle of the bellows was about six inches from it; but at the distance of three feet from the nozzle, the same stream electrified the cap negatively. Thus it appears that the electricity may be changed from positive to negative merely from the circumstance of this stream of chalk being more widely diffused in the air. It may also be changed by placing a bunch of fine wire, silk, or feathers, in the nozzle of the bellows: and it is likewise negative when the air is blown from a pair of bellows wanting the iron pipe, so that it may come out in a larger stream; but this last experiment succeeded best when the air was damp. There is likewise a remarkable difference between the experiments in which the electricity is positive and that in which it is negative; the former being communicated to the cap with some degree of permanency, so that the slips of gold leaf continue for some time to diverge; but the latter being only momentary, and the slips collapsing as soon as the cloud of chalk is dispersed. The greater permanency of the electricity in the former case is owing to some of the chalk sticking to the cap when the nozzle of the bellows is very near it.\n\n2. A piece of chalk drawn over a brush, or powdered chalk put into the brush, and projected upon the cap, electrifies it negatively; but its electricity is not communicated.\n\n3. Powdered chalk blown with the mouth or bellows from a metal plate placed upon the cap, communicates to the cap a permanent positive electricity. If the chalk is blown from the plate either insulated or not so, that the powder may pass over the cap, if not too far off, the electricity communicated is also positive; or if a brush be placed upon the cap and a piece of chalk be drawn over it, the slips of gold-leaf when the hand is withdrawn gradually open with positive electricity as the cloud of chalk disperses.\n\n4. Powdered chalk falling from one plate to another placed upon the instrument electrifies it negatively.\n\nOther methods of producing electricity with chalk and other powders have been tried; as projecting chalk from a goose wing, chalking the edges of books and clapping the leaves of the book suddenly together, afflicting the powder upon the cap, all which electrified it negatively; but the instrument being placed in a dusty road, and the dust struck up with a stick near it, electrified it positively. Breaking the glass-pearl upon a book electrified it negatively, but when broken in water it did not electrify it.\n\nWheat flour and red lead produced a strong negative electricity in all cases where the chalk produced a positive electricity. The following powders were like chalk: red ochre, yellow rosin, coal ashes, powdered crocus metallorum, aurum molaicum, black-lead, lamp-black (which was only sensible in the two first methods), powdered quick-lime, umber, lapis calaminaris, Spanish brown, powdered sulphur, flowers of sulphur, iron filings, rust of iron, land. Rosin and chalk, separately alike, were charged by mixture; this was often tried in dry weather, but did not succeed in damp; white-lead also sometimes produced positive and sometimes negative electricity when blown from a plate.\n\nIf a metal cup be placed upon the cap with a red hot coal in it, and a spoonful of water be thrown in, it electrifies it negatively; and if a bent wire be placed in the cap, with a piece of paper fastened to it to increase its surface, the positive electricity of the ascending\nPrinciples of electricity may be tried by introducing the paper into it.\n\nThe sensibility of this electrometer may be considerably increased by placing a candle on the cap. By this means, a cloud of chalk, which in the other case only just opens the gold-leaf, will cause it to strike the fides for a long time together; and the electricity which was not before communicated, now passes into the electrometer, causing the gold-leaf to repel after it is carried away. Even sealing-wax by this means communicates its electricity at the distance of 12 inches at least, which it would scarcely otherwise do by rubbing upon the cap.\n\nA cloud of chalk or wheat flour may be made in one room, and the electrometer with its candle be afterwards leisurely brought from another room, and the cloud will electrify it before it comes very near. The air of a room adjoining to that wherein the electrical machine was used, was very sensibly electrified, which was perceived by carrying the instrument through it with its candle.\n\nNo sensible electricity is produced by blowing pure air, by projecting water, by smoke, flame, or explosions of gun-powder.\n\nA book was placed upon the cap, and struck with silk, linen, woollen, cotton, parchment, and paper, all which produced negative repulsion; but when the other side of the book was struck with silk, it became positive; this side, struck at right angles with the former, was again negative; and by continuing the strokes which produced positive, it changed to negative for a little while; and by flopping again, became positive. No other book would do the same, though the sides were scraped and chalked, upon a supposition that altering the surface would produce it. At last, one side of a book was moistened, which changed it; whence it was concluded, that one edge of the book had lain in a damp place; which conjecture was farther confirmed by all the books becoming positive in damp weather, and one of them being dried at the fire again became negative.\n\nWhen the cap is approached with excited sealing-wax, the gold-leaf may be made to strike the fides of the glass more than twelve times; and as the sealing-wax recedes, it strikes nearly as often; but if it approaches much quicker than it recedes, the second number will sometimes be greater.\n\nThe quantity of electricity necessary to cause a repulsion of the gold-leaf is so small, that the sharpest points or edges do not draw it off without touching; hence it is unnecessary to avoid points or edges in the construction of this instrument.\n\nTo the experiments on blowing powders from a pair of bellows, it may be added, that if the powder is blown at about the distance of three inches upon a plate which is moistened or oiled, its electricity is contrary to that produced by blowing upon a dry plate. This shows that the electricity of the streams of powder rising out of the bellows is only contrary to the more expanded part, because it is within the influence of its own atmosphere; for when this is destroyed by the adhesion of the powder to the moistened place, it is negative when the bellows are positive, as it was before positive when the more expanded cloud was negative.\n\nThis instrument is also free from an inconvenience which attends the electrometers in which cork or pith balls are employed. In these, when the balls are electrified, they are very apt to adhere together for some time before the repulsion takes place, and then they often separate with a jerk so as to recede from each other farther than they ought to do, and thus make the electricity produced appear greater than it really is; whereas the flips of gold-leaf in Bennet's electrometer do not adhere together, and separate equally and gradually.\n\nThis instrument is, however, not without its defects, as the delicate texture of the gold-leaf renders it very difficult to fasten the flips, so as to keep them entire, and also prevent the instrument from being easily removed from one place to another. Mr Cavalli proposes poles to remedy these defects in the following manner: When the flips are cut and are lying upon paper, or on the leather cushion upon which they are cut, make them equal in length, by measuring them with a pair of compasses, and cutting off a suitable portion from the longest; then cut two bits of very fine gilt paper, each about half an inch long, and a quarter of an inch broad, and by means of a little wax, stick one of them to one extremity of each flip of gold-leaf, so as to form a kind of letter T. This done, hold up in the fingers of one hand, one of those pieces of paper with gold-leaf suspended to it, and hold the other with the fingers of the other hand; then bringing them near to each other, and having adjusted them properly, viz. so as to let them hang parallel and smooth, force the pieces of paper which now touch each other, between the two sides of a fort of pincers made of brass wire, or of very thin and hammered brass plate, which pincers are fastened to the under part of that piece which forms the top or cover of the glass vessel. As these gold flips are very apt to be spoiled, we should keep several of them ready cut in a book, each having a cross piece of paper fastened to one extremity, so that in case of accident, a new pair of gold flips may be soon put between the aperture of the above-described pincers; and by this means the electrometer is rendered, in a certain manner, portable.\n\nMr Cavalli describes an electrometer which is nearly as sensible as Mr Bennet's, and is not liable to the inconveniences above mentioned. It is represented at fig. 19.\n\nThe case or handle of this electrometer is formed by a glass tube, about three inches long, and three-tenths of an inch in diameter, half of which is covered with sealing-wax. From one extremity of this tube, i.e. that without sealing wax, a small loop of silk proceeds, which serves occasionally to hang the electrometer on a pin, &c. To the other extremity of this tube a cork is adapted, which, being cut tapering on both ends, can fit the mouth of the tube with either end. From one extremity of this cork, two linen threads proceed, a little shorter than the length of the tube, suspending each a little cone of pith of elder. When this electrometer is to be used, that end of the cork which is opposite to the threads is pushed into the mouth of the tube; then the tube forms the insulated handle of the pith electrometer, as represented fig. 19, c. But when the electrometer is to be carried in the pocket, then the threads are put into the tube, and the cork stops it, as represented at b. The peculiar advantages\nPrinciples of stages of this electrometer are, its convenient small size, Electricity its great sensibility, and its continuing longer in good order than any other we have yet seen.\n\nRepresents a case to carry the above-described electrometer in. This case is like a common tooth-pick case, except that it has a piece of amber fixed on one extremity A, which may occasionally serve to electrify the electrometer negatively, and on the other extremity it has a piece of ivory fastened upon a piece of amber BC. This amber BC serves only to inflate the ivory, which, when inflated, and rubbed against woollen cloths, acquires a positive electricity; and it is therefore useful to electrify the electrometer positively.\n\nThere are many other electrometers employed by electricians; but these cannot properly be described at present, as they are constructed on principles which have not yet been explained. They will be noticed in their proper place.\n\nThe electric power forces a fluid to flow in a stream through a capillary tube, through which, when not electrified, it would only pass in drops.\n\nExper. 1.—Suspend a small metallic bucket full of water from the prime conductor, and place in the water a glass syphon, the diameter of whose tube is so small that the water will only drop from it. Now set the cylinder of a machine in motion, and the water will begin to flow in a full stream from the end of the syphon. The stream will sometimes be subdivided, and if the experiment is made in the dark, the water will appear luminous.\n\nExper. 2.—Dip a sponge in water, and suspend it from the prime conductor. The water which before only dropped from the sponge, will now flow very fast, and appears in the dark like fiery rain.\n\nThe effect of electricity on water flowing through capillary tubes, was first observed by M. Boze, but was more accurately investigated by the Abbé Nollet. He found that the stream of water through a capillary tube, was accelerated in the inverse ratio of the diameter of the tube; but that if the diameter of the tube, was less than a line; the stream was not sensibly accelerated. The important application which the able thought he could make of this experiment will be seen hereafter.\n\nWhen an inflated vessel is electrified, and an inflated body, such as a ball-electrometer, is suspended within the cavity of the vessel, the body shows no signs of electrical attraction or repulsion.\n\nThe experiment by which this principle is to be illustrated, is called the electrical well, and is thus described by Mr Cavallo.\n\n\"Place upon an electric stool a metal quart mug, or some other conducting body nearly of the same form and dimension; then tie a short cork-ball electrometer, of the kind represented fig. 16. (x), at the end of a silk thread proceeding from the ceiling of the room, or from any other proper support, so that the electrometer may be suspended within the mug, and no part of it may be above the mouth; this done, electrify the mug, by giving it a spark with an excited electric or otherwise, and you will see that the electrometer, whilst it remains in that inflated situation, even if it be made to touch the sides of the mug, is not attracted by it, nor does it acquire any electricity; but if, whilst it stands suspended within the mug, a conductor standing out of the mug be made to communicate with, or only presented to it, then the electrometer acquires an electricity contrary to that of the mug, and a quantity of it, which is proportionable to the body with which it has been made to communicate; and it is then immediately attracted by the mug.\n\nIf, by raising the silk thread a little, part of the electrometer, i.e. of its linen threads, be lifted just above the mouth of the mug, the balls will be immediately attracted; for then, by the action of the electricity of the mug, it will acquire a contrary electricity, by giving to, or receiving the electric power from, the air above the cavity of the mug.\"\n\nThis experiment may be made in greater perfection by employing a globular glass vessel, with a narrow neck just sufficient to admit the electrometer, which should be fastened to a crooked glass rod, so that it may be presented to any part of the cavity. The outside of the vessel should be smeared with some clammy substance, as syrup or treacle, and may be inflated by placing it on a wine glass. The balls presented to the outside when the vessel is electrified, will be repelled, but presented to any part of the inside, they will show no signs of electricity, unless touched with some substance, as a wire, while within the cavity; when, on being taken out, they will repel each other.\n\nThis experiment was invented by Dr Franklin, and is called by him the electrical cup.\n\nCHAP.

Of the diversities exhibited by the electric power in its passage from pointed surfaces, and from obtuse surfaces.\n\nWhen the electric power passes between an electrified body and a pointed conductor, a luminous stream is produced, attended with a current of air from the point.\n\nExper. 1.—Fix a metallic point in the prime conductor, and let the machine in motion. No crackling, but rather a hissing noise, will be heard, and a light will appear as if issuing from the point, and on holding the hand near it, a strong blast of air will be found to proceed from it. On holding another point at the distance of about half an inch from the point in the prime conductor, a stream of light will be seen passing between them, attended with a crackling noise. This current of air will be sufficiently strong to turn any light bodies which are freely suspended, and in this way the following pleasing experiments may be made.\n\nExper. 2.—Cut a round flat piece of cork, with the edges very smooth, and stick a number of small crow quills into the circumference, with the feather ends as represented in fig. 23.; pass a needle through the centre of the cork, and suspend this needle by a small magnet m; on holding the cork near the point\n\n(N) Instead of the electrometer, there may be used any other kind of small conducting body; but that seems best adapted to such experiments.\nChap. II.\n\nELECTRICITY.\n\nPrinciples of point, the current of air will make it move round with great swiftness.\n\nExper. 3.—Let four arms of wire, with their extremities pointed and turned all in the same direction, be stuck in the circumference of a small circular piece of light wood, supported on a pointed wire, as represented in fig. 24. On bringing the wires near the point in the conductor, while the machine is in motion, they will move swiftly round as before, and in the dark, a beautiful circle of fire will be produced by the light issuing from the points. If figures of dogs, horses, &c. formed of elder pith, be stuck on the points, they will appear as if pursuing each other, thus forming what Mr Kinnerley called the electrical horse-race.\n\nExper. 4.—Fix eight bells near the edge of a circular board supported on four feet, as represented fig. 25, having a glass pillar e in the centre, terminated by a point g. On this point place the pointed wires used in the last experiment, hanging from one of them as d, a small glass clapper by a filken thread; and connecting the apparatus by a chain h, proceeding from the prime conductor. On setting the machine in motion, the wire will move round, and the clapper ring the bells.\n\nExper. 5.—By this motion of circulating points we may in some measure imitate the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, forming what is called the electrical orrery. Let a single wire, with the extremities pointed and turned as before, be nicely balanced on a point; fix a small glass ball over its centre, as a, fig. 26, to represent the sun. At one extremity of the wire, let a small wire be soldered perpendicularly, and on this balance another small wire with its ends pointed and turned, and having a small pith ball w in its centre to represent the earth, and a smaller ball of the same kind at one of the angles for the moon. Let the whole be supported upon a glass pillar, and be conducted by a chain proceeding from the prime conductor to the wire supporting the glass ball. Now, when the machine is put in motion, the wires will turn round, so that the ball representing the earth will move round the central ball, and the little ball at the angle of the smaller wire will at the same time revolve about the earth.\n\nExper. 6.—The power exerted by electricity upon points, may under some circumstances be made to counteract the power of gravitation. Let an inclined plane be formed of two parallel wires fastened by their extremities to four pillars of solid glass, M, N, O, P, fig. 27, fixed in a board so that the two at one end shall be higher than the other two. Then fix a wire with its ends pointed and turned in the same direction, at right angles upon a wire axis. When this axis is laid upon the inclined plane, it will of course roll to the bottom, but if, when it has nearly arrived there, the machine be put in motion, the wire will return up the plane, revolving on its axis.\n\nExper. 7.—Take a small lock of cotton, extended in every direction as much as can conveniently be done, and by a linen thread about five or six inches long, or by a thread drawn out of the same cotton, tie it to the end of the prime conductor; then set the machine in motion, and the lock of cotton on being electrified, will immediately swell, by repelling its filaments from one another, and will stretch itself towards the nearest conductor. In this situation let the cylinder be kept in motion, and present the end of your finger, or the knob of a wire, towards the lock of cotton, which will then immediately move towards the finger, and endeavour to touch it; but take with the other hand a pointed needle, and present its point towards the cotton, a little above the end of the finger, and the cotton will be observed immediately to shrink upwards, and move towards the prime conductor. Remove the needle, and the cotton will come again towards the finger. Present the needle, and the cotton will shrink again.\n\nWhen the electric power passes between an electrified body and a conductor whose surface is obtuse, a luminous spark is produced, attended with an explosion, and these appearances are more or less strong in proportion as the surfaces are more or less obtuse.\n\nExper. 1.—When the prime conductor is situated in its proper place, and electrified by whirling the sparks cylinder, if a metallic wire with a ball at its extremity, or the knuckle of a finger, be presented to the prime conductor, a spark will be seen to issue between them, which will be more vivid, and will be attended with a greater or less explosion, according as the ball is larger. The strongest and most vivid sparks are drawn from that end or side of the prime conductor, which is farthest from the cylinder. The sparks have the same appearance whether they be taken from the positive or the negative conductor; they sometimes appear like a long line of fire reaching from the prime conductor to the opposed body, and often (particularly when the spark is long, and different conducting substances in the line of its direction) it will have the appearance of being bent to sharp angles in different places, exactly resembling a flash of lightning.\n\nThe figure of the spark varies with the superficial dimensions of the part from which it is taken. If it be drawn from a ball of two or three inches in diameter, it will have the appearance of a straight line; but if the ball from which it is drawn be much smaller, as half an inch in diameter, it will assume the zig-zag appearance above mentioned.\n\nWe have just seen that when the electric power passes from a point to a point, there are no sparks, but a luminous stream appears; but if the point be obliterated, by being thrust back so as to be on a level with the surface of the conductor, by being held between the fingers &c., the sparks will appear as before.\n\nThe length of the spark, or the distance through the length of air which it strikes from the conductor, depends on several circumstances; as, the length and diameter of the conductor; the termination of the surface from which, or to which, the spark passes; the dimensions of the cylinder; and the position of the conductor.\n\n1. If the conducting body be increased in length only, the distance of the spark will be shortened. This fact was very early observed by Dr Priestley. He found that a spark from the end of a wire several yards in length, and about one fourth of an inch in diameter, was not longer than one taken from a conductor two feet in length, and two inches in diameter. Signor Volta found, that when he connected several rods, eight feet long, and half an inch in diameter, suspended at the distance of eight inches from each other, the spark drawn from them was not so long as one drawn from a conductor of the same length, but of twelve inches diameter.\nMr. Brook of Norwich connected nearly twenty rods of wood covered with tin-foil, near seven feet long, and three-fourths of an inch in diameter, at about a foot from each other, so that the whole apparatus resembled a large gridiron, which was suspended from the ceiling by glass rods. From so large an extent of conducting surface no spark exceeding six inches could be drawn; whereas from a conductor eight feet long, and five inches in diameter, sparks may often be drawn above nine inches long, with the same cylinder.\n\n2. If the diameter of the conductor be increased in proportion to its length, the spark is not so long as when it is shortened, while the diameter is increased. A conductor twelve feet long, and eight inches in diameter, does not yield a spark above half the length that may be drawn from a conductor of the same diameter, only six feet long.\n\n3. The spark will strike to a greater distance, according as the cylinder is smaller in proportion to the conductor. A much longer and more violent spark was drawn from Mr. Brook's gridiron conductor with a cylinder only four inches in diameter than from a conductor five feet long, and five inches in diameter, with the same cylinder.\n\n4. The length of the spark is greater from a ball of moderate dimensions than from the surface of the prime conductor.\n\n5. The spark will be longer when the conductor is placed parallel to the cylinder, than when it is at right angles with the cylinder.\n\nThe sound of the spark varies according as the surfaces between which it strikes are more or less obtuse. It is louder when the spark is taken from the prime conductor, than when taken from a ball annexed to it; and it is loudest of all when the spark strikes from one flat surface to another: a straight spark is always louder than one of the zig-zag appearance. If the spark be made to pass from one end of a glass tube (clothed at both ends and very dry) to the other, the sound is entirely hushed.\n\nWhen the spark is received by the knuckle it produces a sensation which is, more or less painful. It is more pungent when received from the prime conductor than from a ball attached to it. The spark produces a more painful sensation in proportion as it is shorter.\n\nThe most remarkable circumstance attending the electric spark is the light (60) produced in its passage through the air. The sparks which usually pass between the rubber of the negative conductor, through the cylinder to the points of the positive conductor, are of a beautiful light blue colour; but when the spark passes between the prime conductor and a ball of the diameter of an inch, its edges are purplish, and from these diverge several ramifications of a purple or indigo colour. If the balls between which the spark passes are not more than half an inch distance from each other, a continued stream of the most brilliant light will be produced, attended with a whizzing noise. If the distance of the balls from each other be increased, sparks equally brilliant will be produced; but their succession will be less quick, and no continued stream will appear.\n\nThe light emitted from electrified conductors is more copious and brilliant in proportion as their surfaces are more extended. If a person standing on an inflating stool, and connected with the prime conductor of a machine in motion, hold a flat plate of metal, as a pewter plate, while another person standing on the floor holds another plate, large flames of vivid light will appear between the plates, so as to illuminate a dark room.\n\nSoon after the cylinder is set in motion, and sparks begin to issue, a peculiar odour may be perceived; and if the machine acts well, this is very powerful. It is difficult to describe this odour, but it seems to resemble that of phosphorus.\n\nCHAP. III. Of charging and discharging the Leyden Phial; with directions for the construction of Jars and Batteries.\n\nThe electric power is communicated to electric vessels with difficulty, unless their surfaces be covered with some conducting substance; but it may be accumulated on them in a much greater degree than on conductors.\n\nExper. 1.—Take a common tumbler or glass dancing jar, and having placed a brass ball in one of the holes of the prime conductor, let the machine in motion, and let the balls touch the inside of the tumbler; while the ball touches only one point, no more of the surface of the glass will be electrified, but by moving the tumblers about so as to make the ball touch many points successively, all these points will be electrified, as will appear by turning down the tumbler over a number of pith or cork balls placed on a table. These balls will immediately begin to fly about, thus showing the electric attraction and repulsion illustrated in (61). This experiment is commonly called the experiment of the dancing balls, and is represented at fig. 28.\n\nExper. 2.—Let a glass jar, either cylindrical, such as is represented at fig. 12, Plate CLXXXVII., or with the mouth as wide a mouth as possible, be covered on both its inside and outside surfaces to within two inches of the top, with tin foil fastened on by means of gum water. The jar is then said to be coated. Fit to the mouth of the jar a piece of baked wood, through the centre of which pass a wire, whose lower extremity is terminated by a number of other wires, which must be made to touch the inside coating, while its upper extremity projects an inch or two above the mouth of the jar, and terminates in a metallic ball a. This ball should be perforated so as to receive a wire supporting a quadrant electrometer.\n\nThe jar being thus prepared, let the knob a communicate with the prime conductor, and let it remain charging while the cylinder is in motion till the ball c of the electrometer stands nearly horizontal; the jar is then said to be charged. It may be removed from the conductor.\n\n(o) The first person who seems to have observed the electric light was Otto Guericke. He appears indeed only to have had a glimpse of it; and the first who perceived it in any great degree was Dr Wall, on rubbing a pretty large piece of amber. Vid. Philos. Trans. abridged, vol. ii.\nLet there be provided a curved brass rod, terminating at each end in a knob, and furnished with a glass handle, such as Def; if now one of the knobs, as e, be made to approach the ball a of the jar, while the other knob f touches the outside coating, a considerable explosion will take place, and the jar will lose its electricity, as will appear by the ball of the electroscope falling into a perpendicular situation.\n\nThe jar is then said to be discharged, and the rod Def is called a discharging rod.\n\nA jar or phial of glass thus constructed is, for a reason which will presently appear, called a Leyden jar or phial.\n\nIn this experiment, the jar is not charged to its utmost height. If, instead of stopping when the index of the quadrant is nearly at right angles, we persist in charging, there will soon appear several luminous streams passing from the prime conductor across the cylinder to the cushion. Presently an explosion will take place from the phial, and this is called its spontaneous discharge. If the phial is not very strong, it will probably either be broken, or on examination will be found perforated in some part. If the glass be very thin, a spontaneous discharge will soon take place, attended with a harsh cracking noise, and the phial will certainly be cracked. A spontaneous discharge happens much more readily when the neck of the phial is very small, and consequently the wire comes very near the uncoated part of the glass.\n\nIf the uncoated part of the glass be moist or dusty, the jar will not receive a charge, so that it is necessary to be very careful in cleaning the jar before using it. When the uncoated part is made very hot, the spontaneous discharge is much accelerated.\n\nThe appearance of the uncoated part of the jar, when the discharge is made in the dark, is very curious. A great number of luminous streams will be seen pouring over the edge of the jar from the inside to the outside.\n\nThe force of the explosion depends very much on the termination of the extremity of the discharging rod. If this be terminated by a large ball, the noise will be much greater than when the ball is small; if it be terminated by a small obtuse surface, a hissing noise is heard before the explosion, and this is faint. But if the rod terminate in a point, no explosion will take place, but the jar will be silently discharged.\n\nIn the above experiment the jar is charged positively, it having been in contact with the positive conductor; but if it be connected with the negative conductor, the jar will be charged negatively. This will be more fully illustrated by and by.\n\nAs the accumulation of the electric power by means of coated jars forms one of the most important discoveries which have been made in this science, we shall here relate the method in which the discovery was made.\n\nThis discovery was accidental, and was the result of an experiment made in the end of the year 1745 by M. Van Kleift, dean of the cathedral in Cammin, who sent the following account of it to Dr Leibekuhn at Berlin.\n\nWhen a nail or a piece of thick brass-wire, &c., is put into a small apothecary's phial, and electrified, remarkable effects follow; but the phial must be very dry or warm. I commonly rub it once before hand with a finger, on which I put some pounded chalk. If a little mercury, or a few drops of spirits of wine, be put into it, the experiment succeeds the better. As soon as this phial and nail are removed from the electrifying glass, or the prime conductor to which it has been exposed, is taken away, is taken away, it throws out a pencil of flame so long, that with this burning machine in my hand, I have taken above sixty steps in walking about my room. When it is electrified strongly, I can take it into another room, and there fire spirits of wine with it. If, while it is electrifying, I put my finger, or a piece of gold, which I hold in my hand, to the nail, I receive a shock which stuns my arms and shoulders.\n\nA tin tube, or a man placed upon electrics, is electrified much stronger by this means than in the common way. When I present this phial and nail to a tin tube, which I have, fifteen feet long, nothing but experience can make a person believe how strongly it is electrified. Two thin glasses have been broken by the shock of it. It appears to me extraordinary, that when this phial and nail are in contact with either conducting or non-conducting matter, the strong shock does not follow. I have cemented it to wood, metal, glass, sealing-wax, &c., when I have electrified without any great effect.\n\nM. Van Kleift communicated this experiment to several of his acquaintances, but they all for some time failed in their attempts to repeat it.\n\nAn experiment of a similar kind was soon after made at Leyden by Mr Cuneus. Making an attempt to communicate the electric power to water, contained in a phial, in which was a nail, happening to hold his glass in one hand, while he disengaged it from the prime conductor with the other, when he imagined that the water had received as much electricity as it was capable of acquiring, he was surprised with a sudden shock in his arms and breast, which he had not in the least expected.\n\nThis experiment was afterwards repeated in the presence of M. M. Allamand and Muffchenbroeck with similar results; and as it was at Leyden that the experiment was made with the greatest success, and afterwards improved, it obtained the name of the Leyden experiment, and a phial so constructed as to exhibit similar phenomena, has been ever since called a Leyden phial.\n\nIndeed the philosophers of Leyden seem to have views of some merit in this discovery, which with them does which led not appear to have been merely accidental. The views to this discovery, which are said to have led to it were as follows:\n\nProfessor Muffchenbroeck and his friends, observing that electrified bodies, exposed to the common atmosphere, which is always replete with conducting particles of various kinds, soon lost their electricity, and were capable of retaining but a small quantity of it, imagined, that were the electric bodies terminated on all sides by original electrics, they might be capable of receiving a stronger power, and retaining it a longer time. Glass being the most convenient electric for this purpose, and water the most convenient non-electric, they first made progressive improvements with water in close bottles.\n\nFor a long time water and spirit of wine were the only conductors employed in this experiment; but it was\nELECTRICITY.\n\nPrinciples of was soon found by Dr Watson, that the experiment succeeded better when the outside of the glass was coated with some metallic leaf, as sheet-lead, or tin-foil, while the phial contained some water within; and after this there was a natural transition to the use of an internal as well as external metallic coating, and thus the Leyden phial was completed in its present form (p).\n\nA number of coated jars having their internal coatings connected together by metallic wires, constitute what is called a battery. Fig. 14. represents an electrical battery of the most approved form, containing nine jars. The bottom of the box is covered with tin-foil to connect the exterior coatings; the inside coatings of the jars are connected by the wires \\(a b c, d e f, g h i\\), which meet in the large ball \\(A\\); a ball \\(B\\) proceeds from the inside, by which the circuit may be conveniently completed. In one side of the box, near the bottom, is a hole through which a brass hook passes, and which communicates with the metallic lining of the box, and consequently with the outside coating of the jars. To this wire or chain is occasionally connected when a discharge is made; and for the more convenient making of this discharge, a ball and wire, \\(B\\), proceed to a convenient distance from the centre of the ball \\(A\\). When the whole force of the battery is not required, one, two, or three jars may be removed, only by pressing down the wires belonging to them, until their extremities can slip out of their respective holes in the brass ball, and then turning them into such a posture that they cannot have any communication with the battery. The number of jars represented in this figure is rather small for some purposes; but it is better to join two or three small batteries, rather than have a single large one, which is inconvenient on account of its weight and unwieldiness.\n\nAs coated jars form one of the most expensive parts of an electrical apparatus, it is of consequence that the electrician should himself be able to adjust them for experiment, and repair the coating, &c., when injured. We shall therefore give particular directions for the preparation of jars and batteries. The circumstances necessary to be attended to, respect principally the form of the coated electric, the substance employed as an electric, and the conductor employed as a coating.\n\nFor most experiments the best form is that of a cylindrical jar, in which the mouth is large enough to admit the introduction of the hand. A phial of this form is much more easily coated, cleaned, or repaired, than one of any other form. Mr Cuthbertson used to make his jars entirely cylindrical, but now he is of opinion that it is better to have the mouth a little contracted, and he has of late always made his jars of this latter form. For illustrating the theory of coated electrics, as we shall see hereafter, plates are the most convenient, and they are also useful in some experiments. Dr Robison prefers bottles of a globular form to any other, and he commonly employed the balloons used in distillation, which he says make excellent jars. The principles of bottles employed for holding mineral acids also make electricity very good jars, but they are rather inferior to the bottles illustrated, as having very thick bottoms. For ordinary purposes, where a glass-bottle is at a great distance, common green glass bottles or apothecary's phials with the mouths as wide as possible, will answer very well.\n\nWith respect to the electric employed for this purpose, glass is to be preferred on many accounts, and of employed this the best kind, as flint or crystal; but the expense here becomes a very considerable object, especially as the jars of a battery are very apt to break by reason of the inequality of their strength; for it should seem that the force of the electric power in a battery is equally distributed among all the bottles, without any regard to their capacities of receiving a charge singly considered. Thus if we express the quantity of charge which one jar can easily receive, by the number 10, we ought not to connect such a jar in a battery with one whose capacity is only 8; because the whole force of electricity expressed by 10 will be directed also against that whose capacity is only 8, so that the latter will be in danger of being broken. It will be proper, therefore, to compare the bottles with one another in this respect before putting them together in a battery. Besides the consideration of the absolute capacity which each bottle has of receiving a charge, the time which is taken up in charging it must also be attended to, and the jars of a battery ought to be as equal as possible in this respect as well as the former. The thinner a glass is, the more readily it receives a charge, and vice versa; but it does not follow from thence, as was formerly imagined, that on account of its thinness it is capable of containing a greater charge than a thicker one. The reverse is actually the case; and though a thick glass cannot be charged in such a short time as a thin one, it is nevertheless capable of containing a greater degree of electric power. In fact, if the glass be thinner than one-eighth of an inch, the phial will not bear any considerable charge. If the thickness of the glass be very great, no charge can indeed be given it; but experiments have not yet determined how great the thickness must be which will prevent any charge. Indeed it is observed, that though a thick glass cannot be charged by a weak electrical machine, it may be by a more powerful one, whence it seems reasonable to suppose that there is no real limit of this kind; but that if a machine could be made sufficiently powerful, glasses of any thickness might be charged.\n\nGlass is attended with one considerable inconvenience; that it is very apt to attract moisture, and therefore the jars acquire perpetual care in wiping before they are used; and this, when a large battery is employed, becomes a very troublesome operation. It is the uncoated part of the jar which is injured by the moisture, for it is found, that if the coating be moist, the jar is more easily and more completely charged.\n\nElectricians\n\n(p) Dr Watson was indebted for the hint of a metallic coating to Dr Bevis, who was also the first electrician that employed a plate of glass coated on both sides in performing the experiments with coated electrics. Hence the coated plate is often called, especially by the continental electricians, Bevis's plate, or square, le carreau de Bevis.\nElectricians have often endeavoured to find some other electric which might answer better than glass for this purpose, at least be cheaper; but except Father Beccaria's method, which may be used very well, no remarkable discovery has been made relating to this point. He took equal quantities of very pure colophonium and powder of marble fitted exceeding fine, and kept them in a hot place a considerable time, where they became perfectly free from moisture; he then mixed them, and melted the composition in a proper vessel over the fire, and when melted, poured it upon a table, upon which he had previously stuck a piece of tin-foil, within two or three inches of the edge of the table. This done, he endeavoured with a hot iron to spread the mixture as equally as possible, and to the thickness of one-tenth of an inch all over the table; he afterwards coated it with another piece of tin-foil, reaching within about two inches of the edge of the mixture; in short he coated a plate of this mixture as he would a plate of glass. This coated plate seems, from what he says, to have had a greater power than a glass plate of the same dimensions: even when the weather was not very dry, and if it is not liable to be easily broken by a spontaneous discharge, it may be conveniently employed in place of glass; for it does not very readily attract moisture, and consequently may hold a charge better and longer than glass, besides when broken, it may be again repaired by means of a hot iron, whereas a broken plate or vessel of glass can seldom be employed again.\n\nTalc, or Muscovy glass, is one of the most convenient electrics for the purposes of coating. It is not very apt to contract moisture, and will retain a charge for a very considerable time.\n\nA very convenient portable phial may be constructed of sealing wax in the following manner: Procure a phial made of tin-plate, or white-iron (as it is called in Scotland), with a long neck; cover the outside of this phial with sealing wax as far as the neck, and coat the sealing wax to within a little of the neck with tin-foil. In this phial it is evident that the sealing wax is the electric, of which the tin-foil forms the outer and the tin-plate the inner coating.\n\nWhen plates or jars having a sufficiently large opening are to be coated, the best method is to coat them with tin-foil on both sides, which may be fixed upon the glass with varnish, gum water, bees wax, &c.; but in case the jars have not an aperture wide enough to admit the tin-foil, and an instrument to adapt it to the surface of the glass, brads filings, such as are sold by the pin-makers, may be advantageously used; and these may be stuck on with gum water, bees wax, &c., but not with varnish, for this is apt to be set on fire by the discharge. Care must be taken that the coating do not come very near the mouth of the jar, for that will cause the jar to discharge itself. If the coating is about two inches below the top, it will in general do very well; but there are some kinds of glass, especially ringed glass, that when coated and charged have the property of discharging themselves more easily than others, even when the coating is five or six inches below the edge.\n\nIt is much more difficult to coat vessels of a globular form than plates or cylindrical jars; but the former may be coated with tolerable ease by attending to the method of cutting the tin-foil. This should be cut into the form of guillets as in covering a globe or in making a balloon; and they should be patted on, so as to overlap each other about half an inch. After having coated the sides of a balloon in this manner, the bottom is to be covered with a circular piece of tin-foil. The thinner the foil, the better it is adapted for the inside coating; and it may readily be applied by first patting it upon paper, and then patting either the paper or the foil next the glass.\n\nIn coating plates of glass it is better to cut the tin-foil into circular pieces, as it is found that a circular space is capable of giving as great a charge to the glass, as a square coating of the same breadth, and a spontaneous discharge does not so readily take place from the circular edge, as from the edges of a square coating.\n\nMr Brooke discovered, that when jars were coated with tin-foil first patted upon paper, they were rendered much less liable to be broken by the discharge. As coating, the trials which led to this discovery afford a useful lesson to the young electrician, we shall relate them in his own words.\n\n\"In making electrical experiments, and in particular those in which the Leyden phial is concerned, a method of preserving the bottles or jars from being struck through by the electric power, is very desirable; but I do not know that it has hitherto been accomplished. The number of them that have been destroyed in many of my experiments, have led me to various conjectures to preserve them: at the same time I have been obliged to make use of bottles instead of open-mouthed jars. And as coating the former withinside is very troublesome, it has put me on thinking of some method more easy, quicker, and equally firm and good, as with tin-foil. With respect to the new method of coating, I failed; though something else presented itself rather in favour of the former: therefore, introducing the process here will not be of very great use; unless in saving another the trouble of making use of the same method, or giving a hint towards the former so as to succeed with certainty. My aim was to find something that should be quick and clean, and not easy to come off with the rubbing of wires against it, and yet a good conductor. My first essay was with a cement of pitch, rosin, and wax, melted together; into which, to make it a good conductor, I put a large proportion of finely fitted brass filings. When this mixture was cold, I put broken pieces of it into the bottle, and warmed the bottle till it was hot enough to melt the cement in it so as to run, and cover the bottle withinside; then I coated the outside with tin-foil, as is commonly done, and now it was fit for use or ready to be charged, to which I next proceeded; and I believe I had not made more than four or five turns of the winch, before it spontaneously struck through the glass with a very small charge. I then took off the outside coating, and flopped the fracture with some of my common cement, after which I put the coating on again; and in as little time as before, it was struck through again in a different place; and thus I did with this bottle five or six times; sometimes it struck through the glass in four different places. This made me consider what it might be that facilitated the spontaneous striking through the glass, and likewise what might retard it. I had, long before,\nPrinciples of before, thought that jars or bottles appeared to be struck through with a much less charge, just after their being coated, or before they were dry, than when they had been coated long enough for the moisture to be evaporated from the paste, with which I mostly lay on the tin-foil, and could only consider the dry paste as a kind of mediator between the tin-foil and the glass, or in other words, that the moisture in the paste was a better conductor and more in actual contact with the glass than the paste itself when dry. And the coating the bottles with the heated cement, though long afterward, did not alter my former idea; for it appeared as if the hot cement, with the conducting substance in it, might be still more in actual contact with the glass than the moisture in the paste. On these probabilities I had to consider what might act as a kind of mediator more effectually than the dry paste, between the glass and the tin-foil. It occurred, that common writing paper, as being neither a good conductor nor insulator, might be serviceable by being first pasted smoothly to the tin-foil, and left to dry. The paper then being pasted on one side, having the tin-foil on the other, I put them on the glass together with the tin-foil outward, and rubbed them down smooth. This succeeded so well that I have never since had any struck through that were thus done, either common phials or large bottles, which contain near three gallons each, though some of the latter have stood in the battery in common use with the others for a long time. And as I have never had one struck through that has been prepared in this way, I am much less able at present to tell how great a charge they will bear before they are struck through, or whether they will be struck through at all.*\n\nThe mineral acids serve very well for an inside coating to jars; but their use is attended with some risk, from their corrosive quality.\n\nThe wire through which the charge is made, should not be less than the fourth of an inch in diameter; it should be terminated by a metallic ball, at least one inch in diameter.\n\nIf the phials be intended to be frequently removed from one place to another, the charging wire must be fastened so as to be always steady in the centre of the phial. For this purpose, some employ a piece of wood, to fit the mouth of the phial like a lid, but the length of insulation which separates the coating from the phial is thus diminished, and consequently, as we shall see hereafter, the phial is more liable to a gradual spontaneous discharge, so that it is much more difficult to charge it. The wire is best fastened below the edge of the inner coating, and in this way Mr Cuthbertson constructed his jars, the mouth being left entirely open.\n\nWhen the phial is not to be removed from the situation in which it is charged, the wire may be fastened to the conductor.\n\nBatteries may be formed either of plates or jars. A very commodious battery may be made in the following manner. Select a number of plates of the best crown glass that are very flat and thin; coat them on each side with a circular piece of tin-foil patted in the middle of the plate, so as to leave a margin sufficiently wide to prevent a spontaneous discharge; let a narrow lip of tin-foil pass from the circumference of the coating on each side, and lay the plates upon each other so that these lips may coincide. Let the lips be connected at their ends by a wire which touches them all; then if one of these lips is connected with the prime conductor, and the other with the ground, the whole may be charged or discharged together. If we wish to have a number of these plates connected so as to form a perpetual battery, they may be cemented by covering the tin-coated margins with melted pitch, and pressing the plates down on each other while the pitch is soft till the coatings touch each other. But if we desire to make use only of a few of the plates at a time, and to vary their number, they may be placed upon their edges in an open frame; and when we wish to make a break in the chain of plates, this may easily be done by placing one of them at right angles to the rest.\n\nA very convenient battery may be formed in this way with coated plates of Mucovoy glass; but great caution is necessary in the use of such plates, as they are very easily broken by a spontaneous discharge, and it is not easy to discover where the crack has happened.\n\nMr Brooke of Norwich, constructed his batteries, which appear to have been very powerful, of green Brooke's glass bottles. Some of them, like that represented in mode of the figure, had only nine of these bottles; but when a greater power was wanted, more were added. Jarseries would have been preferred to bottles, on account of their being more easily coated by reason of their wide mouths; but being less easily procured, he was content to put up with this inconvenience. The mean size of these bottles was about eight inches in diameter; they were coated ten inches high, and made of the thickest and strongest glass that could be procured, weighing from five pounds and a half to seven pounds each. In the construction of a battery of twenty-seven bottles, he disposed of them in three rows; nine of the stoutest and best composing the first row, nine of the next in strength being disposed in the second, and the third containing the nine weakest. All of these were of green glass, but not of the same kind. Some of those which stood in the foremost row, were composed of a kind very much like that of which Frontignac wine bottles are made; and our author remarks, that this kind of glass seems to be by much the best, as being both harder and stronger, and less liable to break by a high charge. The second and third rows of the battery consisted of bottles whose diameter was from six and a half to ten inches, and which were coated from eight and a half to eleven inches high; none of their mouths being larger than an inch and a half, nor less than three quarters of an inch.\n\nAll the bottles of this battery, as well as the single ones which he commonly made use of in his experiments, were coated both on the inside and outside with lips of tin-foil from three-eighths to three-fourths of an inch wide, laid on with paste of flour and water, at the distance of about a flip between each.\n\nMr G. Morgan lays down the following requisites as essential in the construction of a battery.\n\n1. Its connecting wires should be perfectly free from all points and edges.\n\n2. The connecting wires should be easily moveable, so that when accident has lessened the number of phials,\nPrinciples of the number of wires may be reduced so as to correspond with the remaining quantity of glass.\n\n3. The phials should not be crowded; for in such a case, if necessity should oblige us to employ phials of different heights or sizes, the tin-foil of the higher ones, being in contact with the uncoated glass of the lower ones, the inflation will thus be rendered less complete.\n\n4. The size of the phials should not be large; for though an increase of magnitude lessens the trouble of cleaning, it at the same time increases the expense of repairing damages which frequently occur.\n\n5. The several wires should be fixed very steadily, or in such a manner as not to admit of any shaking.\n\n6. The battery should take up the least possible room; for as it increases in size, so is the probability increased of its being exposed to the influence of surrounding conductors.\n\nThe first electrical battery appears to have been constructed in the year 1746 by Mr Gralath, a German. Dr Franklin constructed a battery consisting of eleven plates of common window glass, and with this he made most of the experiments which will be mentioned hereafter. The construction of the battery was greatly improved by Dr Priestley, who formed them of considerable size and power. In his history he describes and figures one consisting of sixty-four jars, each ten inches high, and two inches and a half in diameter, and the whole battery containing 32 square feet of coated surface.\n\nBut the most complete electrical batteries are those made by Mr Cuthbertson for Teyler's museum at Haarlem. Of these batteries there are two, differing in their magnitude and mode of construction, but allowed to be equally perfect. The first was completed in the year 1784, and is composed of 135 jars in nine boxes, which may be used separately or combined, as the nature of the experiment requires. Each box is a separate battery of itself; and the description of one box will be sufficient for explaining its construction and use. Each box contains 15 jars; each jar is 11 inches high, and six inches in diameter, contracted at the mouth to four inches, and coated so as to contain 140 square inches; and thus the whole battery will contain about 132 square feet of coated surface. Each box is divided into 15 partitions, five of which are in the length and three in the breadth; the height of the sides of the box being somewhat lower than the coating of the jars, as are also the partitions in which they stand. The lid of the box is made without hinges, for the convenience of releasing it from the box, that it may be removed while experiments are performed. It is taken off by lifting it upwards. The outside coatings of the jars are connected by means of crofs wires passing under the bottom of each jar; and those on the inside by means of a brass frame, bearing 15 brass balls, fixed upon the frame above the centre of each jar. All these balls, excepting the four at the corners, have wires screwed to them and hanging downwards into the inside of each jar; but the wires of the four corner jars are screwed to a foot, which is cemented to the bottom of each in the inside. Upon these wires the whole frame rests, and is kept in its proper position. The four corner balls have holes, which receive the ends of the wires, and terminate at a proper height from the jars. By this contrivance the inside connecting frame may at any time be easily removed. It is according to the above principles of construction that Mr Cuthbertson forms his present batteries, excepting that he has increased the size of the jars, so as to make one battery contain about 17 square feet; and he engages to prove by experiment, that the batteries of his construction are far superior to any others. Teyler's second grand battery was finished by Mr Cuthbertson in 1789. This is the largest and most complete battery that was ever made. It consists of 100 jars of the same shape with that of those already described, only that they are so enlarged in size, that each of them contains 5½ square feet of coated surface, instead of 140 inches, and the whole battery contains 550 square feet of coating; and for convenience, it is put into four separate cases, each containing 25 jars in the form of a square, five on each side. The boxes are lined with lead on the inside for forming the outside communication; each jar has a perpendicular stand resting upon its bottom, and supported from falling sideways by three stays on the inside. Upon the top is screwed a three-inch brass globe, from which proceeds a brass tube about one inch in diameter, to a large brass globe, supported by the middle jar at a proper height, so as to keep the inside communication properly arranged.\n\nVarious expedients have been thought of to repair Method of jars when cracked, and enable them to bear another charging charge, but they seem to have been attended with very little success. Mr Brooke found that when any of his bottles was broken by the discharge, it might be conveniently mended and made serviceable in the following manner. \"Take of Spanish white, eight ounces; heat it very hot in an iron ladle, to evaporate all the moisture; and when cool sift it through a lawn sieve; and three ounces of pitch, three quarters of an ounce of rosin, and half an ounce of bees wax; heat them all together over a gentle fire, stirring the whole frequently for near an hour; then take it off the fire, and continue the stirring till it is cold and fit for use.\" The bottles cemented with this composition, however, were not judged to be sufficiently strong to stand in their original place, but were removed to the second or third row, as it was apprehended they could best sustain the charge.\n\nIn relating the experiment of charging and discharging a Leyden phial, we have briefly described the discharging charging rod. Discharging rods are made of various rod forms and dimensions; fig. 13 represents one of the most common forms. It is convenient that the legs should move upon a hinge, so that the balls may be placed at a greater or lesser distance as occasion may require; the extremities of the legs should terminate in points, and the balls be made to screw on and off at pleasure.\n\nFig. 29. represents Mr Henry's universal discharger; Mr Henry's instrument of very extensive use in forming communications between jars, or directing the shock through any particular substance. AB is a flat board fifteen inches long, four broad, and one thick, and forming the basis of the instrument. DC are two glass pillars cemented in two holes upon the board AB, and furnished at their tops with brass caps; each of which has a turning joint, and supports a spring tube, through which the wires EF and ET slide. Each of these caps is composed of three pieces of brass, connected with each other in such a manner, that the wire EF, besides its\nPrinciples of its sliding through the socket, has two other motions, viz. a horizontal one, and a vertical one. Each of the wires is furnished with an open ring at one end, and at the other has a brass ball; which, by a short spring socket, is slipped upon its pointed extremity, and may be removed from it at pleasure. HG is a circular piece of wood five inches diameter, having a lip of ivory inlaid on its surface, and furnished with a strong cylindrical foot, which fits the cavity of the socket I. This socket is fixed in the middle of the bottom board, and has a screw at K; by which the foot of the circular board is made fast at any required height.\n\nFig. 30. is a small press belonging to this instrument. It consists of two oblong pieces of wood, which are forced together by the two screws, a, a. The lower end has a circular foot equal to that of the circular table H. When this press is to be used, it must be fixed into the socket I, in place of the circular board HG; which in that case is to be removed.\n\nMr G. Morgan gives the following rules for the construction and use of discharging instruments.\n\n1. They should be constructed so as to allow no other passage to the electric power, than that of the intended circuit.\n\n2. The conducting wires of the instrument should be made to come into contact with the inner surface of the coated electric as speedily as possible; for when approached gradually part of the charge is taken off previous to the explosion, the power of which is thus greatly diminished.\n\n3. The operator should not be within the atmosphere of the conductor at the time of making the discharge.\n\n4. The discharging instrument and the inside of the charged surface should be separated as rapidly as they were connected.\n\nOn these principles the instrument employed by Mr Morgan, in his experiments on the conducting power of various substances, is constructed, and is thus described by him.\n\nA and B, fig. 31. are two brass wheels, whose diameter is four or five inches; they are connected by an axis, which is made to turn easily in a collar, fixed upon the glass stem DM. The wires DC, and EF, are screwed into the circumference of the wheels, but on sides directly opposite to each other. The length of these wires is regulated by the distances at which the discharging rod is fixed from the conducting body, and their direction is perpendicular to the axis of the wheels. Two other wires are to be fixed perpendicularly to the planes of the wheels, to the circumference of which they are screwed as nearly as possible, but at opposite points, so that they may strike objects lying in the same line, parallel to the axis at the distance of half a revolution from each other. The length of these last wires is regulated by the distances at which they join the metallic or other connection that is formed with the outside of the coated phial.\n\nThe mode of using this discharging rod is as follows. When C is brought into contact with the conductor, it receives the electric power, and conveys it through G into the outside of the coated surface. The motion of C is not stopped by the contact, but the continuance of it brings E into the same contact by which the residue of the jar is conveyed through K to the outside. The glass stem should penetrate deeply into each of the caps, for the whole apparatus will be otherwise loosened and put out of order, by the necessary rapidity of the motion and the conglomeration of parts attending it.\n\nIf C, in its circumvolutions, strike against an immoveable body in connexion with the conductor, it is frequently stopped, and then its ball is injured, or a change unfavourable to the accuracy of the experiment takes place.\n\nTo prevent these inconveniences, C, fig. 32. strikes the ball A which is connected with the brass tube that penetrates into the conducting substance, with an elastic wire bent into the form of a spring. The points and edges of this instrument are rendered impotent by fattening a box to the brass tube, so that the ball A may move backwards and forwards in the hollow of it, when struck by C. The box should be made of hard wood, and its edge carefully turned and well polished.\n\nWhen a coated jar has been discharged, either spontaneously, or by a discharger, there is still a portion of the charge remaining, sufficient to give a slight shock, as will be found by grasping the outside with one hand, and with the other touching the ball of the wire. As this remaining charge, especially in large jars or batteries, is often so considerable as to give a pretty severe shock, it is therefore proper to caution the experimenter, not to touch the outside of the jar or battery, or any conductor which communicates with the inside at the same time.\n\nEvery machine will not charge jars equally well, but the power of charging will depend much on the goodness of the cylinder.\n\nIn a battery it sometimes happens, that one or more of the jars is more apt than the rest to undergo a spontaneous discharge, and in this case, the whole of the battery will be discharged at the same time, although the other jars, without this accident, would have contained a much higher charge.\n\nTo remedy the inconvenience of some of the jars in Mr Nairne's battery bursting at the time of the discharge, Mr Nairne proposed that the discharge should not be made through a perfect conductor of a shorter circuit than a battery five feet; and this method he found so effectual, that from being after he adapted it, he was able to discharge a battery broken by for a hundred times without breaking a single jar, a discharge which before was continually happening. It must be observed, however, as will appear soon, that when the circuit through which the discharge is made, is considerably lengthened, the force of the discharge is also proportionally diminished. Hence in many experiments, where it is necessary to employ the highest possible charge, this method of diminishing the risk of breaking the jars is inadmissible.\n\nIf a Leyden phial, or any other coated electric, be insulated or placed so that its external coating has no communication with conducting bodies, it cannot be charged. Place a Leyden phial on the insulating stool, or on a wine glass turned mouth downwards; connect the knob of the jar, or its outside coating, with the prime conductor, by means of a chain, and let the machine in motion. It will then be observed that the quadrant electrometer on the knob will soon rise to 90°, seeming to indicate that the jar is charged. On taking off the connection between the jar and the prime conductor, and endeavouring to discharge the jar by means of the discharging rod, or by the hands, it will however appear\nIf now the outside of the jar, still standing on the inflator, be connected with the floor, table, &c., by a chain, and then charged, the result will be very different as the jar will then receive its usual charge.\n\nIf a jar be inflated, and one side of it, instead of being connected with the earth, be connected with the insulated rubber, while the other side communicates with the prime conductor, the jar will be charged, and perhaps in a more expeditious manner.\n\nTo make the above experiment in a clearer and more satisfactory manner, place the jar upon the stool as before, and with its wire not in contact, but at about half an inch distance from the prime conductor; hold the knob of another wire at such a distance from the outside coating of the jar, as the knob of the jar is from the prime conductor, then let the winch of the machine be turned, and it will be observed, that whenever a spark comes from the prime conductor to the wire of the jar, another spark passes from the outside coating of the jar to the knob of the wire presented towards it. In this manner the jar becomes charged.\n\nIf instead of the knobbed wire, a pointed wire be presented to the outside of the jar, the point will appear illuminated with a star; and if instead of presenting any wire to the jar, a point be connected with its coating, the point will appear illuminated with a brush of rays which will last as long as the jar is charging.\n\nIf the knob of another jar be presented to the outside coating of the inflated jar in the above experiment, it will also be charged.\n\nThe charge of a coated jar, or any coated electric, resides in the jar, or electric, and not in the coating.\n\nTake an uncoated phial, and, for a coating on the outside, stick a piece of tinfoil with a little tallow or bees wax, so that it can just adhere to the glass; and for an inside coating put into the jar a quantity of small shot or of mercury; stop the mouth of the jar with a perforated cork, through which insert a knobbed wire, so as to communicate with the shot or the mercury. Then hold the phial thus coated, by its outside coating, and charge it by presenting the knob of the wire to the prime conductor. When it is charged, turn it upside down, so that the wire, and the mercury or shot within the jar, may fall into a dry glass vessel; then remove also the outside coating. During this operation the phial does not lose its charge; and if the shot or mercury be examined, it will be found that they are not more electrified than would happen to any other inflated body of equal conducting power, after having been in contact with the prime conductor. Now replace the outside coating on the phial, and pour into it the shot or mercury; then touch with one hand the outside coating, and with the other introduce a knobbed wire within the phial so as to touch the inside non-electric, and you will feel a shock, which will prove that the jar has lost very little of its charge by removing the coatings.\n\nThe same experiment may be more conveniently made by laying a pane of glass upon a metal plate, and covering an equal part of the upper surface with tin foil, having a silk thread fastened to one of its sides, by which it may be easily taken off when the glass is charged, and as easily replaced when required.\n\nThis important fact, that the charge in a coated electric resides in the electric and not in the coating, was ascertained by Dr Franklin.\n\nWhen he first began his experiments upon the Leyden phial, he imagined that the electric power was all accumulated in the substance of the non-electric in contact with the glass; but he afterwards found by the following ingenious analysis of the bottle, that the power of giving a shock lay in the glass itself, and not in the coating.\n\nIn order to find where the strength of the charged bottle lay, he placed it upon glass; then first took out the cork and the wire, and finding the virtue was not in them, he touched the outside coating with one hand, and put the finger of the other into the mouth of the bottle, when the shock was felt quite as strong as if the cork and the wire had been in it. He then charged the phial again, and pouring out the water into an empty bottle inflated, expected that if the force resided in the water it would give the shock, but he found it gave none. He then judged that the electric fire must either have been lost in decanting, or must remain in the bottle, and the latter he found to be true; for filling the charged bottle with fresh water, he found the shock, and was satisfied that the power of giving it resided in the glass itself.\n\nHe made the same experiment with panes of glass, laying the coating on lightly, and charging it as he had before charged the water in the bottle, and the result was the same in both. This experiment is more satisfactory than the former; because when the water is poured out of the phial, there still remains a thin coating of the fluid, which might be thought to contain the power of giving a shock.\n\nA charged jar may be gradually discharged by making a conducting body communicate alternately with the outside and the inside coating.\n\nExperiment 1.—Fig. 33 represents an electric jar having a wire, CDE, fastened on its outside, which is fixed so as to have its knob E as high as the knob A. Plate B is the figure of a spider formed out of a piece of cork slightly burned, with a few short threads run through it to represent its legs. This spider is to be fastened at the end of a silk thread, proceeding from the ceiling of the room, or any other support, so that the spider may hang midway between the two knobs AE, when the jar is not charged. Let the place of the jar upon the table be marked; then charge the jar, by bringing its knob A in contact with the prime conductor, and replace it in its marked place. The spider will now begin to move from knob to knob, and continue this motion for a considerable time, sometimes for several hours.\n\nThis experiment is one of the earliest that were made by Dr Franklin and his friends, and is described by Dr Franklin in one of his letters to Collinson.\n\nExperiment 2.—Let a coated jar be inflated by passing it through a ring fixed upon a glass stand, as represented at fig. 34. From the ball a of the wire which communicates with the inside coating suspend a wire to which\nElectricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nThese states of electricity are usually distinguished by means of the common pith-ball electrometer.\n\nExperiment.—Set the machine in motion, while both conductors are insulated, or without connecting either the prime conductor or the rubber with contiguous bodies. We have before remarked (41), that the prime conductor was called the positive, and that to which the rubber is adapted the negative conductor; so that they are so in these circumstances may be demonstrated according to the explanation given in note (d).\n\nOn presenting a pith-ball electrometer to the cylinder whose electricity we have agreed to call positive, the balls will diverge, and will continue to diverge when brought near that side of the prime conductor which is most remote from the cylinder; but being carried to the other conductor, they will instantly collapse; thus showing that the electricity of the rubber is opposite to that of the other conductor or of the cylinder, i.e., that it is negative. This may be known in another way. The balls presented to the rubber will diverge with negative electricity, but being brought near the other conductor in this divergent state, they will collapse.\n\nBut should a more precise method be required to determine the quality of the electricity of an electrified body, the following may be used:—First, electrify one of the electrometers C, placed upon the stand fig. 15, either positively, or negatively, at pleasure: touch it, for instance, with an excited glass tube, so that its balls may repel, and stand about two inches distant from one another; then touch the other electrometer C with the electrified body, that you desire to examine, so that it may be possessed of the same degree of electricity: lastly, take either of the two electrometers by the top of the glass handle, disengage it from the arm of the stand, and bring it near the other electrometer; if then the balls of one electrometer repel those of the other, you may conclude that they are possessed of the same kind of electricity; but if they attract each other, you may conclude that they have been electrified with contrary electricities; and as you know the electricity of that electrometer, which was first electrified, you will of course know the electricity of the other electrometer, i.e., of the electrified body, with which it was touched.\n\nThe above experiment may also be made with the single-thread electrometers; for if they are brought near to one another, when their feathers are electrified, they will, if possessed of the same electricity, repel each other, or, if possessed of contrary electricities, they will attract each other.\n\nWhile the conductors are thus insulated, if a pointed body (as for instance, the point of a needle or pin) be light presented to the back of the rubber, at the distance of about two inches, a lucid pencil of rays will appear to proceed from the point presented, and diverge towards the rubber.\n\nIf another pointed body be presented to the prime conductor, it will appear illuminated with a star; but...\nIf a pointed wire, or other pointed conducting body, be connected with the prime conductor, it will throw out a pencil of rays.\n\nF. Beccaria remarks, that if two equally sharp points are approached to a prime conductor, they will appear luminous at only half the distance at which one of them would have done.\n\nFrom this experiment may be learned the method of distinguishing the quality of the electricity of an electrified body, by the appearance of the electric light; for if a needle, or any other pointed body, be presented in the dark, with the point towards a body strongly electrified, it will appear illuminated with a star, when that body is electrified positively, and with a pencil or brush, when it is electrified negatively (q).\n\nHere it is proper to remark, that when two points (one of which is connected with the prime conductor, or the rubber) are opposed to one another, the appearance of light in both is pretty much the same. Mr Wilcke remarks, that when a point not electrified, is opposed to another point electrified positively, the cones of light, which otherwise would appear upon them, disappear; but that if a positive cone be opposed to a negative cone, they both preserve their own characteristic properties.\n\nMr Nicholson has given us some valuable observations on the different appearances of the electric light, when proceeding from bodies electrified positively or negatively.\n\n\"The escape of negative electricity from a ball,\" says Mr Nicholson, \"is attended with the appearance of straight sharp sparks with a hoarse or chirping noise. When the ball was less than two inches in diameter, it was usually covered with short flames of this kind, which were very numerous.\n\n\"When two equal balls were presented to each other, and one of them was rendered strongly positive, while the other remained in connection with the earth, the positive brush or ramified spark was seen to pass from the electrified ball: when the other ball was electrified negatively, and the ball, which before had been positive, was connected with the ground, the electricity exhibited the negative flame, or dense, straight, and more luminous sparks from the negative ball; and when the one ball was electrified plus and the other minus, the signs of both electricities appeared. If the interval was not too great, the long zig-zag spark of the plus ball struck the straight plane of the minus ball, usually at the distance of about one third of the length of the latter from its point, rendering the other two thirds very bright: sometimes, however, the positive spark struck the ball at a distance from the negative flame. These effects are represented in Plate CLXXXVIII, figs. 35, 36, and 37.\n\n\"Two conductors of three quarters of an inch diameter, with spherical ends of the same diameter, were laid parallel to each other, at the distance of about two inches, in such a manner as that the ends pointed in opposite directions, and were six or eight inches asunder. These, which may be distinguished by the letters P and M, were successively electrified, as the balls were in the last paragraph. When one conductor P was positive, fig. 39, it exhibited the sparks of that electricity at its extremity, and struck the side of the other conductor M. When the last-mentioned conductor M was electrified negatively, fig. 38, the former being in its turn connected with the earth, the sparks ceased to strike as before, and the extremity of the electrified conductor M exhibited negative signs, and struck the side of the other conductor. And when one conductor was electrified plus and the other minus, fig. 40, both signs appeared at the same time, and continual streams of electricity passed between the extremities of each conductor, to the side of the other conductor opposed to it.\n\n\"In drawing the long spark from a ball of four inches diameter, I found it of some consequence that the stem should not be too short, because the vicinity of the large prime conductor altered the disposition of the electricity to escape: I therefore made a set of experiments, the result of which showed, that the disposition of balls to receive or emit electricity, is greater when they stand remote from other surfaces in the same plate; and that between this greatest disposition in any ball, whatever may be its diameter, every possible less degree may be obtained by withdrawing the ball towards the broader or less convex surface out of which its stem projects, until at length the ball, being wholly deprived beneath that surface, loses the disposition entirely.\n\nFrom these experiments it follows, that a variety of balls is unnecessary in electricity: because any small ball, if near the prime conductor, will be equivalent to a larger ball whose stem is longer.\n\n\"From comparing some experiments made by myself many years ago with the present set, I considered a point as a ball of an indefinitely small diameter, and which I constructed an instrument consisting of a brass ball of six inches diameter, though the axis of which a stem, points carrying a fine point, was screwed. When this stem is illustrated fixed in the prime conductor, if the ball be moved on its axis in every direction, it causes the fine point either to protrude through a small hole in its external surface, or to withdraw itself; because by this means the ball runs along the stem. The disposition of the point to transmit electricity may thus be made equal to that of any ball whatever, from the minutest size to the diameter of six inches. See fig. 41, A.\n\n\"The effect of a positive surface appears to extend farther than that of a negative; for the point acts like a focus for a ball, when considerably more prominent, if it be positive, than it will if negative.\"\n\nFig. 42 represents an instrument invented by Mr Nicholson for distinguishing positive from negative electricity. It consists of two metallic balls, A, B, which may be placed at a greater or less distance from each other, by means of a joint at C, on which the two branches CA, CB move. These branches are of positive glass covered with varnish. A short point proceeds from one of the balls B towards the other A. If the two balls be placed near a body which is electrified, so that\n\n(q) The pencil of light exhibited by a point positively electrified was first seen by Mr Grey, though the difference of the two states was not in his time correctly ascertained.\nPrinciples of Electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nFor supposing that the electricity passes from A to B, there will be a certain distance of the balls at which a spark will pass between the balls; but this distance will be much shorter when the electricity is passing from B to A. It is evident that this instrument will be of use only when the electricity to be examined is sufficiently strong to give sparks.\n\nThe appearances of positive and negative electricity are sufficiently distinct in almost every experiment which can be made with the exhibition of electric light. Paper is a good substance for observing the visible passage of the electric power. If a strong positive electric stream be let fall on the flat side of an uninflated sheet of paper, it will form a beautiful star about four inches in diameter, consisting of very distinct radii not ramified. Negative electricity, in perfectly similar circumstances, throws many pointed brushes to the paper, but forms no star upon it. This experiment is by Mr Nicholson, and the cylinder of the machine employed in making it was seven inches in diameter*.\n\nChap. V. Of the different states of electricity possessed by the two surfaces of a charged electric.\n\nThe opposite surfaces of a charged electric are in opposite states, i.e., one positive, and the other negative.\n\nExper. 1. Inflate a coated phial, such as is described in fig. 34, without the bells, and charge it by holding the knob a to the positive conductor, while the knob b communicates with the table. When the phial is charged, hold a pith-ball electroscope to the knob a, and the balls will diverge with positive electricity, as will appear by presenting them in their diverging state to excited sealing-wax, when they will collapse. Now hold the balls to the knob b, which communicates with the outer coating of the phial, and they will diverge with negative electricity, as will appear by presenting them to an excited glass tube.\n\nIf the jar be charged at the negative conductor, these appearances will be reversed; the balls presented to the knob a will diverge with negative electricity, and presented to b, they will diverge with positive electricity.\n\nExper. 2. Fix a pointed wire into a hole in the knob of the inflated phial, and fix another wire in the positive conductor. Hold the knob a to the point in the positive conductor, and on turning the cylinder in the dark, a pencil of luminous rays will be seen diverging from the point in the conductor to the knob a, while a similar pencil of rays, diverges from the wire fixed in the knob b.\n\nIf the wire is fixed in the negative conductor, a luminous star will appear at each point.\n\nExper. 3.—Fix a pointed wire into a hole in the knob a, while another pointed wire is fixed in b, as in the last experiment. Present the wire in the knob a in the dark, to the positive conductor, and a luminous star will appear at the point a, while the point at b throws out a pencil of luminous rays.\n\nIf the point at a be presented to the negative conductor, the luminous pencil will appear at a and the luminous star at b.\n\nExper. 4.—Fig. 43. is an electric jar which serves to illustrate the contrary states of the sides of a Leyden phial while charging: BB is the tin foil coating; C, a stand which supports the jar; D, a socket of metal, carrying the glass rod EF, a bent brass wire pointed at each end, and fixed at the end of the rod G; this rod is moveable in the spring tube N at pleasure: that tube being fixed by a socket on the top of the glass rod E, the jar is charged by the inside wire, which communicates with the different divisions of the inside coating by horizontal wires.\n\nPlace the jar at the conductor as usual; and when charging, a luminous star will appear upon the upper point of the wire at F, clearly showing, according to the commonly received opinion, that the point is then receiving the electric power. From the upper ring of the coating B, on the outside of the jar, a stream or pencil of rays will at the same time fly off, beautifully diverging from the lower point of the wire E upon the bottom ring of the coating of the jar. When the appearances cease, which they do when the jar is charged, let a pointed wire be presented to the conductor: this will soon discharge the jar filently; during which the point will be illuminated with a small spark, while the upper point of the wire will throw off a pencil of rays diverging towards the upper ring of the coating.\n\nWhen a charged electric is discharged, the electric course of power passes from the positive to the negative surface.\n\nExper. 1.—When a jar has been charged at the positive conductor, take a discharging rod, furnished with pointed extremities, and hold it in such a position, that the point shall be at the distance of about an inch from the knob of the jar, while the other point shall be at nearly the same distance from the outside coating. In this way the jar will be filently discharged, and if the experiment be made in the dark, a luminous star will appear at that point which is held to the knob of the jar, and a luminous pencil at the point which is held to the outer coating.\n\nIf the jar has been charged at the negative conductor, the appearance of the light at the points will be reversed; a luminous pencil will now appear at the point which is held to the knob of the jar, and a luminous star at that which is held at the outer coating.\n\nExper. 2.—Remove the circular piece of wood GH, by the direction of the universal discharger, fig. 29, fix the wires; EF, rectification FT, so that its knobs FT may be about two inches distant from one another. Then fix upon the socket of the board, from which the board was removed, a small lighted wax taper so that its flame may be just in the middle between the knobs FT. When the apparatus is thus disposed, if the outside of a charged jar be connected by means of a chain or other conducting substance, with one of the wires, and the knob of the jar be brought to the other wire, it will be observed, that, on making the discharge which must pass between the knobs FT, the flame of the taper will be driven in the direction of the electric power, i.e. it will be blown towards the knob of that wire which communicates with that surface of the jar which is negatively electrified.\n\nExper. 3.—Fig. 44 and 45, of Plate CLXXXIX, represent a small phial coated on the outside, about three inches\nPrinciples of Electricity.\n\nElectricity phial, cemented a brass cap, having a hole with a valve, and from the cap a wire proceeds a few inches within the phial, terminating in a blunt point. When this phial is exhausted of air, a brass ball is to be screwed on the brass cap, so as to defend the valve, and prevent any air from getting into the exhausted glass. This phial exhibits clearly the direction of the electric power, both in charging and discharging; for if it be held by its bottom, and its brass knob be presented to the prime conductor positively electrified, you will see that the electric power causes a pencil of rays to proceed from the wire within the phial, as represented fig. 45, and when it is discharged, a star will appear in the place of the pencil, as represented in fig. 44. But if the phial be held by the brass cap, and its bottom be touched with the prime conductor, then the point of the wire, on its inside, will appear illuminated with a star when charging, and with a pencil when discharging. If it be presented to a prime conductor electrified negatively, all these appearances, both in charging and discharging, will be reversed.\n\nThis experiment of the Leyden vacuum, as it is called, is an invention of the late Mr Henry.\n\nExper. 4.—Fig. 46 represents an electric jar, whose exterior coating is made up of small pieces of tin-foil placed at a small distance from each other. This jar is to be charged in the usual manner, when small sparks will pass from one piece of tin-foil to the other, in various directions, forming a very pleasing spectacle. The separation of the tin-foil is the cause of this visible passage, from the outside to the table; and the experiment is similar in appearance to that mentioned. If the jar be discharged by bringing a pointed wire gradually to the knob T, the unsealed part of the glass between the wire and knob will be agreeably illuminated, attended by a cracking noise of the sparks. If the jar be suddenly discharged, the whole outside will be illuminated. The jar, used in these experiments, must be very dry.\n\nExper. 5.—Fig. 47 represents two jars, or Leyden phials, placed one over the other, by which various experiments may be made in order to elucidate the theory of electricity. Bring the outside coating of the bottle A in contact with the prime conductor, and turn the machine till the bottle is charged; then place one ball of the discharging rod upon the coating of B, and with the other touch the knob of the jar A; an explosion will follow; now place one ball of the discharger on the knob A, and bring the other ball to its coating, and you have a second discharge. Again, apply one ball of the discharger to the coating of B, and carry the other to the coating of A, and it will produce a third discharge. A fourth is obtained by applying the discharger from the coating of A to its knob.\n\nThe outer coating of the upper jar communicating with the inside of the under one, conveys the electric power from the conductor to the large jar which is therefore charged positively; the upper jar does not charge, but when a communication is formed from the outside of A to the inside of B, part of the electric power on the inside of A will be conveyed to the negative coating of B, and the jar will be discharged. The second explosion is occasioned by the discharge of the jar A; but as the outside of this communicates by conducting substances with the positive inside of the jar B, if the ball of the discharging rod remains for a little time after the discharge on the knob of A, part of the electric power of the inside of A will escape, and be replaced by an equal quantity on the outside from the jar B, by which means A is charged a second time; the discharge of this produces the third, and of B the fourth explosion.\n\nMr Brooke of Norwich brings the following experiments to prove that the opposite surfaces of an electric, while charging, are not necessarily in opposite states of electricity.\n\n1. Let two pound phials be coated with tin-foil on their outsides, and filled to convenient height with common shot, to serve as a coating within side, as well as to keep a wire steady in the phials without a stopple in the mouth of them. Let each phial be furnished with a wire about the size of a goose-quill, and about ten inches long, and let each wire be sharpened a little at one end, that it may the more easily be thrust down into the shot, so as not to touch the glass anywhere at the mouth of the phials, yet so as to stand steadily in them. Let a metallic ball about six or seven eighths of an inch diameter be screwed on at the other end of each wire; also, let there be in readiness a third wire, fitted up like those for the phials, except that another ball of nearly the same size as the former may occasionally be screwed on at the sharpened end of it. I say, instead of suspending the phials from the prime conductor, let one of those above described be charged at the prime conductor, and then set it aside, but let it be in readiness in its charged state; then let the other be placed upon a good insulating stand, and let the third wire also be laid upon the stand, so that its ball, or some part of the wire, may touch the coating of the phial. Let the sharpened end of this wire project five or six inches over the edge of the stand; all of these being now placed close to the edge of a table, hang a pair of cork balls on the sharpened end of the wire, and make a communication from the prime conductor to the ball on the wire on the bottle: on working the machine, the sharpened end of the wire will permit the bottle to be charged although it be insulated; and if the wire be very finely pointed, the bottle may be charged nearly as well as if it were not insulated: I say, on working the machine, the phial will charge, and the cork balls will immediately repel each other; but whilst this phial is charging, take the first phial, which having been previously charged at the same prime conductor in the hand, and while the second phial is charging, present the ball of the first to the cork balls, and they will all repel each other. This plainly proves that the outside of the second bottle is electrified plus at the time that it is charging, the same as the inside of the first; and the inside of both the bottles will readily be allowed to charge alike, that is plus or positive.\n\n2. Let the second bottle in the last experiment be wholly discharged, and charge it again as before (the first bottle yet remaining charged); and whilst it is charging, let the ball of the first approach the cork balls contiguous with the second, and they will, as before, all repel each other; withdraw the ball of the first, and lo...\nPrinciples of long as the machine continues to charge the second bot-\ntle higher, the cork balls will continue to repel each other; but cease working the machine, and the cork balls will cease to repel each other till they touch, and will then very soon repel each other again; then let the ball in the first phial approach the cork balls, and they will now be attracted by it, instead of being repelled as above, as in the last experiment. This also plainly shows, that both sides of a Leyden phial are alike at the time it is charging; and at the same time evidently shows, that the difference of the two sides does not take place till after the bottle is charged, or till the machine ceases to charge it higher.\n\n3. In this experiment, let both of the former bottles be discharged, then let one of them be placed upon the insulating stand. Let a ball be put on over the sharpened end of the third wire, and let it be laid on the stand as before, so as to touch the coating of the phial; place the other phial on the table, so that its ball or wire may touch the ball on the third wire, or any part of the wire itself; make a communication from the ball on the wire of the first phial to the prime conductor; then, by working the machine, both bottles will soon become charged. As soon as they are pretty well charged, and before the machine ceases working, remove the second phial from the third wire; after the second phial is removed, cease working the machine as soon as possible; take the third wire, with its two balls, off the stand with the hand, and lay it on the table, so that one of its balls may touch the outside coating of the second phial; remove the first phial off the stand, and place it on the table so as to touch the ball at the other end of the third wire; then with an insulated discharging rod, make a communication from the ball in one bottle to the ball in the other. If the outside of the first phial be negative at the time it is charging, the inside of the second will be the same, and making the above communication would produce an explosion, and both bottles would be discharged; but the contrary will happen, for there will be no explosion, nor will either of the bottles be discharged, although there be a complete communication between their outsides, because the inside of them both will be positive. This is a proof, that considering one side of a phial to be positive and the other negative at the time they are charging is a mistake; as well as that, if any number of bottles be suspended at the tail of each other, all the intermediate surfaces or sides do not continue so.\n\n4. Here also let the apparatus be disposed as in the last experiment, till the bottles are highly charged, then with a clean stick of glass, or the like, remove the communication between the balls of the first phial and the prime conductor, before the machine ceases working; then, with an insulated discharging rod, make a communication from the outside to the inside of the first phial; a strong explosion will take place on account of the excess withinside, notwithstanding they are both positive.\n\n5. This experiment being something of a continuation of the preceding one, immediately after the last explosion takes place, discharge the prime conductor of its electricity and atmosphere; then touch the ball in the first phial with the hand, or any conducting substance that is not insulated; then will the inside coating of the first phial, which at first was so strongly positive, be in principles of the same state as the outside coating of the second, having a communication with the hand, the floor, &c., with experience each other; that is negative, if anything can properly be called negative or positive that has a communication with the common stock: but a pair of cork-balls that are electrified either plus or minus will no more be attracted by either the inside coating of the first phial or the outside coating of the second, than they will by the table on which they stand, or a common chair in the room, while they continue in that situation. Remove the aforeaid communication from the ball of the first phial; touch the ball in the second, as before in the first, or discharge the bottle with the discharging rod, and the ball in the first bottle will immediately become negative; with a pair of cork balls electrified negatively, approach the ball in the first phial, and they will all repel each other, or if the cork-balls be electrified positively, they will be attracted. All these circumstances together serve fully to prove what has already been said, not only that the inside of the first phial, which was so strongly positive, may be altered so as to become in the same state as the outside of the second, without discharging the phial, or any more working the machine; but that it may be fairly changed, from being positively charged to being negatively charged. If a pair of cork-balls are now hung on to the ball of the wire in this phial, by the help of a stick of glass, they will repel each other, being negatively electrified. Make a communication from the outside of the bottle to the table, and replace the communication from the prime conductor to the ball in the bottle; then, upon moderately working the machine to charge the bottle, the cork-balls will cease to repel each other till they touch, and will soon repel each other again by being electrified positively.\n\nHere the working the machine anew, plainly shows that the inside of the first bottle, which was positive, was changed to negative.\n\nThe following observations and experiments on the Milner's Leyden phial, are taken from a little work by Dr Thomas Milner.\n\nAn electric power communicated to any insulated substances has been named simple electrification; the Leyden phial, in order to distinguish this particular state from that of the charged phial; but it will appear whether this distinction ought to be retained or not, by taking a comparative view of both these cases. And, if the changes which an electrical power in general is capable of making in the electrical state of any substance contained within the sphere of its influence, be taken into consideration, and compared with those which have been observed in the charged phial, it is apprehended that they will not appear to be different in any material circumstance.\n\n1. In the charged phial, when the inside has either kind of electricity communicated to it, the outside is found to possess a contrary power. It appears also that either kind of electricity always produces the other on any conducting substance placed within the sphere of influence. And as the same effect is also produced on electrics themselves, in the same situation, and as some portion of the air, supposing no other substance to be near enough, must be unavoidably exposed to such influence, it necessarily follows, that neither power can exist.\nWhen a plate of coated glass has been charged, and principles of the circuit between the coatings has been completed, by the mediation of a good conducting substance, no part of the coated surface is supposed to retain any part of the charge; but, according to the commonly received doctrine, the whole of it is said to be discharged; or in other words, to be brought into its natural state. This however is not really the case, as will evidently appear from the following experiment; the design of which is to show the effects produced by charging and discharging a plate of glass.\n\nLet the middle of a piece of crown window glass, seven inches square, be placed between two circular plates of brass, about the 16th part of an inch thick, and five inches in diameter. In order to enable these plates to retain a greater degree of power, it will be proper to terminate each of them with a round bead the third part of an inch thick; and the whole of the bead should be formed on one side of the plate, that the other side may remain quite flat, and apply well to the surface of the glass. Let the whole be inflated about four inches above the table, and in a horizontal position, by fastening one end of a cylindrical piece of some good insulating substance to the middle of the under plate, the other end of it being fixed in any convenient stand. Let a like insulating item be fastened to the middle of the upper plate. Let a brass chain, which may easily be removed, reach from the under plate to the table. In the last place bend a piece of brass wire into such a shape, that it may stand perpendicularly on the upper plate; and let the upper extremity of this wire be formed into a hook, that it may be removed at any time by the assistance of a silk string, without destroying the inflation of the plate.\n\nThe glass being thus coated with metal on both sides, and having also a proper communication with the table, will admit of being charged; and both coatings may be separated from the glass, and examined apart, without destroying the inflation of either: for the upper coating may be separated by the means of its own proper stem; and the under coating may be separated by taking hold of the corners of the glass, and lifting the glass itself. As glass readily attracts moisture from the atmosphere, it will therefore be necessary to warm it in the beginning, and to repeat it several times in the course of the experiment, unless the air should be very dry.\n\nExcite a smooth glass tube, of the common size, by rubbing it with silk, and apply it repeatedly to the bent wire, until the glass be well charged. Then remove the chain, which reaches from the lower plate to the table, and also the charging wire from the upper plate, by laying hold of its hook with a silk string. It necessarily follows, from considering the quality of the power employed in the present case, that the upper surface of the glass, together with the upper coating, must be electrified positively; and that the under surface and coating must be electrified negatively; but as it is designed in this experiment to examine the powers of charged glass, that no virtue may be imputed to the glass but what really belongs to it, let both coatings be separated from it; and after they have been brought to their natural state, by touching them with a conducting body not inflated, let the glass be replaced between them; and whatever effects may be now produced must be ascribed solely\nPrinciples of solely to the powers of the charged glass. On bringing a finger near the upper coating, a small electrical spark will appear between that coating and the finger, attended with a snapping noise. Apply a finger in the same manner to the under coating, and the same thing will happen. This effect cannot be produced twice, by two succeeding applications to the same coating; but it may be repeated several hundred times over, in a favourable state of the atmosphere, by alternate applications to the two coatings; and the powers of the glass will be thus gradually weakened.\n\nThis part of the experiment may be explained, by observing that the contrary electricities have a natural tendency to produce and to preserve each other, on the opposite sides of a plate of glass; and therefore, the increase or decrease of power, on the other side: and as in charging a plate of glass positively, no gradual addition of electric matter can be made to the upper surface, without a proper conveyance for a proportionate part to pass away from the lower surface; so in this method of uncharging it, the electric power cannot be gradually taken away from the upper surface, without adding a proportionate part to the under surface: one operation is the reverse of the other, and so are the effects; one case being attended with an increase and the other with a decrease of power.\n\nLet the glass be again fully charged, and after bringing both coatings to their natural state, as before, let the glass be replaced between them; and on touching the upper coating with a finger, and then separating it from the upper and positive surface of the glass by the insulating item, this coating will acquire a weak negative power, which will be sufficient to produce a small spark while the glass is in full force, though after the power of the glass has been reduced, it will give little or no spark: but in both cases, on touching the coatings alternately two or three times, the negative power of this coating, when separated from the positive surface of the glass, will be considerably increased, as to produce strong negative sparks.—This effect may now be repeated several times, by only touching the upper coating, but the sparks will grow weaker every time; and they may be restored again to nearly their former strength, by alternate applications to both coatings, as before. The same things will also happen to the under coating, in the same circumstances; but with this difference, that the power of the under coating, on being separated from the under and negative surface of the glass will be positive. And thus a long succession of both positive and negative sparks may be produced in favourable weather, or at any time by keeping the glass moderately warm.\n\nIt appears from this part of the experiment, that each of the surfaces of the charged glass has a power of producing a contrary electricity in the coating in contact with it, by a momentary interruption of the insulation. It necessarily follows, in producing these effects, that more electrical matter must have passed away from the upper coating, at the time of touching it, than the same coating could receive from the upper surface of the glass; and therefore the upper coating, by losing some of its natural quantity, will be negatively electrified; and also that more electric matter must have been added to the under coating at the time of touching it, than the under surface of the glass could receive from it; and therefore the under coating, by receiving some addition to its natural quantity, will be positively electrified. It appears further, that the greatest degree of this influential power, which may be consistent with the circumstances of the case, will be produced in either coating by taking care at the same time to bring the opposite coating into a like state of influential electricity; and thus it is evident, that the influential powers of the two coatings have the same relation to each other, as the contrary powers of the glass itself, and will therefore always increase or decrease together.\n\nThe glass being again well charged, as at first, let a brass wire bent in the form of a staple be brought into contact with the upper and lower coating at the same time. By this the common discharge will be made; but the equilibrium of the coated glass will be only restored in part; for a considerable degree of attraction will happen at the same time between the upper coating and the glass, which has frequently been strong enough to lift a piece of plate glass weighing ten ounces. Neither coating will now show the least external sign of electricity while it is in contact with the glass: but on separating either of them from it, if care be taken to preserve their insulations, the upper coating will be strongly electrified negatively, and the under coating will be strongly electrified positively. Let then both coatings be brought to their natural state, by touching them when separated from the glass, with a conducting body not insulated, and let the glass be replaced between them as before. In this state of things, on touching the upper coating only, and separating it from the glass, it will not be capable of giving any spark; but on touching the coatings alternately five or six times, it will then give a weak spark; and this may now be repeated several times by only touching the upper coating: but on a second application of the bent wire to both coatings at the same time, a second discharge may be perceived, though much weaker than the first, and the coatings will be again brought into the same electrical state as immediately after the first discharge. This may frequently be repeated; and a considerable number of strong negative sparks may be taken from the coating when it is separated from the positive surface of the glass. If the glass in replacing it between the two plates be turned upside down, the electrical powers of both coatings will be changed by the next application of the discharging wire to complete the circuit; and a succession of strong positive sparks may be taken from the coating when it is separated from the negative surface of the glass.\n\nIt appears from this part of the experiment, that the coated part of the charged glass was not brought into its natural state by completing the circuit between the coatings, but that it still retained a degree of permanent electricity; that the powers of both coatings were actually changed at the time of the first discharge; and that a succession of the same powers may be produced in the coatings, without renewing the least application of electricity to the glass itself.\n\nThe whole quantity of electric power added to the glass in charging it, is evidently distinguished into two parts in this experiment. The first part, which is by far the most considerable, appears to have been readily communicated from one surface of the glass to the other.\nPrinciples of other, along the bent wire, when it was first brought into contact with both coatings at the same time. The second part of the charge appears to be more permanent, and remains still united with the glass, notwithstanding the circuit has been completed (r). This permanent electricity, as well as the other, must be positive on the upper surface, and negative on the lower surface: because, in the present experiment, the charge was given by a smooth glass tube excited with a silk rubber. Now, the influence of the opposite and permanent powers on the different sides of the glass (each side having a tendency to bring the coating in contact with it into a state of electricity contrary to its own) must affect each other, in causing part of the electric matter naturally belonging to the upper coating to pass away from it to the under coating, along the discharging wire, and at the same time the discharge to pass the same way. The upper coating, therefore, by losing some part of its natural quantity, must be negatively electrified; and the under coating, by receiving an addition to its natural quantity, must be positively electrified. The whole quantity of electric matter, which the influence of the permanent electricity of the glass is capable of taking from one coating and of adding to the other, bears but a small proportion to the whole charge: and therefore the second and every subsequent discharge must be considerably weaker than the first.\n\nIt appears from several of the preceding experiments, that a considerable degree of influential power may be produced at some distance by an electric in full force; and therefore a small excited body of a cylindrical shape was sufficient to answer that purpose: but when the excited electric has been so far weakened that it cannot communicate its own power, nor produce this influential power in any body, unless it be brought very near or in contact with it, bodies of a cylindrical form must then act to great disadvantage, and a small degree of power only can be produced; because the strength of the influential electricity in this case will be in proportion to the surfaces of the electric and conducting bodies, which are brought near together, or in contact with each other; and therefore a plate of glass in the same circumstances, whether its permanent power be derived from excitation or communication, is enabled from its shape to produce a considerable degree of the influential powers in the coatings in contact with it.\n\nIt has been very properly recommended to use a particular kind of rubber, and to attend to the state of it, in order to excite glass well; but it will not be necessary to pay the least regard to these circumstances in the following experiments, in which a method will be shown of charging a small phial and a plate of glass at the same time, by a gradual accumulation of power; that power being entirely derived from the glass itself, and with no other degree or kind of friction than is necessarily connected with the form of the experiment.\n\nPlace a circle of tin-foil five inches in diameter on the table, between a soft piece of baize and the middle of the same plate of glass that was used in the last experiment, which will thus be coated on the under side: and in order to preserve a proper communication with this coating, let a fillet of tin-foil reach from it beyond the extremity of the glass. The same insulated metal cover is to be used for the upper coating as before. Let a thin ounce phial of glass be filled with brass filings, and coated with tin-foil on the outside to about one inch from the top. Let a large brass wire, the fifth part of an inch in diameter, pass through the cork of the phial into the filings, about an inch of it being left above the cork, and let the upper extremity of this wire be well rounded. This experiment requires, that the whole construction should be well warmed at first; and it will be necessary to repeat it at proper intervals, unless the atmosphere should be very dry.\n\nTaking hold of the wire of the phial with one hand, let it be placed on the upper surface of the glass, and its bottom carried in contact over the middle of the upper surface, as far as the tin-foil coating reaches on the under side: and during this part of the operation, a finger of the other hand must be kept in contact with the fillet of tin-foil. Then lifting the phial by the wire with one hand, let it be placed on the insulated metal cover, suspended in the air with the other hand; and after shifting the hand from the wire to the coating, let the bottom of the phial be placed on the end of the tin-foil fillet. Place the insulated metal cover on the middle of the glass, and touch it with a finger of one hand, while the other hand touches the tin-foil fillet. Now lift the insulated cover by its stem, and bring the head of the cover in contact with the wire of the phial, and a very small spark of light will appear between them. Let this be repeated in the same manner about fifteen times, taking care to preserve a proper communication between the coating and the floor. Then taking hold of the phial by the coating, let it be replaced on the insulated cover while it is suspended in the air; and after shifting the hand from the coating to the wire, let it be again placed on the middle of the glass: and let the bottom be again carried in contact over the middle of the glass, holding the wire in one hand, while the other has a proper communication with the tin-foil coating. Let the phial be again returned to the tin-foil fillet as before, and let the insulated cover be applied repeatedly to the wire, immediately after every separation from the glass; and a brighter spark, together with a weak snapping, will now attend each application, if it be carefully observed to touch the cover with one hand before every separation, while the other hand rests on the fillet of tin-foil. By proceeding in this manner, after the third application of the phial to the glass, a very\n\n(r) Some new terms seem to be wanted in order to express with precision the different parts of the charge. And if that part of it which cannot be destroyed by completing the circuit, should be called the permanent part of the charge, or more simply the charge; then might the other part, or that which may be destroyed by completing the circuit, be named the firecharge.\nPrinciples of very weak shock will be felt in those fingers which are used in completing the circuit of the glass; and after repeating two rounds more in the manner before mentioned, the phial will be fully charged. By applying the coating of the phial when it is in full force to the upper surface as before, the glass plate will get the greatest power it is thus capable of receiving, and will then give a shock as high as the elbows. After this, on attempting to lift the insulated cover, the glass itself will generally be lifted at the same time, with the tin-foil coating adhering to the under surface; but by continuing the separations of the cover from the glass, a succession of strong negative sparks may be produced by the influence of the upper surface; and by turning the glass over, and leaving the tin-foil coating on the baize, a succession of strong positive sparks may be produced by the influence of the other side.\n\nThis experiment may be performed more steadily by placing the glass, together with the tin-foil coating and baize, on a plate of metal about one-tenth of an inch thick, and of the same square as the glass. The whole may be fastened together by two small hoidsails placed at the opposite corners, which will prevent the glass from being lifted. This plate of metal will be useful in another view; for after it has been sufficiently warmed, by retaining heat well, it will help to keep the glass dry, and consequently fit for use so much the longer. But when it shall be required to show the contrary powers of the opposite sides of the glass, it will be more convenient not to fasten the parts together, and the whole may be kept sufficiently steady, by the operator's keeping down one corner of the glass with a finger, and by placing a proper weight on the opposite corner.\n\nThe bottom of the phial cannot be carried in contact over the glass without producing some little degree of friction; from which the power in this experiment is originally derived. The cover will appear on examination to be electrified negatively after every separation from the glass; but as it was touched in completing the circuit between the coatings before every separation, it necessarily follows, that the cover can have only an influential electricity, and consequently that the permanent power of the upper surface of the glass must be positive. The negative power of the cover is communicated to the wire of the phial, by which the inside is electrified negatively and the outside positively; and both these powers will increase with every application, because the circumstances of the phial are favourable to its charging. The phial must be insulated every time it is required to shift the hand from the wire to the coating, or from the coating to the wire; for without this precaution the phial would be discharged. By applying the outside of the phial to the upper surface of the glass, in the manner above mentioned, the phial will be partly discharged on the surface; and though it must be therefore weakened, the power of the glass will be increased, and consequently enabled to produce a proportionally stronger effect on the brass cover, which by the next round of applications will give the phial a stronger charge than it had before. And thus a very small degree of original power is first generated, and then employed in forming two different accumulations: and by making each of these subservient to the increase of the other, the phial is at last fully charged, and the glass plate acquires such a degree of charge, as to give a pretty smart shock; and after, it remains capable, by the influence of its permanent powers, of producing a succession of positive and negative sparks on the opposite surfaces.\n\nThe contrary charge may be given to the phial by taking hold of the coating, and carrying the wire in contact over the middle of the upper surface of the glass, and by applying the power of the insulated cover to the coating; for if the operation be conducted in every other respect in the same manner as before, then will the inside be electrified positively, and the outside negatively. The powers of the glass plate will be the same as they were in the former case.\n\nAfter the phial has been fully charged negatively, by the process of the last experiment, let it be insulated; and taking hold of the wire, let the bottom be held uppermost, and let the hand which holds it rest on the fillet of tin-foil. Apply the insulated cover to the glass, and after touching it with a finger of the other hand, separate it from the glass; and on bringing it towards the coating of the phial, a strong spark will pass between them. After repeating this between 20 and 30 times, the powers of the phial will be destroyed; and by continuing the same operation, they will be inverted; for the inside will be at last fully charged positively, and the outside negatively.\n\nThe same effect may be produced by turning the glass over, and by repeatedly applying the influential electricity, produced on that side, to the wire of the phial.\n\nWhen the phial has been fully charged negatively, as in the last experiment, take hold of the coating of the phial with one hand, and while the other hand rests on the tin foil fillet, apply the wire to the middle of the upper surface of the glass, as far as the tin-foil coating extends on the other side. By this the powers of the glass plate will be changed.\n\nAnother, and perhaps a better method of applying the phial, is to place the insulated cover on the surface of the glass, and then holding the phial by the coating in one hand, to apply the wire to the cover, while the other hand touches the fillet of tin-foil; by which a shock will be given, and the same change of powers will be produced in an instant, which before took up some little time. On lifting the insulated cover by its stem immediately after the shock, it will be negative, or have the same power as the inside of the phial; but on replacing the cover, and completing the circuit of the glass plate, the surcharge will be destroyed; another shock will be felt; and the power of the cover, after the next separation, will be positive, or contrary to that of the inside of the phial. Apply this positive power to the wire of the phial as before; and after 15 applications, the powers of the phial will be destroyed; and by still proceeding in the same manner, the powers of the phial will be changed, and the inside will be fully charged positively, and the outside negatively, by 60 applications.\n\nThese effects may also be produced by a single application of the coating of the phial to the other side of the glass plate; and by repeated applications of the influential electricity, produced on the same side, to the coating of the phial.\n\nIf it were simply the object in this experiment to change\nPrinciples of change the powers of the phial, the operation might then be considerably shortened, by completing the circuit of the phial, and consequently destroying the whole by expert furlage; but it was intended to show what effects might be produced, by opposing the contrary powers to each other; and by doing this it appears that either side of the glass plate can destroy the powers of the phial, and give it a contrary charge; that either side of the phial can also change the powers of the glass plate; and that the powers of the glass plate, thus inverted, can again destroy the powers of the phial, and give it a full charge of the contrary electricity.\n\nHere it may be observed, that, in some cases, the quality of the power may be determined by observation alone. When the phial employed in the two last experiments has been fully charged, it may be known whether the inside be positive or negative from the light which appears at the wire, or from the hissing noise which attends it: for when the phial has been fully charged positively, if the room be sufficiently darkened, a bright luminous appearance may be seen, diverging in separate rays to the distance of an inch, attended with an interrupted hissing noise; and both the light and the noise continue a very short time. But when the phial is fully charged negatively, a weaker and more uniform light appears, which does not extend itself more than the sixth part of an inch, and is attended with a closer and more uniform hissing; and this noise and light always continue longer than the former. Even positive and negative sparks, passing between the insulated cover and a finger, may be distinguished from each other: for the positive sparks are more divided, give less light, make a weaker snapping noise, and affect the finger less sensibly than the negative.\n\nThe strongest sparks which can be produced in these experiments, are those that pass between the coating of the phial and the insulated cover, when they possess the contrary powers; but they will be more particularly vigorous if the coating be positive, and the insulated cover negative.\n\n**Chap. VI. Miscellaneous Experiments with charged Electrics.**\n\nSig. Cigna made some curious experiments on the adhesion of electrified plates of glass. He laid two of these plates well dried, one upon the other as one piece, the lowermost of them being coated on the outside; and, when they were insulated, he alternately rubbed the uppermost plate with one hand, and took a spark from the coating of the lower with the other till they were charged; when the coating and both the plates adhered firmly together. Giving a coating to the other side, and making a communication between the two coatings, the usual explosion was produced. But, though the united electric was thus discharged, the plate still cohered, and though no sign of electricity appeared while they were united, they were, when separated, found possessed of opposite states of electricity.\n\nIf the two plates were separated before they were discharged, and the coating of each was touched, a spark came from each, and when they were again placed together, they cohered as before, but were not capable of giving a flock.\n\nIf plates of glass, thus coated and electrified, be separated in the dark, flashes of light will be perceived between them. By laying the plates together again, and again separating them successively, the appearance of these luminous flashes may be repeated several times, but always in a weaker degree than the first.\n\nMr Symmer made several experiments of the same kind before Sig. Cigna. He found that when the two plates were coated only on one side, they were charged as one plate, and the uncoated sides adhered together; but when they were coated each on both sides, they became charged distinctly from each other, and did not adhere.\n\nMr Henley, in describing an experiment of this kind, makes the following observation. \"Crown glass, that is, the glass commonly used for sash-windows, though so much thinner, succeeds in this experiment as well as the plate-glass; but what is very remarkable, the Dutch plates, when treated in the same manner, have each a positive and a negative surface, and the electricity of both surfaces of both plates is exchanged for the contrary electricity in the discharge. If a clean, dry, uncoated plate of looking-glass be placed between the coated looking-glass plates, or between the plates of crown-glass, it appears after charging, to be negatively electrified on both sides; but if it be placed between the Dutch plates it acquires, like them, a positive electricity on one surface, and a negative electricity on the other.\"\n\nA very curious and elegant experiment on the Leyden phial was made by Professor Richman of Petersburgh, whose unfortunate death will be hereafter related.\n\nHe coated both sides of a pane of glass, within two or three inches of the edge, and fastened linen threads to the upper part of the coating, on both sides; which, when the plate was not charged, hung down in contact with the coating: but setting the plate upright and charging it, he observed, that when neither of the sides was touched by his finger, or any other conductor communicating with the earth, both the threads were repelled from the coating, and stood at an equal distance from it; but when he brought his finger or any other conductor to one of the sides, the thread hanging to that side fell nearer to the coating, while the thread on the opposite side receded as much; and that when his finger was brought into contact with one of the sides, the thread on that side fell into contact with it likewise, while the thread on the opposite side receded twice the distance at which it hung originally; so that the two threads always hung so as to make the fame angle with one another.\n\nOne of the most diverting experiments with charged electrics, is that which Dr Franklin calls the Magic Picture, and which he describes in the following manner. Having a large mezzotinto print (supposed of the king), with a frame and glass; take out the print and cut a panel out of it, near two inches distant from the frame all round. If the cut be through the picture, it is not the worse. With thin paste or gum-water, fix the board that is cut off on the inside of the glass, pressing it smooth and close, then fill up the vacancy by gilding.\nPrinciples of gilding the glass well with gold or brass leaf. Gild Electricity likewise the inner edge of the back of the frame all round, except the top part, and form a communication between that gilding and the gilding behind the glass; then put in the board and that side is finished. Turn up the glass, and gild the foreside exactly over the back gilding; and when it is dry, cover it, by pasting on the panel of the picture that has been cut out, observing to bring the correspondent parts of the board and picture together, by which the picture will appear of a piece as at first, only part is behind the glass, and part is before. Lastly, hold the picture horizontally by the top, and place a little moveable gilt crown on the king's head.\n\nIf now the picture be moderately electrified, and another person take hold of the frame with one hand, so that his fingers touch its inside gilding, and with the other hand endeavour to take off the crown, he will receive a severe shock, and fail in the attempt. The operator who, to prevent it from falling holds the picture by the upper end, where the inside of the frame is not gilt, feels nothing of the shock, and may touch the face of the picture with impunity, which he pretends to be a test of his loyalty. If a ring of persons take a shock among them, the experiment is called the conspirators*.\n\nOn the same principle that the wires of phials charged differently, will attract and repel differently, is made an electrical wheel, which, Dr Franklin says, turns with considerable strength, and of which he gives the following description. A small upright shaft of wood passes at right angles through a thin round board, of about twelve inches diameter, and turns on a sharp point of iron, fixed in the lower end; while a strong wire in the upper end, passing through a small hole in a thin brass plate, keeps the shaft truly vertical. About thirty radii of equal length, made of soft-glass, cut in narrow lips, issue horizontally from the circumference of the board; the ends most distant from the centre, being about four inches apart. On the end of every one a brass thimble is fixed.\n\nIf now the wire of a bottle electrified in the common way, be brought near the circumference of this wheel, it will attract the nearest thimble, and so put the wheel in motion. That thimble, in passing by, receives a spark, and thereby being electrified is repelled, and so driven forwards; while a second being attracted, approaches the wire, receives a spark, and is driven after the first; and so on till the wheel has gone once round; when the thimbles before electrified approaching the wire, instead of being attracted as they were at first, are repelled, and the motion presently ceases.\n\nBut if another bottle which had been charged through the coating, be placed near the same wheel, its wire will attract the thimble repelled by the first, and thereby double the force that carries the wheel round; and not only taking out the electric power that had been communicated by the thimbles to the first bottle, but even depriving them of their natural quantity, instead of being repelled when they come again towards the first bottle, they are more strongly attracted; so that the wheel mends its pace, till it goes with great rapidity, 12 or 15 rounds in a minute, and with such strength, that the weight of 100 Spanish, with which it was once loaded, did not seem in the least to retard its motion. This is called an electrical jack, and if a large bottle of wine were spilt on the upper shaft, it would be carried round before a fire, with a motion fit for roadding.\n\nBut this wheel, like those driven by wind, moves by a foreign force, viz. that communicated to it by the bottles.\n\nThe self-moving wheel, though constructed on the same principles, appears more surprising. It is made of a thin round plate of window glass, seventeen inches in diameter, well gilt on both sides, to within two inches of the circumference. Two small hemispheres of wood are then fixed with cement, to the middle of the upper and under sides, centrally opposite, and in each of them a thick strong wire, eight or ten inches long, together making the axis of the wheel. It turns horizontally on a point at the lower end of its axis, which rests on a bit of brass cemented within a glass salt cellar. The upper end of its axis passes through a hole in a thin brass plate, cemented to a long and strong piece of glass; which keeps it fix or eight inches distant from any non-electric, and has a small ball of wax or metal on its top.\n\nIn a circle on the table which supports the wheel, are fixed twelve small pillars of glass, at about eleven inches distance, with a thimble on the top of each. On the edge of the wheel is a small leaden bullet, communicating by a wire with the upper surface of the wheel; and about six inches from it, is another bullet, communicating, in like manner, with the under surface. When the wheel is to be charged by the upper surface, a communication must be made from the under surface with the table.\n\nWhen it is well charged it begins to move. The bullet nearest to a pillar moves toward the thimble on that pillar, and passing by, electrifies it, and then pushes itself from it. The succeeding bullet, which communicates with the other surface of the glass, more strongly attracts that thimble, on account of its being electrified before by the other bullet, and thus the wheel increases its motion, till the resistance of the air regulates it. It will go half an hour, and make one minute with another, twenty turns in a minute, which is six hundred turns in the whole, the bullet of the upper surface giving in each turn, twelve sparks to the thimbles, which makes seven thousand two hundred sparks, and the bullet of the under surface receiving as many from the thimble, these bullets moving in the time near two thousand five hundred feet. The thimbles are well fixed, and in so exact a circle, that the bullets may pass within a very small distance of each of them.\n\nIf instead of two bullets you put eight, four communicating with the upper surface, and four with the under surface, placed alternately, (which eight at about six inches distance, complete the circumference) the force and swiftness will be greatly increased, the wheel making fifty turns in a minute, but then it will not continue moving so long.\n\nThese wheels may be applied perhaps to the ringing chimes, and moving light made orreries*.\n\nMr Cavalli gives the following description of an instrument which he calls the self-charging Leyden phial.\n\nTake a glass tube of about eighteen inches in length, and an inch, or an inch and a half, in diameter. It is immaterial\nPrinciples of Electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nCoat the inside of it with tin-foil, but only from one open extremity of it about as far as its middle; the other part, which remains uncoated, we shall call the naked part of the instrument. Put a cork into the aperture of the coated end, and let a knopped wire pass through the cork, and come in contact with the coating. The instrument being thus prepared, hold it in one hand by the naked part, and with the other hand clean and dry-rub the outside of the coated part of the tube; but after every three or four strokes you must remove the rubbing hand, and must touch the knob of the wire, and in so doing a little spark will be drawn from it. By this means the coated end of the tube will gradually acquire a charge, which may be increased to a considerable degree. If then you grasp the outside of the coated end of the tube with one hand, and touch the knob of the wire with the other hand, you will obtain a shock, &c.\n\nIn this experiment the coated part of the tube answers the double office of electrical machine and of Leyden phial; the naked part of it being only a sort of handle to hold the instrument by. The friction on the outside of the tube accumulates a quantity of positive electricity upon it, and this electricity forces out of the inside a quantity of electricity also positive. Then by taking the spark from the knob, this inside electricity, which is by the coating communicated to the knob through the wire, is removed, consequently the inside remains undercharged or negative, and of course the positive electricity of the outside comes closer to the surface of the glass, and begins to form the charge. By farther rubbing and taking the spark from the knob this charge is increased, &c.\n\nInstead of a tube, this instrument may be constructed with a pane of glass, in which case it will be rather simpler, but it cannot be managed so easily, nor of course can it be charged so high as the tube. A piece of tin-foil must be pasted in the middle of only one surface of the pane, leaving about two inches and a half or three inches of uncoated glass all round. This done, hold the glass by a corner, with the coated side from you, and with the other hand rub its uncoated side, and take the spark from the tin-foil alternately, until you think that the glass may be sufficiently charged; then lay the glass with its uncoated side flat upon one hand, and on turning the tin-foil with the other hand you will receive the shock.\n\n**Chapter VII. Of the chemical effects of the Electric Spark.**\n\n**Exper. 1.—To fire rosin.** Wrap some cotton wool, containing as much powdered rosin as it will hold, about one of the knobs of a discharging rod. Then having charged a Leyden jar, apply the naked knob of the rod to the external coating, and the knob enveloped by the cotton to the ball of the wire. The act of discharging the jar will set fire to the rosin.\n\nA piece of phosphorus or camphor wrapped in cotton wool, and used in the same way, will be much more easily inflamed.\n\n**Exper. 2.—To fire spirits.** Hang a small ball with a stem to the prime conductor, so that the ball may project below the conductor. Then warm a little ardent spirit, by holding it a short time over a candle in a metallic spoon; hold the spoon about an inch below the ball, and let the machine in motion. A spark will soon issue from the ball and set fire to the spirits.\n\nThis experiment succeeds in the very same manner, whether the conductor is electrified positively or negatively, i.e., whether the spark be made to come from the conductor or from the spoon; it being only in consequence of the rapid motion of the spark that the spirits are kindled.\n\nIt will perhaps scarce necessary to remark, that the more inflammable the spirits are, the more proper they will be for this experiment, as a smaller spark will be sufficient to inflame them; therefore rectified spirit of wine is better than common proof spirit, and ether is better than either.\n\nThis experiment may be varied different ways, and may be rendered very agreeable to a company of spectators. A person, for instance, standing upon an electric stool, and communicating with the prime conductor, may hold the spoon with the spirits in his hand, and another person, standing upon the floor, may set the spirits on fire, by bringing his finger within a small distance of it. Instead of his finger, he may fire the spirits with a piece of ice; when the experiment will seem much more surprising. If the spoon is held by the person standing upon the floor, and the insulated person brings some conducting substance over the surface of the spirit, the experiment succeeds as well.\n\nMr Winckler says, that oil, pitch, and sealing-wax, might be lighted by electric sparks, provided those substances were first heated to a degree next to kindling. To these it must be added, that Mr Graham fired the smoke of a candle just blown out, and lighted it again; and that Mr Boze fired gunpowder, melting it in a spoon, and fired the vapour that rose from it.\n\nThis experiment will succeed better with a charged jar.\n\n**Exper. 3.—To fire hydrogenous gas.** Provide a bottle of strong glass with two necks, as a, fig. 48. Let a hydrogenous gas be fitted to each neck c, d; one of which is furnished with a cock, and through the other e, CLXXXIX. a glass tube s is passed, containing a wire projecting beyond the tube at one end, which is terminated by a knob n, while the other passing within the bottle turns round so as to come within an inch of the brass through which the glass tube passes. The bottle being thus prepared, fill it with water, and throw up into it equal parts of hydrogen gas and common air, or three parts of hydrogen and one of oxygen gas; fix in the cork, and shake the bottle so as to mix the gases well together. Then bring the knob n, near the knob of a charged jar, or a ball of the prime conductor, and the hydrogen will be inflamed with a loud report.\n\nIn general the cork will be forced out by the explosion; but if this should not be the case, an opportunity is afforded of proving that the gases have disappeared, and water has been produced by the experiment. On taking out the cork below the surface of water, the water will rush in, and fill the bottle, thus shewing that the gases have disappeared.\n\nTo prove the production of water, it is necessary that the bottle should have been filled with mercury before\nELECTRICITY.\n\nPrinciples of Electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nThe first person who fired inflammable bodies by the electric spark was Dr Ludolf of Berlin, in 1774, who, by sparks excited by the friction of a glass tube, kindled the ethereal spirits of Frobenius*. Mr Gordon of Erfurd, produced so strong a spark from the back of a cat, as to fire spirit of wine†.\n\nExper. 4.—It has been proposed by Sig. Volta to apply the burning of hydrogen gas to economical purposes, in what he called the inflammable air lamp.\n\nA, fig. 49, is a glass globe for containing the gas; B a glass basin or reservoir for holding water; D a cock to form a communication between the water and the gas. The water passes into the globe through the metal pipe g g, which is fixed to the upper part of the reservoir A; at r is a cock to cut off or open a communication between the air and the jar K. N is a small pipe to hold a piece of wax taper; L a brass pillar, on the top of which is a ball of the same metal; a, is a pillar of glass with a socket at the top, in which slides the wire b, having a ball screwed on the end of it. F, is a cock by which the globe is filled with hydrogen gas, and which afterwards serves to confine the gas and what water falls from B into A.\n\nTo use this instrument, having filled the globe with gas, and the reservoir A with water, turn the cocks D and r, and water will fall into the globe, forcing up a quantity of gas, which will rise through the pipe K. If now an electric spark be made to pass from the ball m to that marked n, it will set fire to the inflammable gas which passes through the pipe K. To extinguish the lamp, first shut the cock r, and then D.\n\nThe gas is obtained in the usual way from diluted sulphuric acid and iron filings, and the globe is to be filled in the following manner. Having previously filled it with water, place the foot A in a tub of water so that it may be covered, and that the bent glass tube through which the gas is to be introduced, may pass commodiously below the foot. When the gas has driven out nearly all the water, turn the cock F, and the lamp is ready for use.\n\nExper. 5. To fire gunpowder.—Fix a small cartridge on a metallic wire which is fitted to a glass or wooden handle; make a communication between the wire and the ground; then present the cartridge to the knob of a charged Leyden phial, and the gunpowder will be fired.\n\nFig. 50, represents a small cannon, with an ivory touch-hole fitted with a brass pin furnished with a round head. Gunpowder may be fired from this cannon by the electric shock, in the following manner. Charge the cannon with gunpowder as usual; then fill the touch-hole with powder, ram it well down, and push into it the brass pin so that its end may be near the bottom of the hole. Now make a communication between the outside of a large charged jar, or a battery, and the body of the cannon; then, placing one ball of a discharging rod on the head of the pin, which passes down the touch-hole of the cannon, and bring the other to the knob of the jar, and the discharge will fire the cannon.\n\nThe electric spark decomposes most of the compound gases, and forms new compounds with their component principles.\n\nThe first who examined the action of electricity on the gases, was Dr Priestley. In the course of his experiments on air, he found that by means of the electric spark, he could convert the blue colour of a vegetable infusion into red. The instrument used in this experiment, was a glass tube about four or five inches long, and one or two tenths of an inch in diameter in the gases, the inside; a piece of wire was put into one end of the tube, and fixed there with cement; a brass ball was fixed on the top of this wire; the lower part of the tube Dr Priestley was filled with water, tinged blue with a piece of turnery—fole or archil. This was easily effected by fitting the tube in a vessel of the tinged water, then placing it under a receiver on the plate of an air-pump; exhausting the receiver in part, and then, on letting in the air, the tinged liquor rose in the tube, and the elevation would be in proportion to the accuracy of the vacuum; now taking the tube and vessel from under the receiver, he threw strong sparks on the brass ball from the prime conductor.\n\nWhen Dr Priestley made this experiment, he perceived, that after the electric sparks had been passed between the wire and the liquor for about a minute, the upper part of the liquor began to look red; in two minutes it was manifestly fo, and the red part did not readily mix with the rest of the liquor. If the tube was inclined where the sparks were passed through it, the redness extended twice as far on the lower side as on the upper. In proportion as the liquor became red, it advanced nearer to the wire, so that the air through which the sparks were passed, was diminished; the diminution amounted to about one fifth of the whole space; after which a continuation of the electric sparks produced no sensible effect.\n\nTo determine the cause of the change of colour, Dr Priestley expanded the air in the tube by means of an air-pump, till it expelled all the liquor, and admitted fresh blue colour in its place; but after this, electricity produced no sensible effect on the air or on the liquor; so that it was clear, that the air had been decomposed, and something of an acid nature had been produced. The result was the same with wires of different metals. It was also the same, when by means of a bent tube, the sparks were made to pass from the liquor in one leg of the tube to the liquor in the other. The air thus diminished, was in the highest degree noxious.\n\nIn passing the electric spark through different gases, it appears of different colours. In carbonic acid gas, the spark is very white; in hydrogenous gas, and ammoniacal gas, it appears of a purple or red colour.\n\nDr Priestley found that the electric spark passed through any kind of oil, produced an inflammable gas. He tried it with oil of olives, oil of turpentine, and essential oil of mint. The electric spark when passed through ether, produces the same effect.\n\nHe found that the electric spark when passed through ammoniacal gas, increases the bulk of this gas; so that, by making about two hundred shocks pass through a given quantity of it, the original quantity was sometimes increased one fourth. If water was admitted to this gas, it absorbed the original quantity, and left about as much gas as was generated by the electricity, and this was a strongly inflammable gas.\nDr Priestley found, that on passing slight electric shocks for about an hour, through an inch of carbonic acid gas, confined in a glass tube one-tenth of an inch in diameter, when water was admitted to it, only one fourth of the air was absorbed.\n\nHe likewise found, when the electric spark was passed through carbonated hydrogen gas, that the inside of the tube in which the gas was confined, was covered with a blackish substance.\n\nDr Priestley took the simple electric spark from a conductor of moderate size, for the space of five minutes without interruption, in a quantity of carbonated hydrogen gas, without producing any change in the inside of the glass; when immediately after, passing through it only two shocks of a common jar, each of which might be produced in less than a quarter of a minute with the same machine in the same state, the whole of the inside of the tube was completely covered with the black matter.\n\nA large phial, about an inch and a half wide, being filled with this gas, the explosions of a very large jar containing more than two feet of coated surface, had no effect upon it; from which it seems, that in these cases the force of the shock was not able to decompose the gas.\n\nSeveral valuable experiments were made by the Hon. Henry Cavendish, of which he gave an account in the 73rd volume of the Phil. Trans.\n\nThe apparatus used in making the experiments was as follows. The air, through which the spark was intended to be passed, was confined in a glass tube M, bent at an angle, as in fig. 51, which, after being filled with quicksilver, was inverted into two glasses of the same fluid, as in the figure. The air to be tried, was then introduced by means of a small tube, such as is used for thermometers, bent in the manner represented by ABC, fig. 52, the bent end of which, after being previously filled with quicksilver, was introduced, as in the figure, under the glass DEF, inverted into water, and filled with the proper kind of air, the end C of the tube being kept stopped by the finger; then, on removing the finger from C, the quicksilver in the tube descended in the leg BC, and its place was supplied with air from the glass DEF. Having thus got the proper quantity of air into the tube ABC, it was held with the end C uppermost, and stopped with the finger; and the end A, made smaller for that purpose, being introduced into one end of the bent tube M, fig. 51, the air, on removing the finger from C, was forced into that tube by the pressure of the quicksilver in the leg BC. By these means he was enabled to introduce the exact quantity of soap-lees, or any other liquor which he wanted to be in contact with the air.\n\nIn one case, however, in which he wanted to introduce air into the tube many times in the same experiment, he used the apparatus represented in fig. 53, consisting of a tube AB of a small bore, a ball C, and a tube DE of a larger bore. This apparatus was first filled with quicksilver, and then, the ball C and the tube AB were filled with air, by introducing the end A under a glass inverted into water, which contained the proper kind of air, and drawing out the quicksilver from the leg ED by a siphon. After being thus furnished with air, the apparatus was weighed, and the end A introduced into one end of the tube M, and kept there during the experiment; the way of forcing air out of this apparatus into the tube, being by thrusting down the tube ED a wooden cylinder, of such a size as almost to fill up the whole bore, and by occasionally pouring quicksilver into the same tube, to supply the place of that pushed into the ball C. After the experiment was finished, the apparatus was weighed again, which showed exactly how much air had been forced into the tube M, during the whole experiment; it being equal in bulk to a quantity of quicksilver, whose weight was equal to the increase of weight of the apparatus.\n\nThe bore of the tube M used in most of the following experiments, was about one-tenth of an inch; and the length of the column of air, occupying the upper part of the tube, was in general from one and a half to three-quarters of an inch.\n\nIn order to force an electrical spark through the tube, it was necessary, not to make a communication between the tube and the conductor, but to place an inflated ball at such a distance from the conductor, as to receive a spark from it, and to make a communication between that ball and the quicksilver in one of the glasses, while the quicksilver in the other glass communicated with the ground.\n\nWhen the electric spark was made to pass through common air, included between short columns of a solution of litmus, the solution acquired a red colour, and the air was diminished conformably to what was observed by Dr Priestley. When lime-water was used instead of the solution of litmus, and the spark was continued till the air could be no farther diminished, not the least cloud could be perceived in the lime-water; but the air was reduced to two thirds of its original bulk; which is a greater diminution than it could have suffered by mere phlogistication, as that is very little more than one-fifth of the whole.\n\nThe experiment was next repeated with some impure oxygen gas. The gas was very much diminished, but without the least cloud being produced in the lime-water, nor was any cloud produced when carbonic acid gas was let up to it; but on the further addition of a little caustic ammonia, a brown sediment was immediately perceived.\n\nHence we may conclude that the lime-water was saturated by some acid formed during the operation; as in this case it is evident that no earth could have been precipitated by the carbonic acid gas alone, but that the caustic ammonia, on being added, would unite with the carbonic acid, and thus becoming a carbonate would precipitate the lime by double affinity; whereas, if the lime had not been saturated with an acid, it would have been precipitated on the addition of carbonic acid gas. As to the brown colour of the sediment, it was probably owing to some of the mercury having been dissolved.\n\nWhen the impure oxygen gas was confined by soap lees, the diminution proceeded rather faster than when it was confined by lime-water; for which reason, as well as on account of this lixivium containing a large quantity of alkali in proportion to its bulk, it seemed better adapted than lime-water for experiments designed to investigate the nature of the acid produced. Accordingly some experiments were made to determine of what degree of purity the oxygen gas should be, in order\nElectricity\n\nPrinciples of order to be diminished most readily and in the greatest degree; and it was found that when good oxygen gas was employed, the diminution was but small; when perfectly pure azotic gas was used, no sensible diminution took place; but when five parts of pure oxygen gas, and three of common air were employed, almost the whole of the gases were made to disappear. It must be considered that common air consists of one part of oxygen gas mixed with between three and four of azotic gas, so that a mixture of five parts of pure oxygen gas and three of common air, was nearly the same thing as seven parts of oxygen gas and three of azotic gas.\n\nHaving made these previous trials, Mr Cavendish introduced into the tube a little soap lees, and then let up some oxygen gas and common air, mixed in the above proportions, which rising to the top of the tube M, distributed the soap-lees in the two legs of the tube, as fast as the air contained in it was diminished by the electric spark; continuing to add more of the same mixture till no further diminution took place; after which a little pure oxygen-gas, and then a little common air were added, in order to see whether cessation of diminution was not owing to some imperfection of the proportion of the two kinds of air to each other, but without effect. The lixivium being then poured out of the tube, and separated from the mercury, seemed to be perfectly neutralized, as it produced no change on the colour of paper tinged with the juice of blue flowers. Being evaporated to dryness, a small quantity of salt was left, which was evidently nitre, as appeared by the manner in which paper impregnated with a solution of it burned.\n\nFor more satisfaction, he tried this experiment over again, on a larger scale. About five times the former quantity of soap lees were now let up into a tube of a larger bore; and a mixture of oxygen gas and common air, in the same proportions as before, being introduced by the apparatus represented in fig. 53. The spark was continued till no more air could be made to disappear. The liquor when poured out of the tube, smelled evidently of nitrous acid. This fact was found by the manner in which paper, dipped into a solution of it, burned, to be true nitre. It appeared by the test of muriate of baryta, to contain no more sulphuric acid than the soap-lees themselves often contain, which is in general very little; and there is no reason to think that any other acid entered into it, except the nitric.\n\n(T) It was found by C. Monge, who carefully examined the gas produced by passing electric sparks through carbonic acid gas, that it had been rendered inflammable; and that the mercury employed to confine the gas, as well as the wires between which the sparks passed, were oxidated. C. Monge supposed that the carbonic acid employed had undergone no change, but that the water held in solution by it had been decomposed; thus accounting for the oxidation of the metals, and the generation of inflammable gas.\n\nM. Theodore de Saussure, not considering C. Monge's experiments as decisive, repeated them on a larger scale. He caused to circulate for 18 hours, electric sparks in the bulb of a matra which contained 13 cubic inches of pure carbonic acid gas, and without any mixture of water superabundant to that which it might naturally hold in solution. The mercury in which the inverted matra was immersed rose to about the half of its neck. After electrification the metallic fluid was found oxidated black, as had been observed by Monge and Priestley; but his conductors, which were of copper, were not sensibly altered. The elastic fluid had experienced a small dilatation, which appeared to him not to exceed the tenth part of a cubic inch. He then made about a grain of water to pass in contact with the aeriform gas contained in the matra. He let it remain there for several days, without perceiving...\nThe gas obtained from sulphuric acid and charcoal was diminished a little, and black spots were formed on the inside of the glass receiver. Afterwards it was observed, that only one-eighth part of the electrified gas was absorbed by water. It extinguished a candle, and had very little smell.\n\nMuriatic acid gas seemed to oppose in great measure the passage of the electric sparks, since they would not pass through a greater length than 2½ inches of this air. It was considerably diminished, but the rest was readily absorbed by water.\n\nFluoric acid gas was neither diminished, nor any other way sensibly altered, by the electric sparks.\n\nAmmoniacal gas, extracted from pure ammonia, was at first almost doubled in bulk; then it was diminished a little; after which it remained without any augmentation or diminution. It became unabsorbable by water; and by the contact of flame it exploded, like a mixture of hydrogen gas and a good deal of common air.\n\nCommon air was lastly tried, and it was found to give a little faint redness to the tincture of turnsole; becoming, at the same time sensibly deoxidized. The experiment was repeated thrice at different times, and in each time after the electrification it was examined by the admixture of nitrous gas in Mr Fontana's eudiometer, and it was compared with the same gas not electrified; the latter always suffering the greatest diminution. In the first experiment the diminutions were \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\); in the second, \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\); and in the last, \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\nOn attempting to repeat Mr Cavendish's experiment described above, in which he produced the nitric acid by a mixture of oxygen with azotic gas; instead of a syphon, the Doctor made use of a glass tube one-sixth part of an inch in diameter, closed at one end, into which an iron wire, \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of an inch in diameter, had been inserted: into this tube, filled with mercury, and fixed in a vertical position, was introduced the air with which the experiment was to be tried. The oxygen gas was obtained from red precipitate, and had been thoroughly purified by alkaline salts, from any acid it might have contained. With a mixture of five parts of this and three of common air, the tube was filled to the height of three inches, to which was added five-twelfths of an inch of lixivium, of the same kind with that used by Mr Cavendish. The result was, that, after transmitting through the tube a continued stream of the electric sparks during 15 minutes, two inches of the air were absorbed by the lixivium: more air being introduced into the tube till it was filled to the height of three inches, when it was again electrified. This process was repeated till 8½ inches of air had been absorbed by the lixivium: this was now examined, and found to be, in some degree, impregnated with the nitric acid; but it was very far from being saturated. With the same lixivium, of which a quarter of an inch remained in the tube, the experiment was continued till 14 inches more of air had been absorbed; but its diminution was not perceived to decrease, though the lixivium had now absorbed 77 measures of air, each equal to its own; whereas, in the experiment related by Mr Cavendish, only 38 measures of air were absorbed by the alkali. But notwithstanding this greater absorption, the lixivium was yet far from being saturated.\n\nThe experiment was repeated with oxygen gas, obtained from minium, moistened with the sulphuric acid; seven parts of this were mixed with three of azotic gas, and lixivium added to the height of one-eighth of an inch. Here, as in the former experiment, the diminution continued without any decrease; and the lixivium, after it had absorbed 22½ inches, and consequently 178 times its own measure of air, was very far from being saturated with the nitric acid.\n\nOn this Dr Van Marum wrote to Mr Cavendish; and finding, by his answer, that this gentleman had used oxygen gas, obtained from a black powder produced by shaking mercury with lead, he requested to be informed of the process by which it is generated; but Mr Cavendish, not choosing to communicate this at present, he determined to defer the repetition of the experiment till this ingenious philosopher should have published his mode of obtaining the oxygen gas used in it.\n\nOur author then goes on to some experiments made\n\nperceiving any dilatation in the volume of the gases, the residue of the operation. He then moistened with a drop of water, which he introduced, the whole inside of the matras; but in vain: the mercury constantly remained at the same height. He, however, found, on absorbing by potash the residuum of the acid gas, that a cubic inch of carbonic acid gas had disappeared, and had been replaced by a quantity nearly equal, or rather superior, to the inflammable gas. The 20 cubic centimetres, occupied in the neck of the matras, a column four inches in length; and the acid gas, had the supposed explanation been just, would have been dilated through all that space. He then thought that this inflammable gas did not arise from the decomposition of the water, but from that of the carbonic acid itself, by the metal. He indeed found that this gas was not hydrogen gas, but carbonous gas perfectly pure. He burnt 100 parts of it on mercury with about a third of oxygen gas. He did not perceive water after this combustion, which left for residuum 77 parts of carbonic acid gas.\n\nThe dilatation which the latter experiences by electrization may be explained by the different densities of the carbonous gas and the carbonic acid gas. He was not able to verify the observation of C. Monge reflecting the dilatation experienced by the carbonic acid gas, after electrization over mercury.\n\nIf it was not possible to reduce entirely the acid gas into carbonous gas by these processes, it was because the first stage of metallic oxidation prevented an obstacle to further oxidation, by preventing the points of contact. The development of the carbonous gas produced therefore an analogous effect.\n\nIt results then from his observations, that the change which carbonic acid gas undergoes by electrization does not arise from the decomposition of the water, but from the partial decomposition of the carbonic acid gas, which becomes carbonous gas, giving up a part of its oxygen to the metal introduced in those experiments.\nOxygen gas obtained the week before from red precipitate, being placed over mercury, and electrified for 30 minutes, was diminished by one-fifth, the surface of the quicksilver soon began to be oxidated, and towards the end of the experiment the glass tube was lined with the oxide as to cease to be transparent. By introducing a piece of iron, the electric stream was made to pass through the air without immediately touching the mercury; yet this was equally oxidated.\n\nTwo inches and three quarters of the same kind of gas being placed over water, and electrified in the same manner during half an hour, lost a quarter of an inch; and being suffered to stand 12 hours in the tube, was found to have lost one-eighth of an inch more. This was very nearly the same diminution of the gas that had taken place when it was electrified over mercury; but, in this case, the process appears to have been more slow. The gas remaining after these experiments, being tried by the edimeter, did not differ from unelectrified oxygen gas taken from the same receiver.\n\nTo determine whether the gas retained any of the acid employed in its production, the Doctor repeated the experiment with gas obtained from red precipitate, confined by an infusion of turpentine, but could not perceive in it the least change of colour. He also electrified gas obtained from minium and the sulphuric acid, placed over some diluted acetate of lead; but this was not rendered at all turbid.\n\nThree inches of azotic gas being electrified, during the first five minutes were augmented to 3½ inches, and in the next 10 minutes to 3¾ inches: some lixivium was then introduced to try whether this would absorb it; but upon being electrified 15 minutes, the column rose to the height of 3½ inches. It was suffered to stand in the tube till the next day, when it was found to have sunk to its original dimensions.\n\nNitrous gas, confined by lixivium, being electrified during half an hour, lost three quarters of its bulk; the lixivium appeared to have absorbed a great deal of nitric acid; and the gas remaining in the tube did not seem to differ from common azotic gas. Some of the same nitrous gas, confined by lixivium, was, by standing three weeks, diminished to half its bulk, and this residuum also proved to be azotic gas.\n\nHydrogen gas obtained from steel filings and the diluted sulphuric acid, being confined by an infusion of turpentine, was electrified for 10 minutes without any change of colour in the infusion, or any alteration in the bulk of the air. The tube being filled with the same air to the height of 2½ inches, and placed in diluted acetate of lead, was exposed to the electric stream during 12 minutes, in which time the enclosed gas rose to five inches; but the acetate remained perfectly clear. Three inches of inflammable gas, obtained from a mixture of alcohol and sulphuric acid, on being electrified for 15 minutes, rose to 10 inches; thus dilated, it lost all its inflammability, and when nitrous gas was added, no diminution ensued.\n\nA column of ammoniacal gas obtained by heat from pure ammonia, three inches high, was electrified four minutes, and rose to six inches, but did not rise higher when electrified ten minutes longer. It appears that this air is not expanded more by the powerful electric stream from this machine than by the common spark. Water would not absorb this electrified air, which was in part inflammable.\n\nThe tube, being filled to the height of an inch with ammoniacal gas, and inverted in mercury, was electrified four minutes; in which time the tube was filled with eight inches of gas, which proved to be equally inflammable, and as little absorbed by water as the ammoniacal gas.\n\nThe following experiment is very curious. Two balloons, made of the allantoides of a calf, were filled periment with hydrogen gas, of which each contained about two cubic feet. To each of these was suspended, by a filken thread about eight feet long, such a weight as was just sufficient to prevent it from rising higher in the air; they were connected, the one with the positive, the other with the negative conductor, by small wires about 30 feet in length; and being kept near 20 feet asunder, were placed as far from the machine as the length of the wires would admit. On being electrified, these balloons rose up in the air as high as the wire allowed, attracted each other, and uniting as it were into one cloud, gently descended.\n\nThe rarefaction of air by the electric explosion, is well illustrated by an experiment of Mr Kinnerley, described by Mr Cavallo, Fig. 54. Plate CLXXXIX. This instrument, which the inventor, Mr Kin-nerley, calls the electrical air thermometer, it being very useful to observe the effects of the electric explosion upon air. The body of this thermometer consists of a glass tube AB, about ten inches long, and nearly two inches diameter, and closed air-tight at both ends by two brass caps. Through a hole in the upper cap, a small tube HA, open at both ends, is introduced in some water at the bottom B of the large tube. Through the middle of each of the brass caps, a wire FG, EI, is introduced, having a brass knob within the glass tube, and by sliding through the caps, they may be set at any distance from one another. This instrument is, by a brass ring C, fastened to the pillar of the wooden stand CD, that supports it. When the air within the tube AB is rarefied, it will press upon the water at the bottom of the tube, which will consequently rise in the cavity of the small tube; and as this water rises higher or lower, so it shows the greater or less rarefaction of the air within the tube AB, which has no communication with the external air.\n\nIf the water, when this instrument is to be used, is all at the bottom of the large tube, (i.e. none of it is in the cavity of the small tube) it will be proper to blow with the mouth into the small tube, and thus cause the water to rise a little in it; where, for better regulation, a mark may be fixed.\n\nBring the knobs GI of the wires IE, FG, into contact with one another, then connect the ring E or F, with one side of a charged jar, and the other ring with the other side, by which operation a shock will be made to pass through the wires FG, IE, i.e. between the knobs EI. In this case you will observe, that the water in the small tube is not at all moved from the mark.\n\nPut the knobs GI, a little distant from one another, and send a shock through them as before, and you will\nPrinciples of Electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nIf the experiment be made in a room, where the degree of heat is variable, then proper allowance must be made for this circumstance, in estimating the event of the experiment; for the electrical air thermometer is affected by heat or cold in general, as well as by that caused by an electric spark.\n\nIn the year 1789, Messrs Paets, Van Troostwyk, and Deiman, the three associated Dutch chemists, as they are generally called, sent a letter to M. de la Mettrie, giving an account of some experiments, which they, assisted by Mr Cuthbertson, had made on the effect of passing a stream of electricity for a considerable time through water. Their letter was printed in the Journal de Physique for that year; but the account is too long to be inserted here; we shall, therefore, copy the following succinct account of the experiment by Dr Pearson.\n\nThe apparatus employed was a tube 12 inches in length, and its bore was one-eighth of an inch in diameter, English measure; which was hermetically sealed at one end, and, while it was sealing, an inch and a half of gold or platina wire was introduced within the tube, and fixed into the closed end, by melting the glass around the extremity of the wire. Another wire of platina, or of gold, with platina wire at its extremity, immersed in quicksilver, was introduced at the open end of the tube, which extended to within five-eighths of an inch of the upper wire, which, as was just said, was fixed into the sealed extremity (u).\n\nThe tube was filled with distilled water, which had been freed from air by means of Cuthbertson's last improved air-pump, of the greatest rarefying power. As the open end of the tube was immersed in a cup of quicksilver, a little common air was let into the convex part of the curved end of the tube, with the view of preventing fracture from the electrical discharges.\n\nThe wire which passed through the sealed extremity was set in contact with a brass insulated ball; and this insulated ball was placed at a little distance from the prime conductor of the electrical machine. The wire of the lower or open extremity, immersed in quicksilver, communicated by a wire or chain with the exterior coated surface of a Leyden jar, which contained about a square foot of coating; and the ball of the jar was in contact with the prime conductor.\n\nThe electrical machine consisted of two plates of 31 inches in diameter, and similar to that of Teyler. It possessed the power of causing the jar to discharge itself 25 times in 15 revolutions. When the brass ball and that of the prime conductor were in contact, no air or gas was discharged from the water by the electrical discharges; but on gradually increasing their distance from one another, the position was found in which gas was discharged, and which ascended immediately to the top of the tube. By continuing the discharges, gas continued to be discharged, and ascend, till it reached nearly to the lower extremity of the upper wire; and then a discharge occasioned the whole of the gas to disappear, a small portion excepted, and its place was consequently supplied by water.\n\nThe residuary portion of gas being let out after each experiment, and the discharges being continued in the same water, this residuary gas was left in smaller and smaller quantity; so that after four experiments, probably made on the same day, it did not amount to more than 1/80th of the bulk of gas which had been produced. If it had been possible to pass electric sparks through this very small quantity of gas a second time, or oftener, it was supposed it would have been diminished still more. But when the tube had been left for a night only filled with water, the residuary gas was in greater quantity than after the last experiment the preceding day (x).\n\nIt was concluded that the gas produced by the electrical discharges was oxygen and hydrogen gas, from decomposed water:\n\n1. Because no other gas hitherto known instantly disappears on passing through it an electric spark.\n2. The gas obtained must have been the oxygen and hydrogen of decomposed water, because they were in exactly those proportions in which by combination they reproduce water; the trifling residue being considered to be merely a portion of air which had been dissolved in the water.\n3. Liquids which are not compounded of hydrogen and oxygen, as sulphuric and nitric acids, afforded gas by the electric discharges, but which did not disappear on\n\n(u) In another part of Mr Van Troostwyk's memoir it is stated that the distance was an inch and a quarter from the end of the upper wire to the top of the lower wire; and that the distance between the insulated ball and prime conductor was at first three-fourths of an inch, but that afterwards it was increased to an inch. Although the wire fastened into the top of the tube was said to be an inch and a half in length, it is observed, that when a column of three-eighths of an inch of air was collected, it was almost at the extremity of the upper wire. From these and other inaccuracies, it will be made appear, that no one, from the account published, has been able to repeat the experiment.\n\n(x) In at least fifty experiments I have never seen the residue of gas less than one-fortieth of the gas produced, although the water had been freed from air by the most effectual means. But Mr Schurer (Annales de Chimie, tom. v. p. 276.) testifies that he saw Mr Van Troostwyk make the experiment; and that after it was repeated many times, on the same parcel of water, there was no residue at all. I have very good grounds for believing, that this is one of the number of inaccuracies in the account published of this subject.\nDr Pearson repeated the above experiments; and has given an ample detail of the manner in which he conducted his experiments, and of their result. Our limits will not permit us to give the paper of this ingenious chemist at length: we shall, therefore, present our readers with a brief abstract of it, referring them for the original to Nicholson's Journal for September, October, and November 1797, or the Philosophical Transactions for the same year.\n\nDr Pearson remarks that electric discharges may be employed in two manners to decompose water, viz. by what has been termed the interrupted explosion, which was Mr Van Troolwyk's method, and the uninterrupted or complete explosion.\n\nThe Doctor lays down the following requisites for succeeding in this experiment by the interrupted explosion:\n\n1. The electrical machine must possess sufficient power.\n2. Dr Pearson employed a plate machine, constructed by Cuthbertson, which he considers as preferable to a cylindrical machine.\n3. The Leyden jar must have a sufficient quantity of coated surface. The Doctor found by experience that the proper quantity was about 150 or 160 square inches, with a proportional prime conductor.\n4. The distance between the insulated ball and the prime conductor must always be less than the distance between the extremities of the wires.\n5. The extremities of the upper and under wire within the tube must be at a certain distance from one another. The distance which the doctor generally found to answer best, was about five-eighths or seven-eighths of an inch.\n6. The upper wire fixed into the closed extremity of the tube must be of a proper length and thickness. The diameter of the upper wire cannot perhaps be too small, and the smaller the diameter of the tube, the longer this wire may be.\n7. The tubes must be of a proper length and diameter. The Doctor found the proper length to be nine or ten inches, exclusive of the curved part. The diameter should not be more than one-eighth, or less than one-twelfth of an inch.\n\nTo succeed by the complete or uninterrupted explosion, Dr Pearson used the following apparatus:\n\n1. A tube about four or five inches in length, and one-fifth or one-sixth of an inch in diameter; one end of which was mounted with a brass cap, and into the other, which was hermetically sealed, was fitted a platinum wire of about 1/40th of an inch in diameter, extending into the brass cap, so as to be almost in contact with it.\n2. He also employed a tube five inches long and half an inch wide, either blown into a funnel at one end, or having a brass funnel fitted to it, and inverted in a brass dish; a wire, such as the last, is sealed into the other end, and nearly touches the brass dish.\n\nThe proper distance between the wire and dish must be found by trials. In the Doctor's experiments it was about one-twentieth of an inch.\n\n3. The Leyden jar employed must contain about 150 square inches of coating.\n4. The distance between the insulated ball and the prime conductor was about half an inch.\n\nFrom his experiments Dr Pearson draws the following conclusions.\n\nThe mere concussion by the electric discharges, appears to extricate not only the air dissolved in water, which can be separated from it by boiling and the air-pump, but also that which remains in water, notwithstanding these means of extricating it have been employed.\n\nThe quantity of this air varies in the same, and in different waters, according to circumstances. New-River water from the cistern yielded one-fifth of its bulk of air, when placed by Mr Cuthbertson under the receiver of his most powerful air-pump; but in the same situation, New-River water taken from a tub exposed to the atmosphere for some time yielded its own bulk of air. Hence the gas procured by the first one, two, or even three hundred explosions in water containing its natural quantity of air, is diminished very little by an electric spark.\n\nThe gas thus separable from water, like atmospheric air, consists of oxygen and nitrogen, or azotic gas; which may be in exactly the same proportions as in atmospheric air: for the water may retain one kind of gas more tenaciously than the other; and on this account the air separated may be better or worse than atmospheric air at different periods of the process for extricating it.\n\nWith regard to the gas, which instantly disappears on passing through it an electric spark, its nature is shown by (a) this very property of thus diminishing; and by the following properties:\n\n(b) A certain quantity of nitrous gas instantly disappeared, apparently composing nitrous acid, on being added to the gas (a).\n\nOxygen gas being added to the residue after saturation with nitrous gas, and an electric spark being applied to the mixture of gasses, well dried, a considerable diminution immediately took place, and water was produced.\n\n(c) Combustion from hydrogen and oxygen gas took place when the tube was about three-fourths full of gas, which was confirmed by passing an electric discharge, under the same circumstances, through a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas.\n\n(d) Combustion from hydrogen and oxygen gas took place when the points of the compasses were accidentally applied to the part of the tube containing gas; which was confirmed by passing a discharge, under the same circumstances, through a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas, while the points of the compasses were applied to the tube.\n\n(e) The observations made of the kindling of gas, in small quantities, from time to time, during the process of obtaining it, particularly while it was ascending in chains of bubbles, or was adhering to the funnel of the tube, confirm the evidence in favour of this gas being hydrogen and oxygen gas.\n\nThe electric spark fuses and oxidizes metals. The metals by first experiment to ascertain the action of electricity on the electric spark.\nPrinciples of metals was, we believe, made by Dr Franklin. The method in which he made the spark fuse metals was by illustrating putting thin pieces of them between two panes of glass bound together, and sending an electric shock through them. Sometimes the piece of glass by which they were confined, would be shattered to pieces by the discharge, and be broken into a kind of coarse sand, which once happened with pieces of thick looking-glass; but if they remained whole, the piece of metal would be melting in several places where it had lain between them, and instead of it, a metallic stain would be seen on both the glasses, the stains on the under and upper glasses being exactly similar in the minutest stroke.\n\nA piece of gold-leaf used in this manner appeared not only to have been melted, but even vitrified, as the Doctor thought, or otherwise so driven into the pores of the glass, as to be protected by it from the action of the strongest aqua-regia. Sometimes he observed that the metallic stains would spread a little wider than the breadth of the thin pieces of metal. True gold, he observed, made a darker stain, somewhat reddish, and silver a greenish tinge.\n\nMr Cavallo gives the following directions for fusing metallic wires.\n\nConnect with the hook, communicating with the outside coating of a battery, containing at least thirty square feet of coated surface, a wire, that is about one-fiftieth part of an inch thick, and about two feet long; the other end of it must be fastened to one end of the discharging rod; this done, charge the battery, and then by bringing the discharging rod near its wires, send the explosion through the small wire, which, by this means, will be made red hot, and melted, so as to fall upon the floor in different glowing pieces. When a wire is melted in this manner, sparks are frequently seen at a considerable distance from it, which are red hot particles of the metal, that by the violence of the explosion are scattered in all directions. If the force of the battery is very great, the wire will be entirely dispersed by the explosion, so that none of it can be afterwards found.\n\nBy repeating this experiment with wires of different metals, and the same force of explosion, it will be found that some metals are more readily fused than others, and some not at all affected; which shows the difference of their conducting power. If it be required to melt such particles of metals, that cannot easily be drawn in wires, as ores, grains of platinum, &c., they may be set in a train upon a piece of wax; this train may be inserted in the circuit, and an explosion may be sent through it, which, if it be sufficiently strong, will melt the metallic particles, as well as the wires; or, if the quantity to be tried be large enough, it may be confined in a small tube of glass.\n\nIf a wire be stretched by weights, and a shock be made to pass through it, so as to render it just red hot, the wire after the explosion will be found considerably increased in length, but if the wire be left loose it will be found after a similar explosion considerably shortened.\n\nIf a wire be melted upon a piece of glass, the glass will after the explosion be found marked with all the prismatic colours.\n\nThe wire may be formed into globules by inclosing it in a glass tube about a quarter of an inch in diameter, and sending the charge of a battery through it. The wire thus melted, will run into globules, which will adhere to the inner surface of the tube, and may be easily separated from it. On examination they will be found to be hollow, and are the metal in its least state of oxidation.\n\nSome nicety is required in this experiment, as if the charge be too small, the globule will not be well formed, and if it be too great, the metal will be so much oxidated as to be diffused in smoke.\n\nIf a piece of metal be fixed upon each of the knobs of the universal discharger, or upon the extremities of the wires that support these knobs, so that their surfaces may come sufficiently near each other for the charge of a battery to be passed between them, and if a discharge be then made, a spot and coloured circles will be formed upon each metallic surface, which are evidently owing to a partial oxidation of the metal.\n\nIn order to exhibit coloured rings upon the surface of metals, place a plain piece of any of the metals upon one of the wires of the universal discharger, and upon the other wire fix a sharp-pointed needle, with the point just opposite to the surface of the metal; then connect one wire of the discharger with the outside of a battery, and the other with the discharging rod, &c. In this manner, if explosions be repeatedly sent either from the point to the piece of metal, or from the latter to the former, they will gradually mark the surface of the piece of metal opposite to the point, with circles, consisting of all the prismatic colours, which are evidently occasioned by laminae of the metal, raised by the force of the explosions.\n\nThese colours appear sooner, and the rings are closer to one another, when the point is nearer to the surface of the metal. The number of rings is greater or less, according as the point of the needle is more sharp or more blunt; and they are represented equally well upon any of the metals.\n\nThe point of the needle is also coloured to a considerable distance; the colours upon it returning in circles, though not very distinctly. This is an experiment of Dr Priestley.\n\nBut the most splendid experiments on the fusion of metals by electricity have been made by Dr Van Marum's experiments. He first tried the effect of a battery containing 130 square feet of coated surface. With this extraordinary power, he melted an iron wire 15 feet long and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch in diameter; and another time melted a wire of the same metal 25 feet long and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch in diameter.\n\nHe afterwards added to the battery 90 jars, each of the same size with the former, so that his grand battery now formed a square of 15 feet, and contained 225 square feet of coated glass. He caused wires of different metals to be drawn through the same hole, of one-thirty-eighth part of an inch in diameter, and observed how many inches of each could be melted by the explosion of his battery; taking care in all these experiments to charge it to the same degree as ascertained by his electrometer. The results were as follows:\n\n| Metal       | Inches |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Lead        | 120    |\n| Tin         | 120    |\n| Iron        | 5      |\n| Gold        | 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| Silver, copper, and brass | Not quite a quarter of an inch. |\n\nThese\nThese several lengths of wire, of the same diameter melted by equal explosions, indicate according to our author, the degree in which each metal is fusible by the electrical discharge; and if these be compared with the fusibility of the same metals by fire, a very considerable difference will be observed. According to the experiments of the academicians of Dijon, to melt tin required a heat of 172 degrees of Reaumur's thermometer.\n\n| Lead   | 230 |\n|--------|-----|\n| Silver | 430 |\n| Gold   | 563 |\n| Copper | 630 |\n| Iron   | 696 (v) |\n\nThus tin and lead appear to be equally fusible by electricity, but not by fire; and iron, which by fire is less fusible than gold, is much more so by the electrical explosion.\n\nWhen iron wire is melted by the explosion of the battery, the red hot globules are thrown to a very considerable distance, sometimes to that of 30 feet; it is however remarkable, that the thicker the wire is which is melted, the further are the globules dispersed; but this is accounted for, by observing, that the globules formed by the fusion of the thinner wires, being smaller, are less able to overcome the resistance of the air, and are therefore sooner stopped in their motion.\n\nTwo pieces of iron wire being tied together, the fusion extended no further than from the end connected with the inside coating of the jars to the knot; though wire of the same length and thickness, when in one continued piece, had been entirely melted by an equal explosion.\n\nWhen a wire was too long to be melted by the discharge of the battery, it was sometimes broken into several pieces, the extremities of which bore evident marks of fusion; and the effect of electricity in shortening wire, was very sensible in an experiment made on 18 inches of iron wire \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of an inch in diameter, which by one discharge lost a quarter of an inch of its length. An explosion of this battery through very small wires, of nearly the greatest length that could be melted by it, did not entirely discharge the jars. On transmitting the charge through 50 feet of iron wire of \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of an inch in diameter, the doctor found that the residuum was sufficient to melt two feet of the same wire; but this residuum was much less when the wire was of too great a length to be melted by the first discharge. After an explosion of the battery through 180 feet of iron wire of equal diameter with the former, the residuum was discharged through 12 inches of the same wire which it did not melt, but only blued.\n\nTwenty-four inches of leaden wire \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of an inch in diameter, were entirely oxidized by an explosion of this battery; the greater part of the lead rose in a thick smoke, the remainder was struck down upon a paper laid beneath it, where it formed a stain which resembled the painting of a very dark cloud. When shorter wires were oxidated, the colours were more varied. In Dr Van Marum's work a plate is given of a stain made by the oxidation of this wire, in which the cloud appears variously shaded with different tints of green, gray, and brown, in a manner of which no adequate description can give an idea.\n\nOn discharging the battery through 8 inches of tin wire \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of an inch in diameter, extended over a sheet of paper, a thick cloud of blue smoke arose, in which a number of filaments of oxide of tin were discernible; at the same time a great number of red hot globules of tin, falling upon the paper, were repeatedly thrown up again into the air, and continued thus to rebound from its surface for several seconds. The paper was marked with a yellowish clouded stain immediately under the wire, and with streaks or rays of the same colour issuing from it in every direction; some of these formed an uninterrupted line, others were made up of separate spots. In order to be certain that the colour of these streaks was not caused by the paper being scorched, the experiment was several times repeated, when a plate of glass and a board covered with tin were placed to receive the globules. These, however, were stained exactly like the paper. On oxidating five inches of the same kind of wire, the red hot globules were thrown obliquely to the height of four feet, which afforded an opportunity of observing that each globule, in its course, diffused a matter like smoke, which continued to appear for a little time in the parabolic line described by its flight, forming a track in the air of about half an inch in breadth.\n\nDr Van Marum attributes the clouded stain, immediately under the wire, to the instantaneous oxidation of its surface; whereas the remainder of the metal is melted into globules, which while they retain their glowing heat, continue to be superficially oxidated, and during the process, part with this oxide in the form of vapour.\n\nPhenomena something similar to the above, were observed on the oxidation of a wire of equal parts of tin and lead, eight inches long, and \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)d of an inch in diameter. This also was melted into red globules, which were repeatedly driven upwards again from the paper on which they fell, and marked it with streaks of the same kind, but of a brown colour, edged with a yellow tinge. Some of these globules, though apparently not less hot, moved with less velocity than others, and were soon stopped in their course by their burning a hole in the paper. In this case a yellow matter was seen to rise from their surface to the height of one or two lines, and extended itself to the width of a quarter of an inch. This matter continued during five or six seconds,\n\n(v) According to the experiments of Mr Wedgwood with his Pyrometer, the following are the degrees of heat computed in degrees of Fahrenheit's scale that are required to fuse certain metals.\n\n| Metals       | Degrees |\n|--------------|---------|\n| Brass        | 380°    |\n| Swedish copper | 458°   |\n| Fine silver  | 471°    |\n| Fine gold    | 523°    |\n| Cast iron    | 3997°   |\n\nVid. Phil. Trans. vol. lxxii.\nPrinciples of seconds, to issue from the globules, and formed on their electricity surface a kind of efflorescence, resembling the flowers of sulphur produced by the foifa-terra. The globules, from which this efflorescence had issued, were found to be entirely hollow, and to consist only of a thin shell. When this mixed metal is oxidated with a less charge of battery, it leaves a stain upon the paper, something similar to that made by lead, and does not run into globules.\n\nDr Van Marum has also given plates of the stains made upon paper by the oxidation of iron, copper, brass, silver, and gold. Those made by copper and brass wire, are uncommonly beautiful, and are variegated with yellow, green, and a very bright brown. Eight inches of gold wire, of \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)th of an inch diameter, were, by the explosion reduced to a purple substance, of which a part rose like a thick smoke, and the remainder on the paper, left a stain diversified with different shades of this colour. Gold, silver, and copper, cannot easily be melted into globules. Our author has once accidentally succeeded in this; but it required a degree of electrical force so very particular, that the medium between a charge, which only broke the wire into pieces, and one which entirely oxidated it, could not be ascertained by the electrometer.\n\nDr Van Marum found, as might be expected, that the electric spark did not oxidate metals when confined in any gas which did not contain oxygen. On exposing wires of lead, tin, and iron, to the electric spark from the discharge of a battery, while the metals were confined in air deprived of oxygen, by the burning of inflammable bodies in it, he found that the first was reduced to a fine powder, which upon trial with nitric acid appeared to be merely lead; the two other metals were melted into small globules. He found that in general metals were not more highly oxidated in pure oxigenous gas than in common air, except that lead was reduced to a fine yellow oxide, perfectly resembling mastic.\n\nIn nitrous gas, oxidation took place as easily as in common air or in oxigenous gas.\n\nHis method of making these experiments was as follows. He confined the gas in which he was to subject the metal to the explosion, in a glass cylinder six inches high and four inches in diameter, closed at the upper end with a brass plate; from the centre of this plate was suspended the wire on which the experiment was made. The cylinder was set in a pewter dish filled with water; and to prevent its being broken by the expansion of the air, its lower edges were supported by two pieces of wood half an inch high. The lower end of the wire rested on the dish, which was connected with the outside coating of the battery.\n\nOn submitting metallic wires to the action of the electric spark while confined in water, he found that the water was decomposed, the metal being oxidated, and a portion of impure hydrogenous gas being discharged (z).\n\n**Exper.—To burn a metallic wire in oxygen gas, by the electric spark.**\n\nThe apparatus for this experiment is represented at fig. 55. It consists of a glass jar for holding the gas, fitted to the bottom C, so that it may easily be taken out. Into the bottom is fastened a brass knob B, and a wire passes through the top of the jar furnished with a ball at A, and a knob within the jar as D, into which the piece of wire, twisted in a spiral form, is to be inserted.\n\nThe jar, thus fitted up with the wire, is to be filled with oxygen gas, obtained from the black oxide of manganese as described under Chemistry; and on passing the charge of a small Leyden phial through the wire A, an explosion will take place between the knob B, and the extremity of the small wire, by which this will be inflamed, producing a most brilliant and beautiful appearance.\n\nWhen the electric spark is passed through a metallic oxide, the oxide is reduced to the metallic state.\n\nThis was effected by Sign. Beccaria, by making the spark pass between two surfaces of the oxide. In this way he reduced several of the metallic oxides, among others, that of zinc. He also obtained pure mercury, from the red sulphuret or cinnabar.\n\nThe electric spark renders bodies luminous, and makes opaque substances appear transparent.\n\n**Exper. i.—Connect one end of a chain with the outside of a charged phial, and let the other end lie on the**\n\n(z) Although there was good reason to suppose that the powders produced in the above experiments were real oxides of the metals, yet they had not been proved to be so by any satisfactory experiment. Dr Van Marum and his ingenious coadjutor (Mr Cuthbertson), began a set of direct experiments for the purpose of ascertaining this point; but the doctor was soon discouraged by the breaking of apparatus, and nothing satisfactory was done. Since Mr Cuthbertson's return to London, he has carried into execution a series of experiments which he had projected in Holland, and by these he has fully proved that metals exploded by the electric spark absorb oxygen from the air and become oxidated, more readily than when fused by ordinary fire. We cannot pretend to give anything like an account of these experiments in this note; they are published at length in Nicholson's Journal for July 1801. The following are Mr Cuthbertson's general conclusions.\n\n\"From the result of the foregoing experiments, it may be safely concluded that all the ductile metals can by electric discharges be sublimed and converted into proper oxides, by absorbing the oxygen from the atmosphere, and although some of the metals resist the action of common fire, and require different solvents to convert them into oxides, yet they all yield to the action of electricity.\n\nIt is remarkable that platinum, though it resists the action of common fire, is more easily fused by electric discharges than copper, silver, or gold, and seems to be as greedy of oxygen as any of the other metals; but these experiments have not been sufficiently extensive to settle the last mentioned property.\n\nIt is well known that all metals which are fusible by common fire, absorb oxygen in different degrees, and likewise in different proportions, according to the degrees of heat employed; this seems to take place also when they are sublimed by electric discharges, but the proper degree of discharge for each metal remains for investigation.\"\nPlace the end of another piece of chain at the distance of about a quarter of an inch from the former; and set a glass decanter of water on the separated ends. On making the discharge, the water will appear perfectly luminous.\n\nThe electric spark may be rendered visible in water, in the following manner. Take a glass tube of about half an inch in diameter, and fix inches long; fill it with water, and to each extremity of the tube adapt a cork, which may confine the water; through each cork insert a blunt wire, so that the extremities of the wires within the tube may be very near one another; then on connecting one of these wires with the coating of a small charged phial, and touching the other wire with the knob of it; by which means the shock will pass through the wires, and cause a vivid spark to appear between their extremities within the tube. The charge in this experiment must be very weak, or there will be danger of bursting the tube.\n\nExper. 2.—Fig. 56. represents a mahogany stand, so constructed as to hold three eggs at greater or smaller distance, according to the position of the sliding pieces. A chain C is placed at the bottom, in such a manner as to touch the bottom of the egg at B with one end, and with its other the outside coating of a charged jar. The sliding wire A at top is made to touch the upper egg; and the distance of the eggs asunder should not exceed the quarter or eighth part of an inch. The electric spark, being made to pass down by means of the discharging rod through the wire and ball at A, will in a darkened room render the eggs very luminous and transparent.\n\nExper. 3.—Place an ivory ball on the prime conductor of the machine, and take a strong spark, or send the charge of a Leyden phial through its centre, and the ball will appear perfectly luminous; but if the charge be not passed through the centre, it will pass over the surface of the ball and fizzle it. A spark made to pass through a ball of boxwood, not only illuminates the whole, but makes it appear of a beautiful crimson, or rather fine scarlet colour.\n\nExper. 4.—Gold-leaf or Dutch metal may be rendered luminous by discharging a small Leyden phial through it. A strip of gold leaf, one-eighth of an inch in breadth, and a yard long, will frequently be illuminated throughout its whole extent, by the explosion of a jar containing two gallons. This experiment may be beautifully diversified, by laying the gold or silver leaf on a piece of glass, and then placing the glass in water; for the whole gold leaf will appear most brilliantly luminous in the water, by exposing it thus circumstanced to the explosion of a battery.\n\nExper. 5.—The natural, or what answers better, the artificial Bolognian stone reduced to powder, (commonly called Canton's phosphorus) may be illuminated by the electric spark in a more perfect manner than by the rays of the sun. The method of making this experiment is thus related by Mr Cavallo.\n\nPut some of this powder in a clear glass phial, and stop it with a glass stopper, or a cork and sealing-wax. If this phial be kept in a darkened room (which for this experiment must be very dark) it will give no light; but let two or three strong sparks be drawn from the prime conductor, when the phial is kept at about two inches distant from the sparks, so that it may be exposed to that light, and this phial will receive the principles of light, and afterwards will appear illuminated for a considerable time.\n\nThis powder may be stuck upon a board by means of the white of an egg, so as to represent figures of planets, letters, or any thing else, at the pleasure of the operator, and these figures may be illuminated in the dark, in the same manner as the above-described phial.\n\nA beautiful method of expressing geometrical figures with the above powder, is to bend small glass tubes, of about the tenth part of an inch diameter, in the shape of the figure desired, and then to fill them with the phosphoric powder. These may be illuminated in the manner described; and they are not so subject to be spoiled, as the figures represented upon the board frequently are.\n\nThe best method of illuminating this phosphorus, and that Mr W. Canton generally used, is to discharge a small electric jar near it.\n\nPaper, after being made dry and rather hot, marble, oyster shells, and most calcareous substances, especially when burned to lime, have the property of being illuminated by the light given by the discharge of a jar, though not so much as the above-mentioned powder.\n\nPut the extremities of two wires upon the surface of a card, or other body of an electric nature, so that they may be in one direction, and about one inch distance from one another; then, by connecting one of the wires with the outside of a charged jar, and the other wire with the knob of the jar, the shock will be made to pass over the card or other body. If the card be made very dry, the lucid track between the wires will be visible upon the card for a considerable time after the explosion. If a piece of common writing paper be used instead of the card, it will be torn by the explosion into very small bits.\n\nWhen the electric discharge is passed through a lump of sugar, the sugar is rendered perfectly luminous, and will retain the light for a considerable time.\n\nExper. 6.—But the most remarkable instance of the penetrability of the electric light, is that related by Dr Priefley. \"I laid a chain (says he), which was in contact with the outside of a jar, lightly on my finger, and sometimes kept it at a small distance by means of a thin piece of glass. If I made the discharge at the distance of about three inches, the electric fire was visible on the surface of the finger, giving it a sudden concussion, which seemed to make it vibrate to the very bone; and when it happened to pass on that side of the finger that was opposite the eye, the whole seemed, in the dark, perfectly transparent.\"\n\nThe following is Mr Cavallo's method of making this curious experiment.\n\nLet the extremities of two wires, one of which proceeds from the outside of a charged jar, and another from one branch of the discharging rod, be laid on a table at the distance of one-tenth of an inch from each other; then put the thumb just upon that interruption, pressing it flat down. This done, bring the discharging rod in contact with the knob of the jar, and on making the discharge, the spark which necessarily happens under the thumb will illuminate it in such a manner that the bone and the principal blood-vessels may be easily discerned in it.\nIn this experiment the operator need not be afraid of receiving a shock; for the discharge of the jar passes from wire to wire, and only affects the thumb with a sort of tremor, which is far from being painful.\n\nWe have before related Mr Hawkesbee's experiment by which he rendered sealing-wax transparent. Signior Beccaria effected the same by making an electric explosion pass between two plates of sealing-wax, on which some brass-dust was sprinkled. The whole was rendered perfectly luminous and transparent.\n\n**Exper. 7.**—Fig. 57 represents an instrument composed of two glass tubes CD, one within another, and closed with two-knobbed brass caps A and B. The innermost of these is a spiral row of small round pieces of tin-foil stuck upon its outside surface, and lying at about one-thirtieth of an inch from each other. If this instrument be held by one of the extremities, and its other extremity be presented to the prime conductor, every spark that it receives from the prime conductor will cause small sparks to appear between all the round pieces of tin-foil stuck upon the innermost tube; which in the dark affords a pleasing spectacle, the tube appearing encompassed by a spiral line of fire.\n\nFig. 58 represents several spiral tubes placed round a board, in the middle of which is screwed a glass pillar, and on the top of this pillar is cemented a brass cap with a fine steel point. In this a brass wire turns, having a brass ball at each end, nicely balanced on the wire. To make use of this apparatus, place the middle of the turning wire under a ball proceeding from the conductor, so that it may receive a succession of sparks from the ball; then push the wire gently round; and the balls in their relative motions will give a spark to each tube, and thereby illuminate them down to the board, which from its brilliancy and rapid motion, affords a most beautiful and pleasing sight.\n\n**Exper. 8.**—The small pieces of tin-foil may be stuck on a flat piece of glass ABCD, fig. 59, so as to represent various fanciful figures. Upon the same principle is the word LIGHT produced, in luminous characters.\n\nIt is formed by the small separations of the tin-foil pasted on a piece of glass fixed in a frame of baked wood, as represented fig. 60. To use this, the frame must be held in the hand, and the ball G presented to the conductor. The spark then will be exhibited in the intervals composing the word; from whence it passes to the hook at h, and thence to the ground by a chain. The brilliancy of this is equal to that of the spiral tubes.\n\nThough many of the following experiments on electric light, may not with strict propriety belong to this chapter, we shall relate them here for the sake of uniformity.\n\nMr G. Morgan, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1785, has given a series of propositions respecting the electric light, and illustrated them by experiments; we shall here give the substance of his paper nearly in his own words.\n\nI. There is no fluid or solid body, in its passage through which the electric light may not be rendered luminous.\n\nThis proposition has been fully illustrated by the foregoing experiments.\n\nII. The difficulty of making any quantity of the electrical light visible in any body, increases as the conducting power of that body increases.\n\n**Exper. 1.**—In order to make the contents of a jar luminous in boiling water, a much higher charge is necessary, than would be sufficient to make it luminous in cold water, which is universally allowed to be the worst conductor.\n\n**Exper. 2.**—There are various reasons for believing the acids to be very good conductors; if, therefore, into a tube filled with water, and circumstanced as has been already described, a few drops of either of the mineral acids are poured, it will be almost impossible to make the light visible in its passage through the tube.\n\n**Exper. 3.**—If a string, whose diameter is one-eighth of an inch, and whose length is six or eight inches, is moistened with water, the contents of a jar will pass through it luminously; but no such appearance can be produced by any charge of the same jar, provided the same string be moistened with one of the mineral acids.\n\nTo the preceding instance we may add the various instances of metals which will conduct the electric power without any appearance of light, in circumstances the same with those in which the same force would have appeared luminous in passing through other bodies, whose conducting power is less.\n\nIII. That the ease with which the electric light is rendered visible in any particular body, is increased by increasing the rarity of the body. The appearance of a spark, or of the discharge of a Leyden phial, in rarefied air, is well known. But we need not rest the truth of the preceding observation on the several varieties of this fact; similar phenomena attend the rarefaction of ether, of spirits of wine, and of water.\n\n**Exper. 4.**—Into the orifice of a tube, 48 inches long, and two-thirds of an inch in diameter, cement an iron ball, so as to bear the weight which presses upon it when the tube is filled with quicksilver, leaving only an interval at the open end, which contained a few drops of water. Having inverted the tube, and plunged the open end of it into a basin of mercury, the mercury in the tube stood nearly half an inch lower than it did in a barometer at the same instant, owing to the vapour which was formed by the water. But through this rarefied water, the electrical spark passed as luminously as it does through air equally rarefied.\n\n**Exper. 5.**—If, instead of water, a few drops of spirits of wine are placed on the surface of the mercury, phenomena, similar to those of the preceding experiment, will be discovered, with this difference only, that as the vapour in this case is more dense, the electrical spark, in its passage through it, is not quite so luminous as it is in the vapour of water.\n\n**Exper. 6.**—Good ether, substituted in the room of the spirits of wine, will press the mercury down so low as the height of 16 or 17 inches. The electric spark, in passing through this vapour, (unless the force be very great indeed,) is scarcely luminous; but if the pressure on the surface of the mercury in the basin, be gradually lessened by the aid of an air-pump, the vapour will become more and more rare, and the electric spark, in passing through it, more and more luminous.\n\n**Exper. 7.**—It has not been discovered, that any vapour does escape from the mineral acids when exposed in vacuo. To give them, therefore, greater rarity.\nPrinciples of Electricity or tenacity, different methods are found necessary.\n\nElectricity With a fine camel-hair pencil, dipped in the sulphuric, nitric, or the muriatic acid, draw upon a piece of glass a line, about one-eighth of an inch broad. In some instances, you must extend this line to the length of 27 inches, and you will find that the contents of an electric battery, consisting of ten pint phials coated, will pass over the whole length of this line with the greatest brilliancy. If, by widening the line, or by laying on a drop of the acid, its quantity be increased in any particular part, the charge, in passing through that part, will not appear luminous. Water, spirits of wine, circumstanced similarly to the acids in the preceding experiments, will be attended with similar, but not equal effects; because, in consequence of the inferiority of their conducting power, it will be necessary to make the line, through which the charge passes, considerably shorter.\n\nIV. The brilliancy or splendour of the electric light, in its passage through any body, is always increased by lessening the dimensions of that body; that is, a spark, or the discharge of a battery, which we might suppose equal to a sphere one quarter of an inch in diameter, will appear much more brilliant, if the same quantity is compressed into a sphere one-eighth of an inch in diameter. This observation is the obvious consequence of many known facts; if the machine be large enough to afford a spark, whose length is nine or ten inches, this spark may be seen sometimes forming itself into a brush, in which state it occupies more room, but appears very faintly luminous; at other times, the same spark may be seen dividing itself into a variety of ramifications, which float into the surrounding air. A spark, which in the open air cannot exceed one quarter of an inch in diameter, will appear to fill the whole of an exhausted receiver, four inches wide and eight inches long: but in the former case it is brilliant, and in the latter it grows fainter and fainter, as the size of the receiver increases. This observation is further proved by the following experiments.\n\nExper. 8.—To an insulated ball, four inches in diameter, fix a silver thread, about four yards long. This thread, at the end which is removed from the ball, must be fixed to another insulated substance. Bring the ball within the striking distance of a conductor, and the spark, in passing from the conductor to the ball, will appear very brilliant; the whole length of the silver thread will appear faintly luminous at the same instant. When the spark is confined within the dimensions of a sphere, one-eighth of an inch in diameter, it will be bright; but when diffused over the surface of air which received it from the thread, its light will be so faint as to be seen only in a dark room. If you lessen the surface of air which receives the spark, by shortening the thread, it will not fail to increase the brightness of the appearance.\n\nExper. 9.—To prove that the faintness of the electric light in vacuo, depends on the enlarged dimensions of the space through which it is diffused; we have nothing more to do than to introduce two pointed wires into the vacuum, so that the fluid may pass from the point of the one to the point of the other; when the distance between them is not more than the one-tenth of an inch, in this case we shall find a brilliancy as great as in the open air.\n\nExper. 10.—Into a Torricellian vacuum, 36 inches long, convey as much air as will fill two inches only of the exhausted tube if it were inverted in water; this quantity of air will afford resistance enough to condense the light as it passes through the tube into a spark, 38 inches in length. The brilliancy of the spark in condensed air, in water, and in all substances through which it passes with difficulty, depends on principles similar to those which account for the preceding facts.\n\nV. That in the appearances of electricity, as well as in those of burning bodies, there are cases in which all the rays of light do not escape; and that the most refrangible rays are those which escape first or most easily. The electrical brush is always of a purple or bluish hue. If you convey a spark through a Torricellian vacuum, made without boiling the mercury in the tube, the brush will display the indigo rays. The spark, however, may be divided and weakened, even in the open air, so as to yield the most refrangible rays only.\n\nExper. II.—To an insulated metallic ball, four inches in diameter, fix a wire a foot and half long; this wire should terminate in four ramifications, each of which must be fixed to a metallic ball half an inch in diameter, and placed at an equal distance from a metallic plate, which must be communicated by metallic conductors with the ground. A powerful spark, after falling on the large ball at one extremity of the wire, will be divided in its passage from the four small balls to the metallic plate. When you examine the division of the spark in a dark room, you will discover some little ramifications, which will yield the indigo rays only; indeed at the edges of all weak sparks, the same purple appearance may be discovered. You may likewise observe, that the nearer you approach the center of the spark, the greater is the brilliancy of its colour.\n\nVI. That the influence of different media on electrical light, is analogous to their influence on solar light, and will help us to account for some very singular appearances.\n\nExper. 12.—Let a pointed wire, having a metallic ball fixed to one of its extremities, be forced obliquely into a piece of wood, so as to make a small angle with the surface of the wood, and to make the point lie about one-eighth of an inch below the surface. Let another pointed wire, which communicates with the ground, be forced in the same manner into the same wood, so that its point likewise may lie about one-eighth of an inch below the surface, and about two inches distant from the point of the first wire. Let the wood be insulated, and a strong spark, which strikes on the metallic ball will force its passage through the interval of wood which lies between the points, and appear as red as blood. To prove that this appearance depends on the wood's absorption of all the rays but the red; when these points were deepest below the surface, the red only came to the eye through a prism; when they were raised a little nearer the surface, the red and orange appeared; when nearer still, the yellow; and so on, till, by making the spark pass through the wood very near its surface, all the rays were at length able to reach the eye. If the points be only one-eighth of an inch below the surface of soft deal wood, the red, the orange, and the yellow rays will appear as the spark passes through it; but when the points are at an equal depth.\nPrinciples of depth in a harder piece of wood, (such as box) the yellow light will be low, and perhaps the orange will disappear. As a farther proof that the phenomena, thus described, are owing to the interposition of the wood, as a medium which absorbs some of the rays, and suffers others to escape; it may be observed, that when the spark strikes very brilliantly on one side of the piece of deal, on the other side it will appear very red. In like manner, a red appearance may be given to a spark which strikes brilliantly over the inside of a tube, merely by spreading some pitch very thinly over the outside of the same tube.\n\nExper. 13.—If into a Torricellian vacuum, of any length, a few drops of ether are conveyed, and both ends of the vacuum are stopped up with metallic conductors, so that a spark may pass through it; the spark in its passage will assume the following appearances. When the eye is placed close to the tube, the spark will appear perfectly white; if the eye is removed to the distance of five or seven yards, the colour of the spark will be reddish. These changes evidently depend on the quantity of medium through which the light passes, and the red light of a distant candle, or a beclouded sun.\n\nExper. 14.—Dr Priestley long ago observed the red appearance of the spark when passing through hydrogen gas; but this appearance is very much diversified by the quantity of medium, through which you look at the spark. When at a very considerable distance, the red comes to the eye unmixed; but if the eye is placed close to the tube, the spark appears white and brilliant. In confirmation, however, of some of these conclusions, you must observe, that by increasing the quantity of sparks which are conveyed through any portion of hydrogen gas, or by condensing that gas, the spark may be entirely deprived of its red appearance, and made perfectly brilliant. All weak explosions and sparks, when viewed at a distance, bear a reddish hue. Such are the explosions which have passed through water, spirits of wine, or any bad conductor, when confined in a tube whose diameter is not more than an inch. The reason of these appearances seems to be, that the weaker the spark or explosion is, the less is the light which escapes; and the more visible the effect of any medium, which has a power to absorb some of that light.\n\nChalk, oyster-shells, together with those phosphoric bodies, whose goodness has been very much impaired by long keeping, when finely powdered, and placed within the circuit of an electrical battery, will exhibit, by their scattered particles, a shower of light; but these particles will appear reddish, or their phosphoric power will be sufficient only to detain the yellow, orange, and red rays. When spirits of wine are in a similar manner brought within the circuit of a battery, a similar effect may be discovered; its particles diverge in several directions, displaying a most beautiful golden appearance. The metallic oxides are, of all bodies, those which are rendered phosphoric with the greatest difficulty; but even these may be scattered into a shower of red luminous particles by the electric stroke.\n\nVol. VII. Part II.\n\nThe following experiments are given by Mr Cavalli to illustrate the appearance of the electric light in rarefied air.\n\nExper. 1.—Fig. 61 represents a prime conductor, invented by Mr Henry, which shows clearly the direction of the electric power passing through it, from whence it is called the luminous conductor (a). The middle part EF of this conductor, is a glass tube about eighteen inches long, and three or four inches in diameter. To both ends of this tube the hollow brass pieces FD, BE, are cemented air-tight, one of which has a point C, by which it receives the electric power, when let near the excited cylinder of the electrical machine, and the other has a knopped wire G, from which a strong spark may be drawn; and from each of the pieces FD, BE, a knopped wire proceeds, within the cavity of the glass tube. The brass piece FD, or BE, is composed of two parts, i.e., a cap F cemented to the glass tube, and having a hole with a valve, by which the cavity of the glass tube may be exhausted of air; and the ball D, which is screwed upon the cap F. The supporters of this instrument are two glass pillars fastened in the bottom board H, like the prime conductor represented fig. 61. When the glass tube of this conductor is exhausted of air by means of an air-pump, and the brass ball is screwed on, as represented in the figure, then it is fit for use, and may serve for a prime conductor to an electrical machine.\n\nIf the point C of this conductor is set near the excited cylinder of the machine, it will appear illuminated with a star; at the same time the glass tube will appear all illuminated with a weak light; but from the knopped wire, that proceeds within the glass from the piece FD, a lucid pencil will issue out, and the opposite knob will appear illuminated with a star or round body of light, which, as well as the pencil of rays, is very clear, and discernible among the other light, that occupies the greatest part of the cavity of the tube.\n\nIf the point C, instead of being presented to the cylinder, be connected with the rubber of the machine, the appearance of light within the tube will be reversed; the knob which communicates with the piece FD appearing illuminated with a star, and the opposite with a pencil of rays.\n\nIf the wires within the tube EF, instead of being furnished with knobs, be pointed, the appearance of light is the same, but it seems not so strong in this, as in the other case.\n\nExper. 2.—Take a glass tube of about two inches conducting diameter, and about two feet long; fix to one of its glass tube ends a brass cap, and to the other a stop-cock, or a valve; then by means of an air-pump exhaust it of air. If this tube be held by one end, and its other end be brought near the electrified prime conductor, it will appear to be full of light, whenever a spark is taken by it from the prime conductor; and much more so, if an electric jar be discharged through it.\n\nThis experiment may also be made with the receiver of an air-pump.—Take, for instance, a tall receiver, clean and dry, and through a hole at its top insert a wire,\n\n(4) An instrument much like this conductor was some years ago invented by Dr Watson, with which he made several original experiments upon the electric light.\nPrinciples of wire, which must be cemented air-tight. The end of Electricity the wire, that is within the tube, must be pointed, but illustrated by experiment not very sharp; and the other end must be furnished with a knob. Put this receiver upon the plate of the air-pump, and exhaust it. If now the knob of the wire at the top of the receiver be touched with the prime conductor, every spark will pass through the receiver in a dense and large body of light, from the wire to the plate of the air-pump.\n\nIt must be observed, that when the air is very much rarefied, the electric light in it is less dense, though more diffused; and contrarywise.\n\nExper. 3.—Take a phial nearly of the shape and size of a Florence flask, such as is represented at fig. 62.\n\nFix a stop-cock or a valve to its neck, and exhaust it of air as much as it is possible with a good air-pump. If this glass be rubbed in the common manner used to excite electrics, it will appear luminous within, being full of a flashing light, which plainly resembles the aurora borealis, or northern light. This phial may also be made luminous by holding it by either end, and bringing the other end to the prime conductor; in this case all the cavity of the glass will instantly appear full of flashing light, which remains in it for a considerable time after it has been removed from the prime conductor.\n\nInstead of the above-described glass vessel, a glass tube, exhausted of air and hermetically sealed, may be used, and perhaps with greater advantage. The most remarkable circumstance of this experiment is, that if the phial or tube, after it has been removed from the prime conductor (and even several hours after its flashing light hath ceased to appear) be grasped with the hand, strong flashes of light will immediately appear within the glass, which often reach from one of its ends to the other.\n\nExper. 4.—GI, fig. 63, represents the receiver with the plate of an air-pump. In the middle of the plate IF, a short rod is fixed, having at its top a metal ball B nicely polished, whose diameter is nearly two inches. From the top of the receiver another rod AD with a like ball A proceeds, and is cemented air-tight in the neck C; the distance of the balls from one another being about four inches, or rather more. If, when the receiver is exhausted of air, the ball A be electrified positively, by touching the top D of the rod AD with the prime conductor or an excited glass tube, a lucid atmosphere appears about it, which, although it consists of a feeble light, is yet very conspicuous, and very well defined; at the same time the ball B has not the least light. The atmosphere does not exist all round the ball A, but reaches from about the middle of it, to a small distance beyond that side of its surface, which is towards the opposite ball B. If the rod with the ball A be electrified negatively, then a lucid atmosphere, like the above described, will appear upon the ball B, reaching from its middle to a small distance beyond that side of it, that is towards the ball A; at the same time the negatively electrified ball A remains without any light.\n\nThe operator in this experiment must take care not to electrify the ball A too much, as, in that case, a spark will pass from one ball to the other, and the desired effect will not be produced. A little practice, however, will render the experiment very easy and familiar.\n\nThis elegant experiment is the invention of Sig. Becaria.\n\nFig. 64. and 65. represent a curious appearance of the electric light. In fig. 65, the light is seen streaming from a wire within the exhausted receiver of an air-pump. If in this state of things, the hand or a finger be applied to the external part of the receiver, part of the light will approach the finger, as represented in fig. 64.\n\nThe electric spark produces changes on most artificial colours.\n\nMr Cavallo made several experiments on substances Mr Cavallo painted with various colours. They were occasioned by his having observed that an electric spark sent over the surface of a card, made a black stroke upon a red spot, from which he was induced to try the effect of sending shocks over cards painted with different water colours. The force employed was generally about one foot and a half of charged surface; and the shocks were sent over the cards while the latter were in a very dry state.\n\n\"Vermilion was marked with a strong black track, about one tenth of an inch wide. This stroke is generally single, as represented by AB, fig. 66. Sometimes it is divided in two towards the middle, like EF; and sometimes, particularly when the wires are set very distant from one another, the stroke is not continued, but interrupted in the middle, like GH. It often, although not always happens, that the impression is marked stronger at the extremity of that wire from which the electric sparks issue, as it appears at E, supposing that the wire C communicates with the positive side of the jar; whereas, the extremity of the stroke, contiguous to the point of the wire D, is neither so strongly marked, nor surrounds the wire so much, as the other extremity E.\n\n\"Carmine received a faint and slender impression of a purple colour.\n\n\"Verdegris was shaken off from the surface of the card; except when it had been mixed with strong gum-water, in which case it received a very faint impression.\n\n\"White lead was marked by a long black track, not so broad as that on vermilion.\n\n\"Red lead was marked with a faint mark much like carmine.\n\n\"The other colours I tried were orpiment, gamboge, sap green, red ink, ultramarine, prussian blue, and a few others which were compounds of the above; but they received no impression.\n\n\"It having been intimated, that the strong black mark, which vermilion receives from the electric shock, might possibly be owing to the great quantity of sulphur contained in that mineral, I was induced to make the following experiment. I mixed together equal quantities of orpiment and flower of sulphur; and with this mixture, by the help, as usual, of very diluted gum-water, I painted a card; but the electric shock sent over it left not the least impression.\n\n\"Deferring of carrying this investigation on colours, a little farther, with a particular view to determine something relative to the properties of lamp black and oil, I procured some pieces of paper painted on both sides...\"\nChap. VIII.\n\nELECTRICITY.\n\nPrinciples of fides with oil colours; and fending the charge of two feet of coated glafs over each of them, by making the interruption of the circuit upon their surfaces, I observ- ed that the pieces of paper painted with lamp black, prussian blue, vermilion, and purple brown, were torn by the explosion; but white lead, Naples yellow, Eng- lish ochre, and verdigrife, remained unharmed.\n\n\"The same shock fent over a piece of paper painted very thickly with lamp black and oil left not the least impression. I fent the shock also over a piece of paper unequally painted with purple brown, and the paper was torn where the paint lay very thin, but re- mained unhurt where the paint lay evidently thicker. These experiments I repeated several times, and with some very little variation, which naturally produced different effects; however, they all seem to point out the following propositions.\n\n\"1. A coat of oil-paint over any substance, defends it from the effect of such a shock as would otherwise injure it; but by no means defends it from any electric shock whatever.\n\n\"2. No one colour seems preferable to the others, if they are equal in substance, and equally well mixed with oil; but a thick coating does certainly afford a better defence than a thinner one.\n\n\"By rubbing the above mentioned pieces of paper, I find that the paper painted with lamp-black and oil is more easily excited, and acquires a stronger electricity, than the papers painted with the other colours; and perhaps on this account it may be, that lamp black and oil might resist the shock somewhat better than the other paints.\n\n\"It is remarkable that vermilion receives the black impression when painted with linseed oil nearly as well as when painted with water. The paper painted with white lead and oil receives also a black mark; but its nature is very singular. The track when first made, is almost as dark as that marked on white lead painted with water; but it loses its blackness, and in about an hour's time (or longer, if the paint is not fresh) it appears without any darkness; and when the painted paper is laid in a proper light appears only marked with a colourless track, as if made by a finger nail. I fent the shock also over a piece of board, which had been painted with white lead and oil four years before, and the explosion marked the black track upon this also; this track, however, was not so strong, nor vanished so soon, as that marked upon the painted paper; but in about two days time it also vanished entirely.\n\nCHAP. VIII. Of the Mechanical Effects of the Electric Power.\n\nThe electric power in its passage through the air, drives light bodies before it.\n\nSig. Beccaria put a narrow piece of silver leaf between two plates of wax, laying it across them, but so that it did not quite reach one of the sides. The discharge being made through this strip of metal, by bringing a wire opposite to the silver at the place where it was discontinued; the silver was found melted, and part of it dispersed all along the track that the electric spark took between the plates of wax, from the silver to the wire.\n\nThe following experiment shows the force of the elec-\nAn experiment given by Mr. Cavallo to prove the direction of the electric power in the discharge of a Leyden phial, will afford a good illustration of our present position.\n\nBend a card, length-ways, over a round ruler, so as to form a channel, or semicircular groove (B): lay this card upon the circular board E of the universal discharger, and in the middle of it put a pith-ball of about half an inch diameter; then at equal distances, about half or three quarters of an inch from the pith-ball, lay the two brass knobs DD. The card being perfectly dry, and rather hot, if you connect, by means of a chain or otherwise, the outside of a charged jar with one of the wires C, and bring the knob of the jar to the other wire C, you will observe, that on making the discharge, which must pass between the knobs DD, and over the card, &c., the pith-ball is always driven in the direction of the electric power; i.e., it is pushed towards that knob which communicates with the negative side of the jar.\n\nIt must be observed, that in this experiment the charge of the jar must be just sufficient to pass through the interval in the circuit; the card, or piece of baked wood, must be very dry and clean; and, in short, the disposition of the apparatus, and the performance of this curious experiment, require a degree of nicety that can only be obtained by practice. Without great precaution, it sometimes fails; but when the operator has once got it to succeed, and follows exactly the same method of operating, he may be sure that the event of the experiment will be constantly as above described.\n\nBy the electric explosion, paper, pasteboard, card, thin glass, and other non-conducting substances, may be perforated or broken.\n\nExper. 1.—Take a card, a quire of paper, or the cover of a book, and keep it close to the outside coating of a charged jar; put one knob of the discharging rod upon the card, quire of paper, &c., so that between the knob and coating of the jar the thickness of that card or quire of paper only is interposed; lastly, by bringing the other knob of the discharging rod near the knob of the jar, make the discharge, and the electric spark will pierce a hole (or perhaps several) quite through the card or quire of paper. This hole has a bur raised on each side, except the card, &c., be pressed hard between the discharging rod and the jar. If this experiment be made with two cards instead of one, which however must be kept very little distant from one another, each of the cards, after the explosion, will be found pierced with one or more holes, and each hole will have burs on both surfaces of each card. The hole, or holes, are larger or smaller, according as the card, &c., is more damp or more dry. It is remarkable, that if the nostrils are presented to it, they will be affected with a sulphureous, or rather a phosphorescent smell, just like that produced by an excited electric.\n\nIf, instead of paper, a very thin plate of glass, resin, sealing wax, or the like, be interposed between the knob of the discharging rod and the outside coating of the jar, on making the discharge, this will be broken in several pieces.\n\nIf the explosion is sent over the surface of a piece of glass, this will be marked with an indelible track, which generally reaches from the extremity of one of the wires to the extremity of the other. In this manner, the piece of glass is very seldom broken by the explosion. But Mr. Henley discovered a very remarkable method to increase the effect of the explosion upon the glass; which is by pressing with weights that part of the glass which lies between the two wires (i.e., that part over which the shock is to pass). He put first a thick piece of ivory upon the glass, and placed upon that ivory a weight at pleasure, from one quarter of an ounce to five pounds: the glass in this manner is generally broken by the explosion into innumerable fragments, and some of it is absolutely reduced into an impalpable powder. If the glass is very thick, and resists the force of the explosion, so as not to be broken by it, it will be found marked with the most lively prismatic colours, which are thought to be occasioned by very thin laminae of the glass, in part separated from it by the shock. The weight laid upon the glass is always thrown by the explosion, and sometimes it is thrown quite off from the ivory. This experiment may be most conveniently made with the universal discharger.\n\nExper. 2.—Place the extremities of two wires, one above and the other below a card, so as to be about an inch distance from each other, taking care that the card be kept steady. Then, make the charge of a Leyden phial pass from one wire to the other, and it will be found, that a luminous track will pass from the end of that wire which is connected with the positive surface of the phial, to the extremity of the other wire, where a hole will be perforated through the card.\n\nThis experiment, to which we shall have occasion to refer hereafter, is by Mr. Lullin of Geneva.\n\nMr. Symmer made some experiments on the perforation of paper, which we shall mention here, as on them he grounded a principal argument in favour of that theory which he adopted, and of which we shall give an account hereafter.\n\nExper. 3.—A piece of paper covered on one side with Dutch gilding, and which had been left accidentally between two leaves in a quire of paper, in which a former experiment had been made, was found to have the impression of two strokes upon it, about a quarter of an inch from each other; the gilding was stripped off, and the paper left bare for a little space in both places. In the centre of one of these places was a little\n\n(b) Instead of the card, a piece of baked wood may be cut in that shape, and painted over with lamp-black and oil; which will answer better than the card, it being much more steady, and not so liable to attract moisture.\nChap. VIII.\n\nELECTRICITY.\n\nPrinciples of the round hole, in the other only an indentation or impression, such as might have been made with the point of a bodkin.\n\nExper. 4.—In the middle of a paper book, of the thickness of a quire, Mr Symmer put a slip of tinfoil; and in another of the same thickness, he put two slips of the same sort of foil, including the two middle leaves of the book between them. On passing the explosion through the two different books, the following effects were produced. In the first, the leaves on each side of the tinfoil were pierced, while the foil itself remained unpierced; but at the same time, it might be perceived that an impression had been made on each of its surfaces, at a little distance from one another; and such impressions were still more visible on the paper, and might be traced, as pointing different ways. In the second, all the leaves of the book were pierced, excepting the two that were included between the slips of tinfoil; and in these two, instead of holes, the two impressions in contrary directions, were visible.\n\nThe following experiment shows how easily so hard a substance as glass, may be pierced by the electric spark. It is thus related by Mr Cavallo.\n\nExper. 5.—Let a glass tube of any diameter, and about five or six inches in length, be closed hermetically, or by means of sealing-wax, at one end, and fill about half of it with olive oil; then stop the aperture of it with a cork, and let a wire pass through the cork, and come so far within the tube, as to have its extremity below the surface of the oil. This end of the wire must touch the surface of the glass, for which purpose it must be bent nearly at right angles, which may be easily done before the cork is put upon the tube. Things being thus prepared, bend into a ring the other extremity of the wire, and suspend it, with the tube hanging to it, to the wire at the end of the conductor. Then work the machine, and bring the knuckle of a finger or the knob of a wire near the outside of the tube, just opposite to the extremity of the wire; the consequence of which will be, that a spark will happen between the wire and the knuckle, which makes a hole through the glass.—By turning the wire about, or raising and lowering it, many holes may be successively made in the same tube, after the manner above described.\n\nExper. 6.—Roll up a piece of soft tobacco-pipe clay in a small cylinder, and insert in it two wires, so that their ends without the clay may be about a fifth part of an inch from one another. If a shock be sent through this clay, by connecting one of the wires with the outside of a charged jar, and the other with the inside, it will be inflated by the shock, i.e., by the spark, that passes between the two wires, and, after the explosion, will appear swelled in the middle. If the shock sent through it is too strong, and the clay not very moist, it will be broken by the explosion, and its fragments scattered in every direction. To make this experiment with a little variation, take a piece of the tube of a tobacco-pipe, about one inch long, and fill its bore with moist clay; then insert in it two wires, as in the above rolled clay; and send a shock through it. This tube will not fail to burst by the force of the explosion, and its fragments will be scattered about to a great distance. If, instead of clay, the above-mentioned tube of the tobacco pipe, or a glass tube (which will answer as well), be filled with any other substance, either electric or non-electric, inferior to metal, on making the discharge, it will be broken in pieces with nearly the same force. This experiment is the invention of Mr Lane, F.R.S.\n\nExper. 7.—Place within a common drinking-glass, nearly full of water, two knotted wires, bent in such a manner, as that their knobs may be within a little distance of each other in the water. Connect one of these wires with the outside coating of a pretty large jar, and touch the other wire with the knob of it; on making the discharge, the explosion which must pass through the water between the two knobs, will disperse the water, and break the glass with a surprising violence. This experiment requires great caution.\n\nSig. Becarria contrived a small mortar, into which a drop of water was put, between the extremities of two wires which went through the sides of the mortar, and a wooden ball was applied over the drop of water; then a charged jar being discharged through the wires of the mortar, and consequently through the drop of water, rarefied the latter, and drove the ball out with considerable force. Mr Lullin produced a greater effect by making the discharge through oil instead of water.\n\nChap. IX. Of the Methods of estimating the Degree of Accumulated Electricity in Jars and Batteries.\n\nThe only method of ascertaining the charge of a Leyden phial or of a battery, which we have hitherto mentioned, is that of observing the repulsive force of the charge on the ball of Henry's quadrant electrometer. But it was found (Vtae 122) that this was not always a just criterion of the amount of the charge; as, even when the jar was insulated, and consequently could receive no charge, the index of the electrometer still rose as high as if the jar was fully charged. We shall now proceed to describe two methods, which, particularly the last, are much less liable to error. The first depends on the following principle.\n\nThe distance of the ball of a discharging rod from the knob of a charged phial or battery necessary to produce an explosion, will be greater in proportion to the degree of accumulated electricity which the jar or battery has received.\n\nExper.—Take a Leyden phial, into the knob of which is fixed a quadrant electrometer; communicate to it a small charge, so that the index of the electrometer may point, we shall suppose, at 10°. In making the discharge, it will be found necessary to bring the ball of the discharging rod almost in contact with the knob of the jar. Now charge the jar to 20°, and it will be found that the explosion will take place, when the ball of the discharging rod is at a greater distance from the knob of the jar, than before; and thus, by repeating the experiment with greater charges, it will be observed, that the distance necessary to produce an explosion will increase nearly in proportion to the charge.\n\nOn this principle Mr Lane constructed an electro-meter, which has been found extremely useful, when it was required to discharge a jar or battery a number of times successively, with the same charge. This instrument...\nThe principal part of it consisted originally of a brass ball about an inch and a half in diameter, screwed to a graduated brass rod, and adapted to a proper frame, so that it might be set at any required distance from the prime conductor of the knob of a Leyden phial. The chief use of this instrument is to allow a jar to discharge spontaneously through any proper circuit, without employing a discharging rod, or moving any part of the apparatus, and also to produce successive explosions nearly of the same strength, as observed above. If, for example, the brass ball be placed at the distance of about half an inch from the prime conductor, and a Leyden phial be so situated as to have its knob in contact with the prime conductor, while its outside coating communicates with the ball of the electrometer, it is evident that the communication between the outside and inside of the jar, is interrupted only between the prime conductor and the brass ball, which are half an inch asunder; therefore, in charging the jar, when the charge is become so high as to strike through half an inch of air, the jar will discharge spontaneously, and by keeping the brass ball at the same distance from the prime conductor, and charging the jar successively, the shocks will be nearly of the same strength.\n\nAn electrometer of this kind, though not exactly like the original one, is now commonly used by the practitioners of medical electricity, and is delineated in fig. 67. of Plate CLXXXIX. It consists of a glass arm D, which proceeds from the wire of the jar F, and to the extremity E of which a spring socket is cemented, through which a wire passes, which is furnished with a knob B, towards the knob A of the jar, and with an open ring C at its other extremity. Now, as this wire may be slid backwards and forwards, the knob B may be put at any required distance from the knob A, as far as the construction of the instrument will allow. The wire BC is generally marked with divisions which show the distance of the two knobs, when the wire is so situated, as that the required division coincides with the edge of the spring socket; as, for instance, one-tenth, or one quarter of an inch, &c. When the jar F is set against the prime conductor G, as represented in the figure, suppose that the ball B is set at the distance of one-tenth of an inch from the ball A, and that a wire be fixed from the electrometer's ring to the outside coating of the jar, as shown by the dotted line CK; then, when the machine is put in motion, the discharge of the jar, as soon as this becomes sufficiently charged, will be made between the knobs AB, and through the wire CK; and it is evident that these discharges will be of the same strength, as long as the distance between AB remains the same.\n\nThis instrument is subject to the following inconvenience, viz. that the force of the explosion, after a time, roughens the surface of the brass ball, and thus, for a reason to be explained hereafter, the instrument is useless, unless the polish of the ball be again renewed. It is also found that this instrument is not accurate in shewing the exact charge of a jar.\n\nThe charge of a jar or battery may be most accurately determined by the weight which the repulsive force of the accumulated electricity is able to raise.\n\nUpon this principle Mr Brooke of Norwich constructed a very valuable electrometer, of which he has given a long and accurate account in his Miscellaneous Experiments.\n\nOur limits will not permit us to copy this long description, for which we must therefore refer our readers to Mr Brooke's work. We have, however, the less reason to regret this omission, because we shall presently describe an instrument invented by the late Professor Robison, which appears to us superior to Mr Brooke's both in simplicity and utility.\n\nMr G. Adams has described an electrometer very similar in principle to that of Mr Brooke, and we shall here copy his description.\n\n\"Fig. 68. and 69. represent an electrometer, nearly similar to that contrived by Mr Brooke. The two instruments are sometimes combined in one, or used separately, as in these figures. The arms FH, fig. 69., when in use, are to be placed as much as possible out of the atmosphere of a jar, battery, prime conductor, &c. The arm FH and the ball K are made of copper, and as light as possible. The divisions on the arm FH are each of them exactly a grain. They are ascertained at first by placing grain weights on a brass ball which is within the ball L, (this ball is an exact counterbalance to the arm FH and the ball K when the small slide r is at the first division) and then removing the slide r, till it, together with the ball K, counterbalances the ball L and the weight laid on it.\n\nA, fig. 69., is a dial-plate, divided into 90 equal parts. The index of this plate is carried once round, when the arm BC has moved through 90 degrees, or a quarter of a circle. That motion is given to the index by the repulsive power of the charge acting between the ball D and the ball B.\n\nThe arm BC being repelled, shows when the charge is increasing, and the arm FH shows what this repulsive power is between two balls of this size in grains, according to the number the weight rests at when lifted up by the repulsive power of the charge: at the same time the arm BC points out the number of degrees to which the ball B is repelled; so that by repeated trials, the number of degrees answering to a given number of grains, may be ascertained, and a table formed from these experiments, by which means the electrometer, fig. 69., may be used without that of fig. 68.\n\nMr Brooke thinks that no glass, charged (as we call it) with electricity, will bear a greater force, than that whose repulsive power, between two balls of the size he used, is equal to sixty grains; that in very few instances it will stand sixty grains weight; and he thinks it hazardous to go more than 45 grains.\n\nHence, by knowing the quantity of coated surface, and the diameter of the balls, we may be enabled to say, to much coated surface, with a repulsion between balls of so many grains, will melt a wire of such a size, or kill such an animal, &c.\n\nMr Brooke thinks, that he is not acquainted with all the advantages of his electrometer; but that it is clear, it speaks a language which may be universally understood, which no other will do; for though other electrometers will show whether a charge is greater or less, by an index being repelled to greater or smaller distances, or by the charge exploding at different distances, yet the power of the charge is by no means ascertained; but this electrometer shows the force of the\nWith his electrometer, Mr Brooke made a set of experiments, with a view to determine exactly the force of batteries of an inferior power, in melting fine metallic wires of different kinds. The following is the substance of these experiments.\n\n1. With a battery of nine bottles, containing about 16 square feet of coated surface, and charged to 32 grains of repulsion, a shock was eleven times felt through a piece of steel wire twelve inches long and \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch thick; the wire was shortened an inch and a half, being then about ten inches and a half long; by a twelfth shock, the wire was melted to pieces.\n\n2. A shock from the same nine bottles charged to the same degree of repulsion, being sent through a piece of steel wire, 12 inches long and \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch thick, the first time melted the whole of it into small globules.\n\n3. A shock from the same nine bottles charged to the same degree, being sent through a piece of brass wire twelve inches long and \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch thick, melted the whole of it, with much smoke, resembling that from gunpowder; but the metallic part formed itself, in cooling, chiefly into concave hemispherical figures of various sizes.\n\n4. A shock from only eight of the bottles charged to the same degree, did but just melt twelve inches of steel wire \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch thick, so as to fall into several pieces; these pieces in cooling formed themselves into oblong lumps, joining themselves to each other by a very small part of the wire between each lump which was not melted enough to separate, but appeared like oblong beads on a thread at different distances.\n\n5. A shock from the same eight bottles, charged to the same degree, so perfectly heated twelve inches of brass wire about \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch in diameter, as to melt it, or at least soften it so far as to make it fall down by its own weight, from the forceps by which it was held at each end, upon a sheet of paper placed below to catch it, and when it fell down it was so perfectly flexible that, by falling it formed itself into a vermicular shape, and remained entire its whole length, which when it was put into the forceps was about 12 inches; but after the shock was passed through it, it flagged to much as to be stretched by its own weight to almost fifteen inches, and by falling on the paper it was flattened throughout its whole length so much, that when it was examined by a magnifier of half an inch focus, it appeared five or six times as broad as it was thick.\n\n6. A shock from nine bottles charged only twenty grains, was sent through a piece of steel wire, of the same length and diameter as in the former experiments, and heated it sufficiently to melt it, so that it separated in several places; and the pieces were formed into beads strung as in experiment 4.\n\n7. A shock from the same nine bottles charged to twenty grains was sent through ten inches of brass wire \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch diameter; the wire was heated red hot so as to render it very flexible, but it did not separate.\n\nIt was shortened, however, nearly three-eighths of an inch.\n\n8. A shock from the same nine bottles charged to the same degree, being sent a second time through the last piece of wire, melted it further in several places.\n\n9. A shock from nine bottles charged to 30 grains, sent through twelve inches of brass wire \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch in diameter, acted on it nearly as in experiment 5, except that it was separated in two places, and the pieces when joined measured about fifteen inches and a half long; it was perfectly flattened by its fall on the paper as before.\n\n10. A shock from nine bottles charged to 30 grains, being sent through eight inches and a half of brass wire of the same diameter, wholly dispersed it in smoke, and left nothing remaining to fall on the sheet of paper placed below it.\n\n11. A shock from twelve bottles charged to 20 grains sent through ten inches of steel wire, \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch in diameter, made it red hot, but did not melt it.\n\n12. A second charge, the same as the last, being sent through the same piece of wire, heated it red hot as before, but did not cause it to separate; the wire was now, however, shortened five-sixteenths of an inch.\n\n13. A shock from the same twelve bottles charged to 25 grains, being sent through the same piece of wire, partly melted it into several pieces, and produced many globules of oxidated metal.\n\n14. With 15 bottles charged to 25 grains, a shock was sent through ten inches of steel wire \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch in diameter, which melted it at the first time, and dispersed a great part of it about the room.\n\n15. A shock from the same 15 bottles charged to 20 grains, just melted ten inches of steel wire of the same diameter as before, so as to cause it to run into several beautiful globules, nearly as in experiment 13.\n\n16. A shock of 15 bottles charged to 15 grains, being sent through ten inches of steel wire of the same diameter as the last, made the wire barely red-hot; but shortened it one-tenth of an inch.\n\n17. The last piece of wire having received a shock from 15 bottles charged to 12 and a half grains, was not made red-hot.\n\n18. A shock from the same 15 bottles, charged to 25 grains, was sent through the same piece of wire, and seemingly tore the wire into splinters.\n\n19. Four bottles charged to 30 grains, just melted three inches of steel wire \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch in diameter, so as to make it fall into pieces.\n\n20. Five bottles charged to 25 grains, melted three inches of such wire as the last into large beautiful globules.\n\n21. With eight bottles charged to 15 grains, three inches of steel wire, \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch in diameter, were melted as in the last experiment; indeed the appearance and effect were so nearly alike in both cases, that the metal after both experiments might have been said to be the same.\n\n22. The force of ten bottles charged twelve grains and a half rather exceeded experiment 19, but scarcely came up to experiments 20 and 21.\n\n23. Suspecting something wrong in experiment 19, Mr Brooke found, that though his bottles hitherto were as nearly of the same size as he could procure them,\nPrinciples of them, yet some of them were a little larger than others, Electricity and which was the case in experiment 19, one of the four was smaller than the other three; so that he repeated the experiment with four bottles more equal in size, charging them to 30 grains, and the fusion was as perfect as in any.\n\n24. A charge to 30 grains, with the last eight bottles, beautifully melted six inches of steel wire \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter.\n\n25. A shock from two bottles charged to 45 grains, was sent through one inch of steel wire, of the same diameter as the last, but only changed its colour.\n\n26. With three bottles charged to 40 grains, a shock sent through one inch and a half of steel wire of the above diameter, dispersed it all about the room.\n\n27. Mr Brooke considering that a steel wire of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter, contains nearly twice the quantity of metal which is contained in the same length of wire of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter, took three inches of the former, and sent through it a shock from ten bottles, charged to 25 grains. This shock melted it just as the shock from five bottles did in experiment 20.\n\n28. With 20 bottles charged to 12 grains and a half, he melted three inches of steel wire of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter, exactly as in the foregoing experiment.\n\n29. As a steel wire of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch diameter contains nearly twice the quantity of metal in the same length, as is contained in a steel wire of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th, or four times the quantity contained in a steel wire of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch diameter; it might from the foregoing experiments be expected, that 20 bottles charged to 25 grains would melt three inches of steel wire of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter: but on a great many trials he could not procure 20 bottles which would bear the discharge when charged to 25 grains; for at the discharge, there was always one or more bottles broken or perforated. He was now reduced to the necessity of being content with bottles of any size, that would bear the required charge of from one to three gallons each, or that contained from 150 to 300 or more square inches of coated surface each, but all in vain. The only resource left him, as he was not near a glasshouse, was to increase the quantity of surface and not to charge so high and to proportion the one to the other: it was therefore resolved to adopt a third expedient, i.e., instead of employing about 36 square feet of coating, he added a third, or twelve feet, which made it in all 48 feet; and instead of charging to 25 grains, or rather 24 for the sake of a more easy division by three, he annulled one-third of the charge, leaving fifteen grains, and thus he succeeded perfectly well; for by 48 feet of coated surface charged to 16 grains, three inches of steel wire \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter were as curiously melted as in any of the former experiments.\n\nThese bottles, thus broken in large discharges, seem always to break or to be perforated nearly in the thinness, but never in the thickest place, which shows the necessity of the glass being of a considerable thickness.\n\n30. As in experiments 19 and 20, where the coated surface in the former is but half the quantity of that in the latter, and the former is charged to 30, and the latter to 15 grains, to know how high 48 feet of coating must be charged to produce the same effect exactly: and as the coating in four bottles, consisting of a little more than six feet and a half, is contained in 48 feet a little more than seven times; so Mr Brooke tried, by charging 48 feet only to a little more than four grains, or only about one-seventh part to high, as four times seven is 28; that is, but two less than 30: and this had exactly the same effect on the wire, which was \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter, and three inches long, as it had upon the former.\n\n31. As the last experiment agreed so exactly with experiments 19 and 20, the next thing tried was to see the effect of 48 feet of coated surface charged to a little more than four grains upon six inches of steel wire, the size of the last; this was made very faintly red.\n\n32. By a repetition of the last experiment, with the same length of the same wire, to see how often the same charge might be sent through it without melting it, and to observe the appearance of the wire after each shock, he found that by the eighth shock it was melted into several pieces. After the first shock, the redness produced became less every time, even the last time, when it was separated. By the first shock, though made little more than fairly red, the wire became flexible, that by a small addition to its own weight, it seemed to become almost perfectly straight when cooled: at about the third or fourth shock it began to assume a zig-zag appearance; after the fifth shock the surface of it appeared rough; after the seventh shock the surface was very roughly scorched or scaly; and some of the scales had fallen upon a piece of white paper placed at about half an inch distance below it. The eighth shock melted it in three places; and at these places where the angles appeared the sharpest or most acute, a great number of the scales were driven off about the paper, and appeared as in experiment 18; some of them were almost one-tenth of an inch long, and some of them about a third or fourth part of the diameter of the wire in breadth, and very thin; after the seventh shock it was shortened seven-sixteenths of an inch; the wire was \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter.\n\n33. Repeating experiment 31. again with the same length of wire of the same diameter, and the same battery charged to the same degree, in order to observe the method of the wire shortening, having fixed an insulated gage parallel to it and at the distance of about a quarter of an inch from it: after the first shock, which made the wire fairly red, (holding it fixed at one end, that the shortening might appear all at the other, which was held so that it might either contract or dilate,) he observed, that it shortened considerably as it cooled; repeating the shock, it did the same, and so on till it was melted, which was by the eighth shock, as before. At the instant when the shock passed through the wire, it appeared to dilate a little; and after it was at the hottest, it gradually contracted after every stroke, as it cooled, about one-sixteenth of an inch each time; the dilatation was so very trifling, as to bear but a very small proportion to its contraction, and sometimes it was doubtful whether or not it dilated at all; but after all the observations it appeared oftenest to dilate, than not.\n\n34. The same 48 feet, negatively charged to a little more than four grains, melted three inches of steel wire \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter, the same as the positive charge did in experiment 30.\n\n35. The same battery of 48 feet of coated surface, charged\nPrinciples of charged to a little more than eight grains, melted three inches of steel wire, \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter. This is very nearly in proportion to experiment 27, but here the charge was negative, and Mr Brooke says the fusion was the most pleasing he had hitherto had; which he attributes to the charge having been probably so well adjusted as to be exactly sufficient to melt the wire and no more: the heat remained for the longest time, and the fused metal ran into the largest globules; probably the long continuance of the heat, was owing to the charge being just sufficient, and to the size of the lumps into which the fused metal was formed.\n\n36. This was a repetition of experiment 1, with twelve inches of steel wire \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter, but with this difference, that as then only nine bottles were employed, containing about fifteen feet of coated surface, charged to 32 grains, he here used 18 bottles containing about 32 square feet of coating charged to only 16 grains. This was done to observe the progress of the destruction of the wire, as in experiment 32, as well as to prove the similarity of the effect. The wire being the same size, fort of metal, and length, as recited just above; the first shock made it red-hot throughout its whole length attended with smoke and smell, changed its colour to a kind of copperish hue, and shortened it considerably; the second shock made it of a fine blue, but it did not appear red, and shortened it more; at the third shock it assumed a zig-zag appearance, many radii were very visible at the bendings, and the wire continued to shorten till the eleventh shock, when one of the bottles in the second row of the battery was struck through: the fracture was covered over with common cement, and its place supplied by changing place with one in the third row, supposing the mended one to be the weakest; and with the battery in this state he made the twelfth shock, which separated the wire as in experiment 1, but shortened it only one inch.\n\n37. A shock from 48 feet of coated surface, charged to eight grains, sent through three inches of copper wire \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter, seven times, gave it the zig-zag appearance, but did not make it much shorter; the eighth shock separated it at one end close to the forceps which held it, but it did not appear to be made at all sensibly red-hot, notwithstanding it must have been often so at the place where it was melted; which space was so very small as barely to be perceptible, like as when a point is set upon any flat surface of iron, and a shock from a pound phial sent through, both the point and flat surface where the point rested, if examined with a magnifying glass, will be found to have been melted, and a speck may be seen; but the redness of the metal will scarcely be visible.\n\n38. A shock from 48 feet, charged to 16 grains, was sent through six inches of lead wire \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter, and melted it into many pieces.\n\n39. A shock from 48 feet, charged to 15 grains, was sent through six inches of wire like the last, which did not separate it, but made it smoke.\n\n40. A shock like the last, was sent through the same piece of wire a second time, and melted it into several pieces.\n\nThe law by which wires resist destruction, in proportion to the diameter of the wire, does not seem to be nearly so equable, in the lead as in the steel wire. For a charge of four grains, in experiment 34, melted three inches of lead wire \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter; but it took a charge of about three times that power, to destroy three inches of lead wire \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter; which is about double the quantity of metal in the same length as in that of \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter. Thus, it is easy to find what different resistance a wire of any of the preceding metals, of equal size and length, will make to the electrical stroke.\n\nThe length of the electric circuit, in which the different wires were placed, in the foregoing experiments, from the nearest part of the inside to the nearest part of the outside of the battery, exclusive of the length of the laid wires, was about eight feet.\n\n41. Two gentlemen coming to see a piece of wire melted by electricity, Mr Brooke proceeded to show it them, by fixing twelve inches of steel wire \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter, and then (supposing the electrometer, and all other things ready placed), to charge the battery, but the electrometer did not move: nevertheless, he continued charging as he supposed; but still the electrometer remained as it was, although he had been charging much longer than would have been necessary, contrary to his design, which was to take a small wire, that a smaller charge might be sufficient. Having been charging a long time, Mr Brooke left off to look about the apparatus, in order to see if all was right: as he was looking he found there was no communication between the battery and the electrometer, and he heard a slight crackling in the battery which convinced him that it was charged. Accordingly he made the discharge, expecting nothing unusual; but the wire was dispersed seemingly in a very violent manner. The report was so very loud that their ears were stunned, and the flash of light so very great, that Mr Brooke's sight was quite confused for a few seconds.\n\nMr Cuthbertson has lately contrived an electrometer, which possesses all the advantages of Mr Brooke's, added to those of Lane and Henly, with which he has ingeniously combined it.\n\nThis valuable instrument is thus described by the inventor:\n\nThe electrometer is represented in Plate CLXXXIX. No. 2, fig. 70. GH is a long square piece of wood, about 18 inches long, and six inches broad, in which are fixed three glass supports, DEF, mounted with brass balls, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\). Under the brass ball \\(a\\) is a long brass hook; the ball \\(c\\) is made of two hemispheres, the under one being fixed to the brass mounting, and the upper turned with a groove to fit upon it, so that it can be taken off at pleasure. The ball \\(b\\) has a brass tube fixed to it, about three inches long, cemented on to the top of F; and the same ball has a hole at the top, of about one-half inch diameter, corresponding with the inside of the tube. AB is a straight brass wire, with a knife-edged centre in the middle, placed a little below the centre of gravity, and equally balanced with a hollow brass ball at each end, the centre, or axis, resting upon a proper shaped piece of brass fixed in the inside of the ball \\(c\\); that side of the hemisphere towards \\(c\\) is cut open, to permit the end \\(c\\) A of the balance to descend till it touches the ball \\(a\\), and the upper hemisphere C.\nPrinciples of Electricity also cut open to permit the end c B to ascend; i is a weight, weighing a certain number of grains, and made in the form of a pin with a broad head; the ball B has two holes, one at the top, and the other at the bottom; the upper hole is so wide, as to let the head of the pin pass through it, but to stop at the under one, with its shank hanging freely in b; a number of such pins are commonly made to each electrometer of different weights; (c) k is a common Henly's quadrant electrometer, and when in use, it is screwed upon the top of c.\n\nIt is evident, from the construction, that if the foot stand horizontal, and the ball B be made to touch b, it will remain in that position without the help of the weight i; and if it should by any means receive a very low charge of electric fluid, the two balls b, B, will repel each other; B will begin to ascend, and, on account of the centre of gravity being above the centre of motion, the ascension will continue till A rest upon a. If the balance be set again horizontal, and a pin i, of any small weight, be put into its place in B, it will cause B to rest upon b, with a pressure equal to that weight, so that more electric fluid must be communicated than before, before the balls will separate; and as the weight in B is increased or diminished, a greater or less quantity of electric fluid will be required to effect a separation.\n\nWhen this instrument is to be applied to a jar, or battery, for which purpose it was invented, one end of a wire, L, must be inserted into a hole in b, and the other end into a hole of any ball proceeding from the inside of a battery, as M (d); k must be screwed upon c, with its index towards A; the reason of this instrument being added, is to show, by the index continuing to rise, that the charge of the battery is increasing, because the other part of the instrument does not act till the battery has received its required charge.\n\nIf this instrument be examined with attention, it will be found to consist of three electrometers; and answers three different purposes, namely, a Henly's electrometer, Lane's discharging electrometer, and Brooke's steel-yard electrometer; the first not improved, but the two last, which were very defective when first invented, I flatter myself are here brought to perfection. As the only use of Henly's electrometer to this instrument is, as I have said before, to show, by its continuing to increase in divergency, that the battery continues to receive a still stronger charge, it required no improvement; but Lane's electrometer, in its primitive state, could by no means answer the required purpose for batteries, because the ball intended to discharge the battery, was necessarily placed so near to the ball of the battery, that dull and fibrous particles were always attracted by and adhered between the two balls, so as to retard the charging, and often render a high charge impossible: whereas, in this, they are placed at four inches asunder; and when the desired height of charge is obtained, and not before, the ball of the electrometer moves of itself nearer to the ball which is connected with the outside of the battery, and causes a discharge. The defects in Brooke's steel-yard electrometer were, first, that it could not cause a discharge; and secondly, the difficulty of observing the first separation of the balls caused great error. If it were not placed in an advantageous light (which the nature of the experiments could not always permit), it would not be seen, without the attention of an assistant, which is sometimes unpleasant, and cannot always be commanded. But the instrument which I have described, requires no attention or assistance; for as soon as the separation takes place between B and b, the ball A descends, and discharges the battery of itself.\n\nBy this combination and improvements, we possess in the present instrument all that can ever be required of an electrometer; namely, by k, we see the progress of the charge; by the separation of B, b, we have the Nielsboer's repulsive power in weight; and by the ball A, the dilution of charge is caused, when the charge has acquired the proper strength propolled.\n\nWith this electrometer Lieutenant Colonel Haldane Col. Hall has made some very ingenious experiments to determine the mode of the exact charge of a battery required to produce certain changes in wires of the same kind. His method of estimating the force of the charge is by the number of explosions that it is capable of producing in a jar containing the outside coating of the battery. Thus, if the battery while charging produces three explosions of the jar, he says, it has received three measures of electricity.\n\nMr Cuthbertson having observed that when he breathed into a jar, it was thus rendered capable of receiving a higher charge, made the following experiments to ascertain the effect of such increased charge.\n\nExper. 1.—Prepare the electrometer in the manner Breathing shewn in the plate, with the jar M annexed, which contains about 168 square inches of coating (e): put into bear a B the pin, marked 15; take two inches of watch-pan higher, duline wire, fix to each end a pair of spring tongs, as is represented at G m, hook one end to m, and the other to the wire N, communicating with the outside of the jar; let the uncoated part of the jar be made very clean and dry; and let the prime conductor of an electrical machine, or a wire proceeding from it, touch the wire L; then, if the machine be put in motion, the jar and electrometer will charge, as will be seen by the rising of the index of k, and when charged high enough, B will be repelled by b, and A will descend and discharge the jar through the wire, which was confined in the tongs, and the wire will be fused and run into balls.\n\n(c) Instead of the pins, which were found inconvenient, Mr Cuthbertson has lately constructed his electrometer with a sliding piece of brass, so adapted to the arm of the balanced wire, as by sliding nearer to, or farther from the centre of gravity to denote proportional weights.\n\n(d) A chain, or wire, or any body through which the charge is to pass, must be hung to the hook at m, and carried from thence to the outside of the battery, as is represented by the line N.\n\n(e) Take out the pin in B, and observe whether the ball B will remain at rest upon b; if not turn the adjusting screw at C till it just remains upon A.\nChap. IX.\n\nELECTRICITY.\n\nPrinciples of Exper. 2.—Put into the tongs eight inches of the Electricity same fort of wire as before, hang one pair of tongs to the illustrated hook m, and apply the other to the wire which forms the outside communication: take out the pin in B, and put in its stead one marked 30; all the other part of the apparatus remaining as before, and the uncoated part of the jar being previously cleaned and dried: the machine will charge, as is shown by the rising of the index as before; but as soon as the jar has received a greater quantity of electric power than before, a spontaneous explosion will happen without affecting the balls B b, because the discharge will have passed along the uncoated part of the jar from the inside coating to the outside: whence it follows, that, while the jar remains in that clean state, it is incapable of receiving a charge high enough to affect the balls, or even a higher charge than it had received in the first experiment. Let the uncoated part of the jar be therefore rendered, in a slight degree, damp; which is easily done, by breathing into the inside, through a glass tube; put the machine in motion, and no spontaneous explosion will happen, but the balls B b will repel, as in the first experiment, and the discharge will happen from A to a, and pass through the wire placed in the circuit; and though it was eight inches, it will be fused in the same degree as two inches in the last experiment, namely, the wire seen red hot the whole length, and then fall into balls.\n\nVery different degrees of fusion are caused by electric discharges, which may cause great mistakes, if not well attended to. It is proper to adhere to the degree above-mentioned, and particular care ought to be taken to lay the wire, intended for fusion, straight, without any bendings or angles in it. The wire used in the two last experiments, was that which is commonly called watch-pendulum wire, which is flattened; and as it approaches very near to such a sharp edge as might be supposed to affect the experiment, by permitting a diffusion of the electric fluid in its passage, round wires were tried, and the result was the same.\n\nThe late Dr Robison contrived an electrometer on similar principles with that of Mr Brooke, but much superior to it in simplicity of construction, and not inferior to any which have been invented in point of accuracy.\n\nPlate CLXXXIX. Fig. 71. exhibits a front view of this instrument, which is thus constructed. A polished brass ball No. 2. A, a quarter of an inch in diameter, is fixed on the point of a common needle about three inches long, and as slender as can be procured of that length. On the other end of the needle is fixed a ball of amber, glass, or other solid non-conducting substance, of about half an inch or three-quarters of an inch in diameter. This ball is fixed in such a way as that the needle does not quite reach to its surface, though the ball F must be completely perforated. From the electric ball there passes a slender glass rod, F, E, L, bent at right angles at E, so that the part FE is about three inches long, and the other extremity L is immediately opposite to the centre of the ball A. A piece of amber C, cut so as to have two parallel cheeks, is fixed on the extremity L of the glass rod. For the principal part of the instrument, a strong dry silk thread is to be prepared by holding it perpendicular in melted sealing-wax, till it shall be fully penetrated by the wax, so as to retain a thin coating of it. The thread, thus coated, must be kept extended, so that it may be quite straight, and it must be made perfectly smooth by holding it before a clear fire and rolling it on a smooth plane. It is then to be passed through a small cube of amber, that has two holes drilled in two of its opposite faces, perpendicularly about half way to the stalk. By these holes the cube is suspended, so as to move readily, on two fine brass pins, between the cheeks of the piece of amber at L. The waxed thread is about six inches long, and is equally divided by the amber cube. To one end of it, B, is fixed a ball of some conducting substance, as of very thin polished metal, or gilt and burnished cork, a quarter of an inch in diameter. The other extremity, D, passes through a cork ball, so as to move with some friction.\n\nThis part of the instrument is so constructed, that when FE is perpendicular to the horizon, and the stalk BD, with its balls, is allowed to hang freely, the ball B just touches the ball A. This position is represented in fig. 72.\n\nThe ball F is fixed to one end of a glass rod FI made to pass perpendicularly through the centre of a graduated circle GHO, and furnished at its other extremity I with a knopped handle of box wood. HK is the stand of the electrometer, in the head of which is a hole in which the rod FI moves smoothly but not easily. Farther, there is adapted to the glass rod FI an index NH that turns round it. This index is so placed as to be parallel to a line LA drawn through the centre of the ball A. Now, as the circle is divided into 360 degrees, O being marked above and 90 on the right hand; the index will point out the angle which the line LA makes with the vertical line. It is convenient to have another index on the rod FI turning stiffly round it, and extending considerably beyond the circle.\n\nThe method of using this instrument will be shown when we speak of the law of electric action in the next part.\n\nChap. X. Of the Electrophorus.\n\nThe electrophorus is an instrument invented by Signior Volta of Como. It generally consists of two of the electrophorus parts; a round plate of metal, or of wood, made perfectly free from points and edges, and covered with tin foil; as A fig. 73; and another circular plate of any conducting substance covered with a coating of some resinous electric, generally of lac dissolved in alcohol, melted sealing-wax, pitch, or of sulphur; as B. The first plate is furnished with a glass handle, or with silk strings, so that it may be occasionally inflated: to this plate Volta has given the name of Scudo.\n\nSometimes the apparatus is made in three parts, i.e., the resinous electric is formed into a cake independent of the plate B, and this is the most convenient method for experiment. To these three parts Dr Robison has given the following names; viz. the resinous electric he calls the cake, the plate B, the sole, and the plate A the Cover; and these names we shall adopt for the sake of convenience. For the purpose of exhibiting the appearances which we are about to describe in the most brilliant manner, the several parts may be made very thin in proportion to their circumference; but for illustrating the theory\nThe general appearances which have been observed with this apparatus may be reduced to the following heads.\n\n1. If the cake, after being just formed, be suffered to remain on the sole, till it be perfectly cool and hard, while the sole is insulated; on examination the whole will be found negatively electric, and on applying the finger to any part of it, especially the sole, a spark is produced. If the apparatus be now suffered to remain at rest, its electricity gradually becomes weaker, and at length entirely disappears. It may, however, be again produced by rubbing the cake with a piece of new flannel, or, what is better, a piece of hare or mole skin with the fur on, made dry and warm. If after the cake has been thus excited, the cover be placed on it, by means of its insulating handle, and if it be again lifted off, without being touched, no electricity whatever can be observed in the cover.\n\n2. If, however, the cover while in contact with the cake, be touched with the finger, a smart pungent spark will be obtained from the cover; and if, while the finger touches the cover, the thumb is placed upon the sole, a sensible shock will be felt between the finger and thumb.\n\n3. After the above spark or shock has been obtained, the electricity of the electrophorus disappears, and the apparatus is said to be dead; no signs of electricity appearing in either sole or cover, so long as the latter remains in contact with the cake.\n\n4. But if the cover be raised to some distance from the cake, and in a direction parallel to it, and if the cover be touched while held in this position, a smart spark will appear between it and the finger, and will even strike to some distance. This spark will be more remarkable, if obtained from the upper surface of the cover, especially from its edge, which, if it has not been well rounded, will even throw off sparks into the air. The spark received from the cover under these circumstances, is however, not so pungent as that mentioned in No. 2, resembling a spark from any electrified conductor.\n\n5. When the cover is thus raised from the cake, the former is found positively electrified, and the latter, as before, negatively.\n\n6. But the electricity of both cover and cake, while in contact, is negative.\n\n7. The appearances above described may be repeated for a considerable time, with apparently undiminished vivacity, without re-exciting the cake by friction; the apparatus has been observed to retain its electric power, even for several months. Hence it serves as a kind of electrical magazine, and may be repeatedly employed for charging jars, either positively, by imparting to the jar the electric spark from the cover while raised from the cake; or negatively, by receiving the sparks from the cover in contact with the cake. From this property of retaining the electric power for so long a time, Signor Volta denominated the apparatus electrophorus, or electroforo perpetuo.\n\n8. If, before placing the cover on the cake, the sole has been insulated, the same spark may be obtained from the cover, and the same shock may be felt on touching both cake and cover at the same time; but the spark, in this case, is by no means so pungent as that obtained when the sole has not been insulated.\n\n9. If, when the sole has been insulated, the cover be again lifted to a considerable distance from the cake, the sole will be found electrical, and its electricity will be the same as that of the cake, or negative.\n\n10. If, after touching both sole and cover, the cover be raised from the cake, by its insulating handle, and again replaced upon the cake without being touched while separate, the whole apparatus is found to possess no electricity.\n\n11. If both sole and cover be inactive after being joined, they will, when separated, show opposite electricities; the cover being electrified positively and the sole negatively.\n\n12. If both cover and sole be rendered inactive while separate, they will, when placed in contact, be found to possess the electricity opposite to that of the cake, i.e., they will together be in a state of positive electricity.\n\nIt is of little consequence what substance forms the glass plate to which the electric coating is applied; formerly Mr. Cavallo used a glass plate, and this was coated with various resinous electrics. Mr. Cavallo, who made several experiments on the construction and phenomena of the electrophorus, found that the most convenient electric was made with the second sort of sealing-wax spread upon a thick glass plate. A plate made by him after this manner, the diameter of which was no more than six inches, was, when once excited, capable of charging a coated phial strongly, that by the explosion, a card could be perforated; this phial might be charged several times successively, without again exciting the plate. Sometimes the cover, when separated from the plate, was so strongly electrified, that it darted strong flashes towards the table on which the electric plate was laid, and even into the air. \"The power of some of my plates,\" says Mr. Cavallo, \"is so strong, that sometimes the electric plate adheres to the metal when this is lifted up; nor will they separate even when the metal plate is touched with the finger, or other conductor.\"\n\n\"If, after having excited the sealing-wax,\" continues he, \"I lay the plate with the wax upon the table, and the glass uppermost, i.e., contrary to the common method, then, on making the usual experiment of putting the metal plate on it, and taking the spark &c., I observe it to be attended with the contrary electricity; that is, if I lay the metal plate upon the electric one, and while in that situation touch it with an insulated body, that body acquires the positive electricity, and the metallic, removed from the electric plate, appears to be negative; whereas it would become positive if laid upon the excited wax. This experiment, I find, answers in the same manner, if an electric plate is used which has the sealing-wax coating on both sides, or one of Mr. Adams's, which has no glass plate.\n\n\"If the brass plate, after being separated from, be presented...\"\nChap. X.\n\nELECTRICITY.\n\nPrinciples of electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nElectrolysis while the fluid is in contact with its excited surface. If the negative side of the phial be applied, and a spark be taken from the positive, the pith-balls immediately separate negatively; but on taking up the fluid, they immediately close, and as rapidly separate again positively.\n\nIf after the phial is removed, the hand be applied to the fluid before it is raised, a small spark strikes into the hand; but on raising the fluid, the balls close and separate instantaneously, and give signs of positive electricity. If the fluid and the brass plate be connected, either by an insulated or uninsulated discharging rod, the balls close and separate again, and the fluid, upon being raised, receives a vigorous negative spark.\n\nIt is obvious that in all the preceding experiments, the brass plate continues unchangeably adherent to the lower surface, while the fluid only, or the conducting substance in connection with the upper surface, is moveable. It is of importance that we should know the consequences of making both the metallic surfaces moveable.\n\nBut this is not an easy matter; it is very difficult to get a resinous substance thin enough, and at the same time firm enough, for the purpose. The perfect laminae of tallow, which I have been able to procure, are too small to be used with any satisfaction; I have therefore had recourse to glass for the purpose. The result of my repeated trials is the following.\n\nHaving substituted a glass plate, about twelve inches in diameter, and one fourth of an inch thick, in the room of the resinous substance, and having reeled it on a ground metallic plate, five inches in diameter, and well connected with the pith-balls g and h, I exposed it to the sparks of a conductor charged positively, and kept my hand at the same time in connexion with the wire a b. The plate took a considerable charge; its upper side was unequivocally positive, and its lower side negative. I placed the fluid on the glass thus charged, and approaching it with my hand, I received a spark. I then approached a b with my hand, and received another. By alternate approaches of this kind, four or five times repeated, the sparks became weaker and weaker till they disappeared; the fluid was then raised, and was strongly negative; but the pith-ball, on the removal of the fluid, closed and separated positively.\n\nI then made the lower the upper surface; and placing the fluid upon it, formed the communication, as in the preceding part of the experiment; but upon being raised, the fluid was strongly positive, and the balls negative.\n\nBut if, previous to the placing the fluid on the glass, the pith-balls be carefully discharged of all adherent electricity, both the upper and lower sides of the glass will be charged with positive electricity, or will give signs of their being in the same state at the same time.\n\nIt is observable that the succession of electricities, in the preceding experiments seems to vary according to the priority of contact given to the wire or the fluid. But though this happens most frequently, yet such anomalies take place as not to justify us in considering this singular connection of diversities as by any means certain.*\n\n* Cavalli's Electricity, vol. ii.\n\nMr Morgan's experiments.\n\nMr Morgan has given us some valuable experimental observations on the Insulated Electrolysis.\n\nHis apparatus consists of a rounded piece of wood, A B fig. 74., with smooth edges and covered with tin-foil, placed on an insulating stand C D. On this board or foil is placed the electric plate or cake; a b is a wire with a brass ball from which are hung the electrometer balls g h. G represents the fluid or cover. After relating the usual appearances produced by friction, he proceeds to describe those which arise from connecting the cake with opposite sides of a Leyden phial.\n\n\"When the negative surface of a charged phial is placed on the excited surface, by bringing the hand into contact with the opposite side of the phial, a spark is instantly communicated, and the pith-balls g and h, separate negatively.\n\nIf the phial be taken off, and the fluid placed in its room, no change is observable on the subsequent removal of the fluid, provided, that no communication has been formed between it and the ground. When such a communication is formed, a charge is communicated, and the fluid and the balls are in opposite states of electricity.\n\nIf the positive side of a Leyden phial be placed on the excited surface, the pith-balls separate positively. It must be observed that these experiments are made with a resinous substance.\n\nThe appearances of the pith-balls and fluid are materially varied, if the Leyden phial be applied to the\nMr Nicholson published in the Phil. Trans. for 1789, some valuable observations on the best means of excitation, which we shall here extract.\n\n1. A glass cylinder was mounted, and a cushion applied with a silk flap, proceeding from the edge of the cushion over its surface, and thence half round the cylinder. The cylinder was then excited by applying an amalgamated leather in the usual manner. The electricity was received by a conductor, and passed off in sparks to Lane's electrometer. By the frequency of these sparks, or by the number of turns required to cause spontaneous explosion of a jar, the strength of the excitation was ascertained.\n\n2. The cushion was withdrawn about one inch from the cylinder, and the excitation performed by the silk only. A stream of fire was seen between the cushion and the silk; and much fewer sparks passed between the balls of the electrometer.\n\n3. A roll of dry silk was interposed, to prevent the stream from passing between the cushion and the silk. Very few sparks then appeared at the electrometer.\n\n4. A metallic rod, not insulated, was then interposed instead of the roll of silk, so as not to touch any part of the apparatus. A dense stream of electricity appeared between the rod and the silk, and the conductor gave very many sparks.\n\n5. The knob of a jar being substituted in the place of the metallic rod, it became charged negatively.\n\n6. The silk alone, with a piece of tin-foil applied behind it, afforded much electricity, though less than when the cushion was applied with a light pressure. The hand being applied to the silk as a cushion, produced a degree of excitation seldom equalled by any other cushion.\n\n7. The edge of the hand answered as well as the palm.\n\n8. When the excitation by a cushion was weak, a line of light appeared at the anterior part of the cushion, and the silk was strongly disposed to receive electricity from any uninsulated conductor. These appearances did not obtain when the excitation was by any means made very strong.\n\n9. A thick silk, or two or more folds of silk, excited worse than a single very thin flap. I use the silk which the milliners call Perian.\n\n10. When the silk was separated from the cylinder, sparks passed between them; the silk was found to be a weak negative, and the cylinder in a positive state.\n\nThe foregoing experiments show that the office of the silk is not merely to prevent the return of electricity from the cylinder to the cushion, but that it is the chief agent in the excitation; while the cushion serves only to supply the electricity, and perhaps increase the pressure at the entering part. There likewise seems to be little reason to doubt but that the disposition of the electricity to escape from the surface of the cylinder is not prevented by the interposition of the silk, but by a compensation after the manner of a charge; the silk being then as strongly negative as the cylinder is positive; and, lastly, that the line of light between the silk and cushion in weak excitations does not consist of returning electricity, but of electricity which passes to the cylinder, in consequence of its not having been sufficiently supplied during its contact with the rubbing surface.\n\n11. When the excitation was very strong in a cylinder newly mounted, flashes of light were seen to fly across its inside, from the receiving surface to the surface in contact with the cushion, as indicated by the brush figure. These made the cylinder ring as if struck with a bundle of small twigs. They seem to have arisen from part of the electricity of the cylinder taking the form of a charge. This appearance was observed in a 9-inch and a 12-inch cylinder, and the property went off in a few weeks. Whence it appears to have been chiefly occasioned by the rarity of the internal air produced by handling, and probably restored by gradual leaking of the cement.\n\n12. With a view to determine what happens in the state of the inside of the cylinder, recourse was had to a plate machine. One cushion was applied with its filken flap, cylinder 4 inch thick. During the excitation, the surface opposite to the cushion strongly attracted electricity, which it gave out when it arrived opposite to the extremity of the flap; so that a continual stream of electricity passed through an insulated metallic bow terminating in balls, which were opposed, the one to the surface opposite the extremity of the silk, and the other opposite to the cushion; the former ball showing positive and the latter negative signs. The knobs of two jars being substituted in the place of these balls, the jar applied to the surface opposite to the cushion was charged negatively, and the other positively. This disposition of the back surface seemed, by a few trials, to be weaker, the stronger the action of the cushion, as judged by the electricity on the cushion side.\n\nHence it follows, that the internal surface of a cylinder is so far from being disposed to give out electricity during the friction by which the external surface acquires it, that it even greedily attracts it.\n\n13. A plate of glass was applied to the revolving plate, and thrust under the cushion in such a manner as to supply the place of the silk flap. It rendered the electricity stronger, and appears to be an improvement of the plate machine.\n\n14. Two cushions were then applied on the opposite surfaces with their silk flaps, so as to clap the plate between them. The electricity was received from both by applying the finger and thumb to the opposite surfaces of the plate. When the finger was advanced a little towards its correspondent cushion, so that its distance was less than between the thumb and its cushion, the finger received strong electricity, and the thumb none; and, contrariwise, if the thumb were advanced beyond the finger, it received all the electricity, and none passed to the finger. This electricity was not stronger than was produced by the good action of one cushion applied singly.\n\n15. The cushion in experiment 12, gave most electricity when the back surface was supplied, provided that surface was suffered to retain its electricity till the rubbed surface had given out its electricity.\nFrom the two last paragraphs it appears, that no advantage is gained by rubbing both surfaces; but that a well managed friction on one surface will accumulate as much electricity as the present methods of excitation seem capable of collecting; but that, when the excitation is weak, on account of the electric matter not paffing with sufficient facility to the rubbed surface, the friction enables the opposite surface to attract or receive it, and if it be supplied, both surfaces will pass off in the positive state; and either surface will give out more electricity than is really induced upon it, because the electricity of the opposite surface forms a charge. It may be necessary to observe, that I am speaking of the facts or effects produced by friction; but how the rubbing surfaces act upon each other to produce them, whether by attraction or otherwise, we do not here inquire.\n\n16. When a cylinder is weakly excited, the appearances mentioned (par. 8.) are more evident the more rapid the turning. In this case, the avidity of the surface of the cylinder beneath the silk is partly supplied from the edge of the silk, which throws back a broad cascade of fire, sometimes to the distance of above 12 inches. From these causes it is that there is a determinate velocity of turning required to produce the maximum of intensity in the conductor. The stronger the excitation, the quicker may be the velocity; but it rarely exceeds five feet of the glass to pass the cushion in a second.\n\n17. If a piece of silk be applied to a cylinder, by drawing down the ends so that it may touch half the circumference, and the cylinder be then turned and excited by applying the amalgamated leather, it will become very greedy of electricity during the time it passes under the silk. And if the entering surface of the glass be supplied with electricity, it will give it out at the other extremity of contact; that is to say, if insulated conductors be applied at the touching ends of the silk, the one will give, and the other receive, electricity, until the intensities of their opposite states are as high as the power of the apparatus can bring them; and these states will be instantly reversed by turning the cylinder in the opposite direction.\n\nAs this discovery promises to be of the greatest use in electrical experiments, because it affords the means of producing either the plus or minus states in one and the same conductor, and of instantly repeating experiments with either power, and without any change of position or adjustment of the apparatus, it evidently deserves the most minute examination.\n\n18. There was little hope (par. 6.) that cushions could be dispensed with. They were therefore added; and it was then seen, that the electrified conductors were supplied by the difference between the action of the cushion which had the advantage of the silk, and that which had not; so that the naked face of the cylinder was always in a strong electric state. Methods were used for taking off the prelude of the receiving cushion; but the extremity of the silk, by the construction, not being immediately under that cushion, gave out large flashes of electricity with the power that was used. Neither did it appear practicable to prevent a row of points or other apparatus to intercept the electricity which flew round the cylinder; because such an addition would have materially diminished the intensity of the conductor, which in the usual way was such as to flash into the air from rounded extremities of four inches diameter, and made an inch and half ball become luminous and blow like a point. But the greatest inconvenience was, that the two states with the backward and forward turn were seldom equal; because the deposition of the amalgam on the silk, produced by applying the leather to the cylinder in one direction of turning, was the reverse of what must take place when the contrary operation was performed.\n\nNotwithstanding all this, as the intensity with the two cushions was such as most operators would have called strong, the method may be of use, and I still mean to make more experiments when I get possession of a very large machine which is now in hand.\n\n19. The more immediate advantage of this discovery is, that it suggested the idea of two fixed cushions method of with a moveable silk flap and rubber. Upon this principle, which is so simple and obvious, that it is wonderful it should have been so long overlooked, I have constructed a machine with one conductor, in which the two opposite and equal states are produced by the simple process of loosening the leather rubber, and letting it pass round with the cylinder (to which it adheres) until it arrives at the opposite side, where it is again fastened. A wish to avoid prolixity prevents my describing the mechanism by which it is let go and fastened in an instant, at the same time that the cushion is made either to press or is withdrawn, as occasion requires.\n\n20. Although the foregoing series of experiments naturally lead us to consider the silk as the chief agent in excitation; yet as this business was originally performed by a cushion only, it becomes an object of inquiry to determine what happens in this case.\n\n21. The great Beccaria inferred, that in a simple cushion, the line of fire, which is seen at the extremity manner of contact from which the surface of the glass recedes, performed consists of returning electricity; and Dr Nooth grounded his happy invention of the silk flap upon the same rubber supposition. The former asserts, that the lines of light without both at the entering and departing parts of the surface a silk flap, are absolutely similar; and thence infers, that the cushion receives on the one side, as it certainly does on the other. I find, however, that the fact is directly contrary to this assertion; and that the opposite inference ought to be made, as far as this indication can be reckoned conclusive: for the entering surface exhibits many luminous perpendiculars to the cushion, and the departing surface exhibits a neat uniform line of light. This circumstance, together with the consideration that the line of light behind the silk in par. 8. could not consist of returning electricity, showed the necessity of farther examination. I therefore applied the edge of the hand as a rubber, and by occasionally bringing forward the palm, I varied the quantity of electricity which passed near the departing surface. When this was the greatest, the sparks at the electrometer were the most numerous. But as the experiment was liable to the objection that the rubbing surface was variable, I passed a piece of leather upon a thin flat piece of wood, then amalgamated its whole surface, and cut its extremity off in a neat right line close to the wood. This being applied by the constant action of a spring against the cylinder, produced a weak excitation; and the line where the contact of the cylinder and leather ceased (as abruptly\nPrinciples of Electricity (as possible) exhibited a very narrow fringe of light.\n\nAnother piece of wood was prepared of the same width as the rubber, but one quarter of an inch thick, with its edges rounded, and its whole surface covered with tin-foil. This was laid on the back of the rubber, and was there held by a small spring, in such a manner as that it could be slid onward, so as occasionally to project beyond the rubber, and cover the departing and excited surface of the cylinder without touching it. The sparks at the electrometer were four times as numerous when this metallic piece was thus projected; but no electricity was observed to pass between it and the cylinder. The metallic piece was then held in the hand to regulate its distance from the glass; and it was found, that the sparks at the electrometer increased in number as it was brought nearer, until light appeared between the metal and the cylinder; at which time they became fewer the nearer it was brought, and at last ceased when it was in contact.\n\nThe following conclusions appear to be deducible from these experiments. 1. The line of light on a cylinder departing from a simple cushion consists of returning electricity; 2. The projecting part of the cushion compensates the electricity upon the cylinder, and by diminishing its intensity prevents it striking back in such large quantities as it would otherwise do; 3. That if there was no such compensation, very little of the excited electricity would be carried off; And, 4. That the compensation is diminished, or the intensity increased, in a higher ratio than that of the distance of the compensating substance; because, if it were not, the electricity which has been carried off from an indefinitely small distance, would never fly back from a greater distance and form the edge of light.\n\nI hope the considerable intensity I shall speak of will be an apology for describing the manner in which I produce it. I wish the theory of this very obscure process were better known; but no conjecture of mine is worth mentioning. The method is as follows:\n\nClean the cylinder, and wipe the silk.\n\nGrease the cylinder by turning it against a greased leather till it is uniformly obscured. Use the tallow of a candle.\n\nTurn the cylinder till the silk flap has wiped off so much of the grease as to render it semitransparent.\n\nPut some amalgam on a piece of leather, and spread it well, so that it may be uniformly bright. Apply this against the turning cylinder. The friction will immediately increase, and the leather must not be removed until it ceases to become greater.\n\nRemove the leather, and the action of the machine will be very strong.\n\nMy rubber, as before observed, consists of the silk flap pasted to a leather, and the cushion is pressed against the silk by a slender spiral spring in the middle of its back. The cushion is loosely retained in a groove, and rests against the spring only, in such a manner that by a sort of libration upon it as a fulcrum, it adapts itself to all the irregularities of the cylinder, and never fails to touch it in its whole length. There is no adjustment to vary the pressure, because the pressure cannot be too small when the excitation is properly made. Indeed the actual withdrawing of the cushion to the distance of \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of an inch from the silk, as in par. 2, Principles of Electricity Illustrated by Experiment, will not materially affect a good excitation.\n\nThe amalgam is that of Dr Higgins, composed of zinc and mercury. If a little mercury be added to melted zinc, it renders it easily pulverizable, and more mercury may be added to the powder to make a very soft amalgam. It is apt to crystallize by repose, which seems in some measure to be prevented by triturating it with a small proportion of grease; and it is always of advantage to triturate it before using.\n\nA very strong excitation may be produced by applying the amalgamated leather to a clean cylinder with a clean silk; but it soon goes off, and is not so strong as the foregoing, which lasts several days.\n\nTo give some distinctive criterions by which other electricians may determine whether the intensity they produce exceeds or falls short of that which this method affords, I shall mention a few facts.\n\nWith a cylinder 7 inches diameter and cushion 8 mer. inches long, three brushes at a time constantly flew out of a 3-inch ball in succession too quick to be counted, and a ball of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch diameter was rendered luminous, and produced a strong wind like a point. A 9-inch cylinder with an 8-inch cushion occasioned frequent flashes from the round end of a conductor 4 inches diameter; with a ball of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inches in diameter the flashes ceased now and then, and it began to appear luminous: a ball of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch diameter first gave the usual flashes; then, by quicker turning, it became luminous with a bright spark moving about on its surface, while a constant stream of air rushed from it; and, lastly, when the intensity was greatest, brushes of a different kind from the former appeared. These were less luminous, but better defined in the branches; many started out at once with a hoarse sound. They were reddish at the item, sooner divided, and were greenish at the point next the ball, which was bright. A ball of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)ths of an inch in diameter was surrounded by a steady faint light, enveloping its exterior hemisphere, and sometimes a flash struck out at top. When the excitation was strongest, a few flashes struck out sidewise. The horizontal diameter of the light was longest, and might measure one inch, the item of the ball being vertical.\n\nWith a 12-inch cylinder and rubber of \\( \\frac{7}{2} \\) inches, a 5-inch ball gave frequent flashes, upwards of 14 inches long, and sometimes a 6-inch ball would flash. I do not mention the long spark, because I was not provided with a favourable apparatus for the two larger cylinders. The 7-inch cylinder affords a spark of 10\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inches at best. The 9-inch cylinder, not having its conductor insulated on a support sufficiently high, afforded flashes to the table which was 14 inches distant. And the 12-inch cylinder, being mounted only as a model or trial for constructing a larger apparatus, is defective in several respects, which I have not thought fit to alter. When the five-inch ball gives flashes, the cylinder is enveloped on all sides with fire which rushes from the receiving part of the conductor.\n\nIt is of consequence that electricians should employ usual methods common method of estimating the power of their kinds of machines, so as to admit of comparing those of different sizes or constructions. This is usually done by describing the length and appearance of the simple spark drawn from the prime conductor; or the distance to electrical machines.\nNicholson has been led to alter his opinion; and he now prefers a plate to a cylinder.\n\nFrom considering the defects of the usual methods of estimating the power of machines, Mr Cuthbertson was led to propose the explosion of steel wire as a proper measure; and he has made several experiments to show that this method is the least liable to error. Mr Nicholson has given an account of these experiments in his Journal for August 1798; but they seem to require measuring a repetition and farther extension before they can be received as conclusive.\n\nAs glass, though preferable to all electrics that can be employed for the purpose of excitation, from its substitutes durability and unchangeable nature, is from its brittleness attended with considerable expense, various experiments have been thought of to substitute in its place some other electric in the construction of electrical machines.\n\nDr Ingenhouz, the inventor of the plate machine, made a variety of experiments for this purpose. Pasteboard thoroughly dried and heated, and then soaked and varnished with a solution of amber in linseed oil, formed plates which were strongly electrified when rubbed with a cat's skin or hare's skin. He tried baked wood boiled in linseed oil, but with less success. A cylinder of strong silk velvet, formed by stretching that substance upon two circular wooden disks, was found to afford considerable electrical force when caused to revolve against a cushion covered with hare's skin.* Phil.\n\nAnd lastly, the same philosopher contrived a portable Transf. for apparatus for charging a jar by means of a varnished silk ribbon, exposed to the friction of a rubber attached to the external coating, while the opposite electricity of the silk was taken off by a metallic part communicating with the inside.\n\nIt was at the beginning of 1784, that M. Walckiers de St Amand undertook to construct a machine, in which a piece of silk was made to revolve incessantly, and pass between two pair of rubbers. He made one of small dimensions, and afterwards a larger one, in which the silk was twenty-five feet in length, and five feet broad. In the following year M. Rouland, professor of natural philosophy in the university of Paris, constructed a machine of the same kind.† As the advantages and effects of these machines appear to be considerable, we shall here insert the description of the latter from Nicholson's Journal for December 1798.\n\nA, B, fig. 80, is a wooden table four feet and a half long, two feet nine inches wide, and somewhat more of silk than an inch and a half thick; its feet are 18 inches long. Upon this table are fastened by strong wooden screws, a b c d, two crofs pieces, each nine inches broad, which carry the uprights C, D, E, F, which last are 27 inches in height. At about two-thirds or more of the height of these uprights, there are cut notches of an inch square each, in which the axes of the two cylinders G and H turn freely. These axes are parallel to the table and to each other, and are kept in their place by clamps of wood screwed over them. The cylinders G and H are formed of light wood glued together, and covered at the ends by a circular piece, whose rounded edges arise half an inch above the surface of the cylinders themselves. Their diameter is eight inches; the axes are of box-wood, and are less than an inch in diameter, having a shoulder which prevents the ends of the cylinders from...\nELECTRICITY.\n\nPrinciples of Electricity lastly, the cylinders are covered with serge.\n\nThe handle is copper, its radius being six inches long.\n\nK, L, is a piece of taffety covered with oily and resinous matter, of the same kind as used in France in the construction of air-balloon, which, M. Rouland says, renders the silk very electrical; the breadth of the silk is nearly one inch less than the length of the cylinders, and it is wrapped round them with its ends sewed together.\n\nThe whole breadth of the silk is taken hold of or pinched between two flattened tin tubes opposite each other at M, and two of the same kind at N: these are the rubbers, and may be made to press against each other, more or less strongly, by means of screws. They are retained by strings of silk fastened to the four uprights of the machine. v v are two brass chains hooked upon the rubbers, and communicating with the earth; o p and q r are four pieces of taffety, prepared in the same manner as the principal piece, sewed in the direction of their length to the rubbers, and fastened to each other by their corresponding corners by means of threads of silk. The metallic tubes or rubbers are covered with cat's skin.\n\nS represents the conductor. It is a cylinder of brass three inches in diameter, 36 inches in length, including the balls at the end, whose diameters are four inches: one of these balls has a ring, t above it, which serves to form a communication between the conductor S and any other conductor.\n\nThe upper and lower parts of this cylindrical prime conductor are armed with two plates of brass y y, whose length is equal and correspondent to the breadth of the taffety, which is 26 inches, and 13 1/2 inches or 11 feet long: the edges of the plates are about half an inch distant from the silk, and serve instead of the metallic points that were used by M. Walckiers, but rejected by M. Rouland, because they were apt to stick into the silk and damage it.\n\nThe conductor S is suspended by silk strings, fastened to the uprights of the machine by the hooks and rings i i: its situation is parallel to the cylinders G, H, and equidistant from each. The action of this machine is as follows: The cylinder H is moved rapidly on its axis by means of the handle, and the cylinder G moves of course in the same direction on the two extremities of its axis, provided the taffety K, L, be properly stretched. This tension is easily obtained; because the cross pieces to which the uprights C, D, and E, F, are fixed, may be moved nearer or further from each other, and fastened by means of the screws a b and c d, which pass through holes cut in the direction of the table.\n\nThe rotation of the cylinders necessarily producing a circulation of the taffety, it must consequently be rubbed in its passage between the tin tubes covered with cat's skin at M and N; and by this friction it obtains what is called the negative electricity, which is communicated from both parts of the silk to the common conductor S. But it may be made to electrify positively, by removing the rubbers to the middle of the silk, so that the prime conductor may communicate with them: or, if the two cushions be removed to half the distance between the revolving cylinders and the prime conductor, positive and negative electricity may be had at the same time, the rubbers being in a negative state, and the prime conductor in a positive state.\n\nThe advantages of a machine of this construction beyond those of glass are stated by the inventor to be, 1. It is not brittle in any part. 2. Its excitation is more steady, because it requires no amalgam. 3. Its dimensions have no limit.\n\nThe power of excitation in this way appears to have been very considerable. The facts are not related with so much detail as could be wished in the report of the academy; but it appears that the negative sparks from the conductor of Walckiers, which was five feet long, were from 15 to 17 inches in length, very loud and dense, and very painful to the hand; that pointed bodies emitted very sensible sparks to the conductor; and that a battery of 50 square feet was charged by 30 turns of the machine, which gives 19 feet of silk rubbed to charge one foot of glass*. In another instance,* see Phil. however, it is said, that a square foot was charged by Journal, one turn of the machine, which answered to 31 1/2 square feet of silk. It is not said whether the labour of turning was considerable or not.\n\nM. Rouland made several trials to substitute plain silk instead of that which was varnished; and he also tried woollens and mixed cloth containing goat's hair; but none of these answered to his satisfaction.\n\nCHAP. XII. Of the Electric Properties of Air.\n\nWe have ranked air among the electrics, but it will be seen by the table of electric substances given in page 646, that it is but an imperfect electric. We have observed at the beginning of this part, that it may even become a conductor by being impregnated with moisture. It is also found that when air is heated to a considerable degree, it becomes a conductor; this according to Cavallo, may be shewn by the following experiment. Electrify a common ball electrometer, or the prime conductor with Henly's quadrant electrometer placed upon it; the balls will, of course, separate from each other, or the index of the quadrant will denote the degree of electricity communicated to the prime conductor. Now bring a red-hot iron within a sufficient distance of the electrometer or the prime conductor, and it will be found that they soon lose their electricity, it being conducted away by the heated air that surrounds the iron; that the heated iron is the cause of the loss of electricity may be proved, by repeating the experiment with the same iron when cold, as in this case it will be found that the electrometer of the conductor, will not lose its electricity so soon, unless the iron be brought very near.\n\nMr Read made the following experiment to prove that hot air is not a conductor.\n\n\"It has been,\" says Mr Read, \"commonly said, that hot air conducts electricity. With a view to affirm certain this matter, the following experiments were made. To one end of a long piece of wood (which served as a handle,) was fixed a glass rod fifteen inches long; to the remote end of the glass was fixed a pith-ball electrometer. Having electrified the balls, I held them by the wood handle, and projected them into a large oven, immediately after the fire was drawn out of it; the consequence was, that when I performed the operation slowly, the balls lost their electricity; but\nChap. XII.\n\nELECTRICITY.\n\nPrinciples of Electricity.\n\nIllustrated electricity, in the first case, was found to have escaped along the glass into the wooden handle, and so to the earth, owing to the great heat the glass rod had acquired, by which it became a conductor of the fluid; for until it had cooled a little, the balls could not be charged again.\n\n\"I shall lay before the reader one circumstance more, because it may tend to throw light on what degree of heat the oven was in at the time the observations were made. The baker having pointed out to me the hottest part of the oven; with a quick motion in and out, I plunged the electrified balls into that part of it, by which one thread ball was burned off, but the remaining ball showed that it still retained its electric charge, because it was strongly attracted on the approach of my finger.\"\n\nAir, as an electric, may be electrified either by excitation or by communication.\n\nAir may be excited by any circumstance which tends to produce motion among its particles; as by friction, evaporation, heat and cold, expansion and contraction, and by any chemical processes in which these circumstances are produced.\n\n1. That air may be excited by friction was sufficiently shown by the experiments related to demonstrate the sensibility of Bennet's electrometer; by these experiments it appeared, that whenever a cloud of dust or powder was raised in the air surrounding the electrometer, the slips of gold leaf, by their separation, manifested signs of electricity, which must doubtless have been produced by the attraction of the particles of dust or powder against the particles of air.\n\n2. Air may be rendered electrical by the vapour or smoke which rises into it from evaporating or burning substances. At the end of the first part of this article, we noticed, in a general way, Sig. Volta's experiments on the electricity produced by evaporation; we must now consider this subject rather more at large. The production of electricity by evaporation, may be thrown by the following experiments.\n\nExper. 1. Upon the cap of Bennet's electrometer c, fig. 81., place a metallic cup containing a little water; drop into the water a red-hot coal, or a red-hot piece of clean iron; a vapour will arise from the water, and the strips of gold leaf n n will diverge with strong negative electricity. If at the same time, an iron wire p, fixed to a rod of glass or sealing-wax, with a common ball electrometer hanging from its extremity, be held by the glass or sealing-wax in the air, at a little distance above the cup, the balls d will be found to diverge with positive electricity.\n\nExper. 2. Let there be two of the above electrometers, as A, B, fig. 82.; upon the cap of the electrometer B, place a metallic cup d, as in the last experiment, and into the cap of the electrometer A, let there be screwed a bent wire m, with a piece of tin soldered to its other extremity. If now, the electrometer B with its metallic cup be placed immediately below the tin r, and a cullender c, containing a few live coals, be held over the cup, and if water be poured from the jug upon the coals in the cullender, so as to fall into the metal cup, the slips of gold leaf in both electrometers will diverge; those of the electrometer B, with negative electricity, and those of the electrometer A, with positive electricity.\n\nThe experiments on the electricity produced by evaporation, may be very conveniently made by heating the final end of a pretty long tobacco-pipe, and pouring water into the bowl of it; the water running down to the heated part, which should be held over the cap of Bennet's electrometer, is suddenly expanded into vapour, and the slips of gold leaf will separate with negative electricity.\n\nIn the above experiment it has been seen, that the electrometer from which the vapour arose, was always electrified negatively; from having observed this to be bodies not always the case in his experiments, Sig. M. Volta always considered it as a general law. Mr Cavallo, however, mentions some experiments made by a professor at Mantua, and by himself, which seem to contradict this supposition.\n\nAll the experiments, (says Mr Cavallo), made on evaporation for some years after this discovery, were attended with results conformable to the above-mentioned general law; but two remarkable exceptions have of late been discovered, which, besides their contradicting the said law, seem to point out a more intimate connection between the electric fluid and other bodies. The first of these exceptions was discovered and published three years ago, by a learned professor of the academy of Mantua; the second was very lately discovered by myself.\n\nThe Mantuan professor observed, that when water was evaporated by being put in contact with a red hot-piece of rusty iron, it would leave the iron electrified positively; whereas when the experiment was tried with a clean piece of iron, the electricity acquired by the metal would be of the negative kind.\n\nWhen I first attempted to repeat this curious experiment, the result did by no means answer my expectations; the electricity, which was produced being of the negative, and not of the positive kind; but observing that sometimes no sensible degree of electricity was produced, though the evaporation was very quick and copious, I began to suspect that the iron, which I had employed, was not sufficiently covered with rust, in consequence of which two opposite states of electricity might possibly be produced, viz. the negative from the clean, and the positive from the rusty part of the iron; which two opposite states, by counteracting each other, would leave the iron un-electrified. After various repetitions of this experiment, in which the red-hot iron was thrown into the inflated water, or the water was poured upon the red-hot and inflated iron, I found that this was actually the case.\n\nI procured some old iron nails, which had remained exposed to the atmosphere for several years, and of course had contracted a very thick coat of rust; and on performing the experiment with them, I obtained positive electricity, agreeably to the assertion of the above-mentioned gentleman. The same nail very seldom would answer for more than one experiment; for the action of the fire and of the water generally removed a great deal of the rust, and exhibited the naked metal, which would afterwards acquire the negative electricity. Here follows the manner of performing this remarkable experiment.\n\nInsulate a metallic or earthen plate, and pour a small\nPrinciples of small quantity of water in it, and let a sensitive electrometer be connected with the water; then drop a red-hot piece of iron into the plate, and it will be found, that, if very ruddy iron be used, the electrometer will be opened with positive electricity; if the iron be clean, or free from rust, the electrometer will acquire the negative electricity; and lastly, if the iron be partially ruddy, the electrometer will acquire little or no electricity, though in every case the evaporation may be equally quick and copious.\n\nThe other exception of the above-mentioned general law is shown by means of red-hot glass, which I chanced to discover very lately. The various degrees of electric power that are produced by the evaporation of water from different substances induced me to diversify the experiments as much as I could, in order to discover, if possible, the reason why those different effects took place when the evaporation seemed to be equally quick and copious. Amongst other substances, I tried glass, and found that it generally produced little or no electricity. The water was sometimes poured upon the hot glass, but in general the hot glass was dropped into the inflated water, which was contained in a tin cup. However, the difference of effect was found not to be occasioned by those two different modes of proceeding. Having repeated this experiment a great many times, I at last found, that the effect depended on the different nature of the glass. If white and clean flint glass be made red-hot, and in that state be dropped into the vessel of water, a quick evaporation will ensue, and the vessel is electrified positively. If the flint glass be not very clear, there will not be any electricity generated by the evaporation, &c. And lastly, if the experiment be tried with more impure glass, as the glass of which wine bottles are made, the negative electricity will be produced.\n\nIn performing this experiment, it is necessary to take care that no pieces of coal adhere to the glass, which will frequently happen when a piece of glass is heated in a common fire; for in that case negative electricity will be produced by the evaporation, though the best flint glass be used.\n\nIt has frequently happened, in the course of my experiments, that no electricity whatever has been produced by the evaporation of water from certain substances; however, as in those cases the evaporation was not very copious, I attributed the deficiency of electricity to the weakness of the evaporation. But a very remarkable instance of this sort is mentioned in the dissertation of the above-mentioned ingenious professor. He flaked 25 pounds weight of quicklime with a sufficient quantity of water, and though a very copious evaporation took place, yet it was not attended with any electricity. Should any person suspect, that the deficiency of electricity in this experiment was owing to the want of burning coals or actual fire, he should consider, that in other similar processes electricity is produced without any actual fire; thus the evaporation, which is occasioned by the effervescence of iron filings in diluted vitriolic acid, produces negative electricity.\n\nAfter a careful examination of the above-mentioned experiments, the origin of the electricity, which is observed in the evaporation of water and other evaporable substances, whether solid or fluid, seems not to be reconcileable to the general law already noticed, nor can I form any plausible theory that can be sufficient to account for all the phenomena. If the production of Electricity electricity in those experiments depended upon the increased or diminished capacity of water for holding the electric fluid, it should seem to be immaterial whether the water be evaporated in one way or in another, provided the evaporation be made with equal quickness and in equal quantities. Were it not known that glass or iron made red-hot produces no electricity in cooling, we might suspect, that the electricity, which is produced by the evaporation of water, may be counteracted by the contrary electricity, which is produced by the cooling of glass or iron; but it has been observed by several ingenious persons, that red-hot glass and red-hot iron produce no electricity whatever when suffered to cool upon insulated stands.\n\nIt has been found that electricity promotes evaporation. This may be proved by the following\n\nExper. Upon the prime conductor of an electrical Evaporation machine, place a shallow metallic dish; as a pewter or iron plate, containing a small quantity of water; and let a red-hot similar dish, containing such a quantity of water as that the two dishes may exactly counterpoise each other, be placed on a table at a distance from the machine. Now let the machine in motion, and after a certain time has elapsed, place the two dishes again in the scales, and it will be found that the dish which stood on the prime conductor is lighter than the other; evidently showing that more of the water has been evaporated.\n\nThis experiment might with more propriety have been given when describing the chemical effects of the electric power.\n\nWe shall return to this subject, under Atmospheric Electricity, to which the consideration of the other circumstances effecting the electricity of air by excitation, more properly belongs.\n\nAir may be electrified by communication in two methods of ways; by simple electrification, as it is called, or by electrifying charging a stratum of it situated between two conductors, the air of a room.\n\nExper. 1.—Fix two or three pointed needles into the prime conductor of an electrical machine, and set the glass in motion so as to keep the prime conductor electrified for several minutes. If now, an electrometer be brought within the air that is contiguous to the prime conductor, it will exhibit signs of electricity, and this air will continue electrified for some time, even after the machine has been removed into another room. The air, in this case, is electrified positively; it may be negatively electrified by fixing the needles in the negative conductor while inflated, and making a communication between the prime conductor and the table, by means of a chain or other conducting substance.\n\nThe air of a room may be electrified in another way. Charge a large jar, and inflate it; then connect two or more sharp pointed wires or needles, with the knob of the jar, and connect the outside coating of the jar with the table. If the jar be charged positively, the air of the room will soon become positively electrified likewise; but if the jar be charged negatively, the electricity communicated by it to the air, will become also negative. A charged jar being held in one hand, and the flame of an inflated candle, held in the other, being brought near the knob of the jar, will also produce the same effect.\nA stratum of air may be charged in the same manner as a plate of glass, when its opposite surfaces are placed in contact with metallic plates which serve as a coating to the plate of air.\n\nTo perform this experiment, take two circular boards, each three or four feet in diameter, made perfectly smooth, and their edges rounded; coat one side of each board with tinfoil, so that it may be turned up over the edge of the board, and let it be burnished so as to render it as smooth as possible. These boards must be placed, with their coated sides parallel to each other, horizontally, and so that they may be set at a greater or smaller distance, and they must both be inflated. For this purpose, it is most convenient to fix one of the boards on a strong support of glass or baked wood, and to suspend the other by silk strings from the ceiling of the room, from which it may be raised or lowered by a proper pulley, so as to be placed at the required distance from the lower board.\n\nThe boards being thus placed in their situation, at the distance of about an inch from each other, on their being electrified, the stratum of air, interposed between them, will present phenomena similar to those of a plate of glass under the same circumstances. On connecting one of the boards with the prime conductor, while the other is inflated, the air will receive no charge agreeably to what was remarked of an inflated Leyden phial. But if, while one of the boards is electrified from the prime conductor, the other be made to communicate with the earth or other conducting bodies, the plate of air will receive a charge, and when the communication between the boards is completed by conductors, an explosion will take place. The explosion in this case, however, is by no means so remarkable as that which is produced from an equal surface of coated glass, for reasons which will be explained hereafter.\n\nThe experiment of charging a plate of air was first made by M. Æpinus and M. Wilcke, who being at Berlin together, jointly made several experiments.\n\nThey made several experiments to give the electric shock by means of air, and at length succeeded by suspending large boards of wood covered with tin with the flat sides parallel to one another, and at some inches asunder; for they found, that upon electrifying one of the boards positively, the other was always negative. But the discovery was made complete and indubitable by a person touching one of the plates with one hand, and bringing his other hand to the other plate; for he then received a shock through his body, exactly like that of the Leyden experiment.\n\nWith this plate of air, they made a variety of curious experiments. The two metal plates, being in opposite states, strongly attracted each other, and would have rushed together, if they had not been kept asunder by strings. Sometimes the electricity of both would be discharged by a strong spark between them, as when a pane of glass bursts with too great a charge. A finger put between them promoted the discharge, and felt the shock. If an eminence was made on either of the plates, the self discharge would always be made through it, and a pointed body fixed upon either of them prevented their being charged at all.*\n\nAt the end of the table of conductors given in page 646, it was observed that a Torricellian vacuum was a non-conductor of electricity. Some experiments were made by Mr Walib, which proved the perfect impermeability of a vacuum by the electric light. But the most complete experiments on this subject are those of Mr W. Morgan and Mr Cavallo. The following are Mr Morgan's experiments.\n\nA mercurial gage B, fig. 83, about 15 inches long, Mr Morgan carefully and accurately boiled, till every particle of air was expelled from the inside, was coated with tin-foil, five inches down from its sealed end (A), and being inverted into mercury through a perforation D, in the power of a brass cap E, which covered the mouth of the cistern perfect vacuum H; the whole was cemented together, and the air was exhausted from the inside of the cistern through a valve C, in the brass cap E just mentioned; which producing a perfect vacuum in the gage B, afforded an instrument peculiarly well adapted for experiments of this kind. Things being thus adjusted, a small wire, F, having been previously fixed on the inside of the cistern, to form a communication between the brass cap E, and the mercury G, into which the gage was inverted; the coated end A was applied to the conductor of an electrical machine; and, notwithstanding every effort, neither the smallest ray of light, nor the slightest charge, could ever be procured in this exhausted gage. It is well known, that if a glass tube be exhausted by an air-pump, and coated on the outside, both light and charge may very readily be procured. If the mercury in the gage be imperfectly boiled, the experiment will not succeed; but the colour of the electric light, which, in air rarefied by an exhausteur, is always violet or purple, appears in this case of a beautiful green; and what is very curious, the degree of the air's rarefaction may be nearly determined by this means. There have been instances known, in a course of experiments, where a small particle of air having found its way into the tube B, the electric light became visible, and as usual of a green colour; but the charge being often repeated, the gage has at length cracked at its sealed end, and in consequence the external air, by being admitted into the inside, has gradually produced a change in the electric light, from green to blue, from blue to indigo, and so on to violet and purple, till the medium has at last become so dense, as no longer to be a conductor of electricity. There can be little doubt, from the above experiments, of the non-conducting power of a perfect vacuum; and this fact is still more strongly confirmed by the phenomena which appear upon the admission of a very minute particle of air into the inside of the gage. In this case, the whole becomes immediately luminous, upon the slightest application of electricity, and a charge takes place, which continues to grow more and more powerful, in proportion as fresh air is admitted, till the density of the conducting medium arrives at its maximum, which it always does when the colour of the electric light is indigo or violet. Under these circumstances, the charge may be so far increased, as frequently to break the glass. In some tubes, which have not been completely boiled, they will not conduct the electric fluid, when the mercury is fallen very low in them; yet upon letting in air into the cistern H, so that the mercury shall rise in the gage B, the electricity, which was before latent in the inside, shall now become visible, and as the mercury continues to rise, and of consequence the medium is rendered less rare, the light shall grow...\nElectricity grows more and more visible, and the gage shall at last be charged, notwithstanding it has not been near an electrical machine for two or three days. This seems to prove, that there is a limit, even in the rarefaction of air, which sets bounds to its conducting power; or, in other words, that the particles of air may be so far separated from each other, as no longer to be able to transmit the electricity; that if they are brought within a certain distance of each other, their conducting power begins, and continually increases, till their approach also arrives at its limit, when the particles again become so near, as to resist the passage of the electricity entirely, without employing violence, which is the case in common and condensed air, but more particularly in the latter.\n\nIt is surprising to observe, how readily an exhausted tube is charged with electricity. By placing it at ten or twelve inches from the conductor, the light may be seen pervading its inside, and as strong a charge may sometimes be procured, as if it were in contact with the conductor. Nor does it signify how narrow the bore of the glass may be; for even a thermometer tube, having the minutest perforation possible, will charge with the utmost facility; and in this experiment, the phenomena are peculiarly beautiful.\n\nLet one end of a thermometer tube be sealed hermetically; let the other end be cemented into a brass cap with a valve, or into a brass cock, so that it may be fitted to the plate of an air-pump. When it is exhausted, let the sealed end be applied to the conductor of an electrical machine, while the other end is either held in the hand, or connected to the floor. Upon the slightest excitation, the electricity will accumulate at the sealed end, and be discharged through the inside in the form of a spark; and this accumulation and discharge may be incessantly repeated, till the tube is broken. By this means, a spark 42 inches long may be procured; and if a proper tube could be found, we might have a spark three or four times that length: if, instead of the sealed end, a bulb be blown at that extremity of the tube, the electric light will fill the whole of that bulb, and then pass through the tube in the form of a brilliant spark, as in the foregoing experiment; though in this case, the charge, after a few trials, will make a small perforation in the bulb. If, again, a thermometer, filled with mercury, be inverted into a cistern, and the air exhausted in the manner before described for making the experiment with the gage, a Torricellian vacuum will be produced; and now the electric light in the bulb, as well as the spark in the tube, will be of a vivid green; but the bulb will not bear a frequent repetition of charges, before it is perforated in like manner as when it has been exhausted by an air-pump. It can hardly be necessary to observe, that in these cases the electricity assumes the appearance of a spark, (v) from the narrowness of the passage through which it forces its way. If a tube, 40 inches long, be fixed into a globe eight or nine inches in diameter, and the whole be exhausted, the electricity, after passing in the form of a brilliant spark throughout the length of the tube, will, when it gets into the inside of the globe, expand itself in all directions, entirely filling it with a violet and purple light, and exhibiting a striking instance of the vast elasticity of the electric power.\n\nMr Morgan concludes his remarks with acknowledging his obligations to Mr Brooke of Norwich for communicating to him his method of making mercurial gages.\n\nMr Brooke's method of making mercurial gages is nearly as follows: Let a glass tube L (fig. 84.), hermetically sealed at one end, be bent into a right angle with two or three inches of the other end. At the distance of about an inch or less from the angle, let a bulb K, of about three-fourths of an inch in diameter, be blown in the curved end, and let the remainder of this part of the tube be drawn out I, so as to be sufficiently long to take hold of when the mercury is boiling. The bulb K is designed as a receptacle for the mercury, to prevent its boiling over; and the bent figure of the tube is adapted for its insertion into the cistern: for by breaking off the tube at M within an eighth or a fourth part of an inch of the angle, the open end of the gage may be held perpendicular to the horizon when it is dipped into the mercury in the cistern, without obliging us to bring our finger or any other substance into contact with the mercury in the gage, which never fails to render the instrument imperfect. It is necessary to observe, that if the tube be 14 or 15 inches long, it will be impossible to boil it effectually for the experiments mentioned above in less than three or four hours, although Mr Brooke seems to prefer a much shorter time for the purpose; nor will it even then succeed, unless the greatest attention be paid that no bubbles of air lurk behind, which is frequently the case: but experience has taught how to guard pretty well against this disappointment, particularly by taking care that the tube be completely dry before the mercury is put into it; for if this caution be not observed, the instrument can never be made perfect. There is, however, one evil which it is sufficient to remedy; and that is, the introduction of air into the gage, owing to the unboiled mercury in the cistern: for when the gage has been a few times exhausted, the mercury which originally filled it becomes mixed with that into which it is inverted, and in consequence the vacuum is rendered less and less perfect, till at last the instrument is entirely spoiled.\n\nMr Cavallo's experiments were made with an excellent air-pump, which is described in the 73rd volume of the Philosophical Transactions.\n\nThe following is the result of Mr Cavallo's experiments as given by himself.\n\n\"From these experiments it appears, first, that in the same air-pump, which amounts to about one thousandth part of the same subject, both the electric light and the electric attraction, though very weak, are still observable; but, secondly, that the attraction and repulsion of electricity become weaker in proportion as the air is more rarefied, and in the same manner the intensity of the light is gradually diminished. Now, by reasoning on this analogy, we may conclude\n\n(v) By cementing the string of a guitar into one end of a thermometer tube, a spark may be obtained, as well as if the tube had been sealed hermetically.\nWhen an insulated conductor is thus presented to any other conductor, Signor Volta calls it a Conjugate Conductor.\n\nIn order to show by experiment the above-mentioned property or increase of capacity in a conductor, take the metal plate of an electrophorus, and holding it by its insulating handle in the air, electrify it so high, as that the index of an electrometer annexed to it might be elevated to $60^\\circ$; then lowering this metal plate by degrees towards a table or other conducting plain surface, you will observe that the index of the electrometer will fall gradually from $60^\\circ$ to $50^\\circ$, $40^\\circ$, $30^\\circ$, &c. Notwithstanding this appearance, the quantity of electricity in the plate remains the same, except the said plate be brought so near the table as to occasion a transmigration of the electricity from the former to the latter; at least the quantity of electricity will remain as much the same as the dampness of the air, &c. will permit. The decrease, therefore, of intensity is owing to the increased capacity of the plate, which is now conjugate, viz. opposed to another conducting surface. In proof of which, remove gradually the metal plate from the table, and it will be found that the electrometer rises again to its former elevation, namely to $60^\\circ$, excepting the loss of that quantity of electricity, which during the experiment must have been imparted to the air.\n\nThe two following experiments will throw more light upon the reciprocal action of the electric atmospheres. First, suppose two flat conductors, electrified both positively or both negatively, to be presented towards, and to be gradually brought near, each other; it will appear by two annexed electrometers, that the nearer those two conductors come to each other, the more their intensities will increase; which shows, that either of the two conjugate conductors has a much less capacity now, than when it was singly insulated, and out of the influence of the other.\n\nSecondly, let the preceding experiment be repeated, with this variation only, viz. that one of the flat conductors be electrified positively, and the other negatively; the effects then will be just the reverse of the preceding; viz. the intensities of their electricities will be diminished, because their capacities are increased, the nearer the conductors come to each other.\n\nLet us now apply the explanation of this last experiment to that of bringing an electrified metal plate towards an uninflated conducting plane; for as this plane acquires a contrary electricity by the vicinity of the electrified plate, it follows that the intensity of the electricity of the metal plate must be diminished, and in the same proportion its capacity is increased; consequently the metal plate in that case may receive a greater quantity of electricity.\n\nThis property may be rendered still more evident, by inflating the conducting plane whilst the electrified plate is very near it, and afterwards separating them; for then both the metal plate and the conducting plane (which may be called the inferior plane) will be found electrified, but poffelled of contrary electricities, as may be ascertained by electrometers.\n\nIf the inferior plane be inflated first, and then the electrified plate be brought over it, then the latter will cause an endeavour in the former to acquire a contrary electricity, which however the inflation prevents from taking place.\nPrinciples of taking place; hence the intensity of the electricity of Electricity the plate is not diminished, at least the electrometer will shew a very little and almost imperceptible depression, which is owing to the imperfection of the inflation of the inferior plane, and to the small rarefaction and condensation of the electric fluid, which may take place in different parts of the said inferior plane. But if in this situation the inferior plane be touched, so as to cut off the inflation for a moment, then it will immediately acquire the contrary electricity, and the intensity in the metal plate will be diminished.\n\nIf the inferior plane, instead of being insulated, were itself a non-conducting substance, then the same phenomena would happen, viz. the intensity of the electrified metal plate laid upon it would not be diminished. This, however, is not always the case; for if the said inferior non-conducting plane be very thin, and be laid upon a conductor, then the intensity of the electrified metal plate will be diminished, and its capacity will be increased by being laid upon the thin insulating stratum, because, in that case, the conducting substance which stands under the non-conducting stratum acquiring an electricity contrary to that of the metal plate, will diminish its intensity, &c., and the insulating stratum will only diminish the mutual action of the two atmospheres, more or less, according as it keeps them more or less alund.\n\nThe intensity or electric action of the metal plate, which diminishes gradually as it is brought nearer and nearer to a conducting plane not insulated, becomes almost nothing when the plate is nearly in contact with the plane, the compensation or accidental balance being then almost perfect; hence if the inferior plane only opposes a small resistance to the passage of the electricity (whether such resistance be occasioned by a thin electric stratum, or by the plane's imperfect conducting nature, as is the case with dry wood, marble, &c.), that resistance, and the interval, however small, that is between the two planes, cannot be overcome by the weak intensity of the electricity of the metal plate, which on that account will not dart any spark to the inferior plane (except its electricity were very powerful, or its edges not well rounded) and will rather retain its electricity; so that, being removed from the inferior plane, its electrometer will nearly recover its former height. Besides, the electrified plate may even come to touch the imperfectly conducting plane, and may remain in that situation for some time; in which case the intensity being reduced almost to nothing, the electricity will pass to the inferior plane exceedingly slowly.\n\nBut the case will not be the same, if, in performing the experiment, the electrified metal plate be made to touch the inferior plane edgewise; for then its intensity being greater than when laid flat, as it appears by the electrometer, the electricity easily overcomes the small resistance, and passes to the inferior plane, even across a thin electric stratum; because the electricity of one plane is balanced by that of the other, only in proportion to the quantity of surface which they oppose to each other within a given distance; whereby, when the metal plate touches the other plane in flat and ample contact, its electricity is not dissipated.\n\nHitherto we have considered in what manner the action of electric atmospheres must modify the electricity of the metal plate in various situations. We must now consider the effects which take place when the electricity is communicated to the metal plate whilst standing upon the imperfectly conducting plane; however, the explanation of this easily follows from what has been said above. Suppose, for instance, that a Leyden phial or a conductor were so weakly electrified, that the intensity of its electricity were only half a degree, or even less; if the metal plate, when standing upon the proper plane, were touched with that phial or conductor, it is evident that either of them would impart to it a quantity of its electricity, proportional to the plate's capacity, viz. so much of it as would make the intensity of the electricity of the plate equal to that of the electricity in the conductor or phial, supposed of half a degree; but the plate's capacity, now that it lies upon the proper plane, is above 100 times greater than if it stood insulated in the air; or, which is the same thing, it requires 100 times more electricity in order to shew the same intensity; therefore, in this case, it must acquire upwards of a hundred times more electricity from the phial or conductor. It naturally follows, that when the metal plate is afterwards removed from the proper plane, its capacity being lessened so as to remain equal to the hundredth part of what it was before, the intensity of its electricity must become of 50°; since, agreeably to the supposition, the intensity of the electricity in the phial or conductor was of half a degree.\n\nHaving premised thus much respecting the capacity of conductors, we shall now proceed to describe Signor Volta's method of rendering sensible minute degrees of electricity.\n\nHis method, in short, is to communicate the other-Description wife unobservable quantity of electricity to the metallic plate of an electrophorus, while standing on an imperfectly insulating plane; for the capacity of the metallic plate being thus augmented, it will acquire a much greater quantity of electricity than if it stood completely insulated in the air, and when it is again separated from the plane its capacity will be diminished; consequently, its electricity increasing at the same time, the intensity of this will be rendered manifest either by sparks or by means of a delicate electrometer.\n\nThe particulars necessary to be kept in view in this method, are the following. The metal plate must be at least five inches in diameter, with the edge well rounded, and having a varnished glass handle, or instead of the glass, three silk strings. The inferior plane must be of a very imperfect conducting nature, as dry marble, very dry and slightly varnished wood, a common piece of wood covered with oiled silk, or such like substance; but let the substance be what it will, its surface must be very smooth, and such as to coincide as well as possible with the surface of the metal plate; on which account, if a marble slab be chosen for the inferior plane, it will be proper to fit the metal plate to that of the iron, by grinding one against the other. What Mr Cavallo found to be very fit for this purpose was a paper drum, consisting of a common wooden hoop, such as are used for barrels, over which a piece of thick writing paper was pasted, and on the back of which he pasted a piece of tin-foil. The upper surface of the paper was varnished only once with shell-lac dissolved\nPrinciples of dissolved in alcohol or spirit of wine. This sort of plane has many advantages, viz., it is easily made, and from its lightness is very portable; its surface is perfectly flat, excepting when the hoop is not very strong, for then the contraction of the paper has power sufficient to warp it; and lastly, as the thickness of the paper and of the varnish may be varied at pleasure, and very easily, the plane may be rendered of any required degree of conducting power.\n\nHaving such a semi-conducting plane and metallic plate properly constructed, the former is to be laid upon a table, and the latter is to be placed upon it, taking care that the inferior plane be not excited by any degree of friction. If the surface of the inferior plane should have acquired any electricity by accidentally rubbing it, &c., the best way of freeing it of that electricity is to pass it two or three times over the flame of a candle. Now the metallic plate is to be struck five or six times with the corner of a dry handkerchief, a piece of dry flannel or paper, &c.; then it is to be raised from the inferior plane by means of its insulating handle, and presented to an electrometer, when it will be found sensibly electrified. If the metallic plate be struck while it is not in contact with the semi-conducting plane, it will be found either to possess no electricity or an incomparably smaller degree than it acquires in the other mode.\n\nBy this means electricity may be obtained from substances which could hardly be supposed electrified, and that not only in sufficient quantity to ascertain its quality, but even sufficient to afford sparks. Signor Volta has given to this apparatus the name of condensing apparatus.\n\nMr Cavallo, observing that in stroking the metallic plate, in order to obtain electricity from various substances, and especially from the hand, the plate was often moved so as to occasion some friction on the inferior plane, whereby this was excited, and consequently the result of the experiment rendered precarious, thought of the following method of preventing such motion.\n\nUpon a varnished glass handle he cemented a brass tube about six inches long and three-fourths of an inch in diameter, from the extremity of which proceeded a fine flexible wire about 14 inches long. Now, when the metallic plate was situated upon the inferior plane, he held the glass handle of the brass tube with his left hand, in such a manner that the end of the wire might touch the plate, the rest remaining in the air. Sometimes, in order to make a better contact, the end of the above-mentioned wire was put into a hole purposely made in the edge of the plate. In this disposition of the apparatus, the substances to be tried are stroked upon the brass tube, and the electricity produced by them is conveyed to the metallic plate by the wire, which being fine and flexible, communicates no motion to the plate.\n\nAnother improvement of Mr Cavallo's consists in rendering sensible degrees of electricity still more minute than those which may be discovered by the condensing apparatus.\n\nNotwithstanding the great sensibility of Volta's condenser, yet sometimes the electricity acquired by the metallic plate from some substances was so small as not to affect an electrometer sufficiently to ascertain its quality, or even its existence; hence it naturally occurred to Mr Cavallo, that for the same reason for which the principles of metallic plate of the condensing apparatus manifested such minute degrees of electricity as could not be otherwise observed, another smaller plate, or small condensing apparatus, might be employed to render the weak electricity of the large metallic plate sensible. Accordingly, he constructed a small plate of about the size of a shilling, having a glass handle covered with sealing-wax; and when the large metallic plate seemed to be so weakly electrified as not to affect an electrometer sensibly, he placed the small plate upon the inferior plane, and touched it with the edge of the large plate; then, after removing the small plate, he took up the small one from the plane, holding it by the extremity of the glass handle, and presented it to the electrometer, which was generally so much affected by it as to diverge to its utmost limits.\n\nIn this manner Mr Cavallo often obtained electricity more than sufficient for ascertaining its quality, from a single stroke of the corner of a handkerchief; viz., the large plate being placed upon the proper plane, was stroked once; then being removed and presented to an electrometer, it appeared not electrified; but by touching the small plate with the edge of it, that small plate acquired thereby electricity sufficient to make an electrometer diverge.\n\nWhen this secondary condensing apparatus is used, care must be taken to hold the large plate almost vertically while the small plate is touched by it. There is no need of having another inferior plane for the small plate, the large one being sufficient for both; for immediately after taking up the large plate, weakly electrified, with one hand, you lay down the small plate, &c.\n\nThe final quantity of electricity that can be discovered by this means is really surprising, and there is hardly any substance, excepting the metals, or those which cannot be subjected to trial, as water and other fluids, which will not produce some electricity when rubbed or stroked against the large plate of the condensing apparatus, and that electricity is afterwards condensed by being communicated to the small plate.\n\nThe discovery of Volta's condenser led to a discovery of the doubler, for which we were first indebted to the Reverend Abraham Bennet of Wirksworth, though the instrument has been much improved by Mr Nicholson and Mr Read.\n\nThe doubler in its first and simplest form consisted of three parts, which are represented at fig. 85, Plate CXCI. viz., a polished brass plate A, with an insulating handle fixed in its centre; a similar plate B with an insulating handle fixed in its periphery, and the cap of Bennet's gold-leaf electrometer C, which serves as a third plate. The two plates A and B are varnished on the under side, and the handles are made of mahogany fixed to the plates by means of glass nuts covered with sealing-wax.\n\nThe method of demonstrating the presence of manipulative electricity by means of this apparatus is as follows:\n\n1. Place B upon C, and communicate some electricity to the latter, while the plate B is touched with the finger. The consequence will be that C will receive a greater degree of electricity than it would have been capable of acquiring if B had not been present.\n\n2. Remove\n2. Remove the communication from C, and take the finger from off B, then raise this latter by its insulating handle, and B and C will exhibit the opposite states of electricity more strongly than when they are in contact.\n\n3. Place A upon B, and touch A with the finger. The consequence will be that A will receive a portion of electricity of a state opposite to that of B, or A will be in the same state of electricity with C.\n\n4. Place B upon C, and touch B with the finger as before, and at the same time apply A edgeways to C. In this situation, A will communicate the greatest part of its electricity to C.\n\n5. Remove A, take the finger from B, and raise B from C. The opposite states of electricity in B and C, will now be stronger than before, on account of the additional electricity afforded by A.\n\n6. Place A upon B again, as in the third stage of the process, and repeat the subsequent manipulations. In each of them the intensity of the electricity is supposed to be doubled, and by proceeding in this manner for a certain time, the electricity originally communicated to C, though at first too small to affect the strips of gold leaf, will at last become sufficiently sensible to produce a considerable divergence of them.\n\nThough the above process is sufficiently simple and evident, yet it requires to be learned, and takes up a certain time for its performance. It was therefore desirable that an instrument should be formed which might complete this series of operations by a very simple mechanical movement. The first instrument constructed with this view was contrived by Dr Darwin, and was shown to Mr Nicholson in the month of December 1787. This instrument consisted of four metallic plates, two of which were moveable by wheel-work into positions which required them to be touched by the hand in order to produce the effect. It appeared to Mr Nicholson that the whole operation, including the touching, might be done by a simple combination without wheel-work by the direct rotation of a winch. This was soon afterwards effected, and communicated by him to the Royal Society in 1788. Mr Nicholson's description of his revolving doubler, was first printed in the 7th volume of the Philosophical Transactions, and has been reprinted by Mr Nicholson in his Philosophical Journal for May 1800, from which we have copied it.\n\nFig. 86 represents the apparatus of the doubler supported on a glass pillar 6½ inches long. It consists of the following parts. Two fixed plates of brass, A and C, are separately insulated and disposed in the same plane, so that a revolving plate B may pass very near them, without touching. Each of these plates is two inches in diameter; and they have adjusting pieces behind, which serve to place them accurately in the required position. D is a brass ball, likewise of two inches diameter, fixed on the extremity of an axis that carries the plate B. Besides the more essential purpose this ball is intended to answer, it is loaded within on one side, that it serves as a counterpoise to the revolving plate, and enables the axis to remain at rest in any position. The other parts may be distinctly seen in fig. 87. The shaded parts represent metal, and the white represent varnished glass. ON is a brass axis, passing through the piece M, which last sustains the plates A and C. At one extremity is the ball D already mentioned; and the other is prolonged by the addition of a glass stick, which sustains the handle L and the piece GH separately insulated. E, F, are pins rising out of the fixed plates A and C, at unequal distances from the axis. The cross-piece GH, and the piece K, lie in one plane, and have their ends armed with small pieces of harpsichord-wire, that they may perfectly touch the pins EF in certain points of the revolution. There is likewise a pin I, in the piece M, which intercepts a small wire proceeding from the revolving plate B.\n\nThe touching wires are so adjusted, by bending, that when the revolving plate B is immediately opposite the fixed plate A, the cross-piece GH connects the two fixed plates, at the same time that the wire and pin at I form a communication between the revolving plate and the ball. On the other hand, when the revolving plate is immediately opposite the fixed plate C, the ball becomes connected with this last plate, by the touching of the piece K against F; the two plates, A and B, have then no connection with any part of the apparatus. In every other position the three plates and the ball will be perfectly unconnected with each other.\n\nMr Bennet and Mr Cavallo observed, soon after the discovery of the doubler, that it never fails to exhibit an electric state by the mere operation, without any communication of electricity being previously made. Mr Bennet endeavoured to find out a method of depriving the doubler of this inherent electricity, and after a number of trials, he considered the following as the best mode of answering this purpose.\n\nHe connected the plates A and C together by a wire hooked at each end upon two small knobs on the backs of the plates, the middle of the same wire touching the pillar which supports the doubler. Another wire was hooked at one end upon the back of the plate B, and at the other end, to the brass ball which counterbalances this plate. Thus all the plates were connected with the earth, and by turning the handle of the doubler, it might be discharged of electricity in every part of its revolution.\n\nAfter often trying this method of depriving the doubler, Mr Bennet observed that its spontaneous discharge was almost always negative. He then touched A and C with a positively charged bottle, and turned the doubler till it produced sparks for a long time together; and after this strong positive charge he hooked on the wires as above, and revolved the plate B about a hundred times, which so deprived the doubler of its positive electricity, that when the wires were taken off, it produced a negative charge at about the same number of revolutions which it required before.\n\nThe positively charged bottle was again applied, and the wires being hooked upon the plates as before, B was revolved only fifty times, yet this was found sufficient to deprive it of its positive charge, and in many experiments five or six revolutions were sufficient; but he never thought it safe to stop at so few, and therefore he generally turned the handle 40 or 50 times between every experiment.\n\nLeft electricity adhering to the electrometer should obstruct the above experiments, Mr Bennet did not let it stand in contact with the doubler during its revolutions,\nPrinciples of solutions, but touched the plate A with the cap of the Electricity electrometer, after he supposed its electricity was become sufficiently sensible; but left even this contact by experiment should communicate any electricity, he made a cap of shell lac for his electrometer, having a small thin tube in the centre, to which the gold leaf was suspended within the glass, and a bent wire was fixed to the top which might easily be joined to the plate A of the doubler, and thus the gold leaf was more perfectly inflated, and the electricity could not be diffused over so large a surface. The glass which inflates the plates and crofs piece of the doubler was also covered with shell lac.\n\nDr Robison conceived that Mr Bennet's original proposal for doubler might be freed from error as far as possible, by employing a thin stratum of air as the intermediate between the three plates. The method which he proposes for effecting this is very ingenious. Stick on one of the plates three very small spherules, made from a capillary tube of glass or from a thread of sealing-wax. The other plate being laid on them, rests on mere points, and can scarcely receive any friction, which may disturb the experiment.\n\nMr Cavallo, finding that Mr Bennet's mode of obviating the inconveniences of the doubler did not succeed with him, constructed a new instrument, which he calls a collector of electricity, and a description of which was inserted in the 78th volume of the Philosophical Transactions. It consists of a plate of tin, supported by two upright sticks of glass; on each side of which plate are two frames of wood covered with gilt paper, which do not touch the tin-plate, but stand parallel to it at a little distance. These frames are fastened to the platform of the instrument by hinges; so that if electricity be communicated to the plate, it will receive a large quantity without any considerable intensity, because its capacity is much augmented by the vicinity of the plane of gilt paper on each side. But if these planes be thrown back into the horizontal position, which is easily done by means of their hinges, the electricity, which before was compensated in the plate, will have its intensity greatly increased. An electrometer connected with this plate will therefore show signs of electricity by means of a communication made between a large stock of electricity, and the tin-plate in its first position, though the intensity of that stock may have been too small to have affected the electrometer without this contrivance.\n\nIt does not appear, in the author's description of this instrument, that it removes the equivocal effect of the doubler; for it is evident that it does not in its simple process enter the province of the doubler in which this effect takes place. The doubler requires six or seven turns before it will exhibit spontaneous electricity; at which period the first charge is magnified above twelve thousand times; but his simple instrument will scarcely exceed one hundred times, and therefore requires the electricity to be one hundred and twenty times as strong as that which causes the uncertainty of the doubler. Whence it may be inferred, that the doubler would have acted unequivocally with all such electricities as this instrument is capable of exhibiting.\n\nMr Cavallo has since constructed another instrument, which he calls a multiplier of electricity, and which he considers as quite free from equivocal results.\n\n\"The figs. 88. and 89. represent this new instrument, and they are about two-thirds of the real size. QRS is the bottom board, upon which are steadily fixed by experiment the glas sticks H, G, two flat brass plates A and C.—B is a similar brass plate supported by a glass stick I, which is cemented in a hole made in the wooden lever KL, which moves round a fleady pin K, that is screwed tight in the bottom board. By moving this lever backwards and forwards, the plate B may be alternately put in the two situations represented by the figures. N is a thick brass wire fixed tight into the bottom board. There is a fourth brass plate D, similar to the other three, which is supported not by glass, but a wire; and this wire is screwed fast to an oblong piece of brass FP, that slides in a groove made for the purpose in the bottom board QRS; so that by applying a finger's nail to the notch on the end F, the sliding piece FP may be drawn out either entirely or to a certain length, and of course the plate D will be removed to any required distance from the fixed plate C. I need not say anything particular respecting the sockets of those brass plates, they being clearly indicated in the figures, excepting only that the socket of the plate A reaches as high as the top of it, and serves to receive a wire, or other apparatus, on certain occasions.\n\nThe parts of this instrument are so adjusted, as that when the lever is in the situation of fig. 88, viz. is pushed as far toward Q as it can go, the plate B comes parallel to the plate A, and about one-twentieth of an inch distant. At the same time the extremity of the wire OM just touches the fixed wire N, and of course renders the plate B uninflated. But as soon as the lever begins to be moved towards S, the communication of the plate B with the wire N, or with the ground, becomes interrupted, and B remains uninflated. And when the lever has been moved as far as it can go towards S, the wire M comes in contact with the plate C, as shown in fig. 89. Then the two plates B and C communicate with each other, though they are otherwise uninflated. The fourth plate D being supported by a wire, communicates with the ground; and when the sliding piece PF is pushed home, it stands parallel to, and at about one-twentieth of an inch from the plate C.\n\nWhen the instrument is situated as in fig. 88, if an electrified body be brought into contact with the plate A, this plate will imbibe a great deal more of that electricity than it would otherwise, because its capacity is increased by the vicinity of the uninflated plate B, and therefore, if after the communication of that electricity, the plate B, by moving the lever, be removed from that situation, and A be made to touch an electrometer, this will be electrified more feebly by it, than it would have been by the contact of the original electrified body itself. So far the plate A acts like a condenser, or collector of electricity. But let us now consider the instrument as a multiplier.\n\nWhen the plate A has received a small quantity of electricity by the contact of any electrified body whatever, and that body is removed, the plate B being uninflated and opposed to the electrified plate A, will, like the metal plate of an electrophorus, acquire the contrary electricity, by either receiving from, or giving to, the ground some electric fluid, according as...\nPrinciples of the plate A happens to be electrified. Thus, suppose that A has been electrified positively, B will become negative, and vice versa. If now the lever be pulled towards S, the plate B will remain electrified negatively, the communication with the ground being cut off; and when B comes into the situation represented by fig. 4th, at which time the wire M touches the plate C, the negative electricity of B will go to C, because the capacity of C for holding electricity is considerably augmented by the vicinity of the uninflated plate D.\n\nIf after this the lever be moved back again to its first situation, B will be made negative a second time in the same manner as before: and by pushing the lever again towards S, that second charge of negative electricity will be communicated from B to C; and thus, by repeating the operation, which consists in merely moving the lever backwards and forwards, a considerable quantity of negative electricity will be accumulated upon C.\n\nIn fact, the action of this instrument resembles very much that of an electrophorus; for the plate A may represent the excited resinous plate, B may represent the metal plate of the electrophorus, and C is a kind of reservoir, into which the successive charges of the plate B are collected.—When a number of those charges or portions of electricity has been communicated to C, if the sliding piece FP be drawn out about an inch, and of course the plate D be removed to the like distance from the plate C, the capacity of the plate C will thereby be much diminished: and therefore if an electrometer be brought into contact with it, the electricity will be manifested: whereas the electricity originally communicated to the plate A, could not have affected an electrometer in any sensible degree.\n\nIn using this instrument, 30 or 40 additions of electricity are the utmost number practicable; for after that number the augmentation of the charge upon C will not go any farther; the limit of which is, when the charge of C is increased to such a degree, as to leave a portion of electricity upon B, equal to that portion which B can receive from the action of A.\n\nIn this case, let C touch an electrometer as mentioned above, and if the electrometer does not diverge, proceed to a second process; for though its pendulums do not diverge, yet some electricity remains in them, which must not be disturbed, as it will help the effect of the second operations, which is as follows: Push in the slider FP, and go on moving the lever backwards and forwards as before, by which means, after a certain number of additions, the plate C will acquire a second charge, about as high as the former: and if then the slider FP be pulled out, and C brought into contact with the same electrometer, the divergency of the pendulums, which before was either not at all or hardly perceptible, will thereby be rendered more conspicuous: and thus it may be increased still farther by a third and a fourth operation. But if, notwithstanding those repeated operations, the electrometer should be found not to diverge, the quantity of electricity may still be augmented by another method, which is, by communicating that little electricity of C to the plate A of another instrument of the same sort, and proceeding with that in the manner already described.*\n\n* Cavalli's Electricity, vol. iii.\n\nIn Nicholson's Journal for September 1804, is a paper by Mr W. Wilson, containing a description of an instrument which Mr Wilson calls a compound condenser of electricity, and which he considers as an improvement on Mr Cavalli's multiplier, answering the purpose of a condenser, a single and double multiplier, and a doubler. The instrument is very complicated, containing no less than five plates. Like all complicated instruments of this kind, it is of course subject to error from its own spontaneous electricity.\n\nMr Nicholson has constructed an instrument for Mr Nicholson's certaining final degrees of electricity, without, as he says, a possibility of equivocal result. This instrument he calls the spinning condenser, and it is thus described in his Journal for April 1797.\n\n\"Fig. 95 represents a vertical section of the instrument. A is a metallic vase, having a long steel axis which passes through a hole in the stand H at K, and rests on its pointed end in an adjustable socket at C. The use of the vase is, by its weight, to preserve, for a considerable time, the motion of spinning which is given by the finger and thumb applied to the nob at the top of the instrument. The flared parts D and E represent two circular plates of glass nearly 1½ inch in diameter. The upper plate is fixed to the vase, and revolves with it; the lower is fixed to the stand. In the lower plate are inserted two metallic hooks, diametrically opposite each other, at F and G. They are cemented into holes drilled in the edge of the glass, which is near two-tenths of an inch thick. In the upper plate are inserted in the same manner two small tails of the fine flattened wire used in making silver lace. These tails are bended down so as to strike the hooks in the revolution, but in all other positions they remain freely in the air without touching any part of the apparatus. At C is a screw, which by raising or lowering the vase keeps the faces of the glass plates from each other at whatever distance may be required. The faces of the glass plates which are opposed to each other are coated with segments of tin-foil, as represented, fig. 91 and 92, the latter of which represents the upper plate. Each of the tails communicates with the tin-foil coating to which it is contiguous, as does also the hook F with that coating of the lower plate nearest to it. But the hook G is entirely insulated from the whole apparatus, and is intended to communicate only with the electrified body or atmospheric conductor L. The lower coating nearest to G is made to communicate permanently with the stand H, and consequently with the earth.\n\nIn this situation, suppose the motion of spinning to be given to the apparatus, and the effects will be these: One of the tails will strike the hook G, by which means the upper coating annexed to that tail will assume the electric state of L by communication. But this state, on account of the proximity of the lower uninflated plate to which it is, at that instant, directly opposed, will be as much stronger than that of L, as a charge exceeds simple electrization. The tail G with its plate or coating proceeds onward, and after half a revolution arrives at the situation to touch the hook F. The upper coating, the lower on the side of F, the hook F itself, and the tail V, must then constitute one jointly inflated metallic mass, in which no charge subsists, but which is simply electrified by the whole charge received...\"\nAnd of this mass the surfaces of the plates themselves, constituting the electric well of Franklin, will throw out all their electricity to the hook and tail. But the coating and its tail instantly pals round, leaving F electrified, and proceed to bring another charge from G and deposit it as before. The balls at F are therefore very speedily made to diverge.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to remark, that the two upper coatings do nothing more than double the speed of the operation; one of the tails being employed in collecting, while the other is depositing; and that the gold-leaf electrometer may be advantageously substituted for the cork-balls.\n\nThe instrument I caused to be made was five inches high. The receiving side G was connected with a coated jar of four square feet coating, and the giving side F was connected with Bennet's gold-leaf electrometer. The electrometer was rendered as strongly positive as it was capable of being, and the jar was rendered negative, by giving it as much of that power as was produced by drawing a common stick of sealing-wax once through the hand. In this state the jar was incapable of attracting the finest thread. The vase was then made to spin; and the effect was, that the leaves of the electrometer first gradually collapsed, and then in the same manner gradually opened, and struck the sides of the glass of the electrometer with negative electricity. The experiment was renewed and repeated with every requisite variation.\"\n\nTo conclude, the methods of ascertaining minute degrees of electricity may be reduced to three.\n\n1. If the absolute quantity of electricity be small and pretty much condensed, as that produced by a small tourmaline when heated, or by a hair when rubbed, the only effectual method of manifesting its presence, and ascertaining its quality, is to communicate it to a very delicate electrometer, i.e., one that is very light and has no great extent of conducting surface.\n\n2. When we wish to ascertain the presence of a considerable quantity of electricity, which is dispersed, or expanded into a great space, and is little condensed, such as the constant electricity of the atmosphere in clear weather, or such as the electricity which remains in a large Leyden phial after the first or second discharge; this may be best ascertained by means of Cavallo's collector or multiplier, or by the condenser with Cavallo's improvement of the small plate.\n\n3. When the electricity to be ascertained is neither very considerable in quantity nor much condensed, such as the electricity of the hair of certain animals, of the surface of chocolate when cooling, &c. In this case the best method is to apply a metallic plate furnished with an inflating handle, such as one of the plates of the doubler, to the electrified body, and to touch the plate with a finger while it remains for some time in this situation; which done, the plate is to be removed and brought near a sensible electrometer; or its electricity may be communicated to the plate of a small condenser, by which it will be rendered more conspicuous. In this operation care must be taken not to bring the plate too near the body whose electricity is to be examined, lest the friction, likely to happen between the plate and the body, should produce some electricity, the origin of which might be attributed to some other cause.\n\nMr Nicholson, in his Journal for September 1797, proposes what appears to be a valuable improvement in Bennet's electrometer.\n\n\"There are, (says he) two particulars in which this excellent instrument appears capable of improvement: the first, to render it portable, without danger to the Bennet's gold-leaf, and the second to express its various degrees of electrization by a scale of divisions.\n\nI have reflected much on the probable means of securing the gold-leaf from fracture by carriage, but hitherto with little prospect of success. There was some hope that a single flip of this gold might be preserved in a fleath or box, with its sides very nearly in contact; but when I placed such a flip upon a gilded piece of wood of the same superficial dimensions, to which it was fastened at one end, its flexibility was such that the leaf very readily slid along the surface of the wood, and became full of folds, by inclining the fastened end a very few degrees lower than the other extremity. There was still left immediate expectation that the flips could be actually and repeatedly confined between two leaves or cushions, as in the book of the gold-beaters, without their being broke by continual agitation. To this, however, my attention will probably be directed when I may again resume this object. In the mean time, I recommend it to other philosophers, as a very desirable improvement in the mineralogical apparatus, and should rejoice to be anticipated by their successful researches.\n\nThe weight of one flip of gold-leaf, in the electrometer of Bennet, is about 1/600th part of a grain; but this, as well as the sensibility of the instrument, must vary, not only from the figure and dimensions of the piece, but the nature and thickness of the gold itself. It seemed, therefore, unnecessary to endeavour to render two of these instruments comparable with each other.\n\nAll that could be done was, to distinguish the different intensities as thrown by the divergencies of the leaf; or, as I have taken it, the distances at which they strike a pair of uninflated metallic bars. In Plate CXLIII, fig. 93. A represents the inflated metallic cap, from which, at C, depend the two narrow pointed flips of gold-leaf. BB is the glass shade, which serves to support the cap, and defend the leaves from the motion of the surrounding air. DD are two flat radii of braids, which open and shut by means of one common axis, like a pair of compasses. By a contrivance of springs, they are disposed to open when left at liberty; but the micrometer screw E serves to draw a nut, which has two steel bars, with a claw at the end of each, that enters into a correspondent slit, in two small cylindrical pieces, to which the radii are fixed respectively. This apparatus is seen in another position in fig. 94. KL represents a piece of braids, which serves as the frame for the work, and fits the lower socket of the electrometer, FF, fig. 3. In this the letters IH indicate the cylindrical pieces which carry the radii, and are seen from beneath. On the side of the nut G, one of the steel drawing pieces is seen; the other being on the opposite side, and consequently not visible. Towards L appear the two reaction springs. The other parts require no verbal description.\"\nIn the common construction of the gold-leaf electrometer, there are two pieces of tin-foil pasted on opposite parts of the internal surface of BB; against which the gold-leaf strikes when its electricity is at the maximum. If the radii DD be left at the greatest opening, our instrument does not then differ from that in common use. But if the divergence produced by the contact of an atmospheric conductor, or any other source of electricity, be so small as to render it doubtful whether the leaves be electrified or not, the radii may then be brought very gradually together by means of the screw, until the increased divergency from their attractive force be sufficient to ascertain the kind of electricity possessed by the leaves. In this and all other cases, the division on the micrometer head, which stands opposite the fixed index, at the time the leaves strike the radii, will shew the greater or less degree of intensity.\n\nIn his Journal for January 1799, he has the following remarks on the glass case of this instrument.\n\n\"Under all the uncertainties concerning the place occupied by the electric charge of coated glasses, though it may seem unfair to make any inference respecting glasses which is uncoated, yet, upon the whole, there appears to be a probability that the interposition of naked glasses may impede the action of electrified bodies. This question more immediately points at the tube in which the gold-leaf electrometer of Bennet is inclosed. To determine whether the tube of the electrometer does affect the electric state of the included leaf, either by compensation or otherwise, I took a piece of window-glass eighteen inches long, two inches wide and one-twentieth of an inch thick, which I cleaned very well, and then passed it several times through the hot air over the flame of a candle. In this state one end of the glass was laid gently upon the electrified plate of Bennet's electrometer, and then suddenly raised by a turn of the wrist. It was scarcely possible to discern that the leaves were at all affected; but when the electrometer was in the plus state a very slight collapson was produced by raising the glass, and the contrary effect was produced when the electrometer was negative. Some days afterwards the experiment was repeated, after the gold-leaf had been changed for other pieces, which were very pointed and delicate in their movements. The result was, that the glass was always shewn by the electrometer to be in a weak positive state; and, when the electricity of the electrometer was made plus, the collapson was equal to the divergence when it was minus.\n\nIn making these experiments I had previously supposed that the influence of the metallic state of the electrometer would produce somewhat of the nature of a charge upon the glass; and consequently that the intensity of the leaves would have been diminished during the existence of that charge; and also, that in such a case the action of the metal through the glass would be subject to the same diminution as in the series of jars. But as the glass did not appear to act in this manner, it seems proper to conclude that clean glass does not affect the electric state of bodies by its vicinity, and that the divergence of the balls or the gold-leaf in the electrometers of Cavallo and Bennet is not diminished by the tube which surrounds them.\n\nFrom a variety of experiments it was clearly ascertained that the metallic coatings, though by their vicinity they may diminish the intensity of the electric state in the leaves, do nevertheless increase the angle of divergence by their attraction.\n\nWhen the gold-leaf electrometer is made with a very small tube, its sensibility is somewhat increased by the nearness of the coatings; but the chance of rendering it unserviceable from casual friction, which excites the glass, and causes the gold-leaf to stick to it, together with the less perfect view of the divergence through a tube of small curvature, afford reasons why a diameter of less than an inch should be rejected. Other reasons of convenience indicate that the diameter of the glass should not much exceed this quantity.\n\nI was once induced to think that the considerable magnitude of the cap of Bennet's electrometer might render it less capable of being acted upon by small quantities of electricity. Experiment did not however give much countenance to this supposition. By trials with heads of different size, the smallest were found to be rather more sensible to extremely minute electricities, and less so to such as were greater. The influence of very weak electricity may produce the opposite state in the whole of a small head, but only in part of a larger; the remaining part of this last assuming the opposite state, and robbing the leaves of part of their intensity. But in higher electricities the whole of the large head may be urged to give electricity to the leaves, in a quantity which the smaller head could not give without acquiring a higher degree of intensity, and consequently more strongly resisting the desired process. It appears therefore that the maximum of effect with a given electricity, acting without communication, will not be obtained but by a head of a definite figure and magnitude.\"\n\nIn No. 82, experiment 5, we described a method of imitating the planetary motions by the motion communicated by the current of air from electrified points; this imitation may be done in various other ways, of which we shall only add the following.\n\n1. From the prime conductor of an electric machine suspend six concentric hoops of metals at different distances from one another, in such a manner as to represent in some measure the proportional distances of the planets. Under these, and at the distance of about half an inch, place a metallic plate, and upon this plate, within each of the hoops, a glass bubble blown very thin and light. On electrifying the hoops, the bubbles will be immediately attracted by them, and will continue to move round the hoops as long as the electrification continues. If the electricity is very strong, the bubbles will frequently be driven off, run hither and thither on the plate, making a variety of surprising motions round their axis; after which they will return to the hoop, and circulate as before; and if the room is darkened, they will all appear beautifully illuminated with electric light.\n\n2. Provide a ball of cork about three quarters of an inch in diameter, hollowed out in the internal part by cutting it in two hemispheres, scooping out the inside, and then joining them together with paste. Having attached this to a silk thread between three and four feet in length, suspend it in such a manner that it may\nPrinciples of may just touch the knob of an electric jar, the outside of which communicates with the ground. On the first contact it will be repelled to a considerable distance, and after making several vibrations will remain stationary; but if a candle is placed at some distance behind it, so that the ball may be between it and the bottle, the ball will instantly begin to move, and will turn round the knob of the jar, moving in a kind of ellipse as long as there is any electricity in the bottle. This experiment is very striking, though the motions are far from being regular; but it is remarkable that they always affect the elliptical rather than the circular form.\n\nIn the table of conductors we have placed flame, smoke, and the vapour of hot water. That these vapours are conductors may be shewn by the following experiments.\n\n**Exper. 1.**—Bring the knobs of two metallic discharging rods, communicating the one with the outside, and the other with the inside of a charged phial, opposite each other, each within an inch of the flame of a candle, so that the flame may be in the middle between them. The flame will be seen to spread on each side towards the knobs, and will produce the discharge of the jar.\n\nMr Cuthbertson has proposed a method of distinguishing positive from negative electricity by the flame of a candle. He places the flame of a candle exactly in the middle between two metallic balls at the distance of four inches from each other, so that the centre of the flame is in a line with that of the balls. The balls are about three-fourths of an inch in diameter, and communicate by insulated wires, the one with the positive and the other with the negative conductor. If the machine be then put in motion, the flame will waver very much, but will seem to incline rather to the negative than the positive ball. After turning the machine for about 50 revolutions (if the glass be a plate of two feet diameter), the negative ball will begin to grow warm, while the positive still remains cold. After 200 revolutions, the negative ball will become too hot to be touched, while the positive will continue as cold as at first.*\n\n* Nicholson's Journal, Nov. 1802.\n\nA charged phial may be gradually discharged by passing it for some time backwards and forwards through the flame of a large candle, so that the flame may act alternately on the knob and the outside coating.\n\n**Exper. 2.**—Suspend a cork-ball electrometer about four or five feet above the prime conductor of an electrical machine; then turn the winch very gently, and it will be found that the balls do not diverge. Now place a green wax taper just blown out in the prime conductor, so that its smoke may ascend towards the balls, and these will diverge a little with the same degree of motion communicated to the machine.\n\nThe same effect, but in a less degree, will be produced if, instead of the taper, a vessel of hot water is placed below the balls, thus shewing that steam is a conductor, though inferior to smoke in its conducting power.\n\nThese experiments are by Mr Henly, and are among several others related by him in the 64th volume of the Philosophical Transactions. His reason for employing a green taper, was, that on account of the verdigris which it contained, it occasioned much smoke with little heat.\n\nIt has been remarked in the Introduction, that glass, though one of the most perfect electrics when cold, becomes a conductor when heated red hot. This is proved by the following experiment, which also shews that other electrics change their nature when heated.\n\nTake a small glass tube of about one-twentieth of an inch in diameter, and above a foot long; close it at one end, and introduce a wire into it, so that it may be extended through its whole length: let two or three inches of this wire project above the open end of the tube, and there fasten it with a bit of cork; tie round the closed end of the tube another wire, which will be separated from the wire within the tube only by the glass interposed between them. In these circumstances endeavour to send a shock through the two wires; i.e. the wire inserted in the glass tube, and that tied on its outside, by connecting one of them with the outside, and touching the other with the knob of a charged jar, and you will find that the discharge cannot be made, unless the tube be broken; because the circuit is interrupted by the glass at the end of the tube, which is interposed between the two wires. But put that end of the tube to which the wire is tied into the fire, so that it may become just red hot, then endeavour to discharge the jar again through the wires, and you will find that the explosion will be easily transmitted from wire to wire, through the substance of the glass, which, by being made red hot, is become a conductor.\n\nIn order to ascertain the conducting quality of hot resinous substances, oils, &c. bend a glass tube in the form of an arch CEF, fig. 95, and tie a silk string GCD to it, which serves to hold it by when it is to be set near the fire; fill the middle part of this tube with rosin, sealing-wax, &c. then introduce two wires, AE, BF, through its ends, so that they may touch the rosin, or penetrate a little way in it. This done, let a person hold the tube over a clear fire, so as to melt the rosin within it; at the same time, by connecting one of the wires, A or B, with the outside of a charged jar, and touching the other with the knob of the jar, endeavour to make the discharge through the rosin, and you will observe that, while the rosin is cold, no shocks can be transmitted through it; but it becomes a conductor according as it melts, and when totally melted, the shocks will pass through it very freely.\n\nThe electric power of glass may also be destroyed by reducing the glass to powder. This was ascertained by other electrics when powdered become conductors.\n\nM. Willeke, and Dr Priestley; but it has been most satisfactorily proved by M. Van Swinden, in the following experiments.\n\n**Exper. 1.**—He covered a cake of white iron with powdered glass, so as to form a cake about an inch thick, a foot long, and eight inches broad, and he placed above this cake, another plate of iron so as to form a coating. He then attempted to charge this coated plate, but without success; he could produce no shock.\n\n**Exper. 2.**—Supposing that the conducting power of the glass in the above experiment might arise from some humidity which it had contracted, he dried it in a crucible, and repeated the experiment. In this case, it appeared slightly electric, so long as the machine was worked,\nELECTRICITY.\n\nPrinciples of Electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nExper. 3.—Into a jar, coated on the outside, he put a quantity of powdered glass, and having furnished it in other respects like a Leyden phial, he proceeded to examine whether it would receive a charge. He found that it could be completely charged, a proof that the powdered glass acted the part of a conductor.\n\nBy similar experiments M. Van Swinden found that flowers of sulphur acted as a conductor though more imperfectly than powdered glass.\n\nSoon after the discovery of the Leyden phial and shock produced by it, it became a desirable object with electricians to ascertain how far the shock might be conveyed, and how long a time would be required to convey it to any considerable distance.\n\nThe French philosophers were the first to appear in this field, but they did little more than excite the English to go far beyond them in these great undertakings. A circuit was made by the former of 900 toises, consisting of men holding iron wires betwixt each two, through which the electric shock was sensibly felt. At another time they made the shock pass through a wire two thousand toises in length, that is, near a Paris league, or about two English miles and a half; though part of the wires dragged upon wet grass, went over chasms, hedges, or palisades and over ground newly ploughed up. Into another chain they took the water of the basin in the Tuileries, the surface of which was about an acre, and the phial was discharged through it.\n\nMr Monnier the younger, endeavoured to determine the velocity of the electric power; and for this purpose made the shock pass through an iron wire of 950 toises in length, but he could not observe that it spent a quarter of a second in passing it. He also found, that when a wire of 1319 feet, with its extremities brought near together, was electrified, that the electricity ceased at one end the moment it was taken off at the other.\n\nBut all these attempts of the French would scarcely have deserved to be mentioned, but that they preceded the greater, the more numerous, and more accurate experiments of the English. The names of the English gentlemen, animated with a truly philosophical spirit, and who were indefatigable in this business, deserve to be transmitted to posterity.\n\nThe principal agent in this scene was Dr Watson. He planned and directed all the operations, and never failed to be present at every experiment. His chief assistants were Martin Folkes, Esq., president of the Royal Society, Lord Charles Cavendish, Dr Bevis, Mr Graham, Dr Birch, Mr Peter Daval, Mr Trembley, Mr Elliot, Mr Robins, and Mr Short. Many other persons, and some of distinction, gave their attendance occasionally.\n\nDr Watson, who wrote the history of their proceedings, in order to lay them before the Royal Society, begins by observing (what was verified in all their experiments) that the electric shock is not, strictly speaking, conducted in the shortest manner possible, unless the bodies through which it passes, conduct equally well; for that, if they conduct unequally, the circuit is always formed through the best conductors, though the length of it be ever so great.\n\nThe first attempt these gentlemen made, was to convey the electric shock across the river Thames, making use of the water of the river for one part of the chain of communication. This they accomplished on the 14th and 18th of July of 1747, by fastening a wire all along Westminster bridge, at a considerable height above the water. One end of this wire communicated with the coating of a charged phial, the other being held by an observer, who in his other hand held an iron rod, which he dipped into the river. On the opposite side of the river stood a gentleman who likewise dipped an iron rod in the river with one hand, and in the other held a wire, the extremity of which might be brought into contact with the wire of the phial.\n\nUpon making the discharge, the shock was felt by the observers on both sides of the river, but more sensibly by those who were stationed on the same side with the machine; part of the electric fire having gone from the wire down the moist stones of the bridge, thereby making several shorter circuits to the phial, but still all passing through the gentlemen who were stationed on the same side with the machine. This was, in a manner demonstrated by some persons feeling a sensible shock in their arms and feet, who only happened to touch the wire at the time of one of the discharges, when they were standing upon wet steps which led to the river.\n\nUpon this and the subsequent occasions, the gentlemen made use of wires, in preference to chains, for this reason among other reasons, that the electricity which was conducted by chains, was not so strong as that conducted by wires. This, as they well observed, was occasioned by the junctures of the links not being sufficiently close, as appeared by the flashing and snapping at every juncture, where there was the least separation. These lesser snappings being numerous in the whole length of a chain, very sensibly lessened the great discharge at the prime conductor.\n\nTheir next attempt was to force the electrical shock to make a circuit of two miles, at the New-river at Stoke Newington. This they performed on the 24th of July 1747, at two places; at one of which, the distance by land was 800 feet, and by water 2000; in the other the distance by land was 2800 feet, and by water 8000. The disposition of the apparatus was similar to what they before used at Westminster bridge, and the effect answered their utmost expectations. But, as in both cases, the observers at both extremities of the chain, which terminated in the water, felt the shock, as well when they stood with their rods fixed into the earth 20 feet from the water, as when they were put into the river; it occasioned a doubt, whether the shock was formed through the windings of the river, or a much shorter way by the ground of the meadow; for the experiment plainly showed, that the meadow ground, with the grass on it, conducted the electricity very well.\n\nBy subsequent experiments, they were fully convinced, that the electricity had not in this case been conveyed by the water of the river, which was two miles in length, but by land, where the distance was only one mile; in which space, however, the electric power must necessarily have passed over the New-river twice, have gone through several gravel pits, and a large stubble field.\n\n† p. 360.\nOn the 28th of July they repeated the experiment at the same place, with the following variation of circumstances. The iron wire was, in its whole length, supported by dry sticks, and the observers stood upon original electrics; the effect of which was, that they felt the shock much more sensibly than when the conducting wire had lain upon the ground, and when the observers had stood likewise upon the ground, as in the former experiment.\n\nAfterwards, everything remaining as before, the observers were directed, instead of dipping their rods into the water, to put them into the ground, each 150 feet from the water. They were both smartly struck, though they were distant from each other above 500 feet.\n\nThe same gentlemen, pleased with the success of their former experiments, undertook another, the object of which was to determine, whether the electric power could be conveyed through dry ground; and at the same time to carry it through water to a greater distance than they had done before. For this purpose they pitched upon Highbury-barn, beyond Illington, where they carried it into execution on the 5th of August 1747. They chose a station for their machine almost equally distant from two other stations for observers, upon the New-river, which were somewhat more than a mile asunder by land, and two miles by water. They had found the streets of London, when dry, to conduct very strongly, for about 40 yards; and the dry road at Newington about the same distance. The event of this trial answered their expectations. The electric fire made the circuit of the water when both the wires and the observers were supported on original electrics, and the rods dipped into the river. They also both felt the shock, when one of the observers was placed in a dry gravelly pit, about 300 yards nearer the machine than the former station, and 100 yards distant from the river; from which the gentlemen were satisfied, that the dry gravelly ground had conducted the electricity as strongly as water.\n\nThe last attempt of this kind which these gentlemen made, and which required all their sagacity and address in the conduct of it, was to try whether the electric shock was perceptible at twice the distance to which they had before carried it, in ground perfectly dry, and where no water was near, and also to distinguish, if possible, the comparative velocity of electricity, and of found.\n\nFor this purpose they fixed upon Shooter's-hill, and made their first experiment on the 14th of August 1747, a time, when, as it happened, but one shower of rain had fallen during five preceding weeks. The wire communicating with the iron rod, which made the discharge, was 6732 feet in length, and was supported all the way upon baked sticks; as was also the wire which communicated with the coating of the phial, which was 3868 feet long, and the observers were distant from each other two miles. The result of the explosion demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the gentlemen present, that the circuit performed by the electricity was four miles, viz., two miles of wire, and two of dry ground, the space between the extremities of the wires, a distance, which, without trial, as they justly observed, was too great to be credited. A gun was discharged at the instant of the explosion, and the observers had stop watches in their hands, to note the moment when they felt the shock; but as far as they could distinguish, the time in which the electric power performed that vast circuit was instantaneous.\n\nIn all the explosions where the circuit was made of any considerable length, it was observed, that though the phial was very well charged, yet that the snap at the gun-barrel made by the explosion was not near so loud as when the circuit was formed in a room; so that a bystander, says Dr Watson, would not imagine, from seeing the flash and hearing the report, that the stroke, at the extremity of the conducting wire, would have been considerable, the contrary of which, when the wires were properly managed, he says, always happened.\n\nStill the gentlemen, unrestrained in these pursuits, were desirous of ascertaining, if possible, the absolute velocity of electricity though a certain space; because, though in the last experiment, the time of its progress was certainly very small, they were desirous of knowing, small as that time might be, whether it was measurable, and Dr Watson had contrived an excellent method for that purpose.\n\nAccordingly, on the 5th of August 1748, the gentlemen met for the last time, at Shooter's-hill; when it was agreed to make an electric circuit of two miles, by several turnings of the wire, in the same field. The middle of this circuit they contrived to be in the same room with the machine, where an observer took in each hand one of the extremities of the wires, each of which was a mile in length. In this excellent disposition of the apparatus, in which the time between the explosion and the shock could be observed with the greatest exactness, the phial was discharged several times; but the observer always felt himself shocked at the very instant of making the explosion. Upon this the gentlemen were fully satisfied, that through the whole length of this wire, which was 12,276 feet in length, the velocity of the electric power was instantaneous.\n\nWe have noticed the increased evaporation from liquids by means of electricity. The following experiment, which is commonly exhibited by lecturers on electricity, is usually considered of the same kind.\n\nStick a small piece of sealing-wax on the end of a wire, and set fire to it. Then put an electrical machine in motion, and present the wax just blown out at the distance of some inches from the prime conductor. A number of extremely fine filaments will immediately dart from the sealing wax to the conductor, on which they will be condensed into a kind of net-work, resembling wool.\n\nIf the wire with the sealing-wax be stuck into one of the holes of the conductor, and a piece of paper be presented at a moderate distance to the wax, just after it has been ignited, on setting the machine in motion, a network of wax will be formed on the paper. The same effect, but in a slighter degree, will be produced, if the paper be briskly rubbed with a piece of elastic gum, and the melting sealing-wax be held pretty near the paper immediately after rubbing.\n\nIf the paper thus painted, as it were, with sealing-wax, be gently warmed by holding the back of it to the fire, the wax will adhere to it, and the result of the experiment will thus be rendered permanent.\n\nA beautiful experiment of the same nature is made\nElectricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nTo make camphor flow into ramifications.\n\nCurious experiment of Professor Lichtenberg.\n\nThe electrophorus, that is, a plate of some resinous substance, as sulphur, rosin, gum-lac, &c., is first excited, either by rubbing or otherwise; then a piece of metal of any shape, at pleasure, as for instance, a three-legged compass, a piece of brass tube, or the like, is set upon the electrophorus, and to this piece of metal, so placed, a spark is given, of the electricity contrary to that of the plate; this done, the piece of metal is removed, by means of a stick of sealing-wax or other electric, and some powder of rosin, kept in a linen bag, is shaken upon the electrophorus; this powder will be found to fall about those points upon the plate, which the piece of metal touched, forming some radiated appearances, much like the common representations of flares; at the same time, upon the greatest part of the plate, that is, besides those flares, there is hardly any powder at all. Now, it is to be remarked, that if the plate be excited negatively, and the spark given to the metal set upon it is positive, the appearance will be as above described; but if, on the contrary, the plate is positive and the spark is negative, then the powder of rosin will be found to fall upon those parts of the plate which in the other case is left uncovered, and to leave the flares clean; in short, it will do just the reverse of what it did in the other case; or, in other words, the powder of rosin will be attracted by those parts only of the electrophorus which are electrified positively.\n\nThe configurations produced in the above experiment of M. Lichtenberg appeared to curious that they were soon imitated by various electricians, particularly by Mr Cavallo and the Reverend Abraham Benney, inventor of the doubler. The directions given by this last gentleman are as follows.\n\nTo make red figures, take a pound of rasped Brazil wood; put it into a kettle with as much water as will cover it, or rather more; also put in about an ounce of gum arabic and a lump of alum about as big as a large nut; let it boil about two hours, or till the water is strongly coloured; strain off the extract into a broad dish, and set it in an iron oven, where it is to remain till all the water be evaporated, which with me was effected in about twelve hours; but this depends on the heat of the oven, which should not be so hot as to endanger its burning. Sometimes I have boiled the strained extract till it was considerably infusified before it was placed in the oven, that it might be sooner dry.\n\nWhen it is quite dry but not burnt, scrape it out of the dish, and grind it in a mortar till it be finely pulverized. In doing this, it is proper to cover the mortar with a cloth, having a hole through to prevent the powder from flying away and offending the nose, and also to do it out of doors if the weather be dry and calm, that the air may carry away the powder necessarily escaping, and which otherwise is very disagreeable.\n\nWhen ground fine, let it be sifted through muslin or a fine hair-sieve, returning the coarser part into the mortar to be ground again. When the grinding and sifting are finished, the powder is ready for use. The resinous plate I have mostly used was composed of five pounds of rosin, half a pound of bees-wax, and two ounces of lamp-black, melted together, and poured upon a board fifteen inches square, with ribs upon the edges at least half an inch high, to confine the composition whilst fluid; thus the resinous plate was half an inch thick, which is better than a thinner plate, the figures being more distinct. After the composition is cold, it will be found covered with small blisters, which may be taken out by holding the plate before the fire, till the surface be melted, then let it cool again, and upon holding it a second time to the fire, more blisters will appear; but by thus repeatedly heating and cooling the surface, it will at last become perfectly smooth. Some plates were made smaller, and the resinous composition confined to the form of an ellipse, a circle, or escutcheon, by a rim of tin half an inch broad, and fixed upon a board.\n\nThe next thing to be done is to prepare the paper, which is to be softened in water, either by laying the pieces upon each other in a vessel of cold water, or first pouring a little hot water upon the bottom of a large dish, then laying upon it a piece of paper, so that one edge of the paper may lie over the edge of the dish, to remain dry; that it may afterwards be more conveniently taken up. Then pour more hot water upon its upper surface. Upon this place another piece in the same manner, again pouring on more water, and thus proceed till all the pieces are laid in. By using hot water, the paper will be more softened in a few minutes than if it remains in cold water a whole day.\n\nWhen the figures are to be made, the resinous plate must lie horizontally, whilst the electricity is communicated, if the experiment requires anything to be placed upon the plate; but it is convenient afterwards to hang it up in a vertical position whilst the powder is projected, lest too much powder should fall where it is not required.\n\nA little of the powder may be taken between a finger and thumb, and projected by drawing it over a brush; or, which is better, a quantity of powder may be put into the bellows and blown towards the plate. When the figure is sufficiently covered with powder, let the plate be again laid horizontally upon a table; then take one of the softened papers out of the water by its dry edge, and lay it carefully between the leaves of a book, pressing the book together, and let it lie in this situation about half a minute. Then remove the paper to a dry place in the book, and press it again about the same time, which will generally be sufficient to take off the superfluous moisture. Then take up the paper by the two corners of its dry edge, and place the wet edge a little beyond the figure on the resinous plate, lowering the rest of the piece gradually till it covers the figure without sliding; then lay over it a piece of clean dry paper, and press it gently; let it remain a short time, and then rub it closer to the plate with a cloth, or, which is better, press it down by means of a wooden roller covered with cloth, taking care that the paper be not moved from its first position. When the paper is sufficiently pressed, let it be taken up by its dry\nPrinciples of dry edge, and laid upon the surface of a vessel of water Electricity with the printed side downwards; by this means the illustrated superfluous powder will sink in the water, and the by experiment figure will not be so liable afterwards to spread in the paper. After the paper has remained on the water during a few minutes, take it up and place it between the leaves of a book, removing it frequently to a dry place. If it be desired that the paper should be speedily dry, let the book-leaves in which it is to be placed be previously warmed, and by removing it to several places it will be dry much sooner than by holding it near a fire, and without drawing the paper crooked.\n\nBy the above process, it is obvious, that leather, calico, or linen, as well as paper, may be printed with these figures, and the effects of the diffusion of electricity upon a refrinous plate be exhibited to those who have not leisure or inclination to perform the experiments.\n\nThe figures represented in Plate CXCII. were formed much after Mr Bennet's method.\n\nThe apparatus used for making them consisted only of a common Leyden phial, and a plate of glass 15 inches square, covered on one side with a varnish of gum-lac dissolved in spirit of wine, and several times laid over. The other side is covered with tin-foil laid on with common paste. When it is to be used, the glass plate is put upon a metallic stand, with the tin-foil side laid undermost; the phial is to be charged, and the knob drawn over the varnished side. Thus any kind of figure may be drawn, or letters made, as represented in the plate; and from every figure beautiful ramifications will proceed, longer or shorter according to the strength of the charge. On some occasions, however, the charge may be too strong, particularly where we wish to represent letters, so that the whole will be blended into one confused mass. The round figures are formed by placing metallic rings or plates upon the electrical plate; and then giving them a spark from the electrified bottle, or sending a shock through them. The figures may be rendered permanent by blowing off the loose chalk, and clapping on a piece of black-sized paper upon them; or if they are wanted of another colour, they may easily be obtained by means of lake, vermilion, rose-pink, or any of the ordinary colours ground very fine. The easiest way of applying them seems to be by a barber's puff bellows.\n\nWe shall conclude this part of our article with noticing the effects produced by electricity on magnetic needles.\n\nThese may be stated in the following proposition.\n\nAn electric shock communicates a magnetic power to needles, and frequently reverses or destroys that polarity.\n\nBy electricity Dr Franklin frequently gave polarity to needles and reversed them at pleasure. A shock from four large jars, sent through a fine sewing needle, he says, gave it polarity, so that it would traverse when laid on water. What is most remarkable in these electrical experiments upon magnets is, that if the needle, when it was struck, lay east and west, the end which was entered by the electric blast pointed north; but that if it lay north and south, the end which lay to wards the north would continue to point north, whether the fire entered at that end or the contrary; though he imagined that a stronger stroke would have reversed the poles even in that situation, an effect which had been known to have been produced by lightning. He also observed, that the polarity was strongest when the needle was struck lying north and south, and weakest when it lay east and west. He takes notice that, in these experiments the needle, in some cases, would be finely blued like the spring of a watch, by the electric flame; in which case, the colour given by a flash from two jars only might be wiped off, but that a flash from four jars fixed it, and frequently melted the needles.\n\nThe jars which the doctor used held seven or eight gallons, and were coated and lined with tin-foil.\n\nDr Van Marum made several experiments on communicating polarity to needles with his very powerful machine. He and his coadjutor tried to give polarity to needles made of watch springs from three to five inches in length, and likewise to steel bars nine inches long, from a quarter of an inch to half an inch broad, and about a line in thickness. The result was, that when the bar or needle was placed horizontally in the magnetic meridian, whichever way the shock entered, the end of the bar that stood toward the north acquired the north polarity, or the power of turning towards the north when freely suspended, and the opposite end acquired the south. If the bar, before it received the shock, had some polarity, and was placed with its poles contrary to the usual direction, then its natural polarity was always diminished, and often reversed; so that the extremity of it, which in receiving the shock looked towards the north, became the north pole, &c.\n\nWhen the bar or needle was struck standing perpendicularly, its lowest end became the north pole in any case, even when the bar had some magnetism before, and was placed with the south pole downwards. Ceteris paribus, the bars seemed to acquire an equal degree of magnetic power, whether they were struck whilst standing horizontally in the magnetic meridian, or perpendicular to the horizon.\n\nWhen the bar or needle was placed in the magnetic equator, whichever way the shock entered, it never gave it any magnetism; but if the shock was given through its width, then the needle acquired a considerable degree of magnetism, and the end which lay towards the west became the north pole, and the other end the south pole.\n\nIf a needle or bar, already magnetic, or a real magnet, was struck in any direction, its power was always diminished. For this experiment, they tried considerably large bars, one being 7.08 inches long, 0.26 broad, and 0.05 thick.\n\nWhen the shock was so strong in proportion to the size of the needle, as to render it hot, then the needle generally acquired no magnetism at all, or very little.\n\nThese experiments were made with the extraordinary power of a battery composed of 135 phials, containing among them about 130 square feet of coated surface.\nPART IV.\n\nTHEORY OF ELECTRICITY.\n\nCHAP. I. A Concise View of the Principal Theories of Electricity.\n\nSECT. I. Of the Theories of Electricity before the Time of Franklin.\n\nThe first electricians supposed, that electrical attraction was performed by means of unctuous effluvia emitted by the excited electric. These were supposed to attach themselves to all bodies, and to carry back with them those which were not too heavy. For in that age of philosophy all effluvia were supposed to return to the body from which they had been emitted, since no person could otherwise account for the substance not being sensibly wasted by the constant emission. When these light bodies, on which the unctuous effluvia had fastened, had arrived again at the excited electric, a fresh emission of the effluvia was supposed to carry them back again. But this effect of the effluvia was not thought of till electrical repulsion had been sufficiently observed.\n\nWhen the Newtonian philosophy had made some progress, and the extreme subtilty of light, and other effluvia of bodies, was demonstrated, so that philosophers were under no apprehension of bodies being wasted by continual emission, the doctrine of the return of effluvia was universally given up, as being no longer necessary; and they were obliged to acquiesce in the unknown doctrines of attraction and repulsion, as natural properties of certain bodies, the unknown cause of which they scarcely attempted to explain.\n\nEarly in the 18th century, M. du Faye discovered that there were two states of electricity, or, as he supposed, two different kinds of electricity, produced when different electrics were excited. \"Chance (says he) has thrown in my way a principle, which calls a new light upon the subject of electricity. The principle is, that there are two distinct kinds of electricity, very different from one another; one of which I call vitreous, the other resinous electricity. The first is that of glass, rock crystal, precious stones, hairs of animals, wool, and many other bodies. The second is that of amber, copal, gum-lac, silk, thread, paper, and a vast number of other substances. The characteristics of these two electricities are, that they repel themselves, and attract each other. Thus a body possessed of the vitreous electricity, repels all other bodies possessed of the vitreous, and on the contrary, attracts all those possessed of the resinous electricity. The resinous also repels the resinous, and attracts the vitreous. From this principle one may easily deduce the explanation of a great number of other phenomena; and it is probable that this truth will lead us to the discovery of many other things.\"\n\nThis discovery of M. du Faye was the origin of a theory of electricity, which is commonly called the theory of two fluids, and which we shall presently consider more at length.\n\nHitherto attraction and repulsion were the only electrical phenomena which had been observed; and to the explanation of these, the above general theories appeared sufficiently competent. But when electricity began to show itself in a greater variety of appearances, and to make itself sensible to the smell, the sight, the touch and the hearing; when bodies were not only attracted and repelled, but made to emit strong sparks of fire, attended with a considerable noise, a painful sensation, and a strong phosphorical smell, electricians were obliged to make their systems more complex, in proportion as the facts accumulated. It was then generally supposed that the electric power, which now began to assume the name of the electric fluid, was the same with the chemical principle of fire; though some thought it was a fluid sui generis, which very much resembled that of fire; and others, with M. Boulanger at their head, thought that the electric fluid was nothing more than the finer parts of the atmosphere, which crowded upon the surfaces of electric bodies, when the grosser parts had been driven away by the friction of the rubber.\n\nDuring this time, it was imagined, that the electric matter was produced from the electric body by friction; but by a discovery of Dr Watson's, it became evident to universally believed, that the glass globes and tubes, came from fevered only to set the fluid in motion, and by no means the earth, to produce it. He was led to this discovery by observing, that, upon rubbing the glass tube, while he was standing upon cakes of wax or rosin (in order, as he expected, to prevent any discharge of the electric matter upon the floor), the power was, contrary to his expectation, so much lessened, that no snapping could be observed upon another person's touching any part of his body; but that, if a person not electrified held his hand near the tube while it was rubbed, the snapping was very sensible. The event was the same when the globe was whirled in similar circumstances. For, if the man who turned the wheel, and who, together with the machine, was suspended upon silk, touched the floor with one foot, the electric fire appeared upon the conductor; but if he kept himself free from any communication with the floor, little or no fire was produced.—He observed, that only a spark or two would appear between his hand and the insulated machine, unless he at the same time formed a communication between the conductor and the floor; but that then there was a constant and copious flow of the electric matter observed between them. From these, and some other experiments of a similar kind, the Doctor discovered what he called the complete circulation of the electric matter. When he found, that, by cutting off the communication of the glass globe with the floor, all electric operations were stopped, he concluded, that the electric fluid was conveyed from the floor to the rubber,\nTheory of rubber, and from thence to the globe. For the same reason, feeling the rubber, or the man who had a communication with it, gave no sparks but when the conductor was connected with the floor, he as naturally concluded, that the globe was supplied from the conductor, as he had before concluded that it was supplied from the rubber. From all this he was at last led to form a new theory of electricity, namely, that, in electric operations, there was both an afflux of electric matter to the globe and the conductor, and likewise an efflux of the same electric matter from them. Finding that a piece of leaf silver was suspended between a plate electrified by the conductor, and another communicating with the floor, he reasons from it in the following manner: \"No body can be suspended in equilibrium but by the joint action of two different directions of power; so here the blast of electric ether from the floor setting through it, drives the silver towards the plate electrified. We find from hence, likewise, that the draught of electric ether from the floor is always in proportion to the quantity thrown by the globe over the gun barrel (the prime conductor at that time made use of), or the equilibrium by which the silver is suspended could not be maintained.\" Some time after, however, the Doctor retracted this opinion concerning the afflux and efflux, and supposed that all the electric phenomena might be accounted for from the excess or diminution of the quantity of electric matter contained in different bodies. This is the theory that was more fully explained by Franklin. It has been disputed whether Dr Watson or Franklin were the original contriver of this theory. It is possible that Watson may have formed the idea independently of Franklin; but certainly to this latter able and acute philosopher is due the merit of having framed and applied the hypothesis of positive and negative electricity, which, with some modification has been since almost universally adopted.\n\nOne great difficulty with which the first electricians were embarrassed, was to ascertain the direction of the fluid. At first, all electric powers, as we have already observed, were supposed to reside in the excited globe or glass tube. The electric spark therefore was imagined to proceed from the electrified body towards any conductor that was presented to it. It was never imagined that there could be any difference in this respect, whether it was amber, glass, sealing wax, or anything else that was excited. This progress of the electric matter was thought to be quite evident to the senses; and therefore the observation of electric appearances at an insulated rubber occasioned the greatest astonishment.—In this case, the current could not be supposed to flow both from the rubber and the conductor, and yet the first appearances were the same. To provide a supply of the electric matter, therefore, philosophers were obliged to suppose, that notwithstanding appearances were in both cases much the same, the electric fluid was really emitted in one case by the electrified body, and received by it in the other. But now being obliged to give up the evidence from sight for the manner of its progress, they were at a loss, whether, in the usual method of electrifying by excited glass, the fluid proceeded from the rubber to the conductor, or from the conductor to the rubber. It was, however, soon found, that the electricity at the rubber was the reverse of that at the conductor, and in all respects the same with that which had before been produced by the friction of sealing wax, sulphur, rosin, &c. Seeing, therefore, that both the electricities were produced at the same time, by one and the same electric, and by the same friction, all philosophers were naturally led to conclude, that both were modifications of one fluid; though in what manner that fluid was modified throughout the immense variety of electric phenomena, was a matter not easy to be determined.\n\nOn this subject the Abbé Nollet adopted the doctrine of afflux and efflux already mentioned. He supposed, that, in all electrical operations, the fluid is thrown into two opposite motions; that the afflux of this matter drives all light bodies before it by impulse upon the electrified body, and its efflux carries them back again. He was, however, very much embarrassed in accounting for facts where both these currents must be considered; as in the quick alternate attraction and repulsion of light bodies by an excited glass tube, or other excited electric. To obviate this difficulty, he supposes that every excited electric, and likewise every body to which electricity is communicated, has two orders of pores, one for the emission of the effluvia, and another for the reception of them. M. de Tour improved upon Nollet's hypothesis, and supposed that there is a difference between the affluent and effluent current; and that the particles of the fluid are thrown into vibrations of different qualities, which makes one of these currents more copious than the other, according as sulphur or glass is used. It is impossible, however, that suppositions so very arbitrary could be at all satisfactory, or received as proper explanations of the electric phenomena.\n\nAbout this time the Leyden phial was discovered; and the extraordinary effects of it rendered the inquiries into the nature of the electric fluid much more general than before. It would be tedious, and indeed impossible, to give an account of all the theories which were now invented. One of the most remarkable was that of Mr Wilson. According to this gentleman, the Mr Wilson's chief agent in all the operations of electricity, is Sir Isaac Newton's ether; which is more or less dense in all bodies in proportion to the smallness of their pores, except that it is much denser in sulphureous and unctuous bodies. To this ether are ascribed the principal phenomena of attraction and repulsion: the light, the sulphureous or rather phosphorescent smell with which violent electricity is always attended, and other sensible qualities, are ascribed to the groser particles of bodies driven from them by the forcible action of this ether. He also endeavours to explain many electrical phenomena by means of a subtile medium at the surface of all bodies; which is the cause of the refraction and reflection of the rays of light, and also refits the entrance and exit of this ether. This medium, he says, extends to a small distance from the body, and is of the same nature with what is called the electric fluid. On the surface of conductors this medium is rare, and easily admits the passage of the electric fluid; whereas, on the surface of electrics, it is dense and resists it. The same medium is rarefied by heat, which thus changes conductors into non-conductors. By far the greater number of philosophers, however, rejected the opinion of Mr Wilson; and as they neither chose to allow the electric fluid to be fire nor ether, they were obliged to own...\nAccording to this theory, all the operations of electricity depend upon one fluid *sui generis*, extremely subtle and elastic. Between the particles of this fluid there subsists a very strong repulsion with regard to each other, and as strong an attraction with regard to other matter. Thus, according to Dr Franklin's hypothesis, one quantity of electric matter will repel another quantity of the same, but will attract and be attracted by any terrestrial matter that happens to be near it. The pores of all bodies are supposed to be full of this subtle fluid; and when its equilibrium is not disturbed, that is, when there is in any body neither more nor less than its natural share, or than that quantity which it is capable of retaining by its own attraction, the fluid does not manifest itself to our senses. The action of the rubber upon an electric disturbs this equilibrium, occasioning a deficiency of the fluid in one place, and a redundancy of it in another. This equilibrium being forcibly disturbed, the mutual repulsion of the particles of the fluid is necessarily exerted to restore it.\n\nIf two bodies be both of them overcharged, the electric atmospheres repel each other, and both the bodies recede from one another to places where the fluid is less dense. For as there is supposed to be a mutual attraction between all bodies and the electric fluid, such bodies as are electrified must go along with their atmospheres. If both the bodies are exhausted of their natural share of this fluid, they are both attracted by the denser fluid existing either in the atmosphere contiguous to them, or in other neighbouring bodies; which occasions them still to recede from one another as if they were overcharged.\n\nThis is the Franklinian doctrine concerning the cause of electric attraction and repulsion; but it is evident, that the reason just now given why bodies negatively attracted ought to repel one another, is by no means satisfactory. Dr Franklin himself had framed his hypothesis before he knew that bodies negatively electrified would repel one another; and when he came afterwards to learn it, he was surprised, and acknowledged that he could not satisfactorily account for it. Other philosophers therefore invented different solutions of this difficulty, of which that above mentioned is one. But by some this was rejected. They said, that as the denser electric fluid, surrounding two bodies negatively electrified, acts equally on all sides of those bodies, it cannot occasion their repulsion. The repulsion, according to them, is owing rather to an accumulation of the electric on the surfaces of the two bodies; which accumulation is produced by the attraction, and the difficulty the fluid finds in entering them. This difficulty is supposed chiefly to be owing to the air on the surface of bodies, which Dr Priestley says is probably a little condensed there. This he deduces from an experiment of Mr Wilson, corrected by Mr Canton. The experiment was made in order to observe the course of the electric light through a Torricellian tube. A singular appearance of light was observed upon the surface of the quicksilver, at which the fluid was supposed to enter. Mr Wilson supposed that this was owing to a subtile medium spread over the surface of the quicksilver, and which prevented the easy entrance of the electric fluid. But this was afterwards discovered by Mr Canton to be owing to a small quantity of air which had been left in the tube. It is plain, however, that as the attraction is equal all round, and likewise the difficulty with which the fluid penetrates the air, bodies negatively electrified ought not to repel one another on this supposition more than the former. Nay, they ought to attract each other; because, in the place of contact, the resistance of the air would be taken off, and the electric fluid could come from all other quarters by the attraction of the bodies.\n\nThis theory is evidently no solution of the difficulty; seeing it is only explaining one fact by another, which requires explanation at least as much as the first. We shall see hereafter how this difficulty may be explained.\n\nWhat gave the greatest reputation to Dr Franklin's theory, was the easy solution which it afforded of the phenomena of the Leyden phial. The fluid is supposed to move with the greatest ease in bodies which are conductors, but with extreme difficulty in *electric per se* Leyden phials, which glass is absolutely impermeable to it. It is moreover supposed, that all electrics, and particularly glass, on account of the smallness of their pores, do at all times contain an exceeding great, and always an equal quantity of this fluid; so that no more can be thrown into any one part of any electric substance, except the same quantity go out at another, and the gain be exactly equal to the loss. These things being previously supposed, the phenomena of charging and discharging a plate of glass admit of an easy solution. In the usual manner of electrifying by a smooth glass globe, all the electric matter is supplied by the rubber from all the bodies which communicate with it. If it be made to communicate with nothing but one of the coatings of a plate of glass, while the conductor communicates with the other, that side of the glass which communicates with the rubber must necessarily be exhausted in order to supply the conductor, which must convey the whole of it to the side with which it communicates. By this operation, therefore, the electric fluid becomes almost entirely exhausted on one side of the plate, while it is as much accumulated on the other; and the discharge is made by the electric fluid rushing, as soon as an opportunity is given it by means of proper conductors, from the side which was overloaded to that which is exhausted.\n\nIt is not, however, necessary to this theory, that the very same individual particles of electric matter which were thrown upon one side of the plate, should make the whole circuit of the intervening conductors, especially in very great distances, so as actually to arrive at the exhausted side. It may be sufficient to suppose, that the additional quantity of fluid displaces and occupies the space of an equal portion of the natural quantity of fluid belonging to those conductors in the circuit which lay contiguous to the charged side of the glass. This displaced fluid may drive forwards an equal quantity of the same matter in the next conductor; and thus the progress may continue till the exhausted side of the glass is supplied by the fluid naturally.\nTheory of rally existing in the conductors contiguous to it. In Electricity, this case, the motion of the electric fluid, in an explosion, will rather resemble the vibration of the air in founds, than a current of it in winds.\n\nIt will soon be acknowledged (says Dr Priestley), that while the substance of the glass is supposed to contain as much as it can possibly hold of the electric fluid, no part of it can be forced into one of the sides, without obliging an equal quantity to quit the other side; but it may be thought a difficulty upon this hypothesis, that one of the sides of a glass plate cannot be exhausted, without the other receiving more than its natural share; particularly, as the particles of this fluid are supposed to be repulsive of one another. But it must be considered, that the attraction of the glass is sufficient to retain even the large quantity of electric fluid which is natural to it, against all attempts to withdraw it, unless that eager attraction can be satisfied by the admission of an equal quantity from some other quarter. When this opportunity of a supply is given, by connecting one of the coatings with the rubber, and the other with the conductor, the two attempts to introduce more of the fluids into one of the sides are made, in a manner, at the same instant. The action of the rubber tends to disturb the equilibrium of the fluid in the glass; and no sooner has a spark quitted one of the sides, to go to the rubber, than it is supplied by the conductor on the other; and the difficulty with which these additional particles move in the substance of the glass, effectually prevents its reaching the opposite exhausted side. It is not said, however, but that either side of the glass may give or receive a small quantity of the electric fluid, without altering the quantity of the opposite side. It is only a very considerable part of the charge that is meant, when one side is said to be filled while the other is exhausted.\n\nIt is a little remarkable, adds Dr Priestley, that the electric fluid, in this and in every other hypothesis, should so much resemble the ether of Sir Isaac Newton in some respects, and yet differ from it so essentially in others. The electric fluid is supposed to be, like ether, extremely subtle and elastic, that is, repulsive of itself; but instead of being, like the ether, repelled by all other matter, it is strongly attracted by it; so that, far from being, like the ether, rarer in the small than in the large pores of bodies, rarer within the bodies than at their surfaces, and rarer at their surfaces than at any distance from them; it must be denser in small than in large pores, denser within the substance of bodies than at their surfaces, and denser at their surfaces than at a distance from them.\n\nTo account for the attraction of light bodies, and other electrical appearances, in air of the same density with the common atmosphere, when glass (which is supposed to be impermeable to electricity) is interposed; it is conceived, that the addition or subtraction of the electric fluid, by the action of the excited electric on one side of the glass, occasions, as in the experiment of the Leyden phial, a subtraction or addition of the fluid on the opposite side. The state of the fluid, therefore, on the opposite side being altered, all light bodies within the sphere of its action must be affected in the very same manner as if the effluvia of the excited electric had actually penetrated the glass, according to the opinions of all electricians before Dr Franklin.\n\nThis hypothesis has been greatly improved by M. Æpinus of St Peterburgh, and by the Hon. Henry Cavendish; and we shall now proceed to an illustration of the theory as given by these gentlemen.\n\nTheory of Æpinus.\n\nElectrical phenomena are produced by a fluid of a peculiar nature, which we call the Electric Fluid, which has the following properties.\n\n1. Its particles repel each other with a force increasing as the distances decrease.\n\n2. Its particles attract the particles of all other matter with a force increasing as the distances decrease, and this attraction is mutual.\n\n3. The Electric Fluid by reason of its extreme subtlety is capable of penetrating other bodies, but all bodies are not penetrated by it with equal facility. In those bodies which we call non-electrics, such as metals and water, it moves very readily; but in those bodies which have been called electrics per se, such as glass, &c., it either does not move at all, or moves with great difficulty.\n\n4. Every body has a certain quantity of electric fluid which is proper to it, and may therefore be called its natural quantity: this quantity is proportional to the mass.\n\n5. We say that a body is electrified positively when the quantity of electric fluid which it has in any way received is greater than its natural quantity; and when that quantity is less than its natural quantity, we say that the body is electrified negatively.\n\n6. The phenomena which depend on the action of the electric fluid may be reduced to two classes; the first comprehending the cases in which the fluid removes from one body into another which has less of it; the other those in which the bodies containing the fluid are in motion, so as to approach or recede from each other, or so as to attract and repel each other.\n\nSuch is the hypothesis of M. Æpinus; let us now inquire what consequences may be drawn from it.\n\nLet us suppose a body to contain a certain quantity of the electric fluid, and let us examine the state of a particle of the fluid, as P, near the surface of the body. There is a mutual attraction between the particle P, and the particles of matter in the body; and there is a mutual repulsion between it and the other particles of electric fluid in the body. The whole attracting force may be equal or unequal to the whole repulsive force. If they be equal, P is in equilibrium, and has no tendency to motion.\n\nNow let us suppose the body to have received a quantity of fluid over and above its natural quantity; i.e., let the body be electrified positively. As, while the body was in its natural state, the attractive and repulsive forces were in equilibrium, the increase of fluid will augment the repulsive force, which will now exceed the attractive force, and the particle P will be repelled towards that surface to which it is nearest, till it at length quits the body. The repulsive power will continue to act upon other particles, which will be successively pushed nearer the surface, so as to produce a constant efflux of the fluid till the equilibrium is re-established,\nLet us now conceive that the body has lost a quantity of electric fluid, or that it is electrified negatively. The repulsive force of the fluid upon the particle P will then be less than the attractive force of the matter contained in the body or the same particle, this attraction will begin to act, and the particle will move nearer the centre. The attraction continuing to act, particles near the surface, and those of contiguous bodies will successively move towards the centre of the body; or a continual influx of fluid will take place till the equilibrium is restored.\n\n**Definition.**—When a body contains its natural quantity of electric fluid, we shall say that it is saturated.\n\nIt will be convenient for us to have general expressions for these several states of a body, in order to estimate the forces.\n\nLet Q represent the natural quantity of fluid,\n\n\\(a\\) the attractive force of the other matter in the body, which we shall hereafter call simply the matter,\n\n\\(r\\) the repulsive force of the fluid; and\n\n\\(f\\) the redundant or deficient fluid.\n\nThen in the case in which a body is saturated, \\(a = r\\) will represent the degree of force with which the particle P is attracted; and \\(r - a\\) the force with which it is repelled. But here \\(a = r\\); consequently \\(a = r\\) and \\(r - a = 0\\).\n\nBut let the quantity \\(f\\) be added to Q, and uniformly distributed through the body; the fluid will now be \\(Q + f\\). As we must admit the repulsive force to be proportional to the quantity of fluid, we shall have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Q}{Q} : \\frac{Q + f}{Q} = \\frac{r}{Q} : \\frac{fr}{Q}, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad r + \\frac{fr}{Q}.\n\\]\n\nThis quantity will represent the force with which P is repelled by the whole fluid of the body. But it is also attracted by the matter of the body, with the force \\(a\\); the whole force exerted on P will therefore be \\(a - r - \\frac{fr}{Q}\\); but \\(a - r = 0\\): the whole action exerted on P is therefore \\(\\frac{fr}{Q}\\), or the force with which the particle P is repelled, is \\(\\frac{fr}{Q}\\).\n\nTo conceive this more readily, we are to remember that when the quantity of fluid \\(= Q\\), P is in equilibrium; it will therefore be necessary only to consider the action of the superabundant fluid \\(f\\). Then to find the repulsive force of this, we say \\(Q : f = r : \\frac{fr}{Q}\\) as before; but to this we must affix the sign —, as we must consider repulsive forces as negative, and attractive as positive. The particle P then being repelled with this force \\(\\frac{fr}{Q}\\), it will quit the body unless it be opposed by some obstacle, and the repelling force continuing to act on other particles, an efflux of fluid will be produced.\n\nThe force \\(\\frac{fr}{Q}\\) will however be continually diminishing, but will not entirely cease till \\(f = 0\\).\n\nNow let the quantity of fluid \\(f\\) be subtracted from\nTheory of Electricity. There will now be a continual efflux of fluid from the conductor towards the cushion, and the conductor will, in its turn, be electrified negatively. In this case, if we present a fine metallic point to the conductor, there will issue from the point a luminous pencil, which is produced by the efflux of fluid from the point to the conductor, in order to restore the equilibrium.\n\nWe have hitherto considered the fluid as uniformly diffused through the body. But it will often happen that there will be a redundancy of fluid in one part of the body, while there is at the same time a deficiency in another part. In order to simplify our formula, we shall suppose the body BC (fig. 96) divided into two equal parts, AB, AC, and that the fluid in AB exceeds its natural quantity, while that in AC is less than the same quantity, the proportion of the fluid acquired on one side to that lost on the other being variable at pleasure. Let us examine the situation of two particles P, p, placed towards the two extremities.\n\nLet Q represent the quantity of fluid necessary for the saturation of AB or AC,\na = the attraction of the whole matter in AB for the particle P or p,\nr = the repulsion of the whole fluid uniformly distributed in AB on the same particle,\nr' = the repulsion of an equal quantity of fluid in AC on the same particle,\nf = the quantity of redundant fluid in AB,\ng = the deficient quantity in AC.\n\nNow the force by which the particle P or p is attracted by the matter of BC when saturated, will be \\( \\frac{a-r-r'}{Q} \\), which when the body is in its natural state will be equal to \\( \\frac{a}{Q} \\). But AB contains the redundant fluid \\( f \\), and AC the deficient fluid \\( g \\). The whole action exerted must therefore be \\( \\frac{(Q-f)\\times r}{Q} - \\frac{(Q-g)\\times r'}{Q} \\). But \\( a-r-r'=0 \\); therefore the whole action is \\( \\frac{gr'-fr}{Q} \\), or rather, since \\( r \\) is greater than \\( r' \\), \\( \\frac{fr-gr'}{Q} \\), which will represent the force by which the particle P is repelled. In the same manner, \\( \\frac{gr-fr'}{Q} \\) will represent the force by which \\( p \\) is attracted.\n\nNow, let us suppose a particle \\( p' \\) in the middle of the body BC; while the body is saturated, it will be in equilibrium; but as the one half of the body AB contains the redundant fluid \\( f \\), and the half AC the deficient fluid \\( g \\), the particle \\( p' \\) will be repelled in the direction AC by the force \\( \\frac{fr}{Q} \\). But it is repelled in the direction AB by the force \\( \\frac{gr}{Q} \\); therefore the whole repulsive force by which it is impelled in the direction AC will be \\( \\frac{fr+gr}{Q} \\), or \\( \\frac{f+g\\times r}{Q} \\).\n\nFrom what we have said above, it appears that so will be prolonged as there is a redundancy of fluid in AB, and a deficiency in AC, the redundant fluid has a tendency there to flow from A to C; and if the body be a perfect conductor, or such as is permeable to the fluid, its state cannot be permanent till the fluid is uniformly distributed between the two halves, unless it is acted on by some external force. But in a non-conductor, or perfect electric, this state may subsist, and it will be continued for a longer or shorter time, in proportion as the electric be more or less perfect.\n\nIf we had supposed the part AC to be overcharged, instead of AB, P would have been repelled with a stronger force, which would be represented by \\( \\frac{f\\times r+r'}{Q} \\), which is evidently greater than \\( \\frac{fr-gr'}{Q} \\), the repulsive force in the first case. The particle \\( p \\) is also less attracted than before, when AB is undercharged instead of AC.\n\nThe above remarks will equally apply to the case of two conducting bodies AB and CD, fig. 98, separated by an electric, Z.\n\nIt is proper to observe that the quantities \\( f \\) and \\( g \\), were indefinite in the above reasoning. Their value may be such that the tendency to influx or efflux may cease, or may be reversed; for supposing \\( gr'-fr=0 \\), or \\( g : f = r : r' \\); and we shall have \\( \\frac{fr}{r'} \\). In this case the attraction of the redundant matter balances the repulsion of the redundant fluid, and P is neither attracted nor repelled. Hence we have this important fact, that a body may be neutral, even where it is redundant or deficient.\n\nWhen one extremity of the body is thus rendered inactive, the state of the other extremity is changed.\n\nTo find this state we must put \\( \\frac{fr}{r'} \\) in place of its equal \\( g \\), in the formula \\( \\frac{gr-fr'}{Q} \\); and we shall have \\( \\frac{f\\times(r^2-r'^2)}{Qr} \\).\n\nAgain the forces may be so balanced, that there shall be no tendency to influx at C, fig. 96. Make \\( g = \\frac{fr}{r'} \\), which expresses the action at C. The action at B, the other end, will be obtained by putting \\( \\frac{fr}{r'} \\) in place of \\( g \\) in the formula \\( \\frac{fr-gr'}{Q} \\) as before, and the result \\( \\frac{f\\times(r^2-r'^2)}{Qr} \\), will express the repelling force at B.\n\nIn order, the better to conceive the relative effects in each of the above cases, we must observe that the repulsion of the part AB on the particle P must increase in proportion as the quantity of additional fluid acquired by AB is greater. On the other hand the attraction of the part AC for the same particle will increase according as the quantity of fluid subtracted from AC is greater. Now, as we have supposed the quantities of fluid in the two parts variable, we may suppose a case to happen, in which, for instance, the quantity lost by AC may be such that the excess of its attraction on P thence resulting, may exactly counterbalance the diminished attraction arising from its great distance, compared to the repulsion of the part AB on the same\nTheory of same particle. In this case, P will remain immovable.\n\nIf, on the contrary, the quantity of fluid lost by AC be not sufficient to compensate for the greater distance, the repulsion of AB will prevail over the attraction of AC, and the particle P will quit the body.\n\nThe particle ρ will also undergo certain changes in these different cases. If the particle P remain immovable, for instance, the particle ρ will have a progressive motion towards the body A, since this is near the part AC of which the attractive force in this case exceeds the repulsive force of AB. If the particle P has already a tendency towards the body A, the particle ρ will for a still stronger reason be attracted towards A.\n\nIn general, according to the different degrees of force exerted by the two parts of the body, it will happen that the fluid will be attracted and repelled on both sides by turns, or it will be attracted on one side, while it is repelled on the other, and v. v., or lastly, it may remain immovable on one side, while it is attracted or repelled on the other.\n\nIf we suppose that the redundancy of fluid in AB is exactly equal to the deficiency in AC, then the particle ρ will have a tendency to penetrate the body A, while the particle P will be repelled by it.\n\nTo prove this, let us suppose that the parts AB, AC act by turns on the particle ρ placed at a determinate distance; and let us conceive the repulsive force of the part AB to be concentrated in a determinate point, while the attractive force of the part AC must be supposed concentrated in a corresponding point on the other side. For, whatever be the law, in proportion to the distance which the repulsion of the particles of the electric fluid follows; the attraction of the particles of matter in the electrified body ought to follow the same law: since, without this, there could be no counterpoise between the attraction and repulsion of the particles in the natural state of the body. It follows then, that the attraction exerted by AC upon the particle ρ must be equal, in the present case, to the repulsion of AB on the same particle. Since, on one side, the particle is repelled by AB by reason of the excess of fluid in that part, and on the other it is attracted by AC by reason of the quantity of matter in that part, and which is proportional to the quantity of fluid which is supposed to have passed into AB. In the present case, therefore, where the particle ρ is nearer to AC than to AB, the attraction will prevail over the repulsion, and the particle will penetrate to AB, and pass through it to the body A.\n\nIn the same manner we might prove that the particle P would be repelled from A.\n\nThe equilibrium between the forces of the parts AB, AC being disturbed, it is clear that there will be an attempt to restore it, so that a portion of the redundant fluid in AB will pass into AC, till the body be brought back to its natural state. The return to this state will be more or less slow, according as the body is a more or less perfect electric; but if it is a conductor the fluid will pervade it in an instant, and an equal distribution will immediately take place.\n\nIt has been stated that the fluid does not move with equal facility through all bodies, but that in moving through electrics it meets with more or less resistance. Theory of Electricity. It will be proper, before we proceed farther, to consider the nature of this resistance. It may either arise solely from the inertia of the particles of the fluid, which is the case in a perfect fluid; or it may resemble the resistance opposed by a parcel of grain to the descent of small shot through it, or the resistance of a plastic or ductile body, such as clay or lead, to the motion of a body through its pores. In the first case, any inequality of force, however small, is capable of producing a uniform distribution of the fluid, or at least such a distribution as will make the excess of the mutual attractions and repulsions equal to the degree of external force by which an unequal distribution may be kept up. But in the two last cases, before a particle of fluid can change its place, it must overcome the tenacity of the adjoining particles of the body, and consequently, when an unequal distribution has been produced by an external force, it will not be rendered equable by a removal or alteration of that force, but there will remain such an inequality of distribution, as will cause the want of equilibrium between the attractions and repulsions to be counterbalanced by the tenacity of the body.\n\nFrom the different states of the particles P, ρ, as described in the above cases, we may conclude, that, during the return of a body to its natural state, the readiness with which the fluid flows from AB into AC must depend much on the nature of the surrounding bodies, and the greater or less facility with which these are pervaded by the electric fluid.\n\nIf the fluid is not uniformly distributed throughout every part of the body, or if, though there be a uniform distribution, the two parts of the body are unequal, we shall always obtain results analogous to those which have been given. There is an infinity of cases supposable, relative to the different states of AB and AC; but as each of these cases has a determinate relation to the most simple case, which we have been considering, it may always be reduced to this.\n\nLet us suppose, for example, that the part AB is double, triple, &c. the part AC, and that the portion of fluid, which is superabundant in AB, is equal to that which is deficient in AC: If we conceive the particle ρ situated between these two parts, the point in which we must suppose the repulsive force of AB to be concentrated, will not be the same as that given in (315); but the point in which ρ must be placed that it may be attracted by AC and repelled by AB, will be between the centres of action of AB and AC, though not at an equal distance from these parts. Then, in the case where ρ is nearer to the centre of action of AC than to that of AB, this particle will tend to penetrate into AC, while the particle P will be equally repelled from it.\n\nHaving thus examined the action between the particles of fluid moving in a body, and the particles of electrical matter in the same body, we shall proceed to consider bodies on the action of electrified bodies on each other.\n\nLet there be two bodies, A and B, in their natural state.\n\nLet M represent the common matter in A.\nm, the common matter in B.\nF₁, the fluid required to saturate A.\nF₂, the fluid required to saturate B.\nx, the mutual action between a particle of fluid and the correspondent matter. This action is represented\nTheory of ed by an unknown quantity, because it is indeterminate: varying with every change of distance.\n\nAs the actions of these bodies on each other are reciprocal, it will be sufficient here to consider how the body A is affected. There are three circumstances to be taken into consideration.\n\n1. The particles of fluid in A attract the particles of matter in B with the force \\( \\propto \\); so that the whole attraction of A on B will be the product of F' and m multiplied by \\( \\propto \\) or \\( \\Gamma m \\propto \\); or\n\n   1st. F tends towards m with the force \\( +Fm\\propto \\).\n\n2. The particles of fluid in A repel the particles of fluid in B with the same force \\( \\propto \\); so that the whole repulsion of A on B will be \\( Ff\\propto \\); or\n\n   2nd. F tends to separate from f with the force \\( -Ff\\propto \\).\n\n3. The particles of matter in A are attracted by the particles of fluid in B with the same force \\( \\propto \\), so that the whole attraction of B on A will be \\( Mf\\propto \\); or,\n\n   3rd. M tends to approach f with the force \\( +Mf\\propto \\).\n\nThe whole tendency of A to approach or to separate from B may therefore be represented by the symbol \\( \\propto \\times Fm + Mf - Ff \\). But as, from the hypothesis, the attraction of the particles of fluid in A for the particles of matter in B is equal to the repulsion between the particles of fluid in A and the particles of fluid in B, which are competent to the matter attracted by the fluid in A, the attraction \\( Fm\\propto \\) is balanced by the repulsion \\( Ff\\propto \\). We have, therefore, only to consider the remaining attraction, or the attraction of the matter in A for the fluid in B, or \\( Mf\\propto \\). On the whole, therefore, A will move towards B, and, as all action is equal and contrary, B will move towards A with an equal force.\n\nThis would be the necessary consequence of the hypothesis, as it stands; but as we see no attraction between bodies in their natural state, there must be some defect in the hypothesis. To remedy this, Æpinus brings another repulsive force into play, and supposes that every particle of matter in A repels every particle of matter in B, as much as it is attracted by so much of the fluid in B as is necessary for its saturation. Now, therefore, the whole action exerted by B on A will be \\( \\propto \\times Fm - Ff - Mm + Mf \\), so that as \\( Fm\\propto \\) is balanced by \\( Ff\\propto \\), and \\( Mm\\propto \\) by \\( Mf\\propto \\), there will remain no excess on either side, and consequently the bodies will have no tendency to motion.\n\nGreat objection has been made to this additional part of M. Æpinus's hypothesis, and indeed Æpinus himself acknowledges, that this circumstance appeared to him hardly admissible; it seeming inconceivable that a particle in A shall repel a particle in B, or recede from it electrically, while it tends toward it by planetary gravitation. But more attentive consideration showed him, that there was nothing in it contrary to the observed analogy of natural operations. We see innumerable instances of inherent forces of attraction and repulsion; and nothing hinders us from referring this lately discovered power to the clas of primitive and fundamental powers of nature. Nor is it difficult to reconcile this repulsion with universal gravitation; for when bodies are in their natural state, the electric attractions and repulsions balance each other, and there is nothing to disturb the phenomena of planetary gravitation; and when they are not in their natural electrical state, it is Theory of fact that their gravitation is disturbed. Although we cannot conceive a body to have a tendency to another body, and at the same time a tendency from it, when we derive our notion of these tendencies entirely from our own consciousness of effort, nothing is more certain than that bodies exhibit at once the appearances which we endeavour to express by these words. We bring the north poles of two magnets near each other, and they recede from each other; if this be prevented by some obstacle, they press on this obstacle, and seem to endeavour to separate. If while they are in this state, we electrify one of them, we find that they will now approach each other; and so we have a distinct proof that both tendencies are in actual exertion by varying their distances, so that one or other force may prevail; or by placing a third body, which shall be affected by one but not the other, &c. We do not understand, nor can we conceive, how either force, or how gravity resides in a body. It must be granted, therefore, that this additional circumstance of Æpinus's hypothesis has nothing in it that is repugnant to the observed phenomena of nature.\n\nIn order to simplify the algebraic expressions which we employ in considering the actions of these bodies, we may remark, that, as in the natural state of the bodies they do not affect each other, we need only, in examining the actions of bodies not in their natural state, consider the action of the redundant fluid or the redundant matter in them, that is, the fluid or matter which is unsaturated: for we may consider an overcharged body as one which contains a quantity of saturated fluid, and a quantity of unsaturated fluid additional; and an undercharged body as one containing a quantity of saturated matter, and a quantity of unsaturated matter in addition.\n\nSuppose two bodies A and B overcharged, or containing each a quantity of unsaturated fluid, which we shall call \\( F' \\) and \\( f' \\). Their mutual action on each other will be \\( F'\\times f' + \\propto \\), and it is evident from what was said before that this is a repulsion. Hence we have the following general proposition.\n\n1. Two overcharged bodies repel each other with the force \\( F'\\times f' + \\propto \\).\n\nNow let these bodies be undercharged, or contain each a quantity of unsaturated matter, \\( M' \\) and \\( m' \\). Their mutual action will now be \\( M'\\times m' + \\propto \\). This action is also repulsive, and hence\n\n2. Two undercharged bodies repel each other with the force \\( M'\\times m' + \\propto \\).\n\nAgain, let one of the bodies A be overcharged or contain the unsaturated fluid \\( F' \\), and the other B undercharged, or contain the unsaturated matter \\( m' \\). Their mutual action will now be expressed by the symbol \\( F'\\times m' + \\propto \\), and will be attractive; or\n\n3. Two bodies which are, one overcharged, and the other undercharged, attract each other with the force \\( F'\\times m' + \\propto \\).\n\nLastly, let one of the bodies be overcharged or undercharged, and the other in its natural state. We infer from the above formulæ, that they will neither attract nor repel each other, or that they will be neutral; for here either \\( F' \\) or \\( f' \\), or \\( M' \\) or \\( m' \\), one of the factors which made part of the above products, is wanting. This may be inferred also, independently of the formulæ, by con-\nTheory of Electricity.\n\nTheorem of fidering that the redundant fluid or redundant matter in one body, is as much repelled or attracted by the fluid or matter in the other, as it is attracted or repelled by the matter or fluid in this other. Hence,\n\n4. If of two bodies, one be in its natural state, they will neither attract nor repel each other.\n\nThe truth of the three first propositions will be evident from the experiments related in the last Part, Chap. I., where we found that bodies which were electrified both positively or both negatively, repelled each other, and that when one body was electrified positively and the other negatively, they attracted each other. But the last proposition seems contrary to the phenomena; and it certainly contradicts a part of the Franklinian doctrine, which maintains that there is an attraction between an electrified and a non-electrified body, we shall presently, however, demonstrate the truth of the proposition, but must now proceed in our explanation of Aepinus's theory.\n\nSuppose the body BC, fig. 97, to be overcharged in the half AC, and undercharged in the half AB, and let us now represent the redundant fluid in the part AC by the symbol \\( f' \\), and the redundant matter in AB by \\( m' \\); let the body D near BC be overcharged with the redundant fluid \\( F' \\); let \\( z \\) and \\( z' \\) denote the force of action exerted on D at the distances of this body from the overcharged or undercharged parts of BC. Now D is repelled by AC, with the force \\( F'f'z' \\), but it is attracted by AB with the force \\( F'm'z' \\); on the whole, therefore, D will be attracted or repelled by BC, according as \\( F'f'z' \\) is greater or less than \\( F'm'z' \\), or (because F is common to both) as \\( m'z' \\) is greater or less than \\( f'z' \\). But this will depend on the proportion that \\( f' \\) bears to \\( m' \\), or \\( z \\) to \\( z' \\). Now, the former of these is regulated by many external circumstances which may tend to produce a greater or less redundancy or deficiency of fluid; and the latter depends on the law of electric action. Without inquiring at present into this law, it is sufficient to recollect that the action decreases with every increase of distance, and that the attraction and repulsion at the same distance are equal. Both, therefore, vary according to the same law, and \\( z \\) is always greater than \\( z' \\).\n\nBut the sensible action of BC on D, and (as action and reaction are equal and contrary) of D on BC, may vary with every new position of BC, and even in the same position.\n\n1. Let us suppose that BC contains on the whole its natural quantity of fluid, but that part of it is taken from AB, and crowded into AC. This, which is a very common case in electricity, may be expressed in our symbolic manner by making \\( f' = m' \\). Now, in this case, \\( F'f'z' \\) is greater than \\( F'm'z' \\), as \\( z \\) is greater than \\( z' \\). A mutual repulsion will therefore take place between BC and D, and this may be expressed by \\( F'f' \\times (z - z') \\).\n\n2. If D were placed on the redundant side of BC, it is evident that the action would be reversed, and the above symbol will express the attraction between BC and D.\n\nAgain, if instead of supposing D to be overcharged, we make it undercharged, the actions will again be changed: in its present situation it will be repelled; on the opposite side of BC it will be attracted.\n\n3. No action may be exerted between them; for the redundancy and deficiency in BC may be inversely proportional to the forces, or we may have \\( f'm': z': z \\). Now, multiplying extreme and mean terms, we have \\( f'z = m'z' \\), and again \\( m' = \\frac{f'z}{z'} \\). In this case the actions counterbalance each other, and when D is at the present distance from the overcharged part AC, it is neither attracted nor repelled. D, and that part of BC that is contiguous to it, may both be overcharged, and yet BC may exert no action on D, or may be neutral with respect to it.\n\nNow suppose D on the opposite side of BC; the effects will be different; for as \\( m' = \\frac{f'z}{z'} \\), and \\( m'z' \\) is now become \\( m'z \\), and \\( f'z \\) is changed into \\( f'z' \\), the action on D will be expressed by \\( F' \\times \\left( \\frac{f'z}{z'} - \\frac{f'z}{z} \\right) = F'f' \\times \\frac{z - z'}{z} \\); of course D will be attracted.\n\nAgain, we may have \\( f' \\) and \\( m' \\) so proportioned as that when D, which we suppose overcharged, is placed at the undercharged end of BC, it shall be neither attracted nor repelled, or that at this exact distance BC shall be neutral. In this case, \\( m' = \\frac{f'z}{z} \\). But if D be on the opposite side of BC, it will be strongly repelled with the force \\( F'f' \\times \\left( \\frac{z - z'}{z} \\right) \\).\n\nHence we see that when the overcharged end of an electrified body becomes neutral with respect to another body that is also overcharged, the undercharged end strongly attracts that body; and when the undercharged end becomes neutral to the body, this is strongly repelled by the overcharged end, as we may deduce from this reasoning the following general conclusion.\n\nWhen an electrified body is neutral at one end, it is rendered more active at the other.\n\nOne circumstance merits particular attention. In the above paragraphs, the neutrality of BC has been confined to a particular distance of the body D, it being required that \\( m' \\) should \\( = \\frac{f'z}{z'} \\); let D be placed nearer to BC and both \\( z \\) and \\( z' \\) are increased. Their increase may be in the same proportion; or one may increase faster than another: in the former case, the value of \\( \\frac{z}{z'} \\), remains the same, and the neutrality continues; in the latter, if \\( z \\) increases faster than \\( z' \\), \\( f'z \\) becomes greater than \\( m'z' \\), and D will be repelled: on the other hand, if \\( z' \\) increases faster than \\( z \\), D will be attracted. Let D be carried farther from the overcharged end of BC, and the effects will be reversed.\n\nWe have been supposing that D is overcharged throughout, but let us take two bodies AB, and CD, unequal fig. 98. AB being overcharged in u B, and undercharged in u A; and CD being overcharged in v D, and undercharged in v C.\n\nIn the first place, let us have the overcharged end of AB opposite the undercharged end of CD as in the figure. Let F and \\( f' \\) be the fluid natural to each, \\( F' \\) and \\( f' \\) the redundant fluid in u B, and v D, and \\( M' \\) and \\( m' \\) the deficient fluid in u A and v C. Let Z and Z'\nTheory of Electricity\n\nLet \\( Z \\) denote the intensity of action exerted by a particle in \\( u \\) on a particle in \\( v \\); and let \\( x \\) and \\( x' \\) in like manner express the intensity of action of a particle in \\( u \\) on a particle in \\( v \\).\n\nIt will easily appear from the former examples that the action of \\( CD \\) on \\( AB \\) will be\n\n\\[\nF'f'Z - Ff'Z' = M'm'x + M'f'x'\n\\]\n\nin which formula the attractions are denoted by \\( + \\), and the repulsions by \\( - \\).\n\nThe attractive or repulsive power will prevail according as the sum of the first and last terms in the numerator of the above fraction is greater or less than the sum of the two middle terms. Again the value of each term will vary with the quantity of redundant fluid or of redundant matter, and with the intensity of the electric action. As it would lead us into too long a discussion were we to notice the numerous varieties of effect, we shall only state the most simple case, as being the most frequent and most useful.\n\nLet us suppose that the overcharged part of each body is as much redundant in fluid as the undercharged part is deficient; in which case we have \\( F' = M' \\) and \\( f' = m' \\). The action will now be expressed by the formula\n\n\\[\nF'f'(Z - Z') - x + x'\n\\]\n\nIt is evident that the external effect produced on \\( AB \\) must depend on the law of action; if \\( Z + x' \\) be greater than \\( Z' + x \\), \\( AB \\) will be attracted, but if \\( Z + x' \\) be less than \\( Z' + x \\), it will be repelled.\n\nIt will be a considerable relief to the imagination to express these abstract values by some sensible quantities, such as lines, and this may conveniently be done in the following manner. From a fixed point in a straight line, measure off portions respectively equal to \\( BC \\), \\( BD \\), \\( AC \\), and \\( AD \\), between those points of the bodies \\( AB \\), \\( CD \\), fig. 98, in which we suppose the forces of the redundant fluid and matter to be concentrated, and at the extremities of these portions erect ordinates proportional to these forces. Though the law of action be but imperfectly known, it will readily be seen of what kind the movements of the bodies will be. Thus in fig. 100, from \\( C \\) in the line \\( CZ \\), make \\( CP = BC \\); \\( CQ = BD \\); \\( CR = AC \\), and \\( CT = AD \\); and erect the ordinates \\( Pp \\), \\( Qq \\), \\( Rr \\), and \\( Tt \\). If the action of electricity be like other attractive and repulsive forces with which we are acquainted, that is, decreasing with an increase of distance, and more slowly as that distance becomes greater, the ordinates will be bounded by such a curve as \\( PQRSTZ \\), that will have its convexity towards the axis \\( Cz \\).\n\nIn our construction, the pair of ordinates \\( Pp \\), \\( Qq \\) are evidently equidistant with the pair \\( Rr \\), \\( Tt \\); as are \\( Pp \\), \\( Rr \\), with \\( Qq \\), \\( Tt \\). It is also clear that the sum of \\( Pp \\) and \\( Tt \\) is greater than the sum of \\( Qq \\) and \\( Rr \\). Bisect \\( Cz \\) in \\( v \\), and draw \\( Vv \\) perpendicular to it, cutting \\( PT \\) and \\( QR \\) in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Then \\( xv \\) is the half of \\( Pp + Tt \\), and \\( yv \\) is the half of \\( Qq + Rr \\). Again, \\( Qm \\) and \\( Tn \\) being drawn parallel to \\( Cz \\), it is evident that \\( Pm \\) is greater than \\( Rr \\), and in general, if any pair of ordinates be brought nearer to \\( C \\), their difference increases; and if two pairs be brought nearer to \\( C \\), the difference of the nearer pair will increase faster than that of the more remote.\n\nTo apply what has been stated,\n\n1. When the overcharged end of \\( AB \\) is towards the undercharged end of \\( CD \\), \\( AB \\) is attracted, as \\( Pp + Tt \\) is greater than \\( Qq + Rr \\).\n\n2. The nearer the bodies are brought, the more the attraction will increase, as the difference between \\( Pm \\) and \\( Rr \\) is thus made greater.\n\n3. The greater the length of \\( AB \\) or \\( CD \\), the distance \\( BC \\) being the same, the more the attraction will increase: for \\( pr \\) or \\( qt \\) (which represent the length of \\( AB \\)) being increased, \\( Rr \\) is diminished more than \\( Tt \\).\n\nBut if the overcharged end of \\( CD \\) be opposite to the overcharged end of \\( AB \\), their mutual action will be represented by \\( F'f' \\left( \\frac{Pp + Qq + Rr - Tt}{Ff} \\right) \\)\n\nand \\( AB \\) will be repelled; the repulsion becoming greater or less, as the attractions, by every change of distance.\n\nHaving thus examined at some length the results of a redundancy or deficiency of fluid, supposing it to be immoveable, we must now proceed to consider the consequences of its mobility.\n\nLet \\( D \\), fig. 97, contain redundant fluid while \\( BC \\) is fixed in its natural state, and let the fluid in \\( D \\) be movable. The redundant fluid in \\( D \\) will exert its repulsive power, and will drive the fluid of \\( BC \\) from the proximate end \\( B \\) towards the remote end \\( C \\), so that the fluid will be rarefied in \\( AB \\), and constricted in \\( AC \\). Without examining here the mutual actions of the redundant fluid and matter, it is clear that we have a case similar to that described in No. 309, and as \\( f' = m' \\) and \\( x \\) is greater than \\( x' \\), \\( D \\) will be attracted by \\( BC \\), with the force \\( F'f' \\times (x - x') \\).\n\nWe may now solve the difficulty mentioned in No. 327, and perceive that the hypothesis agrees with the fact even in the case in which it appeared so opposite. Had the fluid been immoveable, no attraction would indeed have taken place; but as it is supposed moveable, the redundant matter in the vicinity of \\( D \\) prevails, and a mutual attraction ensues.\n\nFor the sake of greater simplicity, we have supposed the fluid in \\( D \\) immoveable, but let us suppose it moveable. In that case, as soon as the uniform distribution on \\( BC \\) is disturbed, and it becomes overcharged in \\( AC \\), and undercharged in \\( AB \\), certain forces begin to act on \\( D \\), tending to disturb its uniformity. The redundant matter towards \\( B \\) attracts the fluid in \\( D \\), more than the redundant fluid toward \\( C \\), which is more remote, repels it; \\( x' \\) being less than \\( x \\). By this attraction the fluid of \\( D \\) tends to constrict in the proximate extremity, and thus again \\( AB \\) is more undercharged, and \\( AC \\) more overcharged than before. Thus the mutual action between the bodies is still more increased. But it is still of the same kind; for however small the redundancy in \\( D \\) may be, it can never be made deficient in its remote extremity by the irregular disposition of the fluid in \\( BC \\), unless \\( BC \\) contain more or less than its natural quantity. By the change in the disposition of fluid in \\( D \\), it is clear that the similar change in \\( BC \\) must be increased; the fluid will be still more rarefied at \\( B \\) and condensed at \\( C \\), and this will go on till all is in equilibrium. There are several forces combining to hold in equilibrium a particle in \\( BC \\). The redundant fluid in \\( D \\) impels it towards \\( C \\); but the redundant fluid here again impels it towards \\( B \\), while the redundant...\nTheory of redundant matter at B attracts it the same way; and Electricity, these two forces of BC must be supposed to balance the action of D.\n\nWe may here conclude that the density of the fluid in BC increases gradually from B to C; at B it must be less, and at C greater than the natural density, and there will consequently be some point between B and C where it is of the natural density. This point may be called a neutral point; though we do not mean to imply by this term that a particle situated at this point is neither attracted nor repelled.\n\nWe have supposed the fluid in D redundant; but let it be deficient. Then the attraction of the redundant matter in D will change the distribution of the moveable fluid in BC, and will constitute it in B, and rarely it in C. Again, the redundant fluid at B will act more strongly on the moveable fluid in D, and tend to impel it towards the remote extremity; and D will thus become undercharged in its proximate extremity, and less undercharged at its remote end than if BC were away. The unequal distribution of fluid in BC will thus be increased; but though both BC and D will be farther from their natural state, the remote end of D can never be overcharged.\n\nIt is clear, that when things are in the state which we have described, D and BC will attract each other with the same force as when D was equally undercharged.\n\nLet a body, A, (fig. 101.) that is overcharged, be placed near the extremities of two oblong parallel conductors, B and C, that are in their natural state. By the action of A, the fluid in B and C will be repelled towards their remote ends N and n, where it will be condensed, while at their proximate ends, S and s, it will be rarefied. Both B will attract and be attracted by A. Now the redundant fluid in NB repels the redundant fluid in nC, and in like manner the redundant matter in SB repels the redundant matter in sC; the bodies B and C therefore repel each other, and will separate; but they ought to approach each other, for SB attracts nC, and NB attracts sC; but the repelling parts being nearer each other than the attracting parts, the forces of the former will prevail. If the body A were undercharged, it is clear that the same sensible appearances would take place, though the internal motions of the bodies would be the reverse of the former.\n\nIf another body in the same state with A be placed near the opposite ends of B and C, their internal motions will be diminished or prevented, and of course the sensible appearances should diminish also.\n\nIf another conductor, as E, be placed near s, opposite to A, it will be affected in the same manner with C, and its proximate extremity f will repel s; but if it be placed at the remote end, or in the position of F, this remote end will be attracted. As the body A, when redundant or deficient, affects every other body in its vicinity, while these do not by themselves affect each other, A is called the electrified body, and the others are said to be electrified by it. The electricity of these bodies is called Induced Electricity.\n\nWe have hitherto supposed the fluid moveable, except at first in A; but let us suppose that there is some obstruction to its mobility, and let us examine what will be the consequences. We may state the obstruction as uniform, and as being such that some small force is required to enable a particle of fluid to pass between two particles of matter.\n\nWhen an overcharged body is placed near an imperfect conductor, it is clear that the fluid cannot be propelled to the remote extremity of the conductor in so great a quantity. We may conceive the distribution of the fluid, by taking a constant quantity from the intensity of the force of the overcharged body at every point of the conductor. This shows that the distribution will not be so unequal between imperfect, as between perfect conductors, and hence that the attraction between the former will not be so strong as between the latter. It will also be much longer before an equilibrium can be brought about. This leads us to an important consequence; viz. that the neutral point will not be so far from the other body when the fluid is of its natural density, as it would be, were there no obstructions. The advance of this point along the imperfect conductor will also be very slow; and it is clear, that the final accumulation at the remote extremity of an imperfect conductor will be less than if the conductor were perfect, and the neutral point will be nearer to the other extremity.\n\nThe obstruction we are considering will be attended with another remarkable effect. The contipation of the fluid at the commencement of the action will always be greatest at a place much nearer to the disturbing cause than the remote end of the conductor, and beyond that point it will diminish. In the time that elapses during the progress of this change, the condensed fluid tends to repel the fluid beyond it, and thus some of this remote fluid may be displaced, and a part of the imperfect conductor made deficient, while there is a small condensation beyond it. By this again a rarefaction and condensation may be produced in another part, thus causing a very irregular distribution of the fluid.\n\nThe effect of such a mode of action will be that there may be several neutral points in an imperfect conductor, and several overcharged and undercharged portions, and hence its action on distant bodies may be extremely various. The formula\n\n\\[ \\frac{f}{r} - \\frac{g}{r'} + \\frac{h}{r''} - \\frac{i}{r'''}, \\]\n\nwhere \\( f, g, h, i \\) express the different portions in opposite states, and \\( r, r', r'', r''' \\), the repulsion at different distances, may be conveniently employed to denote the action in such circumstances. Hence, if another body be placed in the direction of the axis, it will be attracted at one distance, repelled at a greater, again attracted at a still greater distance, and so alternately.\n\nThe obstruction may not be considerable, and then the action of the neighbouring overcharged body will produce a deficiency in the proximate part of the conductor, a redundancy farther on, then a deficiency, and so on. Presently these will shift, and successively disappear at the farther end, and the body will remain with only one neutral point. A greater obstruction will leave the body with more than one neutral point, and the number of these will be in proportion to the obstruction.\n\nThe removal of an overcharged body from the vicinity of conductors will have different results according as the conductors are perfect or imperfect, that is, according as there is obstruction or not. In the former case, imperfect conductors...\nTheory of case, the electricity induced by the vicinity of the overcharged body will be instantly destroyed on the removal of the body. But where there is an obstruction acting, though, on the removal of the body, the forces that tend to restore the equilibrium in the conductor begin to act, and restore it in part, they can never do this completely; for when the force by which a particle is propelled from an overcharged part to one undercharged is just sufficient to balance the obstruction, it will remain in that state of distribution at which it had arrived. We may expect then, that imperfect conductors will retain a part of their induced electricity.\n\nOn the removal of the electrifying body, the electric appearances induced by it in the conductor will disappear in a contrary order to that in which they were produced, and they will be left in a state of unequal distribution, or with a degree of electric power, proportioned to their imperfection as conductors.\n\nWe have now given an account of the principal consequences of the theory of Æpinus, a theory which till of late was little known in Britain, owing probably to the very lame and imperfect account given of it by Dr Priestley in his popular work on electricity. More justice has been done to this theory by Mr Cavendish, who before he saw M. Æpinus's work had framed an hypothesis of his own upon very similar principles. Mr Cavendish's paper, in which he has treated this subject in a very able and learned manner, appeared in the 61st vol. of the Phil. Trans.\n\nTo this paper we shall be much indebted presently; but in the mean time we shall only extract from it the hypothesis, which is as follows.\n\nThere is a substance which we call the electric fluid, the particles of which repel each other, and attract the particles of all other matter, with a force inversely as some less power of the distance than the cube; the particles of all other matter also repel each other, and attract those of the electric fluid, with a force varying according to the same power of the distances. Or, to express it more concisely, if you look upon the electric fluid as a matter of a contrary kind to other matter, the particles of all matter, both those of the electric fluid and of other matter, repel particles of the same kind, and attract those of a contrary kind, with a force inversely as some less power of the distance than the cube.\n\nFor the future, he would be understood never to comprehend the electric fluid under the word matter, but only some other sort of matter.\n\nIt is indifferent whether we suppose all sorts of matter to be ended in an equal degree with the foregoing attraction and repulsion, or whether you suppose some sorts to be ended with it in a greater degree than others; but it is likely that the electric fluid is ended with this property in a much greater degree than other matter; for in all probability, the weight of the electric fluid in any body bears but a very small proportion to the weight of the matter; but yet the force with which the electric fluid therein attracts any particle of matter must be equal to the force which the matter therein repels that particle; otherwise the body would appear electrical, as will be shown hereafter.\n\nTo explain this hypothesis more fully, suppose that one grain of electric fluid attracts a particle of matter at a given distance with as much force as n grains of any matter, lead for instance, repel it: then will one grain of electric fluid repel a particle of electric fluid with as much force as n grains of lead attract it; and one grain of electric fluid will repel one grain of electric fluid with as much force as n grains of lead repel n grains of lead.\n\nAll bodies, in their natural state with regard to electricity, contain such a quantity of electric fluid interspersed between their particles, that the attraction of the electric fluid in any small part of the body in a given particle of matter, shall be equal to the repulsion of the matter in the same small part, in the same particle.\n\nA body in this state is said to be saturated with electric fluid; if the body contains more than this quantity of electric fluid, he calls it overcharged; if less, he calls it undercharged.\n\nSect. III. Of the Theory of two Fluids.\n\nThis theory originated, as we have said, in M. du Faye's discovery of the different electricities produced by rubbing glass and sealing-wax.\n\nLet us suppose that there are two electric fluids, which have a strong affinity for each other, while, at the same time, the particles of each are strongly repulsive of each other. Let us suppose these two fluids in some measure equally attracted by all bodies, and existing in intimate union in their pores; and while they continue in this manner to exhibit no mark of their existence, let us suppose that the friction of an electric produces a separation of these two fluids, causing (in the usual method of electrifying) the vitreous electricity of the rubber to be conveyed to the conductor, and the resinous electricity of the conductor to be conveyed to the rubber. The rubber will then have a double share of the resinous electricity, and the conductor a double share of the vitreous; so that, upon this hypothesis, no substance whatever can have a greater or less quantity of electric fluid at different times; the quality of it only can be changed.\n\nThe two electric fluids being thus separated, will begin to show their respective powers, and their eagerness to rush into re-union with each other. With whichever of these fluids a number of bodies are charged, they will repel one another: they will be attracted by all bodies, which have a less share of that particular fluid with which they are loaded; but will be much more strongly attracted by bodies which are wholly destitute of it, and loaded with the other. In this case, they will rush together with great violence.\n\nOn this theory, the electric spark consists of both the fluids rushing in contrary directions, and making a double current. When, for instance, the finger is presented to a conductor loaded with vitreous electricity, it discharges it of part of the vitreous, and returns so much of the resinous, which is supplied to the body from the earth. Thus both the bodies are unelectrified, the balance of the two powers being restored.\n\nWhen the Leyden phial is presented to be charged, and consequently the coating of one of its sides is connected with the rubber, and that of the other with the conductor; the vitreous electricity of that side which is connected with the conductor is transmitted to that which\nTheory of which is connected with the rubber, which returns an equal quantity of its refrinous electricity; so that all the vitreous electricity is conveyed to one of the sides, and all the refrinous to the other. These two fluids being thus separated, attract each other very strongly through the thin substance of the intervening glass, and rush together with great violence, whenever an opportunity is presented, by means of proper conductors. Sometimes they will force a passage through the substance of the glass itself; and in the mean time, their mutual attraction is stronger than any force that can be applied to take away either of the fluids separately.\n\nDr Priestley gives the following view of the comparative merits of this theory and that of Dr Franklin.\n\n\"In the first place, (says he,) the supposition itself of two fluids, is not quite so easy as that of one, though it is far from being disagreeable to the analogy of nature, which abounds with affinities, and in which we see innumerable instances of substances formed, as it were, to unite and counteract one another.\n\nThe two fluids being supposed, the double current from the rubber to the conductor, and from the conductor to the rubber, is an easy and necessary consequence. For if, on the common supposition, the action of the rubber puts a single fluid into motion in one direction, we might expect, that if there were two fluids, which counteracted each other, they would, by the same operation, be made to move in contrary directions. And a person that has been used to conceive that a single fluid may be made to move either way, viz. from the rubber to the conductor, or from the conductor to the rubber at pleasure, according as a rough or a smooth globe is used, can have much less objection to this part of the hypothesis.\n\nAdmitting then this different action of the rubber and the electric upon the two different fluids, the manner of conveying electric atmospheres, or powers, to bodies is the same on this as on any other theory; and it is apprehended that the phenomena of negative electricity are more easily conceived by the help of a real fluid, than by no fluid at all. Indeed Dr Franklin himself ingenuously acknowledges, that he was a long time puzzled to account for bodies that were negatively electrified, repelling one another; whereas M. du Faye, who observed the same fact, had no difficulty about it, supposing that he had discovered another electricity, similar, with respect to the properties of elasticity and repulsion, to the former.\n\nBy this double action of the rubber, the method of charging a plate of glass is exceeding easy to conceive. Upon this hypothesis, all the vitreous electricity quits its union with the refrinous on the side communicating with the conductor, and is brought over to the side communicating with the rubber; which, by the same operation had been made to part with its refrinous electricity in return.\n\nAll the vitreous electricity being thus brought to one side of the plate of glass, and all the refrinous to the other, the phenomena of the plate while standing charged, or discharged, are perhaps more free from all difficulty than upon any other hypothesis. When one of the sides of the glass is conceived to be loaded with one kind of electricity, and the other with the other kind; the strong affinity between them, whereby they attract each other, with a force proportioned to their nearness, immediately supplies a satisfactory reason, why Theory of so little of either of the fluids can be drawn from one Electricity of the sides without communicating as much to the other. Upon this supposition, that consequence is perhaps more obvious, than upon the supposition of one half of the glass being crowded with the electric matter, and the other half exhausted. In the former case, every attempt to withdraw the fluid from one of the sides, is opposed by the more powerful attraction of the other fluid on the opposite side. On the other hypothesis, it is only opposed by the attraction of the empty pores of the glass.\n\nLastly, The explosion upon the discharge of the glass has as much the appearance of two fluids rushing into union, in two opposite directions, as of one fluid proceeding only in one direction. The same may be said of the appearance of every electric spark, in which, upon this hypothesis, there is always supposed to be two currents, one from the electric, or the electrified body, and the other to it.\n\nI do not say, continues Dr Priestley, that the burr which is usually seen on both sides of a quire of paper pierced by an electric explosion, and the current of air flowing from the points of all bodies electrified negatively as well as positively; are material objections to the doctrine of a single fluid. But upon the supposition of two fluids and two currents, the difficulty for accounting for these facts would hardly have occurred.\n\nIt is almost needless to observe, that the influence of points is attended with exactly the same difficulty upon this theory, as upon the other. It is equally easy, or equally difficult, to suppose one fluid to enter and go out at the point of an electrified conductor at different times, as to suppose, that, of two fluids, one goes out, and the other goes in, at the same time.\n\nThat bodies immersed in electric atmospheres must acquire the contrary electricity, is quite as easy to suppose upon this, as upon any other hypothesis. For, in this case, suppose the electrified body to be possessed of the vitreous electricity, all the vitreous electricity of the body which is brought near it will be driven backwards to the more distant parts, and all the refrinous electricity will be drawn forwards. And, when the attraction between the two electricities in these different bodies is so great as to overcome the opposition to their union occasioned by the attraction of the bodies that contained them, the form of their surfaces, and the resistance of the interposing medium, they will rush together; an electric spark will be visible between them; and the electricity of both will appear to be discharged; the prevailing electricity of each being saturated with an equal quantity of the opposite kind, from the other body.\n\nThis hypothesis will likewise easily account for the difficulty of charging a very thick plate of glass, and the impossibility of charging it beyond a certain thickness; for these fluids, at a greater distance, will attract one another less forcibly, and at a certain still greater distance will not attract at all.\"\n\nDr Priestley makes the following answer to the principal objection that may be urged against this theory.\n\n\"If it be asked (says he,) why the two fluids meeting on the surface of the globe, or in the electric explosion, do not unite by means of their strong affinity, and\nTheory of and make no further progress; it may be answered, Electricity—that the attraction between all other bodies and the particles of both these fluids, may be supposed to be at least as strong as the affinity between the fluids themselves; so that the moment any body is dislodged from one, it may recruit itself to its usual point of saturation, from the other.\n\nBesides, in whatever manner it be that one of the electric fluids is dislodged from any body (since upon every theory the two electricities are produced at the same time) the opposite electricity will, by the same action, be dislodged from the other substance. And whatever it be that dislodges the fluid from any substance, it will be sufficient to prevent its return; consequently, supposing both the substances necessarily to have a certain proportion of electric matter, each may be immediately supplied from that which was dislodged from the other.\n\nThe rubber, therefore, at the time of excitation, gives its vitreous electricity to that part of the smooth glass against which it has been pressed, and takes an equal quantity of the resinous in return. The glass being a non-conductor, does not allow this additional quantity of electricity to enter its substance. It is therefore diffused upon the surface, and, in the revolution of the globe is carried to the prime conductor. There it repels the vitreous, and violently attracts the resinous electricity; and (the points of the conductor favouring the mutual transition), the vitreous, which abounds upon the globe, passes to the conductor; and the resinous, which abounds upon the nearest parts of the conductor, rushes upon the globe. There it mixes with, and saturates what remained of the vitreous electricity on the part on which it flows, and thereby reduces it to the same state in which it was before it was excited. Every part of the surface of the globe performs the same office, first exchanging electricities with the rubber and then with the conductor.\n\nThe solution of this difficulty will also solve that of the electric explosion, in which there is a collision, as it were, of the two fluids, while yet they completely pass one another. For still each surface of the glass may be supposed to require its certain portion of electric matter, and therefore cannot part with one part without receiving an equal quantity of the other. It must be considered also, that the air through which the fluids pass, has already its natural quantity of electricity, so that being fully saturated, it can contain no more, and that the two fluids only rush to the places from which they had been forcibly dislodged, and where the greater body of the opposite fluid waits to embrace them.\"\n\nAlthough, in our explanation of electrical phenomena, we shall adopt the theory of Epinus and Cavendish, it is proper to observe that this theory does not universally prevail among the electricians of the present day. The hypothesis of Du Fay, or the theory of two fluids, is still maintained by several, especially on the continent. This theory has lately found two strenuous advocates in France, M. M. Haug and Tremery.\n\nTheir principal objection to the theory of Epinus seems to be founded on that part of his hypothesis with which Epinus himself was not perfectly satisfied, but which (in No. 321.) we have attempted to defend, viz. his introduction of a repulsive force among the particles of matter in a body.\n\nVol. VII. Part II.\n\n\"In fact, (say they,) the supposition of a single fluid Theory of which the particles mutually repel each other, and are attracted by the particles of matter in all known bodies, gives rise to many distinct forces, which cannot be in equilibrium, and which, by their mode of acting, are such, that two bodies which are in their natural state, and which are not attracted by any other force besides that of electricity, must tend towards each other.\n\n\"The supposition of a repulsive force among the particles of matter in solid bodies becomes unnecessary if we conceive the electric fluid as composed of two fluids, of which one possesses the property which Epinus attributes to the particles of matter in the body. It is much better to admit a repulsion at a distance among the particles of two peculiar fluids, which, like all others, repel each other, even in contact, than to conceive such a repulsion to exist among the particles of bodies that are in their nature solid. Those philosophers who endeavour to explain all the phenomena on the principle of a single fluid, believed themselves that its particles repelled each other at a distance, as from one surface of the Leyden phial to the other; and as what we call action at a distance, is properly no more than a fact on which we ground a theory, without inquiring what is the cause which furnishes the point of difference, it is sufficient that the manner in which we conceive this fact enables us to adapt it to our theory.\n\n\"Epinus, who does not conceal his reluctance to admit that such a force as that which we have mentioned can take place, would doubtless, (say these gentlemen,) have adopted the hypothesis of two fluids, if in his time the nature of the electrical phenomena had been better understood. But, at that period, the means of observation not being so perfect, experiments had not been made with that precision which characterize those which we owe to M. Coulomb, and which have formed the foundation of those important discoveries, by means of which this celebrated philosopher, far exceeding the point at which Epinus rested, has carried the science to a high degree of perfection, in that beautiful series of memoirs, in which we must admire the address with which he has availed himself both of experiment and calculation.\n\n\"Almost all the phenomena of electricity, then, seem to depend on the action of two peculiar fluids, which act in such a manner, that the particles of each mutually repel each other at a distance, with a force which is inversely as the square of this distance, and attract the particles of the other fluid with the same force.\n\n\"It is of consequence not to confound these two fluids with the two currents, the one of influent and the other of affluent matter, by which Nollet attempted to explain the phenomena. These two currents belong to the same matter, and proceed, one from the conductor towards surrounding bodies, the other from these towards the conductor.\n\n\"We shall now endeavour to apply the hypothesis of two fluids to the explanation of same phenomena which do not appear to agree with it, and which, by the manner in which we are accustomed to view them, seem to indicate that vitreous and resinous electricity are only modifications of the same fluid.\n\n\"The experiments which seem to militate against our theory are very few, and may be reduced to the following.\"\nTheory of Electricity.\n\n\"Exper. 1.—If upon a cake of rosin we trace various designs with the point of a conducting substance, which is at one time electrified positively, or by vitreous electricity, and at another negatively, or by resinous electricity; and if on this surface, thus electrified, we let fall a powder (g) properly disposed; the designs thus rendered visible will present characters peculiar to each species of electricity; thus shewing, according to the followers of Franklin and Aepinus, a superabundance of electric fluid on one side and a deficiency on the other.\n\n\"Exper. 2. When a conducting body terminating in a point, is electrified positively or by vitreous electricity, we perceive at the point a luminous brush. And if, all other things being equal, we substitute negative or resinous electricity, the point is illuminated with a star or luminous point.\n\n\"According to the theory of positive and negative electricity, the brush indicates the transmission of electric fluid from the body which is electrified positively, and the star its entrance into the body which is negatively electrified.\n\n\"Exper. 3.—When an electric explosion takes place, all the electric fluid appears constantly to pass from the body electrified positively to that which is electrified negatively.\"\n\nHere they cite the method of proving this, by piercing a card placed between the conducting balls of the universal discharger. (Vid. No. 106. Exp. 2.)\n\nThese experiments, to which the theory of positive and negative electricity is happily applied, seem at first sight inexplicable, according to the hypothesis of two fluids. In fact, the particles of these two fluids being subject to the same laws, it seems,\n\n1. That the designs traced on a cake of rosin, or other ideo-electric substance, with the point of a conductor, electrified at one time positively and at another negatively, should on the whole be similar.\n\n2. That the luminous appearance observed at the summit of a pointed conductor, ought always to be the same, whatever be the electrical state of the body.\n\n3. That when an electric discharge has taken place, the vitreous and resinous electricities, which mutually attract each other, ought to form a luminous train on each surface of the card, and the card ought to be perforated in a point equally distant from the two extremities of the balls of the discharger.\n\nThe following is the manner in which M. Tremery undertakes to explain these appearances.\n\n\"The matter, (says he,) to the action of which we attribute the electrical phenomena, being considered as compounded of two peculiar fluids, we may conclude that all bodies, considered in the relation which they bear to these fluids, do not possess the same properties; it is possible that vitreous and resinous electricity may be of such a nature, that, on the one hand, certain bodies, whether electrics or conductors, may have with respect to them different conducting powers; and on the other hand, that the coercive power (u) of ideo-electrics may vary according as they are opposed to the motion of Theory of particles proper to vitreous electricity, or to the motion of particles proper to resinous electricity.\n\n\"If, for instance, the air of the atmosphere, in which electrical phenomena usually take place, has an incomparably greater coercive power with respect to the resinous electricity than it has to the vitreous, it would be very easy to explain the experiments that we have quoted. In this case, the resinous electricity, because of the almost infinite resistance that the air would oppose to the motion of its particles, might be regarded as inherent in the surface of the bodies; whence it follows, that the same circumstances would take place, as if the body electrified regularly had the property of exercising by itself an attraction for the vitreous or positive electricity; a property which bodies in the negative state are supposed to have, according to the theory of Franklin.\n\n\"If now, the coercive power that we have supposed the air to have with respect to the resinous electricity, could diminish so as to become equal to that which it has with respect to the vitreous, it would happen, that the signs which induce us to regard the vitreous electricity as positive, and the resinous as negative, would disappear, so that all the phenomena would seem to depend equally on the action of the two fluids that would be subject to the same law. In this new circumstance, we should observe a luminous pencil at the summit of a pointed conductor electrified regularly or negatively, and when an electric discharge took place, the vitreous and resinous electricities would appear to approach each other.\n\n\"If, under these circumstances, the coercive power of the air with respect to the vitreous electricity, should increase, so as in its turn to become incomparably greater than what it had with respect to the resinous electricity, it is evident, that the electric matter, acting in the midst of such a substance, would produce phenomena exactly similar to those with which we are acquainted; but, in this case, the vitreous or positive electricity would perform the office of the resinous or negative, and vice versa, and they would mutually exchange signs. A luminous pencil would appear at a point electrified negatively or resinously, and a luminous star at a positive or vitreously electrified point; and when two conducting bodies, electrified differently, were placed at a convenient distance, all the electric matter would appear to move from the negative body towards the positive *.\"\n\nChap. II. A theoretical Explanation of the Phenomena of Electricity.\n\nSect. I. Of the Nature and Distribution of the Electric Fluid.\n\nBefore we enter on a theoretical explanation of the Nature of phenomena of electricity, it will not be improper to inquire fluid.\n\n(g) This powder should be composed of two substances, which, by their mutual friction against each other, are capable of receiving opposite electricities.\n\n(h) By coercive power our author understands that which ideo-electrics or conductors oppose to the motion of the particles that are proper to each of the two fluids, that, according to this hypothesis, are supposed to form by their union the electric fluid.\nTheory of electricity somewhat more at large into the nature of that subtle agent which we have distinguished by the name of the electric fluid, and to notice some of the more plausible opinions that have been hazarded on the subject.\n\nOne of the first questions that naturally arises from the very name of fluid is, What proofs have we of the materiality of this power?\n\nBesides the properties of attraction and repulsion, which are properties of matter, we have many other evidences that are very persuasive, as being more distinctly the objects of our senses.\n\n1. The spark that appears when the electric power passes suddenly through the air or any other resisting medium, and the spark, by which it is accompanied, are strong evidences in favour of the materiality of the power, by which they are produced. The noise of the spark is occasioned by the sudden impression made on the air, or some other elastic fluid, through which the spark passes. When the air is confined in close vessels, as in a tube above water, no very durable effect is indeed produced on the water in the tube. But this is owing to the rapidity with which the expansion and subsequent condensation take place. Again, it is objected, that it is impossible to communicate motion to a very delicate lever, nicely balanced, by throwing on it any quantity of electricity. Some pretend to have done this; but, however, the impossibility of doing it is no argument against the materiality of the electric fluid; and we might just as well say, that a musket ball is not material, because it may be fired through a paper or thin board delicately suspended, without imparting to them any part of its motion.\n\n2. The light and heat accompanying the spark, are proofs of the materiality of the electric power. These are chemical phenomena; and whether we consider them as effects of the fluid as a simple, or as resulting from its decomposition, we conceive that they prove the materiality of the electric power, as completely as the materiality of caloric and light have been proved.\n\nWe are aware that this reasoning will not satisfy those philosophers who deny the materiality of caloric and light; we know that much stress is laid on the experiments of Count Rumford, as completely subversive of the materiality of heat, experiments that could even stagger the opinion of a Robison. Without defining in the least to detract from the merit of that ingenious and able experimentalist, for whom we entertain a very high esteem, we must confess, that we do not consider his experiments as warranting the conclusions that have been drawn from them, and we are still disposed to think the materiality of caloric and light as fully proved as can be expected, with respect to matter that is not absolutely tangible.\n\nFrom the similarity of the chemical effects of the supposed to electric fluid with those of elementary fire or caloric, it was long ago (as we have shewn in the beginning of this Part) supposed, that they were the same, and this is still the opinion of some electricians. We cannot here pretend to enter on a full discussion of this question, but we shall briefly state the arguments in favour of the identity of caloric, and the objections that we have to make to them.\n\nElectricity is the same with caloric (say the advocates for their identity) because,\n\n1. Both produce the same chemical effects, expansion, fluidity, inflammation, oxidation, &c.\n\n2. Those bodies that are the best conductors of caloric, as the metals, are also the best conductors of electricity; and glass, which is a very bad conductor of caloric, is one of the most perfect non-conductors of electricity.\n\nTo the first argument for their identity, we shall reply in the words of M. Berthollet, who once considered against this them as the same, but from experiments was satisfied that supposition, their effects were different.\n\n\"A wire of platina was submitted to shocks which were nearly strong enough to effect its combustion; and to be satisfied of this, a shock was excited, by which a great part of the wire was melted and dispersed; afterwards the shocks employed were a little weaker, and immediately after each, the wire was touched to judge of the temperature it had acquired: a heat was felt, which was dissipated in a few minutes, and which, at the utmost, was estimated to resemble that of the boiling point of water. If electricity liquefied metals, and brought them into combustion by the heat it excites, the platina wire must after a shock, which differed but little from that which would have produced its dispersion and its combustion, have approached the degree of temperature which occasions its liquefaction: Now this degree, which is the most elevated that can be obtained, would, according to the valuation, more or less accurate, of Wedgwood, be 3227° of Fahrenheit.\n\n\"When the shock is sufficiently strong to destroy the aggregation of the platina wire, it begins by detaching molecules from its surface, which exhale like smoke; if it is strong enough to produce combustion, the remains of the wire appear to be torn into filaments.\n\n\"A thermoscope blackened with ink, and placed in the steam of a strong electric spark, only experienced a dilatation which was nearly equal to one degree of Reaumur's thermometer, and this slight effect might depend on the oxidation of the iron of the ink; placed beside the current, it did not show any dilatation, although the air was necessarily affected by the electric action: it was the same when it was placed in contact with a metallic conductor, which received a stream less powerful than in the preceding experiments.\n\n\"A cylinder of glass filled with air, with an exciter at each of its extremities, to one of which was fixed a tube communicating with another cylinder filled with water, produced an impulse at each shock, which raised the water more than a diameter above its level, but its effect was instantaneous.\n\n\"These experiments seem to me to prove that electricity does not act on substances, and on their combinations, by an elevation of temperature, but by a dilatation which separates the molecule of bodies. The flight heat observed in the platina wire, is only the effect of the compression produced by the molecules which first experience the electric action, or which experience it in a greater degree; it must, therefore, be compared to that excited by percussion or compression.\n\n\"If the dilatation was the effect of heat, that experienced by a gas, in the experiment related above, would not have been instantaneous; it would only have experienced a progressive diminution by cooling, as when its expansion is owing to heat.\n\n\"In the experiment by which ammoniacal gas is decomposed,\nTheory of composed, the gas undoubtedly receives the electric action, and nevertheless it is not heated; and as soon as the decomposition is finished, its volume remains unchanged, because the electric action which is employed in this experiment, is not sufficiently energetic to cause a perceptible dilatation. No sensible dilatation is produced by a gas in a shock which is not very strong, because the impulse not being gradual like the expansion arising from caloric, and being excited instantaneously, the resistance of the liquid becomes too great, and cannot be overcome unless the dilatation has great energy.\n\nAn experiment of Dieman and his learned associates confirms this explanation: they caused a shock to pass through lead placed in a vessel filled with azotic gas, which could not oxidate it; it was reduced into powder retaining all its metallic properties: If it had experienced a liquefaction similar to the action of heat, it would have cooled gradually, and would have congealed into one, or at least into several masses.\n\nWhen a metal is submitted to the electric action, the effects produced immediately by the electricity must be distinguished from those which are owing to its oxidation: the first are limited to the diminution or destruction of the effects of the force of cohesion, to removing and dispersing the molecules (if by this a little heat is disengaged, it is only owing to the compression sustained by some of the parts); but those which are occasioned by the oxidation, produce a high degree of heat, and then the effects allude all the appearances of an ordinary combustion: hence it arises, that the most oxidable metals are those which become red with the greatest facility, and which must shew the properties of a metal liquefied by heat.\n\nElectricity favours this oxidation in as much as it diminishes the force of cohesion; it is thus that an alkali renders the action of sulphur on oxygen much more powerful, by destroying the force of cohesion opposed to it, and that a metal dissolved in an amalgam, is oxidated much more easily than when it is in a solid state. It is only by destroying the effects of the force of cohesion that heat itself produces the oxidation of metals; but the expansive action of electricity will have a great advantage over that of caloric, because its action is confined to the solid which it encounters in its course, so that the gas itself will not experience a dilatation in opposition to the condensation which accompanies the combination: To this circumstance may be applied what is observed in the action of hydrogen gas, which is capable of completely reducing an oxide of iron placed in the focus of a burning glass, although water, whose two elements receive the heat equally, is decomposed by this metal.*\n\nTo the second argument we shall answer, that though in the instance of metals it is correct, in so far as that these bodies are the best conductors, both of caloric and electricity, there are however, bodies that conduct caloric very well, but either do not conduct electricity, or do it very imperfectly.\n\nEven in the case of metallic bodies, so far as can be inferred from the imperfect experiments that have been made on their comparative conducting power, it should appear that the order of their conducting power, with respect to caloric, is not the same as that with respect to electricity.\n\nFarther, caloric takes some time to pass through the best conductors, while the electric fluid pervades the longest with inconceivable velocity.\n\nAgain, if electricity were the same with caloric, they should mutually produce the same effects, and should exist simultaneously. But this is by no means the case; a body may be strongly electrified without being sensibly increased in temperature, and so far is heat from producing electricity (except in a few instances), that where the former is present in any considerable degree, the latter is destroyed.\n\nLastly, the mode in which electricity and caloric pass along conductors is, we think different. Caloric seems undoubtedly to penetrate their substance, while electricity appears not to extend beyond the surface, except it meet with some resistance. The following experiment is usually adduced to prove that electricity pervades the substance of conductors.\n\nTake a wire of any kind of metal, and cover part of it with some electric substance, as rosin, sealing-wax, &c., then discharge a jar through it, and it will be found that it conducts as well as without the electric coating. This, says Mr Cavallo, proves that the electric matter passes through the substance of the metal, and not over its surface. A wire, adds he, continued through a vacuum, is also a convincing proof of the truth of this assertion. Even here, however, the proof, if impartially considered, will be found very defective. It is a fact agreed upon by all philosophers, that bodies which to us are apparently in contact, do nevertheless require a very considerable degree of force to make them actually touch one another. Dr Priestley found that a weight of five pounds was necessary to press 20 shillings into close contact, when lying upon one another on a table. A much greater weight was necessary to bring the links of a chain into contact with each other. It cannot be at all incredible, therefore, that a wire, though covered with sealing-wax or rosin, should still remain at some little distance from the substance which covers it.\n\nM. Coulomb proves that in an overcharged conducting body, the fluid does not penetrate into its substance, but diffuses itself merely over the surface.\n\nBy means of a very delicate electroscope, he examined pits made in a conducting body of various depths, and found that in the shallowest of them there was no sensible electricity; whence he naturally draws the conclusion, that the electricity in such bodies does not extend beyond the surface. The reader may see a description of the electroscope employed, and a detail of the experiments in the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1786, p. 72, or the Journal de Physique, vol. ii. (of the series by Delametherie), p. 236.\n\nDr Robison repeated Coulomb's experiments with the same results.\n\nAnother opinion that has been maintained with respect to electricity, is that it is the same with light. The differs from principal argument for the identity of electricity and light. Light seems to be that bodies are impregnated with the latter by means of the former, and indeed that light commonly appears when the electric fluid passes in any quantity from one body to another.\n\nAnother reason given for their identity, is, that both move with inconceivable velocity.\n\nA strong argument against the identity of light and electricity,\nTheory of electricity, is that the former passes through glass and other transparent electrics, which seem to be impermeable to the electric fluid.\n\nAs to the impregnation of opaque bodies with light by means of electricity, this is the effect of chemical decomposition, as will presently appear, and is really produced by light itself.\n\nWhat has been now said is, we think, sufficient to prove, that the electric fluid is neither calorific nor light. But the appearance of calorific and light, in many cases, shows that there is an intimate connection between them and the electric fluid. In short, they seem to form part of its composition; and we are inclined to consider it as a compound, containing calorific and light, and probably some peculiar constituent, to which we give the name of electricity. This opinion is not new; it was the hypothesis of Mr. James Ruffel, who filled the natural philosophy chair at Edinburgh, above thirty years ago.\n\nMr. Ruffel considered the electric fluid as a compound of several others, containing particularly elementary fire, from which it derived its great elasticity or power of repulsion. The elasticity of the electric fluid he supposed to differ from that of air, in acting at a distance; whereas the action of the air is only on adjoining particles. Hence bodies that contain more electric fluid than the spaces around them, have a tendency to repel each other.\n\nMr. Ruffel considered the characteristic ingredient of the compound, i.e., the electricity, as united to the other constituents by chemical affinity, or, as it was then called, Electric Attraction. This attraction acts at all distances, but not exactly according to the same law, as the repulsive power of the elastic fluid; and in general, while in this state of composition, counteracts the repulsion of the electric particles. Again, the electricity attracts the particles of other bodies, but with different degrees of affinity. Non-electrics or conductors are attracted by it at all distances, but electrics only at very small and imperceptible distances, and at such distances only its own particles attract each other.\n\nHence this compound fluid repels its own particles at all considerable distances, but attracts them when very near. It also attracts conductors at all distances, but electrics only when very near. The appearances of light and heat were considered by Mr. Ruffel as proofs of a partial decomposition, and as evincing the presence of elementary fire: the peculiar odour of the electric spark, and the effect produced in certain influences on the organ of taste, were also regarded as proofs of chemical decomposition, and of the compound nature of the electric fluid.\n\nAgain, conducting bodies containing electric fluid, if forced very near, attract each other; otherwise they repel each other. Electrics contain the electric fluid in consequence of the electricity existing in the compound: a part of this must be attached to the surface of the electric, but not in its elastic state, since when brought so near as to be attracted, its particles are subjected to their own mutual action, and hence the repulsion occasioned by its combination with the other ingredient of the fluid is overcome by the redoubled attraction; the electric fluid is thus partially decomposed, and the electricity attaches itself to the surface of the Theory of Electric. Thus the electric fluid may appear in two states; elastic when entire, and unelastic when partially decomposed.\n\nThe electricity may be rendered unelastic in several ways, as by friction, by which the electric fluid contained in the air is forced into closer contact, thus producing a decomposition of the fluid, and causing its electricity to unite with the surface of the rubbed body. This operation may be compared to the forcible wetting of a dry sponge, or of some powder, as that of the puff hall, which, when dry, do not easily imbibe moisture; but when wetted by mechanical compression, retain it very forcibly. The electricity unites with bodies in this way during several operations of nature, as in the melting and cooling of some substances in contact with electrics; and it may be thus forcibly united to the surface of electrics by means of metallic coatings, into which the fluid is forced by the skilful management of its mutual repulsions. This operation, again, was compared by Mr. Ruffel to the condensation of the moisture of humid air on a cold pane of glass; and the evacuation of fluids from the other side of the coated pane he compared to the evaporation of the moisture from the other side of the cold pane, in consequence of the heat that was extricated from the condensed vapour.\n\nThe analogy that exists between electricity and calorific, has induced some to apply to the former the doctrine of capacity, so ingeniously applied to calorific by Dr. Crawford. This doctrine seems to be one of the fundamental principles of Mr. Wilkinson's theory of electricity; the substance of which is contained in the following extract.\n\n\"From some experiments, I am induced to suppose, Mr. Wilkinson, that electricity is universally diffused, but not equally; for, hypothesizing that those bodies are the best conductors which contain the greatest quantity, and those the best non-conductors which contain the least.—Thus metallic bodies are the best conductors; all fluids, except air and oil, are also conductors. The disposition in the body to retain electricity may be termed its capacity.\n\nWhen conducting bodies undergo any change, if by such change their capacities become altered, then signs of electricity are evinced.\n\nIf the change should be of such a nature, that their capacity for electricity becomes increased, the substance will be in a state of abstracting it from surrounding bodies, and therefore will evince negative signs; the same as frigorific mixtures produce negative signs of heat.\n\nIf, in the change it undergoes, the capacity of the substance for electricity is diminished, it gives out a portion of its natural quantity, and evinces positive signs, or a state of superabundance.\n\nWhen any substance, in the change it undergoes, gives out electricity, it becomes proportionally diminished in its conducting powers; so, on the contrary, when it acquires an increase, it increases also its powers as a conductor.\n\nThus a metallic substance, which is a good conductor, when oxidated is a very imperfect one. In the change from its reguline state to a calx, electricity is given out.\"\nThis capacity for electricity is not regulated by any known laws, such as the densities or the specific gravities of the bodies.\n\nIn many substances, the conducting power seems to depend on the addition of other principles; thus wood, when a conductor, is so in consequence of the moisture it contains; when deprived of it by drying, it resists the passage of electricity.\n\nWhat this peculiar change may be, is difficult to conceive; but when electric bodies become partial conductors, it seems to be effected by the agency of heat.\n\nWhen the pressing action is very considerable, as in the case of metallic bodies, great quantities of heat are extricated. Thus a nail, when struck violently, soon exhibits signs of considerable warmth; the caloric infused in its interstices is exuded on the surface, in consequence of the approximation of the constituent particles of the iron.\n\nWhether the caloric diffused in the interstices, or combined with the body, is given out by pressure, is a fact difficult to determine. Those substances which are non-conductors, and consequently capable, from excitation, of giving out signs of electricity, do not all of them lose their power, when freed from the rubbing action. Those bodies which are usually termed refractory, continue for a certain space of time in their conducting state, until they are equalized with the surrounding air; and, continuing in a disposition to abstract electricity from surrounding bodies, will therefore evince negative signs (1).\n\nThe doctrine of bodies having different capacities for electricity was ingeniously employed by Mr G. Morgan to account for the effects produced on electrics by friction.\n\n\"If (says he) we admit the corporeal nature of that which is hence with accuracy called the electric fluid, let us attend to the necessary consequences of what we admit:—1st. That the electric fluid, like all other corporeal substances, is capable of attracting, and of being attracted. 2d. That in consequence of this capacity, it enters into an union with other bodies, and that as the nature of the substances to which it is united may vary, so the degree of force by which it is united may show an equal variety. 3d. That when the electric fluid is separated from any body, this separation must be the effect of lessening the force by which it was united to that body, and thus giving the attractive force of another body the superiority; or it must be the effect of very much increasing the force of the third body, and thus destroying the equilibrium.\n\nSuppose that any body, A, should be capable of uniting to itself, or suppose the law of its constitution were such as to admit of its attaching, fifty particles of the electric fluid to itself, when near or in contact with another body, B, which likewise has an attraction to those particles; now, in case any such change should take place as would add twenty particles to B, and leave thirty only in A, this change, it is evident, must proceed either from a diminution of A's attracting force, or from an adequate increase of force in B. Having deduced, from the corporeal nature of the electric fluid, such consequences as show that when it is separated from a body, it must proceed from a diminution of attractive force in the body that yields, or an increase of the same force in the body that takes; let us now examine how friction is likely to be the cause of such changes.\n\nBy attending to the nature of friction, we shall find it to be nothing more than a succession of prelure or contacts of the different parts of different substances against each other; and the question in the present case is this:—whether contact is necessarily attended with a change of attractive force in the different substances which are brought together? or whether the close union of a particle of silk, hair, leather, &c., to a particle of glass, may be attended with a change of capacity in those bodies to retain the electric fluid?—If this question be admitted, I think the particular mode in which friction operates is easily discovered.\n\nBriefly my idea of the manner in which friction operates, is this: when two electrics are pressed closely together, while they continue together, they become capable of taking more, or retaining less; and if this be allowed, I think the various appearances of bodies in a state of excitation are easily accounted for.\n\nHowever, it may be asked, if the change produced in the surfaces of two bodies be the effect merely of bringing the bodies nearer together; why does not contact alone produce the same effect? I must answer, that the several instances of spontaneous electricity enumerated by Wilcke, Äpinus, and others, appear to me to be so many evidences of the preceding theory. In these instances we see the excitation of surfaces take place in such circumstances as will not rationally admit of any other cause than simple contact.\n\nIt is evident, I think, that contact alone is adequate to the production of electricity. I would add, that in the only case where contact may be applied most completely, electricity is produced in a most remarkable degree.—By Bennet's new electroscope, we find that the slightest evaporation (which is certainly the union of watery with ærial particles) produces immediate signs of electricity. How rationally all the electrical appearances of our atmosphere may be ascribed to the same source, will be shown more fully hereafter.\n\nBefore I quit this subject, I would explain to you the reasons why, in many cases, agreeably to the preceding hypothesis, friction is necessarily much more powerful in its effects than prelure.\n\nSuppose\n\n(1) Mr Coulomb endeavours to prove that the electric fluid is not distributed among conducting bodies in contact by chemical affinity, but merely by its repulsive motion.\n\nWhen two bodies, equal and similar, placed in contact, are tolerably perfect conductors, such as the metals, the electricity communicated from one to the other is in an instant divided equally between them; but when one of the bodies is an imperfect conductor, as a plain of paper, it will take some time before the paper receives the half of the electricity of the metal. In all cases, however, the electricity is equally divided. Vid. Mem. de l'Acad. Roy. de Paris, pour 1786. p. 69.\nSuppose A to be a particle of silk, brought into contact with a particle of glass, which I call B; by the increase of attraction consequent upon the union, the combined bodies become capable of attracting a portion of the fluid, which I say, is equal to five. Now A is no sooner separated from B, than another particle of silk comes in contact, and produces a similar effect. The portion accumulated is now ten. A third comes into successive contact with B, and adds to the accumulation; and while the rubbing goes on, a series of successive effects is produced by a series of successive unions and separations; for A is no sooner separated from B, than it is brought into that state in which it was before the union, and consequently disposed to part with what it gained by the union. Now if you suppose A and B, instead of being single particles, to be surfaces, all of whose parts operate at the same time, you may easily perceive how the effect would be increased.\n\nIn the preceding case, I described the capacity of A and B to be enlarged by their union. If it had been lessened, the subsequent effects would have been sufficient; for, in such a case, after the dissolution of their contact, they would be disposed to receive or retake what they had lost by their union. But I will speculate no longer on the consequences of friction, as elucidated from the supposed corporeal nature of the electric fluid, and from the changes supposed to take place on the attractive force of different bodies when brought into very close contact with each other.*\n\n* Morgan's Lectures, vol. i.\n\nSig. Brugnatelli, from the chemical properties of the supposed electric fluid, and, from several experiments which he has made upon the subject, concludes that it should be ranked among the acids. This fluid, says he, reddens the tincture of turpentine, which as the fluid diffuses returns again to a blue colour; it penetrates the metals, oxidizes them, and produces hydrogen gas. In fine, it possesses all the properties of an acid. He therefore denominates it the electric or oxi-electric acid, and of course the salts which are formed by its combination with fusible bases, are called electrats. On some of these he makes the following observations.\n\n1. The electrat of gold is formed of small, brilliant, and transparent points.\n2. The electrat of silver consists of small prismatic crystals, terminated by fixed pyramids, which are limpid and transparent, and strongly reflect the light. They are tasteless and insoluble in water.\n3. The electrat of copper consists of cubical transparent crystals, which dissolve in the acid with effervescence. The crystals are of a beautiful green colour.\n4. The electrat of iron is of a reddish yellow colour, and opaque.\n5. The electrat of zinc is opaque, and of a grayish colour.\n\nThe electric acid, according to this author, is not decomposed, when it oxidizes the metals, but the oxygen required for their oxidation, is derived from the water employed in his experiments.\n\nHaving thus considered pretty fully the chemical nature of the electric fluid, we shall return to its mechanical properties, and endeavour to ascertain the law by which its particles act on each other, and how it is distributed in bodies of various figures, and in various relations.\n\nIt was long a desideratum among electricians to discover the law of action according to which the particles of the electric fluid attract and repel each other. AE. Electricity. Principia, we have seen, states no other law than that the action decreases according to the distance increases. Mr Cavendish suspected, but did not prove either by demonstration or experiment, that the action of electricity was, like that of gravitation, inversely as the square of the distance.\n\nLord Stanhope attempted to prove that this was the law of electric action, both experimentally and mathematically, and concluded from the result of both his experiments and reasoning, that the supposition was just. But Dr Robison did not consider the experiment of Lord Stanhope, as sufficiently accurate, or sufficiently detailed, to warrant the conclusions that his Lordship had drawn.\n\nThat eminent philosopher, nearly 40 years ago, made of Electricity, Parts iv. v. and vi. were attended with results similar to those of Lord Stanhope.\n\nDr Robison's experiments were made with the assistance of his excellent electrometer, which he describes in No. 266. The mode of using this instrument is as follows.\n\nThe body whose electricity is to be examined is connected with the electrometer by a wire, the end of which is inserted into the hole at F, and made to touch the end of the needle. Now the index is to be turned to the right by the handle I, till it come to 90. In this position LA, and consequently CB, is horizontal; and the moveable ball B rests on A and moves with it. The balls being now electrified, the handle is turned back till the index arrive at 90, from which it set out. If during this motion the balls be noticed, it will be found that in some position of the index they will separate. Bring them again together, and again separate them, till the exact point of separation be ascertained. This will give their repulsion when in contact, or at the distance of their centres. Then turn the index still more to the vertical position, and the balls will separate still more. Let an afflant now move the long index till it become parallel to the stalk of the electrometer, which will be known by its hiding the latter from his view. If the stalk be poised, by laying a weight of some grains on the cork ball D, till the stalk become horizontal and nicely balanced, we know exactly the weight that denotes the degree of repulsion that will cause the balls to separate when in the horizontal position, by computing for the proportional lengths of BC and DC. Then, by a very simple computation, we shall find the weight denoting the degree of repulsion with which they separate in any oblique position of the stalk, and again, by the revolution of forces, we find the degree of repulsion with which the balls separate when AL is oblique, and BC makes with it any given angle.\n\nThe intention of Dr Robison's experiments was to ascertain the law of repulsion of two small spheres, as whatever was the law of distribution of the particles in a sphere, which we shall consider presently, the general action of its particles on those of another sphere will not differ materially from the law of action between two particles, if the spheres are very small in proportion to their distance.\n\nThe result of the experiments was that the mutual repulsion...\nTheory of repulsion of two small spheres, electrified either positively or negatively, was very nearly inversely as the square of the distance of their centres, or a little greater. Thus, if we express the distance by \\( x \\), the law of repulsion was as nearly as possible \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\). One of the balls being much larger than the other appeared to cause no difference in the results.\n\nRepeating the experiment with balls electrified oppositely, and which of course attracted each other, the results obtained were not quite so regular; but the general result was a deviation from the above law rather less than in the preceding case, this being in defect, while that was in excess.\n\nSir Isaac Newton has demonstrated, (Princip. lib. i. pr. 74,) that if particles of matter act on each other with a force in the inverse duplicate ratio of the distances, spheres composed of such particles and of equal density at equal distances, will act on each other according to the same law. He has demonstrated that the same holds in the case of hollow spherical shells, and that these act on each other in the same manner as if all their matter were crowded into their centres; and he has farther demonstrated, that if the law of action between the particles be different from what has been stated, the action of spheres or spherical shells will also be different.\n\nM. Coulomb of the French academy made a number of most valuable experiments for the purpose of ascertaining this point, and obtained the same results.\n\nThis distinguished academician has published in the memoirs of the Royal Academy at Paris for 1784, 1785, 1786, and 1787, papers which rank him very high among those who have contributed to advance the science of electricity.\n\nIn the Memoirs for 1785 appeared the papers that contain the experiments by which he proved the law of electric action. These we cannot here pretend to detail, but the result is highly satisfactory. They were made with the assistance of a very delicate electrometer, the construction of which we shall describe under the article Electrometer.\n\nThe reader may satisfy himself very nearly of the truth of this law by the following simple experiment.\n\nA, fig. 102, is the convex extremity of an excited surface. BC is a metallic rod, delicately suspended on the point E. CF is designed to contain any weight which may be applied to the extremity of the rod. The apparatus should be as light as possible, and is best made of reed and cork covered with tinfoil.\n\nWhile the surface A is in an excited state, B is brought within a certain distance of it, and the weight moved by its influence is carefully observed. A similar observation is then made at a second, a third, and a fourth distance.\n\nVarieties will be discovered in the result of these observations, proceeding from the impossibility of keeping the surface for any considerable time in the same state of excitation. These varieties, however, are trifling; and in a vast number of experiments, the weight will diminish very nearly in the duplicate ratio of the increased distance.\n\nWe may now safely conclude that the law of electric action is like that of gravitation, so that electrified bodies attract or repel each other with a force that is inversely as the square of the distance. The affirming of this important law is of infinite consequence. It affords us a full conviction of the truth of the propositions respecting the action of bodies that are overcharged at one end, and undercharged at the other. It renders certain what we could formerly infer only from a reasonable probability. We now see that the curve described in No. 338, must really have its convexity turned towards the axis, and that \\( Z + x' \\) will always be greater than \\( Z' + x \\).\n\nWe now proceed to consider the manner in which the electric fluid is distributed, when it is redundant or deficient in bodies; and for this purpose we cannot do better than lay before the reader the following series of propositions, chiefly taken from Mr Cavendish's paper, but accommodated to the true law of action above laid down.\n\n**Lemma I.**—Let the whole space comprehended between two parallel planes, infinitely extended each way, be filled with uniform matter, the repulsion of whose particles is inversely as the square of the distance; the plate of matter formed thereby will repel a particle of matter with exactly the same force, at whatever distance from it it be placed.\n\nFor, suppose that there are two such plates, of equal thickness, placed parallel to each other, let \\( A \\), fig. 103, be any point not placed in or between the two plates; let \\( BCD \\) represent any part of the nearest plate; draw the lines \\( AB, AC, \\) and \\( AD \\), cutting the furthest plate in \\( b, c, \\) and \\( d \\); for it is plain that if they cut one plate, they must, if produced, cut the other: the triangle \\( BCD \\), is to the triangle \\( bcd \\), as \\( AB^2 \\) to \\( Ab^2 \\); therefore a particle of matter at \\( A \\) will be repelled with the same force by the matter in the triangle \\( BCD \\), as by that in \\( bcd \\). Whence it appears, that a particle at \\( A \\) will be repelled with as much force by the nearest plate, as by the more distant; and consequently will be impelled with the same force by either plate, at whatever distance from it it be placed.\n\n**Cor. 1.**—The same will be true of the action of plates of equal thickness and equal density, or of such thickness and density as to contain quantities of matter or fluid proportional to their areas.\n\n**Cor. 2.**—The action of all such sections made by parallel planes, or by planes equally inclined to their axis, is equal.\n\n**Cor. 3.**—The tendency of a particle to a plane, or plate of uniform thickness and density, and infinitely extended, is the same, at whatever distance it be placed from the plate, and it is always perpendicular to it.\n\n**Cor. 4.**—This tendency is proportional to the density and thickness of the plate or plates jointly.\n\n**Problem 1.**—In fig. 104, let the parallel lines \\( Aa, Bb, \\) &c., represent parallel planes infinitely extended each way; let the spaces \\( AD \\) and \\( EH \\) be filled with uniform solid matter: let the electric fluid in each of these spaces be moveable and unable to escape: and let all the rest of the matter in the universe be saturated with immoveable fluid. It is required to determine in what manner the fluid will be disposed in the spaces \\( AD \\) and \\( EH \\), according as one or both of them are over or undercharged.\n\nLet \\( AD \\) be that space which contains the greatest quantity\nTheory of quantity of redundant fluid, if both spaces are overcharged, or which contains the least redundant matter, if both are undercharged; or if one is overcharged, and the other undercharged, let AD be the overcharged one. Then, first, There will be two spaces, AB and GH, which will either be entirely deprived of fluid, or in which the particles will be pressed close together; namely, if the whole quantity of fluid in AD and EH together, is less than sufficient to saturate the matter therein, they will be entirely deprived of fluid; the quantity of redundant matter in each being half the whole redundant matter in AD and EH together; but if the fluid in AD and EH together is more than sufficient to saturate the matter, the fluid in AB and GH will be pressed close together; the quantity of redundant fluid in each being half the whole redundant fluid in both spaces. 2dly, In the space CD the fluid will be pressed close together; the quantity of fluid therein being such as to leave just enough fluid in BC to saturate the matter therein. 3dly, The space EF will be entirely deprived of fluid; the quantity of matter therein being such, that the fluid in FG shall be sufficient to saturate the matter therein; consequently, the redundant fluid in CD will be just sufficient to saturate the redundant matter in EF. And 4thly, The spaces BC and FG will be saturated in all parts.\n\nCor. 1.—If the two plates be equally overcharged, all the redundant fluid will be crowded on the remote surfaces, and the adjacent surfaces will be in their natural state.\n\nCor. 2.—If the redundant fluid in the one be just sufficient to saturate the redundant matter in the other, the two remote surfaces will be in their natural state, all the redundant fluid being crowded in the stratum CcD, and all the redundant matter being in EeF.\n\nLemma II.—Let BDE be a sphere, whose center is D; if the space BB is filled with uniform matter, whose particles repel with a force inversely as the square of the distance, a particle placed anywhere within the space BB, as at P, will be repelled with as much force in one direction as another, or it will not be impelled in any direction. This is demonstrated in Newt. Princip. lib. i. prop. 70. It follows also from his demonstration, that if the repulsion is inversely as some higher power of the distance than the square, the particle P will be impelled towards the centre; and if the repulsion is inversely as some lower power than the square, it will be impelled from the centre.\n\nProblem 2.—Let the sphere BDE be filled with uniform solid matter, overcharged with electric fluid; let the fluid therein be moveable, but not able to escape from it; let the fluid in the rest of infinite space be moveable, and sufficient to saturate the matter therein; and let the matter in the whole of infinite space, or at least in the space BB, whose dimensions will be given below, be uniform and solid: it is required to determine in what manner the fluid will be disposed both within and without the globe.\n\nTake the space BB, such that the interfaces between the particles of matter therein shall be just sufficient to hold a quantity of electric fluid, whose particles are pressed close together so as to touch each other, equal to the whole redundant fluid in the globe, besides the quantity requisite to saturate the matter in BB; and take the space BB, such that the matter therein shall be just able to saturate the redundant fluid in the globe: then in all parts of the space BB, the fluid will be pressed close together, so that its particles shall touch each other: the space BB will be entirely deprived of fluid; and in the space CB, and all the rest of infinite space, the matter will be exactly saturated.\n\nCor. 1.—If the globe BDE is undercharged, everything else being the same as before, there will be a space BB, in which the matter will be entirely deprived of fluid, and a space BB in which the fluid will be pressed close together; the matter in BB being equal to the whole redundant matter in the globe, and the redundant fluid in BB being just sufficient to saturate the matter in BB; and in all the rest of space the matter will be exactly saturated, exactly similar to the foregoing.\n\nCor. 2.—The fluid in the globe BDE will be disposed in exactly the same manner, whether the fluid without is immovable, and disposed in such manner, that the matter shall be everywhere saturated, or whether it is disposed as above described; and the fluid without the globe will be disposed in just the same manner, whether the fluid within is disposed uniformly, or whether it is disposed as above described.\n\nLet BC, fig. 106, be a cylindrical conducting body, and A an overcharged body. Draw bc parallel to BC, and draw BB, CC, PP, &c., perpendicular to BC, to represent the uniform density of the fluid, when BC is in its natural state; and let BD, CR, PS, &c., represent the unequal densities at different points, while it is opposed to the overcharged body A. Now these ordinates will be bounded by a line dnr, cutting the line bc in n, a point in the line nN drawn perpendicular to N, the neutral point of the conductor. The whole quantity of fluid in BC will be represented by the parallelogram bce, CB; but this must be equal to the space BC nd; again, the redundant fluid in any portion, as PC or PN, may be represented by the spaces pirc, or tpe, and the deficient fluid in any portion BQ, may be represented by the space bdoq. Now, the action of BC on any body placed near it, will entirely depend on the space contained between the curve line and the axis bc. With respect to this curve, the only circumstance that we can ascertain, is that variations of curvature at every point are proportional to the forces exerted by the spherical body A; and are, therefore, inversely as the squares of the distances from A, as will be shown presently. The exact place of the point n, and the length of the ordinates, will vary according to the diameter of the conductor. We shall at present consider only the simplest case, or that where the conductor is of no sensible diameter, like a very fine wire.\n\nLet such a slender conducting canal be represented by AE, fig. 107, and let BB, CC, EE, &c., represent the density of the contained fluid, this being kept in a canal near the state of unequal density by its repulsion for some overlying uniform charged body. Now, a particle at C is impelled in the direction CE by all the fluid that is on the side of A; and it is impelled in the direction CA by all the fluid on the side of E. The moving force will arise from the difference of these repelling forces. When the diameter of the canal continues the same, this will arise from the difference of density only. Therefore, the force of the element at E may be expressed by the excess of D above Cc + the action at the distance CD.\nDraw \\( \\beta e \\) parallel to \\( AE \\); then the force of the element \\( E \\) may be expressed by the formula\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2}{c^2} x,\n\\]\n\nand this is the force repelling the particle in the direction \\( CA \\).\n\nTake \\( CF = CD \\); the force at \\( F \\) will be expressed by\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f \\phi}{c^2} x, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{f \\phi}{c^2} x,\n\\]\n\nand this force also impels the particle in the direction \\( CA \\). The joint action of the two is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 + f \\phi}{c^2} x.\n\\]\n\nIf \\( b c e \\) were a straight line, \\( d^2 + f \\phi \\) would always be proportional to \\( c^2 \\), and might be expressed by \\( m \\times c^2 \\), \\( m \\) denoting some number that expresses what part of \\( c^2 \\) the sum of \\( d^2 \\) and \\( f \\phi \\) is equal to, suppose \\( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\ldots \\), &c. But in the present case \\( d^2 + f \\phi \\) is not always proportional to \\( c^2 \\), for \\( d^2 \\) does not increase so fast as \\( c^2 \\), while \\( f \\phi \\) increases faster.\n\nWe may, however, without any sensible error, express the accelerating force tending towards \\( A \\), in the neighbourhood of any point \\( C \\), by\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m c^2}{c^2} x,\n\\]\n\nthat is, by\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{x},\n\\]\n\nwhich is the fluxion of the area of a hyperbola \\( HDG \\), of which \\( CC' \\) and \\( CK \\) are asymptotes. The whole action of the fluid between \\( F \\) and \\( D \\) may be expressed by the area \\( C'CDD'H \\). Hence, the action of the smaller conceivable portion of the canal that joins to \\( C \\) on either side, or the difference of the actions of the two adjacent elements, is equal to the action of all beyond it. The state of compression is therefore scarcely affected by anything at a sensible distance from \\( C \\), and the density of the fluid in an indefinitely small canal is uniform.\n\nHaving thus found that the fluid in very small canals is very nearly of an uniform density, we may now proceed to examine the communication of electricity by means of conducting canals; which forms one of the most important parts of the theory.\n\nLet us suppose that the body \\( A \\) communicates by the canal \\( EF \\), with another body \\( D \\), placed on the contrary side of it from \\( B \\), as in fig. 108, and let these two bodies be either saturated, or over or undercharged; and let the fluid within them be in equilibrium. Let now the body \\( B \\) be overcharged: it is plain that some fluid will be driven from the nearer part \\( MN \\) to the further part \\( RS \\); and also some fluid will be driven from \\( RS \\), through the canal, to the body \\( D \\); so that the quantity of fluid in \\( D \\) will be increased thereby, and the quantity in \\( A \\), taking the whole body together, will be diminished; the quantity in the part near \\( MN \\) will also be diminished; but whether the quantity in the part near \\( RS \\) will be diminished or not, does not appear for certain; but probably it will be not much altered.\n\nCor.—In like manner, if \\( B \\) is made undercharged, some fluid will flow from \\( D \\) to \\( A \\), and also from that part of \\( A \\) near \\( RS \\), to the part near \\( MN \\).\n\nSuppose now that the bodies \\( A \\) and \\( D \\) communicate by the bent canal \\( MPNPM \\) (fig. 109.) instead of the straight one \\( EF \\): let the bodies be either saturated or over or undercharged as before; and let the fluid be at rest; then, if the body \\( B \\) is made overcharged, some fluid will still run out of \\( A \\) into \\( D \\); provided the repulsion of \\( B \\) on the fluid in the canal is not too great.\n\nThe repulsion of \\( B \\) on the fluid in the canal, will at first drive some fluid out of the leg \\( MP \\) into \\( A \\), and out of \\( NP \\) into \\( D \\), till the quantity of fluid in that part of the canal which is nearest to \\( B \\) is so much diminished, and its repulsion on the rest of the fluid in the canal is so much diminished also, as to compensate the repulsion of \\( B \\); but as the leg \\( NP \\) is longer than the other, the repulsion of \\( B \\) on the fluid in it will be greater; consequently some fluid will run out of \\( A \\) into \\( D \\), on the same principle that water is drawn out of a vessel through a syphon; but if the repulsion of \\( B \\) on the fluid in the canal is so great as to drive all the fluid out of the space \\( GPH \\) \\( G \\), so that the fluid in the leg \\( MGPM \\) does not join to that in \\( NHPN \\); then it is plain that no fluid can run out of \\( A \\) into \\( D \\); any more than water will run out of a vessel through a syphon, if the height of the bend of the syphon above the water in the vessel, is greater than that to which water will rise in vacuo.\n\nThis is Mr Cavendish's reasoning; but Dr Robison objects to it, that in these cases the fluid does not move on the principle of a syphon, and that there is nothing to prevent the fluid from expanding in \\( GPH \\). He was therefore of opinion, that it would always move from \\( A \\) to \\( D \\) over the bend.\n\nCor.—If \\( AB \\) is made undercharged, some fluid will run out of \\( D \\) into \\( A \\); and that though the attraction of \\( B \\) on the fluid in the canal is ever so great.\n\nWe shall now consider the action of electrified bodies on the canal of communication, in some of the most important cases. But, as we are confined in our limits, and have much important matter yet to treat of, we must content ourselves, with enumerating facts without proving them by rigid demonstration.\n\nLet \\( ACa \\), fig. 110, represent a thin conducting plate, seen edgewise, to the centre of which the slender canal \\( CP \\) is perpendicular. It is required to determine the action exerted by the fluid, or matter, uniformly disposed over the plate, on the fluid moveable in \\( PC \\).\n\n1. To find the action of a particle at \\( C \\) on the fluid in the whole canal. Join \\( AP \\), and let \\( CP \\) be denoted by \\( x \\), \\( AP \\) by \\( y \\), and \\( AC \\) by \\( r \\). Also, let \\( f \\) represent the intensity of action at the distance \\( r \\) of the scale from which the lines are measured.\n\nThe action of \\( AmP \\) is \\( \\frac{f}{y^2} \\), and it may be demonstrated that the action of \\( A \\) on the whole of \\( CP \\) is\n\n\\[\nf \\left( \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{1}{y} \\right) = f \\left( \\frac{y - r}{ry} \\right).\n\\]\n\n2. To find the action of the plate whose diameter is \\( Aa \\) on a particle at \\( P \\).\n\nLet \\( a \\) denote the area of a circle whose diameter is \\( = 1 \\). The action required will be expressed by the fluent \\( 2fa \\left( 1 - \\frac{x}{y} \\right) \\).\n\nCor.—If \\( PC \\) be very small in comparison of \\( AC \\), the action will be nearly the same as if the plate was infinite.\n\n3. To find the action of the plate on the whole column. This will be expressed by the fluent \\( 2fa \\left( x + r - y \\right) \\).\nOur mathematical readers, who are familiar with the method of fluxions, (and to no others will these theorems be intelligible), will readily see the meaning of these expressions.\n\nThe following geometrical construction will render the action of the plate for the whole column, or its parts, more familiar, and more easily remembered.\n\nProduce PC till CK is = CA, and with the centre P, describe the arch AI, crossing CK in I. Then the electrical action will be expressed by \\(2fa \\times IK\\); and this expression represents a cylinder whose radius is r of the scale, and whose height is \\(= 2IK\\).\n\nAgain, about the centre p, with the distance \\(rA\\), describe the arch Ai, cutting CH in i. Then we have \\(2fa \\times IK\\), expressing the action of the plate on the column C, and \\(fa \\times 1i\\), expressing its action on Pp.\n\nBy the formula \\(2fa \\times IK\\), is meant, that the action exerted by the whole plate on PC is the same as if all the fluid in the cylinder expressed by \\(a \\times 2IK\\) were placed at the distance from the acting particle denoted by i.\n\nCor. 1.—If PC is very great compared with AC, the action is nearly the same as it would be if the column were infinitely extended.\n\nCor. 2.—If besides, another column \\(pC\\) is very small when compared with AC, the action on PC will be to that on \\(pC\\), as \\(pC\\) to AC nearly.\n\nThe redundant fluid cannot be uniformly diffused over the whole plate, as we have hitherto supposed, since the mutual repulsion of its particles will render it denser at the circumference. As it is difficult to determine the variation of density, we shall only state the result of the extreme case, where the whole redundant fluid is crowded into the circumference of the plate.\n\nThe action of the fluid in the canal is now \\(fa(r - \\frac{r^2}{y})\\), and the whole action of the fluid crowded into the circumference will be \\(fa(r^2) \\times \\left(\\frac{y - r}{ry}\\right)\\)\n\n\\(= fa(r^2) \\times \\left(\\frac{y - r}{y}\\right)\\). This may be thus represented geometrically. Describe the quadrant CbBE, crossing AP in B, and Ap in b. Draw BD and bd parallel to PC. Now, PB is \\(= y - r\\), and DC \\(= r(y - r)\\). The expression \\(fa(r^2) \\times \\left(\\frac{y - r}{y}\\right)\\) will therefore denote a cylinder whose radius is r, and height DC, multiplied by f.\n\nAgain, \\(DC\\) will be the height of the cylinder expressing the action on \\(pC\\), and \\(Dd\\) that of the cylinder expressing the action on Pp.\n\nCor. 1.—If CP is very great compared with CA, D is very near to A, and I to C, and CD has to IK very nearly the ratio of equality.\n\nCor. 2.—But if the column \\(pC\\) is very short, the action of the fluid uniformly diffused over the plate, is to the action of the fluid crowded into the circumference nearly as \\(4AC\\) to \\(pC\\).\n\nFrom this corollary we see that the recess of the fluid towards the circumference, has a much less effect on short columns than on long ones, i.e. the action in the former case will be much less diminished. Any external force that tends to impel fluid along the canal, and from thence to diffuse it over the plate, will impel a greater quantity to the plate when the fluid of the Theory of plate is crowded into the circumference, than if it were uniformly diffused over the plate, and this difference will be greater when the canal is short.\n\nLastly, When KL is equal to AP, or PL to KI, the repulsion exerted by the whole fluid of the plate, collected in K, on the fluid in the canal CL, is equal to the repulsion of the same fluid, when crowded into the circumference, on the column CP.\n\nCor. 1.—When CP is very long in comparison with AC or KC, the actions of the two fluids in both the above situations is nearly equal.\n\nCor. 2.—The action exerted by the whole fluid on the column CP, when uniformly diffused, is to its action when collected in K, as \\(2IK\\) to CD.\n\nCor. 3.—If CNO be a spherical surface, or a spherical shell, of the same diameter and thickness with the plate Aa, and containing redundant fluid of uniform density, the action exerted by this fluid on the column CL is equal to twice the action of the fluid on the column CP, when the fluid is uniformly diffused over the plate, and to four times its action on the same column, when it is crowded into the circumference.\n\nLet there be two circular plates, represented edgewise at DE, de, fig. 111., or two spherical shells ABO, two plates abo, of the same diameters and thicknesses with the connected plates, containing redundant fluid of uniform density, infinitely extended, perpendicular to their surfaces and passing through their centres, and let the fluid in these canals be of uniform density and equally diffused.\n\nIt may be demonstrated that the repulsions exerted by the fluid in the plates or spheres on the canals are as the diameters of the plates or spheres.\n\nCor. 1.—When the canals are very long compared to the diameters of the spheres or plates, the repulsions are nearly in the same proportion.\n\nCor. 2.—The more the length of the canals diminishes when compared with the diameters of the plates or spheres, the more the repulsions approach to equality.\n\nCor. 3.—When the density of the fluid in two spherical shells is inversely as their diameters, the repulsions of the contained fluid on a column of fluid infinitely extended, will be equal.\n\nCor. 4.—When the quantities of redundant fluid in two spheres are proportional to their diameters, the repulsions exerted by them on a canal infinitely extended are equal.\n\nCor. 5.—If there be two overcharged spheres, or spherical shells, as ABO, ab, fig. 112., that communicate by a conducting canal infinitely extended, the quantities of redundant fluid they contain are proportional to their diameters; and they will be nearly so if the canals be very long.\n\nCor. 6.—When the spheres of conducting matter are in equilibria, the pressures exerted by the fluid on their surfaces are nearly proportional to their diameters.\n\nIt follows from this corollary that the tendency of fluid to escape from such spheres is, ceteris paribus, inversely as the diameters.\n\nLet there be four circular plates, as HK, AB, DF, LM, fig. 113., equal and parallel to each other, and let two of them, AB and HK, communicate by an indefinite...\nTheory of definite canal GC perpendicular to their planes and palling through their centres; let DF and LM communicate in like manner by the canal EN, both canals being in the same straight line: let HK be overcharged, and LM just saturated. It is required to determine the disposition of the fluid, and its proportion in the plates, so that the above condition may be possible and permanent, while all is in equilibrio?\n\nAs HK and AB communicate and are equal, as HK is overcharged, AB will be so also, and in the same degree, and the fluid will be similarly disposed in both. HK and AB being in this situation, if DF and LM be brought near them to within the distance CE, as in the figure, the redundant fluid in AB will act on the moveable fluid in DF, and force some of it along the canal EN into LM, rendering this latter overcharged. Now, if this redundant fluid in LM be taken off, the repulsion which LM was beginning to exert on the canal NE, will be diminished or destroyed. Hence, more fluid will move from DF into LM, and this will again be overcharged. The redundant fluid in LM may again be taken off, but in less quantity than before, and so on repeatedly, till no more can be taken off. DF will thus be rendered undercharged, or will contain redundant matter. This will act on the fluid in GC, and attract it from G, and consequently the fluid will now move from AK into AB, by which HK will be rendered less overcharged, and AB more so than at first. The thus increased redundancy of fluid in AB will act more strongly on the moveable fluid in DF, and repel a part of it into LM as before. DF will thus be again rendered deficient, and by its redundant matter will again act on the canal GC. Thus, by repeatedly touching LM to take off the fluid driven into it from DF, or by allowing LM to communicate with conducting bodies, an equilibrium will be produced; and when this is the case, HK contains a certain quantity of redundant fluid, AB contains redundant fluid in a greater degree, DF contains redundant matter, and LM is in its natural state. The problem may now be reduced to this. To find what proportion the redundant fluid in HK bears to that in AB, and what proportion this latter bears to the deficient fluid in DF?\n\nTo determine these proportions it is necessary that,\n\n1st, The repulsion exerted by the redundant fluid in AB on the fluid in EN be precisely equal to the attraction exerted by the redundant matter of DF on the same canal.\n\n2ndly, The repulsion exerted by the redundant fluid in HK on the whole fluid of the canal GC, balances the excess of the repulsion of the redundant fluid in AB on GC above the attraction of the redundant matter of DF on the same canal.\n\nIf we call the redundant fluid in AB, \\( f \\); the redundant matter in DF, \\( m \\); and the redundant fluid in HK, \\( f' \\); as the fluid in HK and AB is similarly disposed, (they being equal), and as it is probable that the redundant fluid in AB, and the redundant matter in DF, are similarly disposed, it follows, that their actions on the fluid in the canals will be similar, and proportional to their quantities nearly.\n\nLet \\( n \\) be to \\( n \\), as the repulsion exerted by the fluid in AB on the fluid that would occupy CE, to the repulsion exerted by the fluid in AB on the fluid in EN or CG.\n\nAB acts on EN with the force \\( f \\times (n-1) \\); and DF acts on EN with the force \\( m \\); but these actions must balance each other, as LM is inactive. Therefore\n\n\\[\nf \\times (n-1) = mn, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad m = f \\times \\frac{(n-1)^2}{n}.\n\\]\n\nIf \\( f \\) repels the fluid in CG with the force \\( fn \\), \\( m \\) attracts the fluid in CG with the force \\( m \\times (n-1) \\); but as \\( m = f \\times \\frac{(n-1)^2}{n} \\), the attractive force of \\( m \\) for CG will be \\( f \\times \\frac{(n-1)^3}{n} \\times (n-1) \\): Therefore the repulsion of \\( f \\) is to the attraction of \\( m \\), as \\( fn \\) to \\( f \\times \\frac{(n-1)^3}{n} \\)\n\n\\[\n= f^n : f \\times (n-1)^3 = n : n-1^3.\n\\]\n\nLet \\( r \\) denote the repulsion of \\( f \\), and \\( a \\) the attraction of \\( m \\); then \\( r : a = n : (n-1)^3 \\); and \\( r : (r-a) = n : n-1^3 = n : (2n-1) \\).\n\nBut the repulsion of \\( f' = r - a \\); therefore \\( n^3 : (2n-1) = f' : f' \\), and \\( f' = f \\times \\left( \\frac{2n-1}{n^3} \\right) \\); or \\( f = f' \\times \\left( \\frac{n^3}{2n-1} \\right) \\).\n\nIf we suppose \\( n^3 \\) much greater than \\( 2n-1 \\), we shall have the quantity of redundant fluid in AB much greater than that in HK.\n\nWhen EC is very small in proportion to AC, it will appear, on referring back to No. 382., that \\( I \\) is to \\( n \\) nearly as \\( CE : CA \\); and consequently \\( n = AC \\) nearly, and there is so little difference between \\( \\frac{n^3}{2n-1} \\) and \\( \\frac{n^3}{2n-1} \\), that we may take the former for the latter without any material error. Now we have \\( f = f' \\times \\frac{n}{2} \\) very nearly.\n\nSuppose AC to represent 6 inches, and CE \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\)th of an inch, we shall have \\( n = 12a \\) and \\( f = 60f' \\), or more exactly \\( f' = \\left( \\frac{n^3}{2n-1} \\right) = \\frac{14400}{239} = 60 \\frac{4}{5} \\).\n\nThis, it will be remembered, represents the redundant fluid in HK; hence it will appear how great must be the redundancy in HK.\n\nAgain, when AB and DF are very near, \\( n \\) is a large number, and the deficiency in DF is nearly equal to the redundancy in AB. In the above example \\( m \\) is \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\)ths of \\( f' \\), as \\( m = f \\times (n-1) \\).\n\nBut though there is this great deficiency in DF, and redundancy in AB, DF is not electrical on the side next LM, nor is AB more electrical than HK; in short, this case affords another example of bodies being neutral while redundant or deficient, in addition to what was advanced in No. 313, 314.\n\nIt will readily occur to the reader, that cases exactly such as we have now stated never happen in any sensible course of experiment; but when the canals are very long in comparison of the diameters of the plate, and effect, when AB is very near DF, the proportions will not greatly vary.\n\nWe have been very particular in the examination of Mode of rethis case, because it is of great importance, and will afford us in explaining some of the principal phenomena, by degrees.\nIf \\( AB \\) be touched by any body, this body will receive from it a part of its redundant fluid, but only a part; for only so much fluid will quit \\( AB \\) as is sufficient to render it neutral, while the touching body communicates with the ground. This will happen till the redundant matter in \\( DF \\) attracts fluid on the remote side of \\( AB \\) as much as the redundant fluid in \\( AB \\) repels it. The repulsion of \\( AB \\) on \\( EN \\) is now diminished, the attraction of \\( DF \\) will therefore prevail, and this will be no longer neutral. If now \\( DF \\) be touched, it may again be made neutral with respect to \\( EN \\); but \\( AB \\) will again repel the fluid in \\( CG \\), and being redundant on that side will again become electric. \\( AB \\) being touched again, loses more fluid, and \\( DF \\) becomes electric by deficiency. Thus by alternately touching \\( AB \\) and \\( DF \\), the redundancy in \\( AB \\) may be exhausted, and the deficiency in \\( DF \\) supplied.\n\nBut the equilibrium that is thus gradually produced may be effected at once. If we suppose a slender conducting canal \\( abd \\), brought very near the plates on the outside, so that the end \\( a \\) is near to \\( A \\), and \\( d \\) to \\( D \\); the first effect of the vicinity of \\( a \\) to \\( A \\), will be to cause the fluid in \\( ab \\) to recede a little from \\( a \\), by reason of the repulsion of the redundant fluid in \\( AB \\). Thus, redundant matter will be left at \\( a \\), and this will strongly attract redundant fluid from \\( A \\), and \\( a \\) may receive a spark. Should the fluid approach still nearer the surface at \\( A \\), the corresponding part of \\( DF \\) will be rendered more attractive, and by the fluid retiring from \\( a \\) along \\( ab \\), some of the natural fluid of this canal will be pulled towards \\( d \\); this increases the deposition of \\( A \\) to part with fluid, and of \\( d \\) to receive it, while \\( a \\) is disposed to give out and \\( D \\) to receive. Thus all contributes to favour the passage of almost the whole of the redundant fluid in \\( AB \\) to rush from \\( AB \\), by \\( A \\), along \\( abd \\) into \\( DF \\).\n\nIt is also clear that, without the canal \\( abd \\), there is a strong tendency of the fluid in \\( AB \\) for the matter in \\( DF \\), and that, of course, these plates will strongly attract each other.\n\nThe theorems we have now given respecting the deposition of the electric fluid are the result of mathematical reasoning, founded on the hypothetical nature of the fluid, and its assumed law of action. We shall conclude this section with relating the result of M. Coulomb's experiments on this subject, given in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1786 and 1787. M. Coulomb gives the following general theorem.\n\nIn a body of any form, \\( AFBde \\), fig. 114., which is supposed filled with fluid whose particles act on each other with a force that is inversely as the square of the distance, let there be raised a perpendicular \\( ab \\) infinitely small, and let a plane, perpendicular to \\( ab \\) at the point \\( b \\), divide the body into two parts; one \\( dacb \\), infinitely small, the other \\( bAFBc \\), of any determinate dimensions. Then the action of the particles composing the thin slice, estimated in the direction \\( ab \\), on the particle \\( b \\), must be equal to the action of the whole fluid in the rest of the body, if \\( b \\) be supposed at rest. Now, as whatever be the deposition of the fluid, the law of continuity will be the same, it is evident that if we take \\( ab \\) sufficiently small, the difference of the density at \\( a \\) and at \\( c \\) may be infinitely small; and that the action of \\( dcbe \\) will be infinitely near to an equilibrium with that of \\( daeb \\). Hence the action of the fluid in the rest of the body will be reduced to nothing, or will be infinitely small. But this cannot take place when the action of the mass at a finite distance on a particle of fluid, is infinitely small with respect to that of a particle in contact on the same particle, unless we suppose the quantity of fluid at a finite distance nearly nothing. It follows that the whole redundant fluid must be concentrated on the surface, and the interior parts be merely saturated.\n\nM. Coulomb then proceeds to examine the density of the electric fluid in different bodies that are in contact. He first examines the density of two globes of different diameters in contact.\n\nAfter a number of experiments, he gives the result in the following table, representing the manner in which the fluid is distributed between the two globes. The first column shows the proportion of the radii of the globes, the second the proportion of their surfaces, and the third the corresponding proportion of their densities. It must be remarked that this table shows only the proportional density of the globes, when after being separated, the fluid is uniformly diffused over their surfaces.\n\n| 1 | 1 |\n|---|---|\n| 2 | 4 |\n| 4 | 16 |\n| 8 | 64 |\n| infinite | infinite |\n\nThus it appears, that the greater the proportion of the surfaces of the globes, the nearer the proportion of their densities approached to 2, but never attained this.\n\nThis is very different from the proportions between two spheres that communicate by a very long slender canal, which, as was shown in No. 390, contained quantities of fluid proportional to their diameters, and that the densities were inversely as the diameters; and this M. Coulomb found to agree very exactly with experiment.\n\nM. Coulomb next proceeds to examine the density of the fluid in various parts of the surface of the globes in contact, in order to ascertain the distribution.\n\nHis method of proceeding was this. He hung a small circle of gilt paper to a thread of lac, fixed to a cylinder of glass or baked wood; the paper was varnished with some electric substance. The body to be examined was first touched with the paper circle, the electricity of which was then examined by means of his electrometer, and an elimination of the density of the spheres made on the supposition that the circle brought off one half of the electricity of the touched point.\n\nThe result of numerous experiments made with two globes in contact was as follows. The more unequal the globes were, the more the density of the small globe varied from the point of contact to the distance of 180°, and the nearer it approached to uniformity in the large globe, increasing rapidly from the point of contact, where it was 0, to 7° or 8° from that point. Thus, when he placed a sphere of 8 inches in contact with one of two inches, he found the density of the small globe indefinite till about 30° from the point of contact; that at 45° it was nearly the one-fourth of what it was at 90°, and hence it increased in the proportion of...\nTheory of electricity, where it was uniform. In the larger globe, on the other hand, the density was still about 4° or 5°; hence it increased rapidly, and from 3° to 18° it was nearly uniform.\n\nFrom these results we may conclude that Mr Cavendish's mathematical demonstration of the uniform distribution of the fluid in a globe that communicates with another by a slender canal, is conformable to the fact.\n\nA small globe between two equal larger globes, was found to possess the same electricity as the other two, when the proportion of their radii was not more than 5 to 1; when it was greater, the small globe showed no electricity.\n\nThree equal globes being placed in contact, the density in the middle one was $\\frac{1}{1.34}$ of that in the other two. When a small globe, after having been in contact with a larger one that was overcharged, was removed to a very small distance, the electricity of the small globe in the fronting point was opposite to that of the large one, at a little greater distance the small globe was neutral, and still farther off, it was redundant.\n\nWhen the diameters of the globes were 11 and 8 respectively, the small globe at the fronting point was negative, till it was at the distance 1, when it was neutral, and beyond this it was positive. When the diameters were 11 and 4, the neutral distance was 2, and when they were 11 and 2, the distance at which the small globe was neutral was 2½.\n\nIt is indifferent whether the globes be solid, or consist merely of a thin shell. This circumstance is an additional proof of the justness of the theoretical investigation, on the supposition of the fluid being diffused over the surface, leaving the interior parts in a neutral state.\n\n**Sect. II. An Application of the Theory of Aepinus and Cavendish to the principal Phenomena of Electricity.**\n\nOn an attentive consideration of the phenomena that have already passed under our review, and a careful comparison of these with the theory of positive and negative electricity, as improved by Aepinus and Cavendish, it will, we think, appear, that this theory is adequate to the explanation of the facts.\n\nThe comparison of the theory with the experiments may readily be made, and we have already hinted at it in several cases. We cannot, however, pursue this to any extent, and must restrict ourselves in the remainder of this chapter to the more important and interesting phenomena, leaving the rest to be supplied by the reader, for which purpose we have furnished him with ample materials.\n\nWe have already, in our illustration of the theory of Aepinus, so fully considered the phenomena of electric attraction and repulsion in a general view, that little more needs to be done, than to explain a few of the more remarkable cases.\n\nThe phenomena of attraction and repulsion may be reduced to the following simple propositions.\n\n**Prop. I.**—If any body be electrified by any means, and if another body be brought near it, this latter becomes electrified by position.\n\nWe shall illustrate this proposition by the following simple experiment.\n\nLet there be provided three metallic conductors, each supported on an insulating stand, such as A, B, C, fig. 115. Set these in a row, with their extremities touching each other, and at one end of the row, as at c, place a stand, to which is hung a ball electrometer with silk threads. On bringing an excited electric near a, the opposite end of the conductor, the pith ball will approach the end c. Care must, however, be taken not to bring the electric too near a, as to make the ball strike the opposite extremity; as in that case the experiment would come under our second proposition. When the excited electric is removed, the ball retires to its perpendicular situation. The same effect will be produced if the electrometer be placed at the side of the conductor, instead of its extremity, clearly shewing that it is affected by the conductor, and not immediately by the excited electric.\n\nThis is an instance of induced electricity, and is easily explained on the principles mentioned in No. 344. The approach of the excited electric to the end a of the compound conductor, renders this end deficient, if the electric be overcharged, or redundant if it be undercharged; and the opposite extremity is in the contrary state, and hence attracts the ball of the electrometer.\n\nAlthough the opposite extremities of the conductor are in opposite states, the fluid is variously disposed in various parts of the conductor; as may be proved in the following manner. While the excited electric remains near a, take away the two extreme conductors, A and C, or, if only two have been employed, take away the remote one; remove the excited electric, and examine the parts of the conductor separately. The part A will be found entirely negative; if the electric were overcharged, C will be entirely positive; and if three pieces have been employed, the middle piece B will be faintly positive. If the pieces be again united, they will be found devoid of electricity. The same appearances will be more completely seen by forming a conductor of a series of metallic balls, lapsed by silk threads, one of which will be found scarcely electrical.\n\n**Prop. II.**—When an insulated body is brought very near an electrified body, a spark passes between them, and the insulated body becomes electrified permanently by communication, while the electricity of the electrified body is diminished.\n\nIn this case the electricity imparted is of the same kind as that of the electrified body, positive if this were positive, and vice versa. The proposition may be illustrated by the same apparatus of the conductors and electrometers, and scarcely requires an explanation.\n\nWhen the electricity is in a small degree, the spark is either very small or scarcely perceptible, but there is no doubt, that it takes place in all cases. The spark is owing to the sudden transference of a portion of the fluid from the electrified body to the unelectrified body.\n\n**Prop. III.**—When an electrified body has communicated part of its electricity to another body, this latter is repelled, unless it has communicated its acquired store to other bodies.\n\nThe flying feather, the cork balls, and many other experiments related in the first chapter of Part III.\nTheory of amply illustrate this proposition, which expresses one of the most general facts in electricity.\n\nBefore the electrified body has communicated part of its electricity to the body presented to it, this latter is in its natural state; but after the communication, both are either redundant or deficient, and consequently repel each other, as appears from No. 323, 324.\n\nFrom these general propositions we may deduce the following corollaries, an application of which will serve still further to illustrate and explain the phenomena of electric attraction and repulsion.\n\nCor. 1.—The vivacity of the appearances produced by a transference of fluid will be proportional to the quantity of fluid transferred.\n\nCor. 2.—The phenomena of communicated electricity will be more remarkable, the greater the conducting power of the bodies to which it is communicated.\n\nIt will have appeared from numerous experiments related in Part III., especially that of the dancing balls in No. 94, that an imperfect conductor, such as glass, permits the communication of electricity only in the point presented to an electrified body; whereas, when electricity is communicated to one point of a tolerably perfect conductor, such as the prime conductor of a machine, the whole conductor is instantly pervaded, and becomes electrical in every part.\n\nCor. 3.—When an electrified body has a free communication with a perfect conductor, its electricity cannot apparently be communicated to a body touched by it.\n\nFor the mass of the earth, with which the body communicates, bears so great a proportion to the body itself, that when the electricity of the latter is communicated to the former, it becomes imperceptible in both.\n\nCor. 4.—When an unelectrified body is presented to an electrified body, the former is first attracted, comes into contact with the electrified body, and is then repelled.\n\nThis corollary has been illustrated by numerous experiments; we may instance the dancing figures, &c., and the appearances are easily explained. The unelectrified body becomes electrical by induction; in consequence of this, it is attracted to the electrified body, from which it receives a spark, becomes electrified by communication, and being now in the same state with the electrified body, is repelled by it.\n\nIt will probably have been observed, in making the experiment of presenting a feather, or a pith ball, suspended by a string to the prime conductor, that they cling to the conductor, and are not repelled for some time. The reason of this is, that these bodies are imperfect conductors, especially when very dry, and hence their surface is not easily pervaded by the fluid; when this becomes equally diffused, they are repelled. The same circumstance explains why the balls of the common electrometer sometimes adhere together, and then separate with a jerk.\n\nCor. 5.—Electrical attraction and repulsion are not prevented by the interposition of unelectrified non-conducting substances.\n\nA thin plate of glass may be interposed between the conductor and the pith-ball in the experiment of No. 399, and still, though the plate be very extensive, the electrometer will be affected.\n\nNay, an insulated electrified body may be covered with a glass bell, and it will yet attract a ball presented to it.\n\nAs this single circumstance affords one of the best arguments against the hypothesis of material electric atmospheres, which has been maintained, and is still of electric maintained, by some of our most eminent electricians; we shall take this opportunity of giving a brief account of this hypothesis, and stating the reasons which induce us to reject it.\n\nIt has been supposed, that the electric fluid is collected around the surface of an electrified body, forming a kind of atmosphere; and that on these atmospheres depended the action of these electrified bodies. If the reader will examine the plates of Lord Stanhope's Principles of Electricity, he will see the figures of conductors surrounded with a thinning margin, like the line of coasts and islands in a map.\n\nThis idea of electric atmospheres was first held at a very early period of the science by Otto Guericke, and afterwards by the academicians del Cimento, who contrived to render the electric atmosphere visible, by means of smoke attracted by, and uniting itself to a piece of amber, and gently rising from it, and vanishing as the amber cooled. But Dr Franklin exhibited this electric atmosphere with great advantage, by dropping rosin on hot iron plates held under bodies electrified, from which the smoke rose and encompassed the bodies, giving them a very beautiful appearance. He made other observations on those atmospheres: he took notice that they and the air did not seem to exclude one another; that they were immovably retained by the bodies from which they issued; and that the same body, in different circumstances of dilatation and contraction, is capable of receiving and retaining more or less of the electric fluid on its surface. However, the theory of electrical atmospheres was not sufficiently explained and understood for a considerable time; and the investigation led to many very curious experiments and observations. Mr Canton took the lead, and was followed by Dr Franklin. Messrs Wilcke and Epinus prosecuted the inquiry, and completed the discovery. The experiments of the two former gentlemen prepared the way for the conclusion that was afterwards drawn from them by the latter, though they retained the common opinion of electric atmospheres, and endeavoured to explain the phenomena by it. The conclusion was, that the electric fluid, when there is a redundancy of it in any body, repels the electric fluid in any other body, when they are brought within the sphere of each other's influence, and drives it into the remote parts of the body, or quite out of it, if there be any outlet for that purpose.\n\nBy atmosphere M. Epinus says, no more is to be understood than the sphere of action belonging to any body, or the neighbouring air electrified by it. Sig. Becaria concurs in the same opinion, that the electrified bodies have no other atmosphere than the electricity communicated to the neighbouring air, and not with the electrified bodies. And Mr Canton likewise, having relinquished the opinion that electrical atmospheres were composed of effluvia from excited or electrified bodies, maintained that they only result from an alteration in the state of the electric fluid contained in, or belonging to the air surrounding these bodies to a certain distance; for instance, that excited glass repels the electric fluid from it, and consequently beyond that distance makes\nmakes it more dense; whereas excited wax attracts the electric fluid existing in the air nearer to it, making it rarer than it was before.\n\nAmong the supporters of this doctrine is Dr Peart of Gainborough, who has distinguished himself as a zealous opponent of the chemical theory of Lavoisier, the fallacy of which he has, in his own opinion, fully demonstrated. But Dr Peart's atmospheres are not those of most electricians; they consist of chemical elements, of ether and phlogiston, by the union and reciprocal action of which all the phenomena of electricity are effected. We are afraid of doing more than stating this leading principle of Dr Peart's hypothesis, lest we should share the fate of Mr Read, with whom the Doctor is very angry for only partially agreeing with him.\n\nWe must therefore refer such of our readers, as wish for more satisfaction on this head to the Doctor's pamphlets on electricity and magnetism, and on electric atmospheres.\n\nIt is perhaps a sufficient refutation of this doctrine of material atmospheres, that electrical attraction and repulsion may take place, where these atmospheres cannot, according to the general opinion, be formed. Thus, in the instance given above, it is scarcely conceivable, that the excited electric on one side of the glass pane, or bell, should so speedily extend its atmosphere to the other side of the pane, or, in the case of the bell, that it should extend it at all, so as instantaneously to affect an electrometer presented to the other side. Nay, it is well known, that an electrified body will affect a conducting wire, so as to render it positive at one end, and negative at the other, though the wire be completely enveloped in sealing-wax, or some other electric substance. It therefore becomes a question, how, if the interposed body be impermeable to the electric fluid, (and we see no reason to think that glass and other perfect electricities are not so), the electric atmosphere can be produced? The one atmosphere can, in this instance, produce the other only by acting at a distance on the particles of which this latter is to be formed. Even supposing that the one atmosphere could produce the other in this way, we should gain nothing by the supposition. It only supposes innumerable attractions and repulsions in place of one.\n\nDr Franklin whirled an electrified ball, suspended by a silk thread, many times about his head with great rapidity, and found that its electricity was not sensibly diminished by the motion. Now it is scarcely conceivable, that the electric atmosphere could remain attached to the ball under these circumstances, or that it could be so instantaneously formed, or renewed in every point of its revolution, as to be capable of acting the moment the motions were ended; for the electricity of the ball must in this way have been greatly lessened, or nearly exhausted; whereas Dr Franklin found that, when the air was very dry, the electricity of the revolving ball was, when the ball was stopped, not less than that of a similar ball that had remained for the same time in a state of rest.\n\nWe have said that we see no reason to think, that glass is permeable to the electric fluid. We are aware, that this permeability is supported by some electricians, and that experiments have been related in proof of their opinion. Among the most plausible of these, are the experiments of Mr Lyons of Dover, which may all be reduced to the following. A wire is brought from the outside of a phial charged by the knob, and terminates in a sharp point at a small distance from a thin glass plate; it is commonly introduced into a glass tube, having a ball at the end, and the point of the wire reaches to the centre of the ball; and another wire is connected with the discharging rod, and also comes very near, and frequently close to the other end of the glass, opposite to the pointed wire. With this apparatus he obtains a discharge, and therefore says that the glass is permeable to the electric fluid.\n\nDr Robison repeated most of Mr Lyons's experiments, and found that, in the above way, he did indeed procure discharges, but that these were very incomplete, and very unlike the full and audible discharge usually obtained; they were always very faint, except when the glass was perforated.\n\nTo terminate this long digression, it must be remarked, that the impermeability of electric fluids supposed in our only fixed theory, shews that the redundancy or deficiency induced in an overcharged or undercharged electric, does not extend beyond the surface; for, when the surface is rendered electrical by excitation in any way, the impermeability of the body prevents the redundant fluid from penetrating to any depth, or from expanding to supply the deficiency on the surface. Hence we find, that an excited electric, when plunged into water, quickly loses its electricity by communication with this conducting medium.\n\nWe must now return to our corollaries, of which we shall deduce one more.\n\nCor. 6.—As non-electrics are conductors, and as some electrics are excited by rubbing them with non-fated electrics, it will follow, that if the non-electrics be insulated and separated from the electric, the former will show signs of electricity as well as the latter, but that, while they remain together, no signs of electricity can be exhibited by either.\n\nThis corollary may be illustrated by numerous facts that have been related in the preceding parts of this article.\n\nThe sheets of paper in No. 19, showed no signs of electricity while in contact with the table; the sulphur in the experiments of Wilcke and Æpinus, was not electrical while within the metallic cups, &c.\n\nWhen cases of this kind occur, in which two bodies, that would, when separated after mutual contact, show signs of opposite electricities, are, when united, said to compensate each other, the circumstance is easily explained.\n\nIn whatever way excitation is produced by friction or other means, which we do not pretend to explain, it must happen that the adjoining surfaces of two bodies rubbed together, must be in opposite states, and the one overcharged in the same degree as the other is undercharged. When the bodies, which we shall suppose to be two plates, are joined, so that the one exactly covers the other, they must be inactive; because a particle of moveable fluid in any part of one surface of the overcharged plate, will be as much attracted by the undercharged surface of the farther plate, as it is repelled by the overcharged surface of the nearer plate. As the surfaces are supposed equal, coincident, and equally electrical, their actions must balance each other. The action\nTheory of action of the united bodies will be expressed by $Fm'x$ Electricity. ($z-z'$) or $Fm'; z-z'$ being here $=0$.\n\nBut now again, if the plates be separated, a considerable part of the redundant fluid will fly back from the one surface to the other, being propelled thither by the repulsion of its own particles, and drawn by the attraction of the redundant matter in the other surface. But, as the electric is a non-conductor, it will retain a portion of fluid, or will remain deprived of a portion, in a stratum a little way within the surface, the two plates must, after separation, be in opposite states, and the non-electric plate, if it has been inflated before separation, will, after separation, appear electrified.\n\nWe shall close our consideration of electrical attraction and repulsion, by explaining two very beautiful experiments of Dr Franklin; one of which, the electrical well, has been described in No 79; the other shall be described presently.\n\nIt appears from Mr Cavendish's account of the deposition of fluid in a sphere, given in No 372, that when the sphere is overcharged, all the redundant fluid is crowded into the surface, leaving the internal parts in a neutral state. Now the vessel that represents the electrical well is exactly in this condition; the electrometer, therefore, when let down within the cavity of the vessel, cannot be affected, because all that space is neutral; but when the balls are raised above the brim of the vessel, they are affected, because they come within the sphere of action of the redundant surface.\n\nThe other experiment to which we allude, is that of the electrified can and chain, which is thus made.\n\nInflate a metallic can, or any other concave piece of metal, and place within it a pretty long metallic chain, having a silk thread tied to one of its ends. At the handle of the can, or to a wire proceeding from it, suspend a cork ball electrometer; then electrify the can, by giving it a spark with the knob of a charged phial, and the balls of the electrometer will immediately diverge.\n\nIf, in this situation, one end of the chain be gradually raised up above the top of the can, by the silk thread, while the lower end of the chain remains in it, the balls of the electrometer will converge a little, and more or less in proportion to the greater or less elevation of the chain above the top of the vessel. A similar experiment was made by Mr Ronayne, which is as follows:—He excited a long slip of white flannel, or a silk ribbon, by rubbing it with his fingers; then, by applying his hand to it, took off as many sparks as the excited electric would give; but when the flannel, &c. had lost the power of giving any more sparks in this manner, he doubled, or rolled it up; by which operation the contracted flannel, &c. appeared to strongly electrical, that it not only afforded sparks to the hand, brought near, but it threw out spontaneous brushes of light, which appeared very beautiful in the dark.\n\nTo explain this experiment, we must have recourse to an inference, that is easily deducible from the same theorem of Mr Cavendish: namely that in overcharged bodies of all shapes, the redundant fluid will be much more dense near the surface than in the more internal parts; and that it will be also denser in all elevated or protuberant parts of these bodies, as also near the extremity of oblong bodies; and in general, that the redundant fluid, or redundant matter, will bear a much nearer proportion to the surfaces of bodies, than to their quantities of matter. Hence we may perceive, that when the chain, in the above experiment, is lifted up, it will attract to itself a part of the denser fluid, leaving that of the surface of the vessel, to which the electrometer is attached, more rare; and consequently, the divergence of the balls will decrease, in proportion as the chain is more elevated above the rim of the cup. Mr Ronayne's experiment admits of a similar explanation.\n\nThe well known effects of points, in causing a quick discharge of electricity, seem to agree very well with points explained.\n\nIt appears from 391, that, if two similar bodies of different sizes are placed at a very great distance from each other, and connected by a slender canal, and overcharged, the force with which a particle of fluid placed close to corresponding parts of their surface is repelled from them, is inversely as the corresponding diameters of the bodies. If the distance of the bodies is small, there is not so much difference in the force with which the particle is repelled by the two bodies; but still, if the diameters of the two bodies are very different, the particle will be repelled with much more force from the smaller body than from the larger. It is indeed true, that a particle placed at a certain distance from the smaller body, will be repelled with less force, than if it be placed at the same distance from the greater body; but this distance is in most cases pretty considerable. If the bodies are spherical, and the repulsion inversely as the square of the distance, a particle placed at any distance from the surface of the smaller body, less than a mean proportion between the radii of the two bodies, will be repelled from it with more force than if it be placed at the same distance from the larger body.\n\nWe may probably, therefore, be well assured, that if two similar bodies are connected together by a slender canal, and are overcharged, the fluid must escape faster from the smaller body than from an equal surface of the larger; but as the surface of the larger body is greatest, it is not certain which body ought to lose most electricity in the same time; and indeed it seems impossible to determine positively from this theory which should, as it depends in a great measure on the manner in which the air opposes the entrance of the electric fluid into it. Perhaps, in some degrees of electrification, the smaller body may lose most, and in others the larger.\n\nLet now ACB (fig. 116.) be a conical point, standing on any body DAB, C being the vertex of the cone; and let DAB be overcharged: Mr Cavendish supposes, that a particle of fluid placed close to the surface of the cone anywhere between b and C, must be repelled with at least as much, if not more, force, than it would, if the part A a b B of the cone was taken away, and the part a C b connected to DAB by a slender canal; and consequently, from what has been said before, it seems reasonable to suppose that the waste of electricity from the end of the cone must be very great in proportion to its surface; though it does not appear from this reasoning, whether the waste of electricity from the whole cone should be greater or less than from a cylinder of the same base and altitude.\n\nAll that has been here said relating to the flowing out\nTheory of electricity from overcharged bodies, holds equally true with regard to the flowing in of electricity into undercharged bodies.\n\nBut a circumstance which probably contributes as much as any thing to the quick discharge of electricity from points, is the swift current of air caused by them, as taken notice of in No 8 et seq. and which is produced in this manner.\n\nIf a globular body ABD is overcharged, the air close to it, all round its surface, is rendered overcharged by the electric fluid, which flows into it from the body; it will therefore be repelled by the body; but as the air all round the body is repelled with the same force, it is in equilibrium, and has no tendency to fly off from it. If now the conical point ACB be made to stand out from the globe, as the fluid will escape much faster in proportion to the surface from the end of the point than from the rest of the body, the air close to it will be much more overcharged than that close to the rest of the body: it will therefore be repelled with much more force; and consequently a current of air will flow along the sides of the cone from B towards C; by which means there is a continual supply of fresh air, not much overcharged, that the electricity would have but little disposition to flow from the point into it.\n\nThe same current of air is produced in a less degree, without the help of the point, if the body, instead of being globular, is oblong or flat, or has knobs on it, or is otherwise formed in such a manner as to make the electricity escape faster from some parts of it than the rest.\n\nIn like manner, if the body ABD be undercharged, the air adjoining to it will also be undercharged, and will therefore be repelled by it; but as the air close to the end of the point will be more undercharged than that close to the rest of the body, it will be repelled with much more force; which will cause exactly the same current of air, flowing the same way, as if the body was overcharged; and consequently the velocity with which the electric fluid flows into the body, will be very much increased. We believe, indeed, that it may be laid down as a constant rule, that the faster the electric fluid escapes from any body when overcharged, the faster will it run into that body when undercharged.\n\nPoints are not the only bodies which cause a quick discharge of electricity; in particular, it escapes very fast from the ends of long slender cylinders; and a swift current of air is caused to flow from the middle of the cylinder towards the end: this will easily appear by considering, that the redundant fluid is collected in much greater quantity near the ends of the cylinders than near the middle. The same thing may be said, but we believe in a less degree, of the edges of thin plates.\n\nWhat has been just said concerning the current of air, serves to explain the reason of the revolving motion of Dr Hamilton's and Mr Kinnersley's bent pointed wires, (No 81.) for the same repulsion which impels the air from the thick part of the wire towards the point, tends to impel the wire in the contrary direction.\n\nIt is well known, that if a body B is positively electrified, and another body A, communicating with the ground, be then brought near it, the electric fluid will escape faster from B, at that part of it which is turned toward A, than before. This is plainly conformable to theory; for as A is thereby rendered undercharged, B will in its turn be made more overcharged, in that part of it which is turned towards A, than it was before. But it is also well known, that the fluid will escape faster from B, if A be pointed, than if it be blunt, though B will be less overcharged in this case than in the other; for the broader the surface of A, which is turned towards B, the more effect will it have in increasing the overcharge of B. The cause of this phenomenon is as follows.\n\nIf A is pointed, and the pointed end turned towards B, the air close to the point will be very much undercharged, and therefore will be strongly repelled by A, and attracted by B, which will cause a swift current of air to flow from it towards B; by which means a constant supply of undercharged air will be brought in contact with B, which will accelerate the discharge of electricity from it in a very great degree; and moreover, the more pointed A is, the swifter will be this current. If, on the other hand, that end of A which is turned towards B is so blunt, that the electricity is not disposed to run into A faster than it is to run out of B, the air adjoining to B may be as much overcharged as that adjoining to A is undercharged; and, therefore may, by the joint repulsion of B and attraction of A, be impelled from B to A, with as much, or more force, than the adjoining air to A is impelled in the contrary direction; so that what little current of air there is, may flow in the contrary direction.\n\nWe might here give an account of Coulomb's experiments on the dissipation of electricity into the air, and along imperfect conductors. But we must defer this to the article Electrometer, under which we shall describe the instrument with which they were made. We must now proceed to the theory of the Leyden phial.\n\nIn the 4th, 6th, and 7th chapters of the third part, we have related a considerable number of experiments, illustrating the phenomena of charged electrics. Before we examine the theory of the Leyden phial, it will therefore be necessary to consider the phenomena only in a simple case, and for this purpose we shall give an experiment, by which the late Dr Robison used to illustrate the theory of charged glaas.\n\nFig. 117 represents the professor's apparatus. G is the extremity of a prime conductor, on which is fixed a quadrant electrometer H. AB represents a round plate of tin-foil, pasted on a plate of glaas, the edges of which extend beyond the tin-foil about two inches. The plate of glaas is fixed to a wooden stand, so that it may be placed upright, and at any required distance from the conductor. DF is another plate of equal dimensions with AB, having a wire EN fixed in its centre, with its extremity N, terminating in a small ball, from which is hung a common ball electrometer. The wire also passes through a wooden ball O, which is fastened to the insulating stand P. It is necessary that the glaas plates be very clean and dry, and a little warm.\n\nThe conductor G is to be connected with the plate AB, by a wire reaching to the centre C. Now move the electrical machine slowly, till the index of the quadrant rise to 30° or 40°, and mark the number of turns required to produce this effect. Take off the electricity,\nTheory of and having removed the connecting wire GC, turn the machine again slowly, till the index be in the same situation. The difference in the number of turns in this latter case, from the former, will shew pretty nearly the expenditure of fluid necessary to electrify only the plate of tin-foil. This difference will be found very trifling, when a low degree of electricity is employed; and to this it is necessary to confine the electrification, to prevent too great a diffusion from the edges of the plate. Now replace the wire, and cause the index of the electrometer to point again at 30°; bring forward the plate DF, taking care to keep it just opposite and parallel to AB without touching it. No sensible change will be produced on the index, till the plate DF come within four or five inches of AB, and it may even be brought much nearer, without making the index sink more than two or three degrees, unless a spark pass between AB and DF. Remove DF again to the distance of two or three feet, and fasten to the ball N a piece of chain, or metallic thread, so that it may lie on the table. Now raise the electrometer again to 30°, and advance DF gradually towards AB. The index will gradually fall as DF advances, but will rise again to its former height, if DF be carried back to its original situation.\n\nThese appearances are easily explained in the principles laid down in No 392, 393. For as DF advances towards AB, the redundant fluid in the latter repels a part of the fluid in DF towards the remote end of the wire EN, as is shewn by the separation of the balls at N; hence an accumulation commences in AB, and the index of the electrometer HG falls just as if part of the fluid in the prime conductor were communicated to AB. When DF is made to communicate with the floor, much more electricity is repelled from DF, according as it approaches nearer to AB; but, by reason of the communication, the electrometer at N gives no signs of electricity.\n\nIf, instead of connecting AB with the prime conductor, we adapt to the wire GC, at the extremity G, a metallic plate of the same dimensions as AB, with an electrometer attached to it next AB, and if this apparatus be any how electrified, and the separation of the balls at H be noted, before DF, which communicates with the floor, be approached, on attending to the charges, it will be seen, that the divergency of the balls corresponds very nearly to the distance of DF, as is required by the theory.\n\nNow, while the plates are near each other, especially if DF communicates with the floor, if we suspend a pith ball by a silk thread between AB and DF, the ball will be strongly attracted by either of these plates that is nearest to it, suppose DF; and, having touched this, it will be immediately repelled, and drawn towards AB, by which it will be again repelled to DF, and it will thus be driven backwards and forwards like the electrified spider described in No 126, as long as any electricity remains in either of the plates. In the mean time, the index of the electrometer at H will gradually descend, till the motion of the pith ball ceases.\n\nAll these appearances are more remarkable, according as the plates are nearer to each other, and when they come in contact, the phenomena are the most complete.\n\nIf, when the plates are charged, we approach one end of a bended wire, (having a downy feather at each end,) to the plate DF, and bring the other to AB, we shall observe the feathers spread out their fibres to the plates, and then the equilibrium will be restored, or the plates will be discharged.\n\nHaving, by means of this experiment, brought again into view the phenomena of charging and discharging a coated electric, we are prepared to explain the theory of the Leyden phial, which can easily be done by recurring to the important theorem of the disposition and actions of four parallel plates, so fully detailed in No 392.\n\nThe following observations will also afford some idea of the manner in which the fluid is disposed in the Leyden phial.\n\nIt fully appears from what has been said in No 499, that the electric fluid is not able to penetrate a plate of glass without breaking it; and yet it seems able to penetrate to a very small depth, we might almost say, an imperceptible depth, within the surface of the glass.\n\nLet ACGM, fig. 118, represent a flat plate of glass, or any other substance which will not suffer the electric fluid to pass through it, seen edgeways; and let BbDd, and Eeff, or B'd' and E'f', as we shall call them for shortness, be two plates of conducting matter of the same size, placed in contact with the glass, opposite to each other; and let B'd' be positively electrified; and let E'f' communicate with the ground; and let the fluid be supposed either able to enter a little way into the glass, but not to pass through it, or unable to enter it at all; and if it is able to enter a little way into it, let B'b'd', or B'd' as we shall call it, represent that part of the glass, into which the fluid can enter from the plate B'b, and e'f' that which the fluid from E'f' can enter. By the above mentioned proposition, No 134, it appears that if b'e', the thickness of the glass, is very small in respect of b'd', the diameter of the plates, the quantity of redundant fluid forced into the space B'd' or B'b', (that is, into the plate B'd', if the fluid is unable to penetrate at all into the glass, or into the plate B'd', and the space b', together if the fluid is able to penetrate into the glass) will be many times greater than what would be forced into it by the same degree of electrification, if it had been placed by itself; and the quantity of fluid driven out of E'f' will be nearly equal to the redundant fluid in B'b'.\n\nIf a communication be now made between B'b and E'f', the canal NRS, the redundant fluid will run from B'b to E'f'; and if in its way it passes through the body of any animal, it will, by the rapidity of its motion produce in it that sensation, called a shock.\n\nIt appears from No 392, that, if a body of any size was electrified in the same degree as the plate B'd', and a communication was made between that body and the ground, by a canal of the same length, breadth, and thickness as NRS; that then the fluid in that canal would be impelled with the same force as that in NRS, supposing the fluid in both canals to be incomprehensible; and consequently, as the quantity of fluid to be moved, and the resistance to its motion, is the same in both canals, the fluid should move with the same rapidity in both; and there seems no reason to think that the case will be different, if the communication is made by canals of real fluid.\n\nTherefore\nTherefore, in the opinion of Mr Cavendish, as great a shock would be produced by making a communication between the conductor and the ground, as between the two sides of the Leyden phial, by canals of the same length, and same kind. This seems a necessary consequence of this theory; as the quantity of fluid which passes through the canal is, by the supposition, the same in both; and there is the greatest reason to think, that the rapidity with which it passes, will be nearly, if not quite, the same in both.\n\nIt may be worth observing, that the longer the canal NRS is, by which the communication is made, the less will be the rapidity with which the fluid moves along it; for the longer the canal is, the greater is the resistance to the motion of the fluid in it; whereas the force with which the whole quantity of fluid in it is impelled, is the same whatever be the length of the canal. Accordingly it is found in melting small wires, by directing a shock through them, that the longer the wire, the greater charge it requires to melt it.\n\nAs the fluid in B is attracted with great force by the redundant matter in E, it is plain that if the fluid is able to penetrate at all into the glaas, great part of the redundant fluid will be lodged in b d, and in like manner there will be a great deficiency of fluid in e. But in order to form some estimate of the proportion of the redundant fluid, which will be lodged in b d, let the communication between E f and the ground be taken away, as well as that by which B d is electrified; and let so much fluid be taken from B d, as to make the redundant fluid therein equal to the deficient fluid in E. If we suppose that all the redundant fluid is collected in b d, and all the deficient in E f, so as to leave B d and E f saturated; then as the electric repulsion is inversely as the square of the distance, a particle of fluid placed anywhere in the plane b d, except near the extremities b and d, will be attracted with very much as much force by the redundant matter in e, as it is repelled by the redundant fluid in b d. Hence it follows, that if the depth to which the fluid can penetrate is very small in respect of the thickness of the glaas, but yet is such that the quantity of fluid naturally contained in b d or e is considerably more than the redundant fluid in B d; then, as the repulsion is inversely as the square of the distance, almost all the redundant fluid will be collected in b d, leaving the plate B d not very much overcharged; and in like manner E f will be not very much undercharged; if the repulsion were inversely as some lower power than the square, B d will be very much overcharged, and E f very much undercharged; and if the repulsion were inversely as some lower power than the square, B d will be very much undercharged, and E f very much overcharged.\n\nIt is a part of Dr Franklin's theory, that no electric fluid can be thrown into one side of a coated plate, unless an equal quantity be at the same time abstracted from the other side; and that consequently the charged plate contains no more fluid than before it was charged. We find, indeed, that one side of the plate will not receive a charge, unless the other side at the same time communicate with the ground. He infers the same consequence from the circumstance, that if a jar be discharged through a person when inflated, the person is not found electrified; the necessary consequence of which is, according to Dr Franklin, that any number of jars may be charged by the same turns of a machine, provided that the outside of one jar communicates with the inside of the next successively, while the outside of the last has a communication with the ground. He found, however, by experiment, that a greater number of turns was necessary, than his theory required; but he attributed this circumstance to the diffusion of the fluid into the air. But we learn from our theory that the redundant matter in the plate that communicates with the ground is less than the redundant fluid in the other plate in the proportion of n-1 to n; and that the proportion of redundant fluid in the next plate or jar is no greater. If we have any number of jars, the charge of the nth jar in the series, will be \\( \\frac{n-1}{m} \\).\n\nIf the charge of the first jar or n=60, that of the 10th will =51 nearly.\n\nThough a coated plate will not receive a charge, unless one side communicate with the ground, it may however be rendered electrical, as appears when we attempt to charge it while insulated. For when we attempt to electrify one side, the other gives a spark which proves this to be electrified also. Again, when a charged phial is discharged by means of an insulated discharger, it always remains electrical, positively or negatively, according as the body from which it was charged was positive or negative.\n\nIt was supposed by Wilcke, that when a jar is charged by connecting one side of it with the prime conductor, and the other with the rubber, it is neutral on both sides. But if this were the case, it could not be discharged; and in fact, it will be found by experiment to be equally active on both sides.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to remark, that the theory of the Leyden phial, and that of a coated plate, are the verifying facts; and hence we have an easy method of comparing the theory with experiment, by taking two plates of the same kind of glaas, and of an equal thickness, but different in the extent of coated surface. If we charge both plates, by means of very long conducting wires attached to both sides, we are to measure how often the charge of the lesser plate is contained in the greater, which is easily done by the following method of Dr Cavendish.\n\nWhen a jar is charged, observe the electrometer that Cavendish's is connected with it, and immediately communicate the charge to another equal jar, the perfect equality of measuring which has been previously ascertained by the methods, which will presently appear. Again, note the electrometer. This will give the elevation, that indicates one half, independent of all theory. Now electrify a jar, or a series of equal jars, to the same degree as the first, and communicate the charge to a coated plate of mirror glaas, discharging the plate after each communication, till the electrometer reaches the degree that indicates one half. This shows how often the charge of the plate is contained in that of the jar or row of jars.\n\nLet the charge of the plate be to that of the jars as x to 1. Then by each communication, the electricity is diminished in the proportion of \\( \\frac{1+x}{1} \\) to 1. If m communications have been made, it will be reduced in the proportion of \\( \\frac{1+x^m}{1} \\) to 1. Therefore \\( \\frac{1+x^m}{2} = 2 \\), and \\( \\frac{1+x}{2} = \\sqrt{2} - 1 \\). When\nWhen \\( x \\) is small in proportion to 1, we shall come very near the truth, by multiplying the number of communications by 1,444, subtracting 0.5 from the product. The remainder shews how often the charge of the plate is contained in that of the jars or \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\).\n\nThe important discovery of Franklin, that the charge of coated glass resides in the glass, and not in the coating, led Beccaria to a no less important discovery; namely, that in a charged plate of glass, and probably of any other electric, there are several strata, inconceivably thin, that are alternately in a positive and negative state, and that the number of these strata increases as the electrification is continued.\n\nThis disposition of the surfaces of electric plates explains many phenomena; particularly the experiments with charged plates described in No. 151, and some curious appearances observed by Beccaria, and ranked by him under the head of vindicating electricity.\n\nThey are thus described by Mr. Cavallo:\n\n1. \\( AB, ab \\), fig. 119, represents a plate of glass, vindicating electricity. Coated on both sides with the two metallic coatings, \\( CD, ca \\), which are not stuck to the plate, but only laid upon it.\n\nFrom the upper coating \\( CD \\), three silk threads proceed, which are united at their top \\( H \\), by which the said coating may be removed from the plate in an insulated manner, and may be presented to an electrified electrometer as represented in fig. 120, in order to examine its electricity. \\( FG \\) is a glass stand, which insulates and supports the plate, &c.\n\n2. Let the plate \\( AB, ab \\), be charged in the common manner, by means of an electrical machine, so that its surface \\( AB \\) may acquire one kind of electricity, (which may be called K) and the opposite surface \\( ab \\) may acquire the contrary electricity, (which we shall call L). Then, if the coating \\( CD \\) be removed from the plate, and be presented to an electrified electrometer, as represented in fig. 120, it will be found possessed of the electricity K, viz. of the same kind with that which was communicated to the surface \\( AB \\) of the glass plate; from whence it is deduced, that the surface \\( AB \\) has imparted some of its electricity to the coating. Now, this disposition of the charged plate to give part of its electricity to the coating, is what the learned F. Beccaria nominates the negative vindicating electricity.\n\n3. If the coating be again and again alternately laid upon the plate and removed, its electricity K will be found to decrease gradually, till after a number of times (which is greater or less, according as the edges of the plate insulate more or less exactly), the coating will not appear at all electrified. This state is called the limit of the two contrary electricities; for if now the above-mentioned operation of coating and uncoating the plate be continued, the coating will be found possessed of the contrary electricity, viz. the electricity L. This electricity, L, of the coating is weak on its first appearance; but it gradually grows stronger and stronger till a certain degree; then infensibly decreases, and continues decreasing until the glass plate has entirely lost every sign of electricity.\n\nBy this change of electricity in the coating, it is deduced, that the surface \\( AB \\) of the glass plate changes property; and whereas at first it was disposed to part with its electricity, now, (viz. beyond the limit of the two contrary electricities) it seems to vindicate its own property, that is, to take from the coating some electricity of the same kind with that of which it was charged; hence this disposition was by F. Beccaria called the positive vindicating electricity.\n\n4. This positive vindicating electricity never changes, though the coating be touched every time it is removed. It appears stronger, and lasts a very considerable time after the plate has been discharged; which is a very surprising property of glass, and probably of all good and solid electrics.\n\n5. If, soon after the discharge of the plate, the coating be alternately taken from the plate, and replaced, but with the following law, viz., that when the coating is upon the plate, both coatings be touched at the same time, and when the coating is cut off, this be either touched or not: then the surface \\( AB \\) of the plate, on being uncoated every time, takes a quantity of electricity, which it alternately loses every time it is coated.\n\n6. On removing the coating in a dark room, a flash of light appears between it and the glass, which is still more conspicuous if the coating be removed by the fingers being applied immediately to it, viz. not in an insulated manner, because, when the coating is not insulated, the glass plate can give to, or receive from it, more of the electric fluid, and that more freely, than otherwise.\n\n7. It is observable, that in the negative vindicating electricity, the glass loses a greater or less portion of electricity in an inverse proportion of the charge given to the plate, viz. the part lost is greater when the charge has been the weaker; for in the positive vindicating electricity, the force of receiving electricity is the stronger, when the charge has been stronger, and contrarywise.\n\n8. If, after every time that the coating \\( CD \\) is removed, the atmospheres \\( E, e \\), that is, the air contiguous to the surface of the glass plate, be examined, they will be found electrified as in the following table, viz. the threads of an electrometer, brought within one or two inches, or more, of the surfaces \\( AB, ab \\), will diverge with electricities contrary to those expressed in the table.\n\n| During the time of the negative vindicating Electricity | During the time of the positive vindicating Electricity |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| If the plate has been charged                            | The air \\( e \\) is electrified \\( L \\)                  |\n| The air \\( E \\)                                          | The air \\( e \\)                                         |\n\nThe theory of coated glass naturally leads us to that of the electrophorus; for though this apparatus is not exactly similar to a charged plate, as has been supposed by some; there is yet a considerable resemblance in the phenomena.\n\nWe have given a description of the electrophorus, and of its effects in Chap. X. of Part III. where we also stated, that, for illustrating the theory, it was proper to\nTheory of to make the several parts of the apparatus of considerable thickness, as the more instructive but minute changes are thus greatly increased, though the showy and brilliant phenomena are not so remarkable. Fig. 121 represents a section of the three parts of the apparatus in contact, where ABCD is the electric cake, CDEF the sole, and ABHG the cover. They are here represented lying horizontally on each other; but for experiment, it will be most convenient to have them fixed vertically to glass supporters, furnished with leaden feet to keep them steady.\n\nWe might here give a mathematical explanation of the phenomena of the electrophorus; and the actions of every part of the apparatus might easily be stated by means of the propositions in No. 308 to 314, and the corresponding ones in No. 228—335, taking into consideration the true law of action. But as this would be going over again much of the ground that we have already trodden, where our readers might not be pleased with being obliged to follow us; we shall treat the subject in a manner somewhat more popular, the result, however, of strict mathematical reasoning.\n\nHaving related the general phenomena in No. 207, we have now to consider only the disposition of fluid in the various parts of the apparatus in various situations, and the mutual forces that operate between them.\n\nWe shall consider the instrument under various states.\n\n1. When the cake is left to cool after being made, it becomes negative by cooling; and if it were by itself, the surface on both sides would be negative to a considerable thickness near the edges; and the fluid would probably grow denser by degrees towards the middle, where it would have its natural density. This disposition may be inferred from No. 371, 372. But as it cools in conjunction with the sole, the attraction of the redundant matter in the cake for the moveable fluid in the sole, must disturb its uniform diffusion in the sole, and cause it to approach the cake. And as this probably happens while the cake is still in a conducting state, the disposition of its fluid will be different from what is described above, and the final disposition of the fluid in the cake and sole will resemble that given in No. 371, where the plates may represent the cake and sole. It will be sufficient at present to consider the cake and sole as divided into only two strata; one containing redundant fluid, and the other deficient, neglecting the neutral stratum interposed between them in each. The cake then consists of a stratum ABbaA, containing redundant matter, and a stratum abCD containing redundant fluid; and the sole of a stratum DCnm containing redundant fluid; that is, all that belongs naturally to the space DCFE, and of a stratum mmFE, containing redundant matter. We may call this the primitive state of the cake and sole; and if this is once changed by communication with unelectrified bodies, it can never be recovered without new excitation.\n\n2. If the sole is touched by a body that communicates with the ground, fluid will enter it, till the repulsion of the redundant fluid in the sole for a superficial particle is equal to the attraction of the redundant matter in the cake for the same particle. What we have said concerning infinitely extended plates rendered neutral on one side, may suffice to give a notion of the present disposition of the fluid in the sole. The inferior surface will be neutral; and the density of the fluid will increase towards the surface DC. The sole contains more than its natural quantity of fluid, but is neutral by the balance of opposite forces. Let it now be inflated. This may be called the common state of the electrophorus.\n\n3. Place the cover GHRA on the cake. A particle Z, at the upper surface of the cover, must be more attracted by the redundant matter in the stratum ABba than it will be repelled by the redundant fluid in the remote strata; for the fluid in the cake is less than when it is in its natural state, and therefore Z is attracted by the cake. The redundant fluid which has entered the remote side of the sole is less than what would be sufficient to saturate the redundant matter of the cake, because it only balances the excess of the remote action of this matter above the nearer action of the compressed fluid in the sole, and this smaller quantity of redundant fluid acts on Z at a greater distance than that of the redundant matter in the cake. Therefore the particle Z, lying immediately within the surface GH, is on the whole attracted; some fluid will move toward the cake, and its natural state of uniform diffusion in the cover will be changed into a violent state, in which the fluid will be compressed on the surface AB, and abstracted from the surface GH. There will now be a stratum GgPH containing redundant matter, and another gBA containing redundant fluid. But this disposition will disturb the arrangement that had taken place in the sole, and had rendered it neutral on the interior surface. The particle Z situated in that surface, will be more repelled by the compressed fluid in the stratum gCA than it will be attracted by the equivalent more remote redundant matter in GHg. Fluid is now therefore disposed to quit the surface EF, and the sole will appear positively electric, but in a small degree only, if the cover be thin. All this may be observed by attaching a small ball electrometer to the lower surface of the sole, or touching the sole, with it, and then trying its electricity by excited glass, or sealing-wax.\n\n4. A particle of fluid Z, placed immediately without the surface GH, is more attracted by the deficient stratum GHgq and by ABba, than it is repelled by the redundant strata beyond them, and hence the cover must be sensibly negative. This is the common state of the whole apparatus after setting on the cover. The lower surface of the sole is slightly positive, and the upper surface of the cover more sensibly negative. A smart spark will be seen between the apparatus and the finger, and fluid will enter, till the attraction of the redundant matter in ABba balances the repulsion of the redundant fluid in DCFE.\n\n5. A spark may now be obtained from the sole; for its neutral it was faintly positive before, and there is now the additional action of the fluid that has entered into the cover. Part of the fluid in the sole is therefore disposed to fly to any body that is presented to it. But when this transference has taken place, the equilibrium at the surface GH is destroyed, and this surface again becomes negative, and will attract fluid, although the cover contains already more than its natural quantity. A small spark will therefore be seen between the cover and any conducting body presented to it. By touching it, the neutrality\nneutral or equilibrium may be restored at GH; but it will be destroyed again at EF, from which a positive spark may be obtained, leaving GH negative in its turn. This would go on for ever, in a series of communications continually diminishing so as at last to become insensible, if the three parts of the electrophorus be thin. This shews the necessity of making them otherwise, if the instrument be intended for illustrating the theory.\n\nThe equilibrium is at length completed at the surfaces GH and EF, both of which are neutral with respect to surrounding bodies, although both the cover and sole contain more than their natural share of electric fluid. This state of the apparatus may be called its neutral state; and it may be produced at once, instead of doing it by these alternate touches of GH and EF. If we touch at once both these surfaces, we shall have a bright, pungent spark, and a small shock. If this be the object of the experiment, the state No. 428, which gives occasion to it may be called the charged state of the electrophorus.\n\nWhen the apparatus has been thus rendered neutral with respect to surrounding bodies, it may continue in this state for any length of time, without its capability of producing the other phenomena being diminished, provided that no fluid pass from the cover to the cake.\n\n6. Now if the cover be removed to a distance, both parts of the apparatus will exhibit strong marks of electricity. For the cover contains much redundant fluid, and must therefore appear strongly positive; it will give a brisk spark, which may be employed for any purpose, particularly for charging a jar positively by the knob, if we just touch the cover with the knob. Again, the sole will attract fluid, or it will be negative, though it contains more than its natural quantity of fluid; it will therefore take a spark. The sole, therefore, in the absence of the cover, may be employed to charge a jar negatively by the knob. By being touched with the finger, or with the knob of a jar held in the hand, it will be reduced to the common state described in No. 426; and now all the former experiments may be repeated. We may call this the active or the charging state of the electrophorus.\n\n7. If the electrophorus be not insulated, a shock may, however, be obtained, by touching first the sole, and then the cover, without taking off the finger; but will not be so smart as when the negative cover is touched at the same time with the sole. The difference will, however, be scarcely perceptible when the pieces are thin.\n\n8. If the apparatus has not been insulated, the cover when put on will afford a spark, in the manner already mentioned, and this will be rather stronger than when it is insulated; for the fluid being allowed to escape from the sole, does not obstruct the entry of fluid into the cover. If then, without removing the finger from the cover, we touch the sole, we feel nothing; but if we first touch the sole, and then, without removing the finger from it, touch the cover, we shall obtain a shock. By this series of alternate touches, the period of the electrophorus is completed. For it is first charged or rendered neutral, by touching the plates in contact; then, by touching both when separate, the whole is reduced to the common state. When after having been in the neutral state they are separated, they have opposite electricities, the sole having that of the cake. When brought together, each in the common state, they have opposite electricities, the cover having that of the cake.\n\n9. By being long exposed to the air without the Method of cover, the electrophorus gradually loses its activity. Renewing this may however be again restored in several ways. One of the most obvious methods is, to produce a fresh excitation of the resinous cake; and this is best done by rubbing it with a piece of new flannel, of cat or hare's skin, or, what answers still better, a piece of mole skin. This friction renders the cake negative. It may also be electrified negatively, by placing on it a jar charged negatively in the inside, and then touching the knob of the jar with any conducting body that communicates with the ground. By this means it may be very strongly excited, if the jar be large, and if the cake be covered with a piece of tinfoil; that comes closely in contact with its whole surface. But one of the most expeditious and effectual methods of restoring the energy of the cake, will be to electrify it by means of an electrical machine, while the surface of the cake is connected with the rubber.\n\nThe only important part of the theory of electricity which we have yet to consider, is that of the condenser, but as this will be greatly elucidated by an application of Coulomb's experiments on inflators, we shall delay till we give an account of these in the article ELECTROMETER.\n\nPART V.\n\nON ATMOSPHERICAL ELECTRICITY.\n\nTHE phenomena of electricity, that we have hitherto described, are sufficiently curious, and many of them extremely interesting; but they are trifling, when compared with those that are now to come under our consideration. In the present part of our article, we are to view the electric fluid as one of the principal agents, employed to produce some of the most remarkable and astonishing phenomena of nature. We are about to prove, by a series of the most satisfactory experiments, that thunder and lightning are merely the effects of a vast explosion of accumulated electricity in the atmosphere.\nELECTRICITY.\n\nCHAP. I. Of Thunder.\n\nSect. I. Of the Identity of Electricity and Lightning.\n\nIt is not surprising that the experiments in which the electric spark is made to produce the effects which we have recounted in the third part of this article, should have led philosophers to conceive a similarity between these effects, and those produced by lightning.\n\nDr Wall and Mr Grey seem to have fancied a resemblance between thunder and the snapping noise produced by applying the fingers to an excited electric; but how such a resemblance should strike them, is not easy to conceive; and indeed it seems to have been merely a bold conjecture.\n\nThe abbé Nollet appears to have formed the first rational idea of their similitude, and expresses himself on the subject in the following remarkable manner.\n\n\"If any one should take upon him to prove from a well connected comparison of phenomena, that thunder is in the hands of nature what electricity is in ours; that the wonders which we now exhibit at our pleasure, are little imitations of those great effects that frighten us, and that the whole depends upon the same mechanism: if it can be demonstrated that a cloud prepared by the action of the winds, by heat, by a mixture of exhalations, &c., is opposite to a terrestrial object; that this is the electrified body, and at a certain proximity to that which is not: I avow that this idea, if it was well supported, would give me a great deal of pleasure; and in support of it, how many specious reasons present themselves to a man who is well acquainted with electricity! The universality of the electric matter, the readiness of its action, its inflammability, and its activity in giving fire to other bodies, its property of striking externally and internally even to their smallest parts, the remarkable example we have of this effect in the Leyden experiment, the idea which we might truly adopt in supposing a greater degree of electric power, &c., all these points of analogy which I have been some time meditating, begin to make me believe, that by taking electricity for the model, one might form to one's self, in respect to thunder and lightning, more perfect and more probable ideas than have hitherto been offered.\"\n\nBut the first electrician who formed a plan for ascertaining the truth of this hypothesis, was Dr Franklin, who truly realized the fable of Prometheus in bringing down fire from heaven.\n\nBefore we relate Dr Franklin's experiments, we shall state the points of resemblance which led him to think of making them.\n\nHe begins his account of the similarity of the electric fluid and lightning, by cautioning his readers not to be flattered at the great difference of effects in point of degree; since that was no argument of any disparity in their nature. It is no wonder, says he, if the effects of the one should be so much greater than those of the other. For if two gun-barrels electrified will strike at two inches distance, and make a loud report; at how great a distance will 10,000 acres of electrified cloud strike and give its fire, and how loud must be the crack!\n\n1. Flashes of lightning, are generally seen crooked and waving in the air. The same is the electric spark always, when it is drawn from an irregular body at some distance. He might have added, when it is drawn by an irregular body, and through a space in which the best conductors are disposed in an irregular manner, which is always the case in the heterogeneous effects of atmosphere of our globe.\n\n2. Lightning strikes the highest and most pointed objects in its way, preferably to others; as high hills and trees, towers, spires, masts of ships, points of spears, &c. In like manner, all pointed conductors receive or throw off the electric fluid more readily than those which are terminated by flat surfaces.\n\n3. Lightning is observed to take the readiest and best conductor; so does electricity in the discharge of the Leyden phial.\n\n4. Lightning sets fire to inflammable bodies; so does electricity.\n\n5. Lightning, as well as electricity, fuses metals.\n\n6. Lightning rends some bodies. The same does electricity.\n\n7. Lightning has often been known to strike people blind. And a pigeon, after a violent shock of electricity, by which the Doctor intended to have killed it, was observed to have been struck blind likewise.\n\n8. Lightning destroys animal life. Animals have likewise been killed by the shock of electricity.\n\n9. Magnets have been observed to lose their virtue, or to have their poles reversed by lightning. The same effect has been produced by electricity.\n\nReasoning on the similarity of these effects, he formed the bold attempt to draw down lightning from the clouds, and examine by experiment whether he could produce effects similar to those of nature. Having observed the effects of pointed conductors in attracting the electric fluid more easily than those of any other form, he conceived that pointed rods of iron, fixed in the air, when the atmosphere was loaded with lightning, might draw from it the matter of thunderbolts, without noise or danger, into the body of the earth. His account of this supposition is given by himself in the following words: \"The electric fluid is attracted by points. We do not know whether this property be in lightning; but since they agree in all the particulars in which we can already compare them, it is not improbable that they agree likewise in this. Let the experiment be made.\"\n\nIn the year 1752, while waiting for the erection of a spire in the city of Philadelphia, not imagining that a pointed rod of moderate height could answer the lightning purpose; at last it occurred to him, that, by means of a common kite, he could have readier access to the clouds, higher regions of the atmosphere than any other way whatever. Preparing, therefore, a large silk handkerchief, and two cords sticks of a proper length on which to extend it, he took the opportunity of the first approaching thunder-storm to take a walk into a field where there was a field proper for his purpose. But dreading the ridicule which too often attends unsuccessful attempts in science, he communicated his intention to nobody but his son, who assisted him in raising the kite. A considerable time elapsed before there was any appearance of success. One very promising cloud had passed over the kite without any effect; when, just as he was beginning to despair, he observed some loo\nloose threads of the hempen string to stand erect, and avoid one another, just as if they had been suspended by the conductor of a common electrical machine. On this he presented his knuckle to a key which was fastened to the string, and thus obtained a very evident electric spark. Others succeeded, even before the string was wet; but when the rain had begun to descend, he collected electric fire pretty copiously. We are told, that when he saw the fibres of the string erect themselves, he uttered a deep sigh, and wished that moment to be his last, feeling that by this discovery his name would be immortalized. He had afterwards an insulated iron rod to draw the lightning into his house; and performed almost every experiment with real lightning, that had before been done with the artificial representations of it by electrical machines. That he might lose no opportunity of making his experiments, he connected two bells with his insulated rod; and these by their ringing, gave him notice whenever his apparatus was electrified by the lightning.\n\nAlthough we have recounted Dr Franklin's experiments first, he was not however, the first who verified his own hypothesis. This was done in France, about a month before Dr Franklin's experiments with the kite.\n\nThe most active persons were two French gentlemen, Mefris Dalibard, and Delor. The former prepared his apparatus at Marly la ville, situated about five or six leagues from Paris; the latter at his own house, which was on some of the highest ground in that capital. Mr Dalibard's apparatus consisted of an iron rod, 40 feet long, the lower extremity of which was brought into a fenny box where the rain could not enter; while on the outside, it was fastened to three wooden poles, by silken strings defended from the rain. This machine was the first that happened to be favoured with a visit from the ethereal fire. Mr Dalibard himself was not at home; but, in his absence he had intrusted the care of his apparatus to one Coifier, a joiner, who had served 14 years among the dragoons, and on whose courage and understanding he could depend. This artificer had all the necessary instructions given him, and was desired to call some of his neighbours, particularly the curate of the parish, whenever there should be any appearance of a thunder-storm. At length the long-expected event arrived. On Wednesday the 10th of May 1752, between two and three in the afternoon, Coifier heard a pretty loud clap of thunder. Immediately he ran to the machine, taking with him a vial furnished with a brafs wire; and presenting the wire to the end of the rod, a small spark issued from it with a snap like that of a spark from an electrified conductor. Stronger sparks were afterwards drawn, in the presence of the curate and a number of other people. The curate's account of them was, that they were of a blue colour, an inch and a half in length, and smelled strongly of sulphur. In taking them, he received a stroke on his arm, a little below the elbow; but he could not tell whether it came from the brafs wire inserted into the phial, or from the bar. He did not attend to it at the time, but the pain continuing, he uncovered his arm when he went home, in the presence of Coifier. A mark was perceived round it, such as might have been made with a blow of the wire on his naked skin.\n\nEight days after, Mr Delor witnessed the same appearances at his own house, though only a cloud passed over, without either thunder or lightning. His apparatus differed little from that of Mr Dalibard, except that his rod was 99 feet high, and answered rather better than that of the other gentleman. As it was found that only a small quantity of electric fluid could be collected by a single pointed rod, these experimentalists added to this apparatus a number of insulated iron bars, communicating with the pointed iron conductor, constituting what they called a magazine of electricity.\n\nDr Franklin having proved the identity of lightning and electricity, was desirous of ascertaining whether the electricity produced from the clouds was positive or negative. The first time he succeeded in making an experiment for this purpose, was on the 12th of April 1753, when the lightning appeared to be negative. Having found that the clouds electrified negatively for eight successive thunder-gusts, he concluded that their electricity was always negative, and set about forming a theory to account for this. But he afterwards found he had concluded too soon. For on the sixth of June following, he met with one cloud which was electrified positively; upon which he corrected his former theory, but did not seem able perfectly to satisfy himself with any other. The Doctor sometimes found the clouds would change from positive to negative electricity several times in the course of one thunder-gust, and he once observed the air to be strongly electrified during a fall of snow, when there was no thunder at all.\n\nThe experiments of Dr Franklin and M. Dalibard, were soon known over all Europe, and the electricians of every country were eager to participate in the glory and satisfaction to be derived from such grand undertakings. M. M. Mazeas, Monnier, and de Roma in France, Canton and Willon in England, and above all, Beccaria in Italy, made a number of interesting experiments on the electricity to be drawn from the clouds, and soon discovered that signs of electricity might be obtained, not only during thunder-storms, but almost at all times, and in every kind of weather. But before we relate these observations, we must conclude our present subject. We shall only here describe Dr Priestley's method of constructing a thunder-rod for making such observations.\n\n\"On the top of any building, which will be the most convenient if it stand upon an eminence, erect a conducting pole as tall as a man can well manage, having on the top of it a solid piece of glass or baked wood a foot in length. Let this be covered with a tin or copper vessel in the form of a funnel, to prevent its ever being wetted. Above this, let there rise a long slender rod, terminating in a pointed wire, and having a small wire twisted round its whole length, to conduct the electricity the better to the funnel. From the funnel make a wire descend along the building, about a foot distance from it, and be conducted through an open sash, into any room which shall be most convenient for making the experiments. In this room let a proper conductor be insulated, and connected with the wire coming in at the window. This wire and conductor, being completely insulated, will be electrified whenever there is a considerable quantity of electricity in the air; and notice will be given when it is properly charged, either...\"\nby Mr Canton's balls hung to it, or by a set of bells.\n\nSect. II. Of the Phenomena and Effects of Lightning.\n\nA thunder-storm commonly commences in the following manner. At first a low dense cloud begins to form in a part of the atmosphere which was previously clear; this cloud increases fast, but only from its upper part, and spreads into an arched form, appearing like a large heap of cotton wool. Its lower surface is generally level, as if it reeled on a smooth plane. The wind is all this time very gentle, and frequently it is imperceptible.\n\nNumberless small ragged clouds, like teazled flakes of cotton, soon begin to make their appearance, moving about in various directions, and perpetually changing their irregular surface, appearing to increase by gradual accumulation. As they move about, they approach each other, and appear to stretch out their ragged arms towards each other; they do not often come in contact, but after approaching very near each other, they evidently recede, either in whole, or by bending away their ragged arms.\n\nWhile this irregular motion continues, the whole mass of small clouds gradually approaches towards the large cloud which first appeared, and with which they finally coalesce; frequently, however, uniting with each other into larger masses, before the general coalescence takes place. The upper cloud often increases by accretion of fresh vapour, without any affluence from the smaller masses. When this happens, its lower surface, which was before level and regular, becomes ragged, and stretches out its irregular tatters towards each other, and towards the earth. The clouds now thicken fast, moving about swiftly in all directions, and flashes of lightning are seen to dart from one cloud to another; the wind now rises or increases, generally blowing in squalls. The lightning becomes more frequent, striking between the clouds and the earth, often in two places at once; flashes of various shapes and various brilliancy are produced, and frequently a vast expanse of horizon appears in one blaze of light. The thunder is now heard to roar at a distance, gradually approaching nearer, and soon succeeded by heavy rain.\n\nThe circumstances to be noticed as attending a thunder-storm, chiefly respect the form and colours of the lightning, the sound of the thunder, and the deviations produced when an explosion takes place between a cloud and some imperfectly conducting body on the surface of the earth.\n\nThe form of the flash is various, but in ordinary lightning it is generally angular, or zig-zag; this zig-zag is sometimes larger than at others, and in some instances the flash is divided into several distinct currents. These diversities might be expected from the heterogeneous nature, and various conducting power, of the several substances which float in our atmosphere. As these substances are placed in no certain order, the electric spark, in passing through the air, and striking successively from one of these bodies to another, as so many stepping stones irregularly placed, can seldom observe the same tract, and hence its zig-zag appearance.\n\nSometimes the flash appears as one dense ball of fire, especially when it strikes from a cloud to any part of a building, when it is generally described as a globe of fire falling on the building.\n\nThe colours of the flash are also various; pale straw colours of colour, vivid yellow, and various shades of blue, are the most prevailing tints. These various colours probably depend on the different density of the air through which the light has passed, or perhaps, on its different nature. We found, when relating the experiments of Mr Morgan on the appearance of the electric light in rarefied air, that its colour varied with the degree of rarity produced in the exhausted receiver; and from the experiments on passing the electric spark through various gases, we found that the colour of the light varied considerably with the nature of the gas through which it passed.\n\nLightning very often appears without being succeeded by thunder, but we believe there is scarcely an instance where the latter is not preceded by the former; we say, scarcely an instance, for we have on record in the 77th volume of the Philosophical Transactions, an account of a thunder-storm that happened on the banks of the Tweed in 1785, in which an explosion took place that killed a man and two horses, but was not preceded by any flash. The respectable recorder of this account, Mr Brydone, was not himself a witness of the accident, but could not learn from the persons whom he interrogated, (two Scotch peasants), who had seen the accident, that there was any preceding flash of lightning. In such singular circumstances, and with such doubtful authority, we should be disposed to suspend our belief, and, until some similar instance better authenticated shall occur, to take it for granted, that a clap of thunder is always preceded by a flash of lightning.\n\nThe sound which attends the explosion of the lightning, varies according to the distance from which it is heard, and the nature of the country where the storm takes place. At a little distance, it is generally a hoarse grumbling noise, which appears to extend through a considerable part of the atmosphere, and gradually dies away. If it be heard very near, the crash is instantaneous, and exactly similar to the explosion of a cannon, when we are very near it at the time of its being fired.\n\nWhen the explosion begins very near, the snap begins with great sharpness, and for some time resembles the violent tearing of a piece of strong silk; but it becomes more mellow as it proceeds to a greater distance.\n\nIf the country where the storm happens be high and irregular, where there are numerous objects capable of reverberating the sound, the explosion consists of a long and broken succession of claps, the loudness of which varies more according to the nature and circumstances of the reverberating objects, than according to the length of time which intervenes between the claps. In a level and low country, where there is no diversity of reverberating objects, and particularly at sea, the series of explosions is regular, and their loudness decreases as the length of time increases.\n\nThe explosion of thunder differs from the snap produced by the electric spark, or even the explosion of a jar or a battery, not only in its degree of loudness, but\nin its nature; it is a long-continued, rumbling, unequalable noise. The long-continued roar of thunder, is certainly owing to the commencement and termination of the explosion reaching our ears at different periods of time; and the unequally loud rumbling noise is owing to the different parts of the explosion striking the ear in a different manner.\n\nIt will not be improper here to mention the method by which the distance of a thunder-stroke may be ascertained. By observing the flash, and counting, by means of a watch with a second hand, the number of seconds which elapse between the appearance of the flash and the commencement of the roar, this may be easily effected; for we know that sound travels at the rate of 186,708 feet in a minute; by reducing the time observed between the flash and the report, into seconds, and allowing for each its proper number of feet, we obtain, with sufficient accuracy, the distance of the stroke from the place of observation.\n\nTo understand the manner in which the explosion of thunder is produced, we must observe, that the air of the atmosphere is often arranged in strata, and these strata are bounded by clouds. That the clouds are stratified, is very evident. From various causes, to be explained hereafter, these strata, or the opposite surfaces of a particular stratum, are possessed of opposite states of electricity, or the stratum becomes charged as the plate of air between the two coated boards, described in No. 235. Numerous experiments have proved, that during a thunder-form, there is a contemporaneous accumulation and deficiency of the electric fluid, or that there are two parts in the atmosphere, that are in the opposite states of positive and negative electricity. Hence we may easily conceive the nature of the explosion; for when the accumulation and deficiency, on the opposite surfaces of the stratum of air, have attained a certain height, a discharge must take place, similar to the spontaneous discharge of a Leyden phial.\n\nThe explosion commonly takes place in the heavens, and is merely the restoration of the equilibrium between opposite clouds; but in some instances, the explosion happens between the clouds and the earth. In this latter case, it is believed by most electricians, that the earth is in the negative state; but Mr G. Morgan is of opinion, that the deficiency is never in the earth, but in some other cloud to which an easier passage is found through so good a conductor as the wet earth, than through the air, which is an imperfect conductor. Mr Morgan brings a great many arguments in support of his opinion, but for these we must refer to his lectures. It is of little consequence to our present purpose, whether the deficiency is in the earth or in some adjacent cloud; it is sufficient to know, that lightning sometimes strikes from the cloud to the earth, or from the earth to the clouds. When this happens, and when the accumulated fluid comes in contact with any body that is an imperfect conductor, such as trees, buildings, &c., it produces those devastations which are sometimes the attendants of severe thunder-storms; these, therefore, we are now to consider.\n\nLightning, when it strikes a building, for the most part attacks the highest parts of it, as the chimneys, or spires, especially if they are surmounted by any metallic work, which is always the case with spires of churches, and not unfrequently on chimney-tops, where iron machines have been placed to prevent smoking. In most of the cases which have been recorded of spherical houses being damaged by lightning, it has entered by the chimney, down which it seems to be conducted by the smoke and foot. Having entered the house, it commonly proceeds to the bell and nearest conductors in its passage, particularly bell-wires, gilt cornices, frames of pictures, and other gilded furniture; these it commonly destroys, fusing, and very often oxidizing, the metal as it passes along. Some very remarkable instances are related of the power of lightning in fusing metals; we have heard of the fusion of bells, of large chains, and of iron conducting-rods near an inch in diameter; but the authority on which these facts are related does not seem worthy of our implicit confidence. There are instances, however, sufficiently credible, where the pointed end of a conductor has been rounded, parts of leaden spouts melted, and the edge and point of a knife completely fused. But in general the bell wires of a house suffer the most; these are always shortened and very commonly melted in some parts; while in others, they are entirely dissipated in oxide, marks of which are very commonly visible on the walls.\n\nIt has been disputed, whether the fusion of metals by lightning be such a chemical fusion as is occasioned by fire, or what is called a cold fusion. Dr Franklin was of the latter opinion; the principal arguments for which, metals by arc, that money has been melted in a person's pocket, and a sword within its scabbard, without the pocket or scabbard being destroyed. We confess ourselves at a loss to conceive what is meant by a cold fusion, as we have no idea of a metallic body being fused at all, i.e., reduced into those globular forms which metals that have been subjected to the action of lightning and electricity usually assume, but by the power of a degree of heat, which would, when applied to bodies sufficiently inflammable, set these on fire.\n\nThat the explosion of lightning frequently does this, is sufficiently certain. In the ordinary cases, indeed, of fires to a building's being struck by lightning, inflammation does not ensue, because the parts of the building through which the fluid passes, are either in their nature very little inflammable, or are so hard and dense in their texture, that they are not easily inflamed. But when the building attacked contains matters of a very combustible nature, such as hay, straw, and more especially gun-powder, a fire is very commonly the consequence; and accordingly, we every now and then hear of instances of stables being burned, and powder magazines blown up by lightning.\n\nWhen the lightning in its course meets with any obstruction, as in passing through a body which is an imperfect conductor, it overcomes this obstruction by forcing its passage through the resisting body; hence, we very commonly find large beams shattered, and stones and bricks either driven from their places, or split and perforated in an unequal manner. Frequently, the lightning will forsake one conducting body, as the handle of a bell-wire, and strike through the wall of the room, attracted by some conductor, either of greater power or larger dimensions, such as a kitchen grate, on the other side. This effect of lightning is exactly similar to the perforation and rending of bodies by electricity, as we related when treating of the mechanical effects of that power; it is undoubtedly owing to the sudden expansion\nof the air or moisture contained within the pores of the refilling body.\n\nWe have seen that animals are destroyed by lightning; but the effects of this power on the animal body come to be explained with more propriety in a future part of this work, where we shall treat of the effects of electricity on vegetable and animal life.\n\nWe shall here only relate the unfortunate death of the celebrated Professor Richman of St. Petersburg. This happened on the 6th of August 1753, as he was making experiments on lightning drawn into his own room. He had provided himself with an instrument for measuring the quantity of electricity communicated to his apparatus; and as he stood with his head inclined to it, Mr. Solokow an engraver, who was near him, observed a globe of blue fire, as big as his fist, jump from the instrument, which was about a foot distant, to Mr. Richman's head. The professor was instantly dead, and Mr. Solokow was also much hurt. The latter, however, could give no particular account of the way in which he was affected; for, at the time the professor was struck, there arose a sort of steam or vapour, which entirely benumbed him, and made him sink down to the ground, so that he could not even remember to have heard the clap of thunder, which was a very loud one. The globe of fire was attended with an explosion like that of a pistol; the instrument for measuring the electricity (called by the professor an electrical gnomon) was broken to pieces, and the fragments thrown about the room. Upon examining the effects of the lightning in the professor's chamber, they found the door-case half split through, and the door torn off and thrown into the room. They opened a vein in the body twice, but no blood followed; after which, they endeavoured to recover life by violent friction, but in vain; upon turning the corpse with the face downwards during the rubbing, an inconsiderable quantity of blood ran out of the mouth. There appeared a red spot on the forehead, from which spurted some drops of blood through the pores without wounding the skin. The shoe belonging to the left foot was burst open, and uncovering the foot at that part, they found a blue mark; from whence it was concluded, that the electric matter having entered at the head, made its way out again at that foot. Upon the body, particularly on the left side, were several red and blue spots, resembling leather shrunk by being burnt. Many more also became visible over the whole body, and particularly over the back. That upon the forehead changed to a brownish red, but the hair of the head was not fringed. In the place where the shoe was unstriped, the flocking was entire; as was the coat everywhere, the waistcoat only being fringed on the fore flap where it joined the hinder; but there appeared on the back of Mr. Solokow's coat long narrow streaks, as if red-hot wires had burned off the nap, and which could not well be accounted for.\n\nWhen the professor's body was opened next day, the cranium was very entire, having neither fissure nor contra-fissure; the brain was sound; but the transparent pellicles of the windpipe were excessively tender, and easily rent. There was some extravasated blood in it, as also in the cavities below the lungs. Those of the breast were quite sound; but those towards the back of a brownish black colour, and filled with more of the blood above mentioned. The throat, the glands, and the small intestines, were all inflamed. The fingered leathery-coloured spots penetrated the skin only. In 48 hours the body was so much corrupted, that they could scarcely get it into a coffin.\n\nFrom the dangers to which persons and buildings are distance at exposed from lightning, it becomes an object of importance to ascertain the distance at which they may be considered as secure from its influence. The following dangerous observations of Mr. G. Morgan on this subject are related with ingenuity and good sense.\n\n\"The greatest danger of a thunder-storm lies between Morgan's two nearest extremities of the correspondent parts of the charged atmosphere, or in that interval of un-electrified air which is always found to separate the positive from the negative portion of the loaded cloud: but on either side of this interval, the further you get into the positive or the negative, the more does the power of injuring diminish.\n\n\"The idea which I now wish to impress, will be illustrated by the following circumstances of fact.\n\n\"Take a Leyden phial, five inches in diameter, and thirteen or fourteen inches in height. On the inside, let the coating rise till its upper edge be two inches and a half from the rim of the vessel. On the outside, let the coating rise no higher than one inch from the bottom. When the phial is thus coated, let it be charged, and a spark will pass from the tin-foil on the outside to that on the inside; but its form will resemble that of a tree, whose trunk will increase in magnitude and brilliancy, and consequently in power, as it approaches the edge, owing to ramifications which it collects from all parts of the glass. Within two inches of the edge it becomes one body or stream, and along that interval its greatest force acts.\n\n\"When two clouds, or the two correspondent parts of a cloud, have their equilibrium restored by a discharge, the appearances are exactly similar to those of the preceding experiment. Each extremity of the flash is formed by a multitude of little streams, which gather into one body, whose power is undivided in that interval only which separates the positive from the negative.\n\n\"In this country these appearances are frequently seen; but they are most commonly hidden by intervening clouds. While I was passing over Mount Jura, one night during a thunder-storm, the flashes succeeded each other so rapidly, that about thirty struck within each minute, but owing to the height of my situation at that time, not one of them appeared otherwise than partially or generally, according to the description I have just given. Sometimes a lower cloud would hide one of the two charged parts, and in this case the lightning assumed the form of a tree, whose trunk and branches only appeared. Sometimes the trunk was hidden, and then the ramifications on each side were alone visible. Frequently intervening clouds would hide all but the trunk, and the lightning then appeared as it commonly does to a spectator in a low situation.\n\n\"It must be obvious from the preceding statement of circumstances, that the greatest deviation of lightning must take place in that interval through which the whole body of the fluid passes, and that as you penetrate further and further into the cloud, the stream that is formed becomes less and less, like a river which diminishes...\"\nnithes by entwining itself as you approach its fountain. Hence to us placed on the ground, no danger can ever occur, till the clouds are so low, that the striking distance through air, or the aerial interval between the charged parts, resists the passage more powerfully than the body of earth, and any additional portion of atmosphere which may lie in the direction of the earth from the striking interval.\n\n\"If the charged cloud lies in contact with the ground, its passage to the earth will be that of several streams, and the danger will be great, in proportion to the magnitude of these separate stream which passes through any given part of the earth; and several distinct situations may be thus unequally endangered at the same time. Hence it happens, that the same stroke will frequently injure several distinct buildings, which are very near to each other, and that different degrees of injury are always observed in the different tracts.\n\n\"The striking distance, or the length of the interval of greatest danger, will vary with the height of the charge, and not with the dimensions of the charged body. This is clear from a multitude of facts already illustrated and applied. We may hence safely conclude, that the longer any charged cloud is in the vicinity of the wet ground, the more will the length, and consequently the danger, of its striking distance be diminished, provided the points and prominences, which are active on the ground, discharge the fluid more abundantly than it is accumulated by the producing cause.\n\n\"From what I have already said, it is clear that all the parts of the circuit, through which a thunder cloud may discharge its contents, are not equally dangerous, and that the maximum of danger is confined within much narrower limits than those of the interval, within which it may be felt in one inferior degree or another. You must however perceive, that as the cloud enlarges, the number of additions increases, by which the great body of the flash is formed, and that the length of the most dangerous interval will always increase with, and bear a certain proportion to, the diameter of the cloud. In our attempts to estimate this diameter, we may follow two methods, which have been recommended; but I cannot say that either of these methods has any great pretensions to accuracy.\n\n\"1st, If you measure the space on which the thunder-shower falls, it is said that you measure what is commensurable with the dimensions of the thunder-cloud. In a mountainous country this measurement is very possible; for the body of the shower may be seen at a small distance, well described upon the elevated grounds whose parts it separates from the eye. Its diameter, therefore, may be correctly estimated from the distance of those well known objects by which it is bounded. Those thunder-showers, which I have observed, have varied in their diameter, from five hundred yards to two miles. It is, however, to be observed, that the partial vacuum, produced by the collapse attending the removal of the electric fluid, may extend its influence to a greater distance, and cause the fall of rain, by rarefying the atmosphere, far beyond the bounds of the charged cloud.\n\n\"2dly, The velocity of a cloud may be known by measuring its height, and the time which any fixed appearance in it takes to describe a certain angle. This may be done in a very small portion of time, and when it is done, you are next to watch the moment at which it begins to affect your elevated conductor, and with equal accuracy you are to mark the evanescence of its signs. The knowledge of these circumstances, united with that of the cloud's velocity, will correctly determine its dimensions.\n\n\"From a diary in my possession, made by Mr. Brook, it does not appear that the same electricity ever lasted more than fifteen minutes. When the symptoms of approaching thunder were decisive, the opposite electricity generally lasted as long, and the interval of time between the two electrics seldom exceeded one-tenth of the whole.\n\n\"If we allow, that the cloud in this case moved at the rate of eight or ten miles in an hour, its diameter must have been four miles. However, in many instances, all the above-mentioned changes of electricity took place in two minutes. This happened several times successively, and each series of changes terminated by a flash of lightning. In all instances of this kind, to make the diameter of the cloud half a mile, we must suppose that it moves at the rate of thirty miles an hour; and in such a case, one-tenth of the whole, or the interval of greatest danger, would not exceed a hundred and eighty yards. But on the supposition that the size of the cloud were such as to strike over the distance of two miles, many are the circumstances which, on its descent towards the ground will encroach upon its offensive powers, change its direction, or decrease and perhaps altogether annihilate its violence.\n\n\"1. Innumerable points and prominences rise from the whole surface of the earth over which it hangs. These act as so many channels, through which its contents will find a rapid evacuation. In the power of carrying off the fluid gradually, I have been able to discover but little difference between partial and metallic conductors. It should be added, that the torrent through an elevated wire is such, when the cloud approaches it, as would discharge a battery, whose surface equalled four or five acres, in twenty or thirty seconds. When, therefore, millions of other conductors are acting with equal effect at the same moment, that must be an immense cloud indeed, whose striking distance in such circumstances is not much lessened, or whose striking powers are not altogether exhausted.\n\n\"2. Metals alone conduct the fluid better than charged surfaces. If a plate of glass, coated on one side with tin-foil, be charged and placed in a circuit, so that the contents of a jar may pass over the other side uncoated, the luminous striking distance will be quadruple what it is in air. Such a combination of changes as that which I have now described must frequently occur in the upper regions of the atmosphere; for the charged clouds must lie in strata above each other; and in the varieties of their motions, produced by their mutual attractions, and by the innumerable causes which affect their different currents, they must be perpetually serving as discharging-rods to one another. We consequently find that nine hundred and ninety-nine flashes out of a thousand, strike from cloud to cloud through the intervening air.\"\n\nSevere shocks have been sometimes experienced from...\na flash of lightning, when the person or building struck has been at a very considerable distance from the cloud in which the discharge appeared to take place. A person at Vienna received a terrible shock from a thunder-rod, on which his hand reeled during an explosion that happened at the distance of three miles from the place where the conductor was erected; and it is supposed that a shock might be felt, or even a person killed, at a distance \"prodigiously greater.\" It is certain that during a thunder-storm, the insulated conductor is affected at every explosion, however great, so as to emit sparks.\n\nIt is supposed by most electricians that no direct stroke is adequate to the production of these effects, and they have therefore had recourse to what Lord Stanhope calls the returning stroke. The following is an abridgment of this theory.\n\nLet PC, fig. 122, represent a conductor charged positively; and AB a conductor in its natural state, placed so that one of its extremities A may just enter the atmosphere of PC. In this case, Lord Stanhope says, that the superabundance of PC will cause some of the natural share of AB to pass from A to B, where it is stopped and accumulated. By this change A is left in a different or negative state, and B by the addition it has received becomes positive. But when the superabundance at P is taken off, the positive fluid at B rushes back to its natural place at A, and this restoration is called the returning stroke.\n\nAgain, let us suppose PC to be negative; and A placed as before just within its atmosphere. Now part of the fluid in AB will rush from B to A, and there being stopped will produce an accumulation; but when PC is discharged, this accumulation will disappear, and the returning stroke will be from A to B.\n\nTo apply this to the present case. Let us suppose two clouds horizontally distant, A and B (in the annexed diagram), the one A electrified positively and the other B negatively, to be incumbent over the surface of the earth at a and b; they will here tend to produce the opposite states, or the part of the surface a will be negative and b positive. If now a discharge take place between the clouds A and B, the fluid will rush back from b to a; and if conductors are fixed at these places, the fluid will rush down the conductors at b, and up that at a. The same effects, though in a less degree, will be produced, if we suppose the negative cloud B placed above the positive cloud A.\n\nBy this theory, Lord Stanhope undertook to explain how the man and two horses were killed in the thunder-storm described by Mr Brydone, and his Lordship presented a very able paper on this subject to the Royal Society.\n\nThis theory of Lord Stanhope has been well received, and it is no small testimony in its favour that it has obtained the support of so able a philosopher as Professor Robison. Mr G. Morgan, however, strenuously objects to this theory, on the very serious grounds that its principle is erroneous, its effects overrated, and its application unnecessary. Our limits will not permit us to detail all Mr Morgan's objections, but we must confess they do not convince us of the fallacy of the theory, although they certainly tend to invalidate the effects attributed to the returning stroke.\n\n\"Let us allow,\" says Mr Morgan, \"that the force required by the theory is rendered active in the manner which I have just described, what reason have we for believing that it would be active to the degree supposed? Lord Stanhope has estimated, that what is effects separated from our natural share without injuring us, and the return may be absent for hours without being felt, is so great in quantity as to destroy us by its motion in returning. But what are the grounds of this estimate? As yet it has been justified by no appeal, either to fact or experiment; and the person who could say, that the greatest possible loss from our natural share is little or nothing, would certainly stand upon equal, I think rather better, grounds, than those who would make it adequate to the fusion of metals and the destruction of life. I would add, that when the power of the returning stroke is magnified as it is in this theory, the rationale of this bold estimate is not only neglected, but it is neglected where it might have been made without much trouble.\n\n\"If the returning stroke of a thunder-cloud will destroy large edifices, surely artificial electricity could produce a similar stroke which would destroy a bird or a mouse, or act on some scale analogous to that which it is said to resemble. If, I say, the returning stroke in nature will melt the irons of a waggon wheel, surely, with the grand machines which we are now able to construct, such a returning stroke might be caused as would melt a capillary thread of metal. But nothing of this kind has ever been done or attempted by those who support the theory, and I am bold enough to prophecy, from the details of my own experience, that nothing of the kind ever will be done.\"\n\nSect. III. Of the means of preventing Accidents from Lightning.\n\nIt has been well observed, that knowledge is invaluable chiefly in proportion as it is useful; a maxim of conduct which no man ever exemplified better than Dr Franklin against lightning. No sooner was the real nature of lightning ascertained by experiment, than it was naturally suggested to Franklin that this grand discovery might be rendered beneficial to mankind, by affording means for preserving buildings from the formerly inevitable devastations of that powerful instrument of nature. Here too, the genius of Franklin led the way; and as he certainly deserves the greatest share of the merit due to the discovery of the identity of lightning and electricity, we are also chiefly indebted to him for the means of applying this knowledge to advantage. He was led to propose the use of pointed metallic conductors attached to the building, as a security against the effects of lightning; and this proposal, like most of Dr Franklin's ingenious contrivances in electricity, was the result at once of acute reasoning and accurate observation.\n\nDr Franklin considered the earth as performing the office of a conductor, in restoring to the atmosphere the ions for electrical equilibrium, that had been disturbed by the conflagrations which tend to produce atmospherical electricity. In its course, he observes, that the lightning will commonly strike the best conductors; and accordingly, as a metallic rod is a much more perfect conductor than the stones, bricks, &c., of which buildings are chiefly composed, the lightning will strike the rod in preference.\nELECTRICITY.\n\nChap. I.\n\nAtmospheric Electricity.\n\nRequisites to be observed.\n\nShould be of the best conductors.\n\nShould be of sufficient diameter, and perfectly continuous.\n\nThunder-houfe.\n\nence to the materials of the building. He therefore advised, that a metallic rod should be fixed to some part of the building, penetrating for some distance into the moist earth, and, as lightning does not in every case strike the highest parts of a building, that the rod should extend for some feet above these, in order, as it were, to solicit the lightning. As lightning has been found to destroy metallic rods of a considerable diameter, he advises, that these conductors should be at least half an inch thick, that they may the better resist the destructive power of the lightning.\n\nFrom a comparison of numerous experiments and observations, the following rules have been laid down for the construction of conductors.\n\n1. That the rods be made of such substances as are in their nature the best conductors of electricity.\n\nIt is found that all metals do not conduct equally well, and that lead and copper are the best fitted to serve as conductors against lightning; but as lead is exceedingly destructible by electricity, and therefore would require to be of a very considerable diameter, copper is to be preferred, as well on account of its greater conducting power, as from its being less liable to contract rust than iron, which is commonly employed.\n\n2. That the rods be of a sufficient diameter.\n\n3. That they be perfectly uninterrupted, or, if formed of several pieces, that their junctions be as nearly in contact as possible.\n\nThe effect of interruptions in conductors, as well as the effects of lightning in general on buildings, may be illustrated by the following experiments.\n\nExper. 1.—Fig. 123. shews an instrument representing the side of a house, either furnished with a metallic conductor, or not; by which both the bad effects of lightning striking upon a house not properly secured, and the usefulness of metallic conductors, may be clearly represented. A is a board about three-quarters of an inch thick, and shaped like the gable end of a house. This board is fixed perpendicularly upon the bottom board B, upon which the perpendicular glass pillar CD is also fixed, in a hole about eight inches distant from the basis of the board A. A square hole, LMK, about a quarter of an inch deep, and nearly one inch wide, is made in the board A, and is filled with a square piece of wood, nearly of the same dimensions. We say nearly of the same dimensions, because it must go so easily into the hole, that it may drop off by the least shaking of the instrument. A wire, LK, is fastened diagonally to this square piece of wood. Another wire, IH, of the same thickness, having a brass ball, H, screwed on its pointed extremity, is fastened upon the board A; so also is the wire MN, which is looped in a ring at O.\n\nFrom the upper extremity of the glass pillar CD, a crooked wire proceeds, having a spring socket F, through which a double-knobbed wire slips perpendicularly, the lower knob G of which falls just above the knob H. The glass pillar DC must not be made very fast into the bottom board; but it must be fixed so as to be pretty easily moved round its own axis, by which means the brass ball G may be brought nearer or farther from the ball H, without touching the part of EFG. Now when the square piece of wood LMIK (which may represent the shutter of a window or the like) is fixed into the hole so, that the wire LK stands in the dotted representation IM, then the metallic communication from H to O is complete, and the instrument represents a house furnished with a proper metallic conductor; but if the square piece of wood LMIK is fixed so, that the wire LK stands in the direction LK, as represented in the figure, then the metallic conductor HO, from the top of the house to its bottom, is interrupted at IM, in which case the house is not properly secured.\n\nFix the piece of wood LMIK, so that its wire may be as represented in the figure, in which case the metallic conductor HO is discontinued. Let the ball G be fixed at about half an inch perpendicular distance from the ball H, then, by turning the glass pillar DC, remove the former ball from the latter: by a wire or chain connect the wire EF with the wire Q of the jar P, and let another wire or chain, fastened to the hook O, touch the outside coating of the jar. Connect the wire Q with the prime conductor, and charge the jar; then, by turning the glass pillar DC, let the ball G come gradually near the ball H, and when they are arrived sufficiently near one another, you will observe that the jar explodes, and the piece of wood, LMIK, is pushed out of the hole to a considerable distance from the thunder-house. Now the ball G, in this experiment, represents an electrified cloud; which, when it is arrived sufficiently near the top of the house A, the electricity strikes it, and, as this house is not secured with a proper conductor, the explosion breaks part of it, i.e., knocks off the piece of wood IM.\n\nRepeat the experiment with only this variation, viz., that this piece of wood IM is situated so, that the wire LK may stand in the situation IM; in which case the conductor HO is not discontinued; and you will observe, that the explosion will have no effect upon the piece of wood LMIK; this remaining in the hole unmoved; which shews the usefulness of the metallic conductor.\n\nFurther: Unscrew the brass ball H from the wire HI, so that this may remain pointed, and, with this difference only in the apparatus, repeat both the above experiments; and you will find that the piece of wood IM is in neither case moved from its place, nor any explosion will be heard; which demonstrates the preference of conductors with pointed terminations to those with blunted ones.\n\nExper. 2.—This apparatus is sometimes made in the powder-shape of a house, as represented fig. 124, where, for the house's sake of distinctness, the side and part of the roof next the eye are not represented. The gable end AC represents that of the thunder-house, and may be used in the same manner with that above described, or more readily by the following method. Let one ball of the discharging rod touch the ball of the charged jar, and the other the knob A of the conductor AC of the thunder-house; the jar will then of course explode, and the fluid will act upon the conductor just mentioned. The conducting wire at the windows HH must be placed in a line. The sides and gable AC of the house are connected with the bottom by hinges; and the building is kept together by a ridge on the roof. To use this model, fill the small tube a with gunpowder, and ram the wire c a little way into the tube; then connect the tube e with the bottom of a large jar or battery. When the jar is charged, form a communication from the hook at C, on the outside, to the top of the jar, by discharging.\ndischarging the rod; the discharge will fire the powder, and the explosion of the latter will throw off the roof, with the sides, back and front, so that they will all fall down together. The figures f and g in the side of the house represent a small ramrod for the tube a, and a pricker for the touch-hole at C.\n\nMr Jones of Holborn makes the front of the common thunder-houses, as well as the powder-house above described, with two pieces of wood or windows h h, which, by being placed in proper situations, the one to conduct and the other to reflect the fluid, will illustrate by one discharge the usefulness of good conductors for securing buildings or magazines from the explosion of thunder, as well as the danger of using imperfect ones.\n\nExper. 3.—Fig. 125 represents a wooden pyramid, made in several pieces, with a wire through each, so that their ends may touch, as at s s s. Let one corner of the pedestal d be loose, and have the safety wire pass almost but not quite through it. Let the wire passing through the rest of the pedestal join by a chain the outside coating of a Leyden phial. If the cloud x be supported by a wire from the prime conductor, and hang half an inch from the knob q of the pyramid; when the phial is discharged, a spark will take place between x and g; the spark will pass along the wires s s s, till it comes to the break at d; there an explosion will take place, that will drive out the corner-stone d, and overthrow the fabric.\n\nAbundant observation has proved the danger of having discontinuous conductors either attached to a building, or forming part of the materials. About the middle of the last century, the steeple of St Bride's church in London was struck by lightning, and greatly injured. In the construction of this steeple a great deal of iron work had been employed; the stones having been fastened together in many places by iron cramps, the ends of which were covered with small stones. The lightning seems first to have struck the vane of the spire, from which it was safely conducted down the shaft by which the vane was supported; from the extremity of this shaft, it leaped to two cross iron bars which were at the base of the obelisk, shattering the obelisk in its way. Hence it passed to one of the above mentioned cramps, and thus from cramp to cramp throwing out or demolishing the stones as it passed along.\n\nThe principles of electricity afford us an easy explanation of the manner in which the interruption of conductors acts. We know that at the extremity of all long rods there is a considerable accumulation of electricity, and this has here a tendency to fly off with great force, especially if there is another conductor at hand. This other conductor also assists the accumulation in the former by acquiring at its adjacent extremity the opposite electricity. Supposing a positive cloud to be over the upper conductor, this conductor will be electrified positively at its lower extremity, and this accumulation being increased by the negative electricity of the upper and of the lower conductor, will tend to fly off with great violence into the air, or if any obstruction oppose its passage, this will be removed by the bursting or displacing the resisting body.\n\n4. It is necessary that the connection between the conductor and the common stock, or the earth, be as complete as possible.\n\nIt has been said, that the lower extremity of the conductor should be inserted some feet below the surface of the ground; it is also proper that it should be turned in a direction away from the foundation; and as moisture is one of the best conductors, it would be advisable, where this can conveniently be done, to connect the extremity of the metallic rod with some neighbouring piece of water.\n\n5. That the rod be carried from the top of the building to the common stock in the shortest convenient direction, as straight as possible.\n\n6. That the upper extremity be finely tapered, and terminative in a sharp smooth point.\n\nThere is no question in electricity, that has been argued with more keenness, than whether thunder-rods pointed should terminate in a sharp point, or in a round ball. Dr Franklin, we have seen, decidedly gave the preference to a pointed conductor, and he has been followed by most of the electricians of Europe; Dr Wilson standing almost alone in support of the round ball. This controversy was renewed with great warmth on the occasion of a house at Purfleet belonging to the board of ordnance, having been struck by lightning, although guarded by a pointed conductor. A set of very ingenious experiments were made, both by Mr Nairne and Dr Wilson, to estimate the comparative merits of pointed and obtuse conductors; but by these the question was not decided; Mr Nairne's experiments always concluding in favour of pointed conductors, while those of Dr Wilson as constantly favoured the obtuse termination. Most electricians, however, still prefer the pointed conductor.\n\nLet B (fig. 126) represent the position of a charged cloud; A, the part that is oppositely charged, or that is connected with it; FG a pointed wire. In this case, the electric fluid must pass either through the series of partial conductors, a, b, c, &c., or through the body of earth, AF.\n\nNow when, on the one hand, we consider the dryness of that foil which is generally selected for the foundation of buildings, the probability there is that nothing but the foil, thus dry, may separate A from the wire FG, and the certainty that if water should connect A and FG, its resistance is very considerable; when, on the other hand, we take into consideration, the nails, bolts, iron bars, strips of lead, bell wires, and metallic utensils that are scattered through all buildings, we shall, I think, perceive the much greater probability there is of the lightning's passing through a, b, c, d, &c., to the cloud, than of its passage through the ground.\n\n2. Let us erect another wire, HI, and fill the danger is almost as great; for now the possible circuits of the lightning are four, and of those, that leading through the house appears to be the easiest; if HI convey it harmlessly, then it must pass through the body of the air FG, or over the roof of the house. We well know from past experiments, that the insulating power of the air makes the resistance in the direction IG very considerable; and even on the supposition that j were wet, the resistance over the roof of the house is not much considerable. If the house were covered or coped with lead, the probability of a stroke would then be diminished, but not taken away; for, suppose the easiest circuit should lie in the direction KM, then, rather than pass through the body of earth HK, or FK, it might\nmight find an easier passage through the house than either of the conductors. This would not be the case, if a strip of lead, or metallic substance of any kind, extended from K to H, and from K to F. \"I hence thought,\" says Mr Morgan, \"at one time, that a house would be perfectly safe, if a strip of lead were carried around the top, and all the bottom of the building, and then connected by two or three metallic strips extending from the one to the other.\n\n\"Let us suppose that a house were erected over a stratum of moisture, or any other conducting substance, which dipped considerably, at a little distance from the house, and then suddenly rose just below it; in that case, if the stratum became the circuit of a charge, the stroke would rise immediately in the centre or body of the house, and in all directions would force its way with devastation, towards the conductors on the outside.\"\n\nTo prevent all possible danger, Mr G. Morgan proposes, that, while the house is building, the foundation of each partition wall be laid on a strip of lead, or that such a strip be fastened to the sides of these partition walls. The strips should be two inches wide, and at least a quarter of an inch thick, and they should be closely connected with each other. A perpendicular strip on each side of the house, should rise from this bed of conductors, to the surface of the ground; whence a strip should be continued round all the house, and carefully connected with water-pipes, &c. The strips on the sides of the house, should then be continued to the roof, which should be guarded in the same manner as the foundation. The top should be surrounded by a strip, whose connection should spread over every edge and prominence, and should continue to the summit of each separate chimney. It is particularly necessary to guard the chimneys; for Mr Morgan was witness to a case, in which a house that had been guarded, in most respects, according to the foregoing directions, except that the chimneys were unprotected, was struck with lightning which entered by one of the chimneys; here it spent its fury; but the chimney falling on the roof, did considerable damage.\n\nThe principal objection to this method, is the expense attending it; but this may be, in a great measure avoided, by making proper use of the leaden pipes, gutters, and copings, which belong to most houses.\n\nShips, from the height and construction of their masts, and from their being such inflated conducting objects as must necessarily attract the lightning from a cloud that is very near, are peculiarly exposed to danger. It is, therefore, still more necessary to guard vessels by proper conductors. Chains are very commonly employed for this purpose, from their being more conveniently disposed among the rigging; but it is found, that from the want of continuity in the links, chains are very imperfect conductors, and have not unfrequently been broken by a severe shock. Strips of lead, are therefore, to be preferred, both as they are cheaper, and less liable to be injured by the weather and salt water, than iron chains. One strip should surround the deck, and another the bottom or side of the keel, and these should be connected with other strips, embracing the ship in various parts. If the ship be copper-bottomed, it will only be necessary to connect the copper with the deck; but in every case, a strip should\n\nVol. VII, Part II.\nprevent our being injured by the splinters of wood, if the tree should be strucken. It is particularly necessary to avoid rivers and brooks, as these are excellent conductors.\n\nPerhaps the best protection in the open air, is a carriage made so large, as that a person may fit in it at a distance from the tides, especially if it be surrounded at the top and bottom with metallic fillets connected with each other by a strip of the same substance.\n\nIf overtaken in a storm, it is safer to be completely wet than dry.\n\n**CHAP. II. Experiments and Observations on the Spontaneous Electricity of the Atmosphere.**\n\nThe first person who observed the spontaneous electricity of the atmosphere, was M. Momnier, who found that even when there was no appearance of lightning, some degree of electricity might generally be observed in the atmosphere. His experiments were made at St Germaine en Laye, and published in a memoir read at the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris in 1752.\n\nBut more accurate experiments were made upon the electricity of the air by the abbé Mazeas, at Chateau de Maintenon, during the months, June, July, and October, of 1753, and communicated to the Royal Society in a letter to Dr Hales.\n\nThe abbé's apparatus consisted of an iron rod, 370 feet long, raised 90 feet above the horizon. It came down from a very high room in the castle, where it was fastened to a silk cord fixed feet long; and was carried from thence to the steeple of the town, where it was likewise fastened to another silk cord of eight feet long, and sheltered from rain. From the extremity of this rod, a large key was suspended to receive the electric fluid.\n\nWhen he began his experiments, viz. on the 17th of June, the electricity of the air was sensibly felt every day, from sunrise till seven or eight in the evening, except in moist weather, when he could perceive no signs of electricity. In dry weather, the rod attracted minute bodies at no greater distance than three or four lines. He repeated the experiment carefully every day, and constantly observed, that in weather void of storms, the electricity of a piece of sealing wax of two inches long, was above twice as strong as that of the air. This observation inclined him to conclude, that in weather of equal dryness, the electricity of the air was always equal.\n\nIt did not appear to him that hurricanes and tempests increased the electricity of the air, when they were not accompanied with thunder; for that during three days of a very violent continual wind in July, he was obliged to put some dust within four or five lines of the conductor, before any sensible attraction could be perceived.\n\nNo sensible alteration in the electricity of the air was observed under different directions of the winds, except when these were moist.\n\nHe could observe no electricity in the air during the driest nights of summer, but it returned in the morning with the sun, disappearing again soon after sunrise.\n\nThe strongest common electricity of the atmosphere during that summer, was observed in July, on a very dry, clear, warm day.\n\nOn the 27th of June about noon, he perceived some stormy clouds rising above the horizon, and observed that the electricity of the atmosphere occasioned by them, was increased as the clouds reached the zenith. He at this time drew considerable sparks from his apparatus, though there was neither thunder nor lightning.\n\nThe electricity observed during the appearance of these stormy clouds, was not diminished by a very heavy rain, till the clouds began to dissipate.\n\nMr Kinnerley observed, that when the air was in its driest state, there was always a quantity of electricity in it, and which might be easily drawn from it. This, he says, may be proved by a person in the negative state of electricity extending his arm into the air in the dark while holding a pointed needle in his hand; this, however, can only be observed when the air is very dry.\n\nWhether the electricity in the air, in clear dry weather, be of the same density at the height of two or three hundred yards, as on the surface of the earth, Mr Kinnerley thought might be easily ascertained by Dr Franklin's old experiment with the kite. The twine, he says, should have throughout a very small wire in it, and the ends of the wire, where the several lengths are united, ought to be tied down with a waxed thread, to prevent their acting in the manner of points.\n\nMr Canton made several ingenious experiments on atmospheric electricity, by means of his pith-ball electrometer, described in No. 66. According to this philosopher, desiccated atmospheric air, when heated, becomes negatively electric, and when cooled, the electricity is of the positive kind, even when the air is not permitted to expand or contract; and the expansion or contraction of atmospheric air occasions changes in its electrical state.\n\nBut no electrician, in the earlier stage of the science, Beccaria, conducted his observations in this way with greater accuracy, or purified them farther than Sig. Beccaria. He observed, that, during very high winds, his apparatus gave no signs of being electrified. Indeed he found, that in three different states of the atmosphere, he could find no electricity in the air: viz. in windy and clear weather; in weather when the sky was covered with distinct and black clouds, that had a slow motion; in moist weather, not actually raining. In a clear sky, when the weather was calm, he always perceived signs of a moderate electricity, but interrupted. In rainy weather without lightning, his apparatus was always electrified a short time before the rain fell, and during the time of the rain, but it ceased to be affected a little before the rain was over.\n\nThe higher his rods reached or his kites flew, the stronger signs they gave of electricity. Also longer strings and cords, extended and insulated in the open air, acquired electricity sooner than those which were shorter. A cord 1500 Paris feet long, stretched across the river Po, was strongly electrified during a shower without thunder, as a metallic rod, employed to bring lightning into his house, had been in any thunderstorm.\n\nHaving\nHaving two rods for bringing the lightning into his house, 140 feet afar, he observed, that if he took a spark from the higher of these, the spark from the other, which was 30 feet lower, was at that instant lessened; but its power again revived, though he kept his hand upon the former.\n\nHe imagined that the electricity communicated to the air might sometimes furnish small sparks to his apparatus; since the air parts with the electricity it has received very slowly, and therefore the equilibrium of the electric fluid in the air, will not be restored so soon as in the earth and clouds.\n\nAmong the effects of a moderate electricity in the atmosphere, Signor Beccaria considers rain, hail, and snow.\n\nClouds that bring rain, he thought, were produced in the same manner as thunder-clouds, only by a more moderate electricity.\n\nHe notes several circumstances attending rain without lightning, which make it very probable, that it is produced by the same cause as when it is accompanied with lightning. Light has been seen among the clouds by night in rainy weather; and even by day, rainy clouds are sometimes seen to have a brightness evidently independent of the sun. The uniformity with which the clouds are spread, and with which the rain falls, he thought were evidences of a uniform cause, like that of electricity. The intensity of electricity in his apparatus, generally corresponded very nearly to the quantity of rain that fell in the same time.\n\nSometimes all the phenomena of thunder, lightning, hail, rain, snow and wind, have been observed at one time; which shews the connection they all have with some common cause.\n\nSignor Beccaria supposes, therefore, that previous to rain, a small quantity of electric fluid escapes out of the earth, in some place where there was a redundancy of it; and in its ascent to the higher regions of the air, collects and conducts into its path a great quantity of vapours. The same cause that collects will condense them more and more, till in the places of the nearest intervals they come almost into contact, so as to form small drops, which uniting with others as they fall, come down in rain. The rain will be heavier in proportion as the electricity is more vigorous, and the cloud approaches more nearly to a thunder cloud.\n\nHe imitated the appearance of clouds that bring rain, by inflating himself between the rubber and conductor of his electrical machine, and with one hand dropping colophonium into a spoon fastened to the conductor, and holding a burning coal, while his other hand communicated with the rubber. In these circumstances, the smoke spread along his arm, and by degrees all over his body, till it came to the other hand that communicated with the rubber. The lower surface of this smoke was everywhere parallel to his clothes, and the upper surface was swelled and arched like clouds replete with thunder and rain. In this manner, he supposed, the clouds that bring rain diffuse themselves from over those parts of the earth which abound with the electric fluid, to those parts that are exhausted of it; and by letting fall their rain, restore the equilibrium between them.\n\nThis ingenious philosopher supposes hail to be formed in the higher regions of the air, where the cold is intense, and where the electric fluid is very copious.\n\nIn these circumstances a great number of particles of water are brought near together, where they are frozen, and in their descent collect other particles, so that the density of the substance of the hailstone grows less and less from the centre; this being formed first in the higher region, and the surface being collected on the lower. Agreeable to this it is observed, that in mountains, hailstones, as well as drops of rain, are very small; there being but small space through which to fall and thereby increase their bulk. Drops of rain and hail also agree in this circumstance, that the more intense is the electricity that forms them, the larger they are.\n\nClouds of snow differ in nothing from clouds of rain, but in the circumstance of cold which freezes them. Both the regular diffusion of snow, and the regularity in the structure of its particles, shew the clouds of snow to be actuated by some uniform cause like electricity. All these conjectures about the cause of hail and snow were confirmed by observing, that his apparatus never failed to be electrified by snow, as well as by rain.\n\nA more intense electricity unites the particles of hail more closely, than the more moderate electricity does those of snow. In like manner, we see thunder clouds more dense than those that merely bring rain, and the drops of rain are larger in proportion, though they often fall not from so great a height.\n\nMr Romayne observed, that the air in Ireland was generally electrified in a fog, and even in a mist, and that both day and night, but principally in winter; Romayne seldom in summer, except from positive clouds or cool fogs. The electricity of the air in a frost or fog is always positive. He says, that he has often observed, during what seemed the puffing of one cloud, successive changes from negative to positive, and from positive to negative. It may be remarked that most fogs have a smell like an excited glass tube.\n\nMr Henly has shewn, that fogs are more strongly electrified in or immediately after a frost than at other times; and that the electricity of fogs is often the strongest soon after their appearance. Whenever there appears a thick fog, and at the same time the air is sharp and frothy, that fog is strongly electrified positively.\n\nThough rain is not an immediate cause, yet Mr Henly is inclined to consider it as a remote consequence of atmospherical electricity; and he generally found, that in two or three days after he had discovered the air to be strongly electrified, there was either rain or snow.\n\nIf, in clear weather, a low cloud, which moves slowly and is considerably distant from any other, passes over the apparatus, the positive electricity generally grows very weak, but does not become negative; and when the cloud is gone, it returns to its former state. When many whitish clouds keep over the wire, sometimes uniting with and then separating from each other, thus forming a body of considerable extent, the positive electricity commonly increases. In all the above circumstances the positive electricity never changes to negative.\n\nThe clouds which lessen the electricity of the exploring wire, are those which move; though those that are low, seem also to have the same effect.\n\nMr Cavallo has considerably improved our knowledge with respect to atmospherical electricity, and by his apparatus, has greatly facilitated the means of making.\nmaking experiments. His first experiments were made by means of a kite; and after bestowing much pains in constructing kites of various dimensions, &c., he found that a common school-boy's kite, about four feet high, and two wide, answered as well as any other. The string of his kite was formed by twisting together two threads of common twine, and one of copper thread, such as is used for trimmings. When a kite constructed in this manner was raised, he always found the string give signs of electricity, except once, when the weather was warm, and the wind very weak, that the kite could scarcely be raised, and could be kept up only for a few minutes. Afterwards, however, when the wind increased so that he could easily raise the kite, he obtained, as usual, pretty strong signs of electricity.\n\nAs making experiments on atmospheric electricity is often attended with more or less danger, it is necessary to observe the following directions given by Mr Cavallo.\n\n\"In raising the kite when the weather is very cloudy and rainy, in which time there is fear of meeting with a great quantity of electricity, I generally use to hang upon the string AB, fig. 127, the hook of a chain C, the other extremity of which falls upon the ground. Sometimes I use another caution besides, which is, to stand upon an insulating stool; in which situation I think, that if any great quantity of electricity, suddenly discharged by the clouds, strikes the kite, it cannot much affect my person. As to insulated reels, and such-like instruments, that some gentlemen have used to raise the kite, without danger of receiving any shock; fit for the purpose as they may appear to be in theory, they are yet very inconvenient to be managed. Except the kite be raised in time of a thunder-storm, there is no great danger for the operator to receive any shock. Although I have raised my electrical kite hundreds of times without any caution whatever, I have very seldom received a few exceedingly slight shocks in my arms. In time of a thunder-storm, if the kite has not been raised before, I would not advise a person to raise it while the stormy clouds are just overhead; the danger at such time being very great, even with the precautions above mentioned: at that time, without raising the kite, the electricity of the clouds may be observed by a cork-ball electrometer held in the hand in an open place; or, if it rains, by my electrometer for the rain; which will be described hereafter.\n\n\"When the kite has been raised, I generally introduce the string through a window in a room of the house, and fasten it to a strong silk lace, the extremity of which is generally tied to a heavy chair in the room. In fig. 128, A.B represents part of the string of the kite which comes within the room; C represents the silk lace; D.E, a small prime conductor, which, by means of a small wire, is connected with the string of the kite; and F represents the quadrant electrometer, fixed upon a stand of glass covered with sealing-wax, which I used to put near the prime conductor, rather than to fix it in a hole upon the conductor, because the string A.B sometimes shakes so as to pull the prime conductor down; in which case the quadrant electrometer remains safe upon the table; otherwise it would be broken, as I have often experienced before I thought of this method. G represents a glass tube, about eighteen inches long, with a knobbed wire cemented to its extremity; with which instrument I use to observe the quality of the electricity, when the electricity of the kite is so strong that I think it not safe to come very near the string. The method is as follows:—I hold the instrument by that extremity of the glass tube which is the farthest from the wire, and touch the string of the kite with the knob of its wire, which, being insulated, acquires a small quantity of electricity from it; which is sufficient to ascertain its quality when the knob of the instrument is brought near an electrified electrometer.\n\n\"Sometimes, when I raise the kite in the night-time, out of the house, and where I have not the convenience of observing the quality of its electricity by the attraction and repulsion, or even by the appearance of the electric light, I make use of a coated phial, which I can charge at the string, and, when charged, put it into my pocket; wherein it will keep charged even for several hours. By making use of this instrument, I am obliged to keep the kite up no longer than is necessary, to charge the phial, in order to observe the quality of the electricity in the atmosphere; for after the kite has been drawn in and brought home, I can then examine the electricity of the inside of the phial, which is the same as that of the kite.\n\n\"When the electricity of the kite is very strong, I fix a chain, communicating with the ground, at about six inches distance from the string; which may carry off its electricity, in case that this should increase too much as to put the bystanders in danger.\n\n\"Besides the above-described apparatus, I have occasionally used some other instruments, which I have often varied, according as some particular experiments required; but, as they are of no great consequence, I shall omit to describe them. It is only necessary, to give an idea of the standard of my quadrant electrometer; which may, very probably, show the same intensity of electricity under a number of degrees different from the other instruments of the same kind. When the kite is flying, and the apparatus is disposed as in fig. 128, I bring, under the extremity E of the prime conductor, a little bran, held upon a tin plate, and observe, that when the index of the electrometer is at ten degrees, the prime conductor begins to attract the bran at the distance of about three-fifths of an inch; when the index is at twenty degrees, the prime conductor attracts the bran at the distance of about one inch and a quarter; when the index is at thirty degrees, the bran begins to be attracted at the distance of two inches and one-fifth. These distances vary, as the weather changes its degree of dryness; but in frosty weather I observe them constantly as above.\"\n\nMr Cavallo has given copious extracts from a journal which he kept of his experiments with the kite; great danger from these we shall give his account of one experiment, which is peculiarly interesting from the danger to which the experimenters appear to have been exposed.\n\n\"October the 18th. After having rained a great deal in the morning, and night before, the weather became a little clear in the afternoon, the clouds appearing separated, and pretty well defined. The wind was west, and rather strong, and the atmosphere in a temperate degree of heat. In these circumstances, at three P.M. I raised my electrical kite with three hundred...\"\nAfter that the end of the string had been inflated, and a leather-ball, covered with tin-foil, had been hung to it, I tried the power and quality of the electricity, which appeared to be positive, and pretty strong. In a short time a small cloud passing over, the electricity increased a little; but the cloud being gone, it decreased again to its former degree. The string of the kite was now fastened by the silk lace to a post in the yard of the house wherein I lived, which was situated near Illington, and I was repeatedly charging two coated phials, and giving shocks with them—while I was doing so, the electricity, which was still positive, began to decrease, and in two or three minutes time it became so weak, that it could be hardly perceived with a very sensible cork-ball electrometer. Observing at the same time that a large and black cloud was approaching the zenith (which, no doubt, caused the decrease of the electricity) indicating imminent rain, I introduced the end of the string through a window, in a first-floor room, wherein I fastened it by the silk lace to an old chair. The quadrant electrometer was set upon the same window, and was, by means of a wire, connected with the string of the kite. Being now three quarters of an hour after three o'clock, the electricity was absolutely unperceivable; however, in about three minutes time, it became again perceivable, but now upon trial was found to be negative; it is therefore plain, that its flopping was nothing more than a change from positive to negative, which was evidently occasioned by the approach of the cloud, part of which by this time had reached the zenith of the kite, and the rain also had begun to fall in large drops.—The cloud came farther on; the rain increased, and the electricity keeping pace with it, the electrometer soon arrived to $15^\\circ$. Seeing now, that the electricity was pretty strong, I began again to charge the two coated phials, and to give shocks with them; but the phials had not been charged above three or four times, before I perceived that the index of the electrometer was arrived at $35^\\circ$, and was keeping still increasing. The shocks now being very smart, I desisted from charging the phials any longer; and, considering the rapid advance of the electricity, thought to take off the inflation of the string, in case that if it should increase farther, it might be filently conducted to the earth, without causing any bad accident, by being accumulated in the inflated string. To effect this, as I had no proper apparatus near me, I thought to remove the silk lace, and fasten the string itself to the chair; accordingly I disengaged the wire that connected the electrometer with the string; laid hold of the string; untied it from the silk lace, and fastened it to the chair; but while I effected this, which took up less than half a minute of time, I received about a dozen, or fifteen, very strong shocks, which I felt all along my arms, in my breast, and legs; shaking me in such a manner, that I had hardly power enough to effect my purpose, and to warn the people in the room to keep their distance. As soon as I took my hands off the string, the electricity (in consequence of the chair being a bad conductor) began to snap between the string and the shutter of the window, which was the nearest body to it. The snappings, which were audible at a good distance out of the room, seemed first isochronous with the shocks which I had received, but in about a minute's time, oftener; so that the people of the house compared their sound to the rattling noise of a jack going when the fly is off. The cloud now was just over the kite; it was black, and well defined, of almost a circular form, its diameter appearing to be about $40^\\circ$; the rain was copious, but not remarkably heavy. As the cloud was going off, the electrical snapping began to weaken, and in a short time became inaudible. I went then near the string, and finding the electricity weak, but still negative, I inflated it again, thinking to keep the kite up some time longer; but observing that another larger and denser cloud was approaching apace towards the zenith, as I had then no proper apparatus at hand, to prevent every possible bad accident, I resolved to pull the kite in; accordingly a gentleman, who was by me, began pulling it in, while I was winding up the string. The cloud was now very nearly over the kite, and the gentleman, who was pulling in the string, told me, that he had received one or two slight shocks in his arms, and that if he were to feel one more, he would certainly let the string go; upon which I laid hold of the string, and pulled the kite in as fast as I could, without any farther observation; being then ten minutes after four o'clock.\n\n\"N.B. There was neither thunder nor lightning perceived that day, nor indeed for some days before or afterwards.\"\n\nFrom his experiments with the kite, Mr Cavallo deduces the following conclusions:\n\n1. The air appears to be electrified at all times; its electricity is constantly positive, and much stronger in frosty, than in warm weather; but it is by no means less in the night than in the daytime ($\\kappa$).\n\n2. The presence of the clouds generally lessens the electricity of the kite; sometimes it has no effect upon it; and it is very seldom that it increases it a little.\n\n3. When it rains, the electricity of the kite is generally negative, and very seldom positive.\n\n4. The aurora borealis seems not to affect the electricity of the kite.\n\n5. The electrical spark taken from the string of the kite, or from any inflated conductor connected with it, especially when it does not rain, is very seldom pungent. When the index of the electrometer is not higher than $20^\\circ$, the person that takes the spark will feel the effect of it in his legs; it appearing more like the discharge of an electric jar, than the spark taken from the prime conductor of an electrical machine.\n\n6. The\n\n---\n\n($\\kappa$) In all his experiments, it happened only once that the string of the kite gave no signs of electricity; it was one afternoon, when the weather was warm, and the wind so weak, that the kite was raised with difficulty, and could hardly be kept up for a few minutes; in the evening, however, the wind, which in the daytime had been north-west, shifted to the north-east, blowing a little stronger: he then raised the kite again, being half past ten o'clock, and obtained, usual, a pretty strong positive electricity.\n6. The electricity of the kite is in general stronger or weaker, according as the string is longer or shorter; but it does not keep any exact proportion to it: the electricity, for instance, brought down by a string of a hundred yards, may raise the index of the electrometer to 25°; when, with double that length of string, the index of the electrometer will not go higher than 25°.\n\n7. When the weather is damp, and the electricity is pretty strong, the index of the electrometer, after taking a spark from the string, or presenting the knob of a coated phial to it, rises surprisingly quick to its usual place; but in dry and warm weather, it rises exceedingly slow.\n\nMr Bennet observed with his electrometer, that in very clear weather, when no clouds were visible, on applying the instrument to the insulated string of kites without metal, their positive electricity caused the slips of gold-leaf to strike the sides of the glass; but when a kite was raised in cloudy weather, with a wire in the string, and when it gave sparks about a quarter of an inch long, the electricity was sensible by the electrometer, at the distance of about ten yards from the string; but when placed at the distance of five feet, the gold-leaf continued to strike the sides of the electrometer for more than an hour together, with a velocity increasing and decreasing with the density or distance of the unequal clouds that passed over.\n\nSometimes the electricity of an approaching cloud has been sensible without a kite, though in a very unfavourable situation for it, being in a town surrounded with hills, and where buildings encompassed the wall on which the electrometer was placed. A thunder cloud passing, caused the gold-leaf to strike the sides of the glass very quick at each flash of lightning.\n\nMr Bennet relates the following instance of the danger sometimes incurred in making experiments with the kite. Having on the 5th of July 1788, raised a kite with two hundred yards of string, when it had been flying for about an hour, a dark cloud appeared at a great distance, and changed the electricity from positive to negative. The electric power increased till the cloud became nearly vertical, when some large drops of rain fell; and Mr Bennet attempting to secure the string from wet, received such a strong shock in his arm, as deprived it for a few seconds of sensation. The explosion was heard at the distance of forty yards, like the loud crack of a whip.\n\nThe following curious phenomenon was observed by Mr Loammi Baldwin, while raising an electrical kite in July 1771, during the approach of a severe thunderstorm. He observed himself to be surrounded by a rare medium of fire, which, as the cloud rose nearer the zenith, and the kite rose higher, continued to extend itself with some gentle faint flashes. Mr Baldwin felt no other effect than a general weakness in his joints and limbs, and a kind of little feeling; all which, he observes, might possibly be the effect of surprise, though it was sufficient to discourage him from pursuing any farther attempt at that time. He therefore drew in his kite, and retired to a shop till the storm was over, and then went to his house, where he found his friends much more surprised than he had been himself; and who, after expressing their astonishment, informed him, that he appeared to them (during the time he was raising the kite, to be in the midst of a large bright flame of fire, attended with flasings; and, that they expected every moment to see him fall a sacrifice to the flame. The atmosphere was observed by some of his neighbours, who lived near the place where he stood.\n\nFig. 129 represents a very simple instrument, contrived by Mr Cavallo for making experiments on atmospheric electricity, and which, on several accounts, seems to be the most convenient for that purpose.\n\nAB is a common jointed fishing-rod, without the last or smallest joint. From the extremity of this rod proceeds a slender glass tube C, covered with sealing-wax, atmospheric and having a cork D, at its end, from which a pith-ball cal electrometer is suspended. HG is a piece of twine fastened to the other extremity of the rod, and supported at G by a small string FG. At the end I of the twine a pin is fastened, which, when pushed into the cork D, renders the electrometer E uninsulated.\n\nWhen he would observe the electricity of the atmosphere with this instrument, he thrust the pin I into the cork D, and holding the rod by its lower end A, projects it out from a window of the upper part of the house into the air, raising the end of the rod with the electrometer, so as to make an angle of about 50° or 60° with the horizon. In this situation he keeps the instrument for a few seconds, and then pulling the twine at H, disengages the pin from the cork D; which operation causes the string to drop in the dotted situation KL, and leaves the electrometer insulated and electrified, with an electricity contrary to that of the atmosphere.—This done, he draws the instrument into the room, and examines the quality of the electricity, without obstruction either from wind or darkness.\n\nWith this instrument he made observations on the electricity of the atmosphere, several times in a day for several months, and from them he deduces the following general observations, which seem to coincide with those made with the electrical kites.\n\n1. That there is in the atmosphere, at all times, a quantity of electricity; for, whenever he used the above-described instrument, it always acquired some electricity.\n\n2. That the electricity of the atmosphere, or fogs, is always of the same kind, namely positive; for the electrometer is always negative, except when it is evidently influenced by heavy clouds near the zenith.\n\n3. That in general, the strongest electricity is observable in thick fogs, and also in frosty weather; and the weakest, when it is cloudy, warm, and very near raining; but it does not seem to be less by night than in the daytime.\n\n4. That in a more elevated place, the electricity is stronger than in a lower one; for, having tried the atmospheric electrometer, both in the stone and iron gallery on the cupola of St Paul's cathedral, Mr Cavallo found that the balls diverged much more in the latter than in the former less elevated place; hence it appears, that, if this rule takes place at any distance from the earth, the electricity in the upper regions of the atmosphere must be exceedingly strong.\n\nMr Cavallo has also contrived an instrument, which he calls his electrometer for the rain; this is merely an insulator for insulated instrument to catch the rain, and, by means of a pith-ball electrometer, to show the degree and quality of its electricity.\n\nAt fig. 130, is represented an instrument of this kind, which Mr Cavallo frequently used, and after several\nseveral observations, found to answer very well. ABCI is a strong glass tube about two feet and a half long, having a tin funnel, DE, cemented to its extremity, which funnel defends part of the tube from the rain. The outside surface of the tube from A to B is covered with sealing-wax; so also is the part of it which is covered by the funnel. FD is a piece of cane, round which several braids wires are twisted in different directions, so as to catch the rain easily, and at the same time to make no resistance to the wind. This piece of cane is fixed into the tube, and a slender wire proceeding from it goes through the bore of the tube, and communicates with the strong wire AG, which is thrust into a piece of cork fastened to the end A of the tube. The end G of the wire AG is formed into a ring, from which is suspended a more or less sensible pith-ball electrometer, as occasion requires.\n\nThis instrument is fastened to the side of the window-frame, where it is supported by strong brass hooks at CB, which part of the tube is covered with a silk lace, in order to adapt it better to the hooks. The part FC is out of the window, with the end F a little elevated above the horizon. The remaining part of the instrument comes through a hole in one of the lights of the sash, within the room, and no more of it touches the side of the window than the part CB.\n\nWhen it rains, especially in passing showers, this instrument, standing in the situation above described, is frequently electrified; and, by the diverging of the electrometer, the quantity and quality of the electricity of the rain may be observed, without any danger of a mistake. With this instrument, he observed, that the rain is generally, though not always electrified negatively, and sometimes to strongly, that he has been able to charge a small coated phial at the wire AG.\n\nThis instrument should be fixed in such a manner, that it may be easily taken off from the window, and replaced again, as occasion requires; for it will be necessary to clean it very often, particularly when a shower of rain is approaching.\n\nMr Cavallo has also shewn how the electricity of the atmosphere may be observed by means of his multiplier, described in No. 255.\n\nIn order to examine the electricity of the atmosphere, he at first used to fix a long pointed wire into the socket of the plate A, and then exposed it to the open air. But he has lately used a much better method of accomplishing that object. He exposes, out of the window, an inflated stick of about five feet in length, and covered with tin-foil; and while he holds this apparatus by the extremity of its inflating handle, he touches with the other hand, for about two or three seconds, the lower part of the stick. By this means, the stick being free from points, acquires an electricity contrary to that of the surrounding air. Mr Cavallo then brings it within the room, and communicates that electricity to the plate A of the multiplier, &c. But the electricity so acquired by the inflated stick, is generally sufficient to affect an electrometer without the use of the multiplier. To examine the electricity of the rain, snow, hail, &c., the same apparatus must be exposed out of a window, but the stick must not be touched, for in this case, it acquires the same sort of electricity as that of the rain, snow, &c., and not the contrary sort, as when exposed to the air.\n\nMr Read, in his \"Summary View of the Spontaneous Electricity of the Earth and Atmosphere,\" observes, that the electricity of the atmosphere, in moderate weather, was always found to be positive; in storms and disturbed states of the air frequently negative; and suddenly and repeatedly changing from the one state to the other. Warm small rain, was found to be very slightly electric; large drops, strongly; hail showers, the most intensely of all. In an easterly wind of long continuance, the electricity was so faint, as to require the nicest of all known tests for discovering its existence. The vapour of water, as soon as it had attained the height of five or six inches of inflation in the air, was found to be permanently and positively electrified; and the surface from which it evaporated, negatively. According to Mr Read, vapour has a greater capacity for electricity, or absorbs and requires more of fluid, than water in its denser state; and, therefore, rarefaction must diminish, and condensation increase, the sensible electric charge of the vapour. Hence, in serene weather, the atmosphere is subject to a regular flux and reflux, or increase and diminution of electricity twice in every twenty-four hours, depending on the action of the sun, and the consequent evaporation and state of the vapours. This diligent observer further remarks, that a limited portion of the earth's surface is often sensibly electrified; over it, there is always a proportionate state of the contrary electricity in the atmosphere; and when an electrified cloud is carried forward by wind, an equal and opposite electric charge keeps pace with it on the earth, till the two charges, becoming more augmented or approaching nearer to one another, or meeting with some conducting eminence, rush together, and produce an explosion.\n\nWe shall conclude our account of experiments on atmospheric electricity, with those made by M. Sauflaire in his excursions among the Alps. The instrument employed by M. Sauflaire is a modification of Cavallo's atmospheric electrometer, and shall be described under the article Electrometer.\n\nThe following are M. Sauflaire's observations on the electricity of the atmosphere.\n\nAerial electricity varies according to the situation; it is generally stronger in elevated and inflated situations; not to be observed under trees, in streets, in houses, or electricity, any inclosed places; though it is sometimes to be found pretty strong on quays and bridges. It is also not so much the absolute height of the places, as their situation: thus a projecting angle of a high hill will often exhibit a stronger electricity than the plain at the top of the hill, as there are fewer points in the former to deprive the air of its electricity.\n\nThe intensity of the atmospheric electricity is varied by a great many circumstances, some of which may be accounted for, others cannot. When the weather is serene, it is impossible to assign any rule for their variation, as no regular correspondence can then be perceived with the different hours of the day, nor with the various modifications of the air. The reason is evident; when contrary and variable winds reign at different heights, when clouds are rolling over clouds, these winds and clouds, which we cannot perceive by any exterior sign, influence however the strata of air in which we make our experiments, produce these changes of which we only see the result, without being\ning able to assign either the cause, or its relation. Thus, in stormy weather, we see the electricity strong, then null, and in a moment after arise to its former force; one instant positive, the next negative; without being able to assign any reason for these changes. M. Sauflure says, that he has seen these changes succeed with such rapidity, that he had not time to note them down.\n\nWhen rain falls without a storm, these changes are not so sudden; they are however very irregular, particularly with respect to the intensity of force; the quality thereof is more constant. Rain, or snow, almost uniformly gives positive electricity.\n\nIn cloudy weather, without rain or storms, the electricity follows generally the same laws as in serene weather.\n\nStrong winds generally diminish its intensity; they mix together the different strata of the atmosphere, and make them pass successively towards the ground, and thus distribute the electricity uniformly between the earth and the air; M. Sauflure has observed a strong electricity with a strong north wind (la bise).\n\nThe state of the air, in which the electricity is strongest, is foggy weather: this is always accompanied with electricity, except when the fog is going to resolve into rain.\n\nThe most interesting observations, and those which throw the greatest light upon the various modifications of electricity in our atmosphere, are those that are made in serene weather. In winter, (during which most of M. Sauflure's observations were made) and in serene weather, the electricity was generally weakest in an evening, when the dew had fallen, until the moment of the sun's rising; its intensity afterwards augmented by degrees, sometimes sooner, and sometimes later; but generally before noon, it attained a certain maximum, from whence it again declined, till the fall of the dew, when it would be sometimes stronger than it had been during the whole day; after which, it would again gradually diminish during the whole night; but is never quite destroyed, if the weather is perfectly serene.\n\nAtmospherical electricity seems, therefore, like the Periodical sea, to be subject to a flux and reflux, which causes it to flux and reflux twice in 24 hours. The moments of its greatest force are some hours after the rising and setting of the sun; those when it is weakest, precede the city of the rising and setting thereof. This will be further explained in the following pages.\n\nM. Sauflure has given an instance of this periodic flux in electricity, on the 22nd of February, 1785, (one of the coldest days ever remembered at Geneva); the hygrometer and thermometer were suspended in the open air, on a terrace exposed to the south-west; the electrometer, from its situation, indicated an electricity equal to what it would have shown if it had been placed on an open plain. The height of the barometer is reduced to what it would have been if the mercury had been constantly at the temperature of 19 degrees of Reaumur's thermometer. The place of observation was elevated 60 feet above the level of the lake. The observations of the day preceding and following this great cold, are inserted in the following table; because it is pleasing to have the observations which precede and follow anyingular phenomena. There was a weak south-west wind during the whole three days; and it is rather remarkable, that most of the great colds, which have been observed at Geneva, were preceded by, or at least accompanied with, a little south-west breeze.\n\n### TABLE\n\n| Barometer, feet in height | Thermometer | Hygrom. | Electrom. |\n|---------------------------|-------------|---------|-----------|\n| h. m.                     |             |         |           |\n| Feb. 21st                 |             |         |           |\n| 9 15 M                    | 26 6 7      | 8 3     | 89 3      | 2 0 Pale sun, cloudy. |\n| 11 10 M                   | 26 6 5      | 4 3     | 83 0      | 1 6 Bright sun. |\n| 2 10 E                    | 26 6 1      | 0 2     | 69 6      | 1 1 The same. |\n| 5 E                       | 26 6 1      | 2 3     | 77 2      | 1 1 Setting sun. |\n| 6 E                       | 26 6 0      | 5 2     | 85        | 1 0 Cloudy in the S.W. |\n| 7 E                       | 26 6 2      | 6 8     | 89        | 1 8 Perfectly clear. |\n| 8 E                       | 26 6 3      | 10 0    | 95        | 2 0 Idem. |\n| 9 E                       | 26 6 3      | 10 6    | 97 5      | 1 8 Idem. |\n| 10 E                      | 26 6 1      | 9 9     | 95        | 1 2 Little cloud at horizon S. |\n| 11 E                      | 26 6 0      | 12 3    | 99 1      | 1 5 Idem more to S.W. |\n| 12 E                      | 26 5 15     | 12 5    | H r frost | 1 2 Idem. |\n| 22d, 1 M                  | 26 6 0      | 14 3    | Idem      | 0 9 Idem. |\n| 2 M                       | 26 6 8      | 14 5    | Id.       | 1 2 Clouds increase and approach. |\n| 6 15 M                    | 26 5 7      | 15 0    | Id.       | 0 8 Clear. |\n| 7 30 M                    | 26 5 4      | 14 7    | Id.       | 1 2 Light fog. |\n| 8 10 M                    | 26 5 2      | 14 2    | Id.       | 1 1 Idem. |\n| 9 10 M                    | 26 4 15     | 10 7    | Id.       | 1 6 Idem. |\n| 10 10 M                   | 26 4 13     | 8 2     | Id.       | 2 2 Thicker fog. |\n| 11 10 M                   | 26 4 3      | 4 8     | Id.       | 1 8 Idem. |\n| 1 10 E                    | 26 4 0      | 4 9     | Id.       | 1 7 Idem. |\n| 2 20 E                    | 26 3 14     | 6 6     | 82        | 1 4 Weak fog, pale sun. |\n### Table\n\n| h. m. | Barometer, feet in height | Thermometer | Hygrom. | Electrom. |\n|-------|--------------------------|-------------|---------|-----------|\n| Feb. 22d, 3 30 | E 26 3 13 | — 0 9 | 81 9 | 1 1 | Cloudy pale sun. |\n| 5 | E 26 3 13 | — 4 3 | 89 | 1 2 | Less cloudy. |\n| 6 | E 26 3 14 | — 4 4 | 91 2 | 2 2 | More fo. |\n| 7 | E 26 3 14 | — 6 1 | 94 | 1 7 | Idem. |\n| 8 | E 26 3 13 | — 5 9 | Id. | 3 7 | Cloudy foggy in S.

In general, in summer, if the ground has been dry for some days, and the air is dry also, the electricity generally increases, from the rising of the sun till three or four in the afternoon, when it is strongest: it then diminishes till the dew begins to fall, which again reanimates it; though after this it declines, and is almost extinguished during the night.\n\nBut the serene days that succeed rainy weather in summer, generally exhibit the same diurnal periods or states of electricity, as are to be observed in winter.\n\nThe air is invariably positive in serene weather, both in winter and summer, day and night, in the sun or in the dew. It would seem, therefore, that the electricity of the air is essentially positive, and that whenever it appears to be negative, in certain rains or in storms, it probably arises from some clouds, which have been exposed to the influence of the electric fluid contained in the upper part of the atmosphere, or to more elevated clouds, that have discharged a part of their fluid upon the earth, or upon other clouds.\n\nIn order to find out the cause of these phenomena, Mr. Saussure instituted a set of experiments on evaporation, avoiding the use of Volta's condenser.\n\nTo produce a strong evaporation, he threw a mass of red hot iron into a small quantity of water, which was contained in a coffee-pot, with a large mouth, and suspended by silk strings; by this he obtained a strong positive electricity, though, according to M. Volta's system, it ought to have been negative. The experiment was repeated several times, varying some of the circumstances, but the result was always the same.\n\nAs it was not easy to think so able a philosopher as M. Volta was deceived, it was necessary to try the experiment in a manner more analogous to that of M. Volta. A small chafing-dish was therefore inflated by silk cords, and the coffee-pot, with a small quantity of water, placed on it; one electrometer was connected with the coffee-pot, and another with the chafing-dish; the fire was raised by a pair of bellows: when the water had boiled strongly for a few minutes, both electrometers exhibited signs of electricity, which, on examination, was found to be negative; proving the truth of M. Volta's experiment. The evaporation produced by the effervescence of iron in the sulphuric acid, and by that of chalk in the same acid, gave also negative electricity.\n\nIt was now necessary to inquire, why the vapour, excited by the heated iron, produced positive electricity; while that from boiling water, in any other way, produced a negative electricity.\n\nM. Saussure suspected, that the intensity of heat to which the water is exposed, by the contact of a body in a state of incandescence, was the cause of the electricity produced by its evaporation; and that a combination was then formed, by which a new quantity of the electric fluid was produced. This conjecture may at first sight seem improbable; but the quantity of electricity produced by this experiment will amply show that it is true; and this quantity is more surprising, because, if it is true, according to the system of M. Volta, that the vapours absorb, while they are forming, a quantity of the electric fluid, there must, therefore, be enough developed in this experiment, for the formation of the great quantity of vapours produced by the heated iron, and afterwards a sufficient quantity to electrify strongly the apparatus, and all these vapours.\nThis experiment shows clearly the cause of that prodigious quantity of electricity, which is unfolded in the eruption of volcanoes; as it is probable, that the water in these, from many circumstances, acquires a much greater degree of heat than is given to it in our experiments.\n\nTo verify this conjecture, that it was in some measure the combustion of the water, or the iron, that produced the positive electricity, it was proper to try whether, by a regular moderation of the heat of the iron, positive electricity would always be obtained. This was essayed in the following manner: A large iron crucible, five inches high, four in diameter, and six lines thick, was heated red hot; then insulated; after which, small quantities of water were thrown into it, each projection of the water cooling more and more the crucible; thus defending by degrees till there was only sufficient heat to boil the water; carefully observing, and then destroying the electricity produced at each projection. The electricity was always positive or null; at the first projections it was very strong; it gradually diminished to the twelfth, when it was scarce sensible, though always with a tendency to be positive.\n\nOn repeating this experiment, and varying it in different ways, a remarkable circumstance was observed: When a small quantity of water was thrown into the crucible, the moment it was taken from the fire, while it was of a pale red, approaching what is called the white heat, no electricity was obtained.\n\nThis fact seemed to have some connection with another mentioned by Mufchenbroek, that water evaporates more slowly on a metal, or any other incandescent body, than on the same body, heated only a small degree above boiling water. To examine this relation, and to find whether there was any between the periods of evaporation, and the production of electricity, M. Sauffire made a great number of experiments, which are most accurately described in his excellent work; but as the detail would be much too long to be introduced in this article, we must content ourselves with presenting the reader with the heads thereof, and a description of the apparatus.\n\nThe apparatus consisted of a pot of clay, well baked or annealed, fifteen lines thick, and four inches in diameter; this was insulated by a dry glass goblet; upon this pot was placed the crucible, or any other heated substance, on which the water was to be thrown, in order to be reduced into vapours; the crucible was contiguous to a wire connected with an electrometer; a measure containing 54 grains weight of distilled water, was thrown upon the heated crucible; the time employed in the evaporation thereof was observed by a second watch; the electricity produced by this evaporation was noted. When this measure of water was reduced into vapour, the electricity of the apparatus was destroyed, and a fresh measure of water was thrown into the crucible; proceeding in the same manner till the crucible was almost cold.\n\nThe first experiment was with an iron crucible, from which it was found, that Mufchenbroek was not right, in saying that the evaporation was slower when the iron was hottest; for at the instant it was taken from the fire it required 19 seconds to evaporate the water, and took more time till the third projection, when it took 35 seconds, though from that period it employed less time, or in other words, the evaporation accelerated in proportion as the iron cooled.\n\nWith respect to the electricity, it was at first 0, then positive, afterwards negative, then 0, and afterwards positive to the end of the experiment. The vapour was not visible till the 7th projection.\n\nIn the second experiment with the same crucible, though every endeavour was made use of to render them as similar as possible, the electricity was constantly positive.\n\nThe third experiment was with a copper crucible; here also the electricity was positive, and the longest time employed in evaporation was not the instant of the greatest heat. It was very curious to see the water endeavouring to gather itself into a globule, like mercury on glass; to be sometimes immovable, and then to turn on itself horizontally, with great rapidity; sometimes throwing from some of its points a little jet, accompanied with a hissing noise.\n\nThe fourth experiment was with the same crucible; the electricity was at first negative, then constantly positive.\n\nThe fifth was with a crucible of pure silver; a considerable time was employed here in evaporating the same quantity of water; even in the instant of the greatest heat it took five minutes, five seconds; the electricity was weak, three times no electricity was perceived, five times negative electricity was discovered.\n\nIn a sixth experiment with the same crucible, a positive electricity was obtained, at the second projection; after which none of any kind was perceived.\n\nThe seventh with the same, gave at first strong negative electricity, the second and third projection gave a weak positive electricity.\n\nThe eighth was made with a porcelain cup; here the evaporation was slower at the second, than the first projection; but from this it took longer time till it was cold, contrary to what happened with the metals; the electricity was always negative.\n\nThe ninth and tenth experiments, with the same cup, produced similar effects.\n\nThe eleventh experiment was with spirits of wine in a silver crucible; here there was no electricity produced at the two first projections, and what was afterwards obtained was negative.\n\nTwelfth experiment with ether; here the electricity was also negative. These two inflammable fluids, in evaporating, followed the same laws as water, being diffused at first most rapidly in the greatest heat, afterwards taking a longer and longer time before they were evaporated, to a certain period, then employing less time, or evaporating quicker, till the crucible was nearly cold.\n\nNow as china and silver always produced negative electricity, while iron and copper have generally given positive electricity, we may conclude, that electricity is positive with those bodies that are capable of decomposing water, or of being decomposed themselves by their contact with the water; and negative with those which are not at all decomposed or altered.\n\nIf in the foregoing experiment, those substances which were susceptible of oxidation had constantly given a positive electricity, and those which do not oxidise had always given the negative; everything would have been explained by these principles, and they would thence have acquired a greater degree of probability. But the phenomena have not always followed this law.\nWe have seen iron and copper sometimes give a negative electricity, and silver the positive. The first case is not difficult to account for; it is well known with what facility iron and copper are oxidized in a brick fire; they become covered with a scaly crust, which is not susceptible of any further alteration with the same heat. If the bottom of the crucible acquires this crusty coating, the drop of water placed thereon will be no longer in contact with an oxidizable substance; there will be no further decomposition, no generation of the electric fluid: the vapors, however, which are still formed, will absorb a part of the fluid naturally contained in the apparatus, and this will therefore be electrified negatively. If some of the scales should be so far detached, that the water may gain some points of contact, the quantity thus generated may compensate for what is absorbed by the vapors, and thus the electricity will be null. If more are detached, it will super-abound and be positive. From the same reasons, a large mass of water, by attacking the iron in a greater number of points, always gives positive electricity; and hence, also, a strong positive electricity is obtained, by throwing a piece of red-hot iron into a mass of water.\n\nIt is not easy to explain why silver gives sometimes a positive electricity, but by supposing it to have been mixed with some substances capable of oxidation; and this the more, as the white porcelain always gave negative electricity. This supposition was verified by some subsequent experiments, in which the same silver, when purified, always gave a negative electricity.\n\nM. Sauflure owns himself incapable of explaining why heated charcoal always gives negative electricity; unless it can be attributed to the promptitude with which it rare a substance loses its heat, by the contact of water.\n\nOne fact astonished him, namely, that by combustion properly so called, although it is an evaporation, nay, the highest degree of evaporation, he never obtained any signs of electricity; though he tried to obtain it in a variety of ways. Probably, the current produced by the flame, disperses and dissipates the electricity as soon as it is formed. The case, however, must not be looked upon as general, because M. Volta obtained signs of electricity from bodies in combustion, by means of his condenser.\n\nAnother singular fact was, his not being able to obtain electricity without ebullition, though he endeavored to compensate by the quantity of surface for the quantity of vapors that were elevated by boiling water; and indeed, the same quantity of water, if extended over too large a surface, will not give any electricity.\n\nWe shall resume this subject immediately, but must first conclude our observations on the phenomena of atmospheric electricity.\n\nThe following axioms with respect to atmospheric electricity, deduced by M. Cotte after a long course of observations, merit attention.\n\n1. Electricity manifests itself oftener without storms than with them.\n2. It is produced more frequently by dry than by rainy clouds.\n3. It is more frequently positive than negative, especially when occasioned by stationary clouds.\n4. The atmosphere exhibits signs of electricity at all times by night or day.\n\nIn our endeavors to explain the production of natural electricity, we have nothing more to do, than to discover the various circumstances of the atmosphere, in which moisture is absorbed or precipitated.\n\nIt is necessary to recollect the proof furnished by numerous experiments, that when any portion of the atmosphere is in a state to take up an additional quantity of moisture, it is in a state at the same time to take up more electric fluid; and vice versa, when it is parting its portion with its water, it is at the same time parting with its electric fluid. But in these cases, neither the superabundance nor the deficiency can produce a charge, unless there be some other part of the air contemporaneously in an opposite state, or in a disposition either to receive or give. It is, however, scarcely possible that this should not always happen; for our atmosphere is, throughout its vast dimensions, each moment agitated by millions of co-instantaneous changes, and for our purpose, it is of no consequence where the required change takes place. Were it New Holland, or at the Antipodes, a connection would be instantly formed between the remote but opposite situations, by the conducting power of the earth.\n\nIt is a necessary conclusion from what we have just said, that if the absorption of moisture by air, or the storms copious evaporation of it from the earth, be attended with a new accumulation of the fluid; then where this cause operates most powerfully, there its correspondent effect will be most sensible. We consequently find, that the most tremendous electrical phenomena belong to the countries within the tropics, or to that portion of our atmosphere which is loaded with moisture by the most powerful influence of the sun's rays. In like manner, within the limits of our own and other similar climates, electrical phenomena are greatest, both in force and frequency, during the hottest months of the year, or during the season in which our atmosphere is most copiously and rapidly charged, by absorbing the humidity of the ground.\n\nIn the neighborhood of Etna and Vesuvius, during the period of their volcanic fury, surfaces, covering the dimensions of several square leagues, are sometimes volca- noes, scorched with red-hot lava, and every atom of their moisture is rapidly dissipated. At the same time the surrounding air is heated to a vast extent, and in this state swallows up an immense quantity of aqueous vapor; but contemporaneously with the operation of these powers, according to the reports of all natural historians, an immense quantity of the electric fluid is accumulated and discharged.\n\nAgain, a dry wind passing over a moist soil is another modification of the cause we are applying; it produces a copious and rapid solution of the aqueous particles, and its consequent alteration of attractive force. Let us for instance, suppose a wind, which had passed over the deserts of Arabia, or that had been torrefied in its passage over a large extent of burning sands, to come in contact with a similar extent of marshy soil, or of any surface well drenched with water, a most abundant evaporation would necessarily take place, and with it an immense accumulation of the electric fluid. But subsequently, in case any power operated, which would take away the aqueous particles thus dissolved, and of course alter the degree of attractive force by which the collected electric fluid is fufilled, we should find\nthat the most dreadful thunder-storms would take place. This is really the case; for there is scarcely a region in the vast circle surrounding the immeasurable lands of Africa, which is not remarkable for storms and tempests.\n\nOn the side of Abyssinia, when the warm winds that have passed over the neighbouring deserts are condensed on its mountains, those deluges are collected, which form the inundations of the Nile.\n\nOn the coast of Guinea, the harmattan, which is a current of air so dry, as to wither and pulverize, by a complete absorption of all its juices, every substance that occurs in its passage, is no sooner mixed with that body of air which is cooled by the ocean, than it forms most terrific hurricanes of wind and lightning that are described by navigators. Along the Syrian regions, we learn from sacred authority, that the storms gather with such rapidity, that a cloud, which this instant might be covered with the hand, is within the interval of a few minutes, charged with water adequate to the inundation of a whole country.\n\nThe thunder that attended these impetuous storms, provoked the sublimest expressions of their poets. Indeed, whenever their minds attempt the description of celestial greatness, or the sudden and overwhelming approach of divine power in its triumph, or in its fury, they have recourse for imagery to those thunder-clouds, which they justly represented as extinguishing the light of the sun, and as involving the world in a few instants in the darkness of midnight.\n\nHaving specified the two most general causes of evaporation on the surface of this earth, let us now attend to the possible changes of the atmosphere, when by the operation of either, or both, it is charged with the electric fluid. All these changes are but different degrees of the same effect, viz. the condensation of moisture, and this condensation is in every case produced by an alteration of temperature, which may proceed,\n\n1. From a mixture, or even the contact, of a colder with a warmer air. When the smallest clouds are formed by such a mixture, an electrical charge takes place, so that one part of the cloud has more, and the other less, than its natural share. Fogs, dews, and the slightest change of clear for hazy weather, commonly arise from a warmer atmosphere coming in contact with one of a lower temperature; but even these trifling degrees of condensation are always followed by signs of electricity.\n\nIn this country, from its insular situation, which exposes it to the perpetual influence of varying winds, the air changes its appearances often many times in one day. But there is no degree of thick cloudiness or perfect clearness, of scattered clouds succeeding embodied masses of clouds, of small rain increasing to heavy, or vice versa, that is not attended with changes in the expressions of the elevated conductor, which never fails to vary with all the atmospheric condensations and rarefactions that take place.\n\nIt is, however, obvious that the effect must be in proportion to the quantity and rapidity of the condensation. When, therefore, any body of air has been for a long time suspended over a surface of ground previously drenched with showers, and at the same time exposed to the violence of the sun's rays, a change in the direction of the wind, or such a change in the weight of the air as mixes the upper with the lower regions of the air, is almost always attended with a thunder-storm.\n\nIn tropical climates, for months together, scarcely a day passes, in which the calm atmosphere is not loaded by successive additions of moisture, till at last, it becomes the reservoir of vast rivers and lakes, and of all the moisture that is spread over whole continents. But when this drought has reached its crisis, the sun crosses the line, the wind takes a new direction, a colder air mixes with that which is thus charged with vapours, and the condensation becomes so copious, as to inundate all the subjacent country; but the deluge is not more destructive than its attendant storm; for, according to the reports of spectators, our imaginations, confined to the proceedings of nature in this frozen region, have no images from which any such comparison can be made, as will communicate the least idea of the thunder attending a tropical hurricane.\n\nThe cause which we are now applying to the explanation of these natural appearances, will furnish us with an easy solution of a difficulty which has oppressed several theories of electricity, namely, that rapid generation and increase of the electric fluid which takes place in some thunder-storms. Even in this country, the succession of flashes is sometimes so quick, that one hundred and twenty have been known to follow each other in a minute. In Asia, this celerity of accumulation and discharge was so great, that Homer uses it as part of a simile, by which he paints the quick repetition of Agamemnon's sighs and pantings in an hour of distress.\n\nIt may be asked, if each distinct cloud is loaded with a distinct charge, and if each flash is a separate discharge of such a cloud, what is there, in our knowledge of natural powers, that will account for an innumerable repetition of these accumulations and discharges within a very short space of time, more especially when each of them is connected in our minds with the necessity of a distinct part of that time for its process? In other words, do we know of any cause that is adequate to the filling and emptying of the same portion of air every instant, for hours together?\n\nOn a hot summer's day it not unfrequently happens, that a fine blue sky will, within five seconds, be changed into one mass of clouds. If the cause which produces so great an effect, were supposed to be doubled in its power of condensation, the degree of electricity shown by the elevated conductor would be rather more than doubled, and its signs would be much stronger than in a common storm; we may hence conclude, that the whole mass which might be thus formed in five seconds, would be loaded so as to have every part of it at the discharging height; but the mass might consist of hundreds of distinct clouds all in the same state, and consequently adequate to the production of several hundred flashes within a minute.\n\nThe collapse of aqueous particles, which would necessarily follow such a rapid succession of discharges as have been now proved to be possible, would produce a partial vacuum of great extent, and on all sides the heavier air would rush into it, and the upper and colder regions would press downwards, and by their condensing temperatures, would renovate all the accumulations and discharges which have been already described; a second collapse would follow a second series of thunder-strokes,\nthunder-strokes, and a partial vacuum, additional to the former; a fresh portion of warm air would again rush in from all quarters, and a fresh mixture of cold air from the upper regions. It is scarcely necessary to show that this repetition of condensations may continue for hours, or till the air, which rushes in laterally, becomes of such a temperature, that its mixture with the colder air will not produce the condensations adequate to the collection of that quantity of electric fluid which is necessary for a discharge.\n\nFrom this explanation, it is obvious that a central point must exist, at which the violence of every storm begins, and from which it is spread in all directions. A hurricane in the West Indies, though ruinous to many, is generally the distinguishing calamity of one island, at which alone the wind is described as blowing from every point of the compass; while in every other island, it is represented as bearing down decisively from one quarter.\n\n2. The precipitation of aqueous particles when suspended by heat in air, is frequently the consequence of the loaded atmosphere's coming in contact with portions of the earth that are colder than itself. Such, particularly, are the summits of mountains, whose effect is great in proportion to the degree of their cold and the extent of their surface. It is, however, certain that condensations, when thus produced, are invariably attended by thunder-storms.\n\nThe uproar, and the splendour of the innumerable lightnings, which dart through all the entangled circuits of an abyss of thunder-clouds, are the immutable attributes of grandeur which belong to the Cordilleras; for they dam up, as it were, an immense flow of air, which is almost saturated with moisture by passing over several thousand leagues of land, exposed to the fury of a tropical sun.\n\nIn summer, the north-westerly winds that pass over France, are always condensed by the Alps; and in the night, during such a state of the atmosphere, to all those who live along the Saone and the upper part of the Rhone, these mountains are always brightened by electrical flashes and coruscations.\n\nAll ridges or chains of very high grounds, especially those which terminate extensive plains lying in the direction of their most common winds, are perpetually beclouded; and with a good conductor, fixed on their summit, we should find that the signs of electricity were as constant as the condensations by which they are enveloped. But in proportion to the coldness, so is the subsequent change of temperature on the eminences diminished, and the electrical effect dependant on that change. It hence happens, that there are countries in the northern parts of Europe, the gloom of whose mists is never dispelled by a thunder-storm, excepting in the hottest season of summer.\n\n3. When the sun, by directing its rays with force and abundance upon the earth for any length of time, has produced a considerable evaporation, the mere interruption of its influence will be attended with a discharge of the electric fluid; for the great source of change in our atmosphere is the ready influence of its upper regions, which are cold, on its lower regions when warmed; and any cause which mixes these together, must bring on a condensation of aqueous vapour. This mixture, however, takes place on the mere approach of night, as is evident from the change of temperature expressed by the thermometer, and the usual fall of the dew; we consequently find, that as night comes on, the signs of electricity always increase. When the weather is tolerably settled, or such that no other cause is active than that proceeding from the change of day for night, or night for day; then the signs of electricity gradually decrease from twelve o'clock at night till six in the morning; from this hour till nine, they gradually increase, when they become exceedingly weak, and continue so till four in the afternoon; the increase at this time recommences, and is very decisive in its appearance till about two hours after sunset, when it becomes stationary, and remains in this state, or decreasing, so farcely to be sensible, till the morning.*\n\nThe cause, whose operation we have now investigated in the production of its most feeble effects, may be easily applied to many other causes, in which similar, but greater powers are displayed by nature. Let us suppose, that on a wide surface of ground, previously warmed by the sun, copious showers of rain had fallen, followed by a return of the sun's influence; in this case, the evaporation is necessarily very rapid, and the signs of electricity expressed by an elevated conductor are very strong.\n\nWhen a copious production of electric fluid has attended a copious evaporation continued for several successive hours, a thunder-storm, or some striking electrical appearance will come on with the approach of night; for unless the barometer should suddenly rise, the condensation attending the evening's cold must be very considerable, and its usual consequences proportionally great. Such a day as we have just described, is usually followed by a violent thunder-storm. Indeed, there is scarcely an instance in which a moist ground, operated on for some hours by a clear sun, provided the wind continues to blow from the south-west or west, is not attended the following night by the appearance of falling stars, flashes of lightning, or the Aurora Borealis.\n\nWe have alluded to the connection of winds with the phenomena of atmospheric electricity. The influence of winds must depend on various circumstances; in some cases, they will tend to diminish electrical appearances, and in others, they may altogether destroy them. The current of air which proceeds from a mixture of two winds of different temperatures, is the effect of a condensation of vapour, that may be succeeded by the most violent storms. But if there should be two neighbouring regions, in one of which, the rays of the sun should co-operate with the moisture of the ground, in producing electricity, while in the other there should prevail a condensation favourable to the discharge of the electric fluid; a current of air would be produced that would act like a communicating rod between two opposite electrified surfaces, would exchange the situations of the charged bodies, and would consequently cause the new situation to counteract the effects produced in the last. This effect would be more sensible in proportion as the exchange has been more rapid, and accordingly we find, that during high winds, the electricity of the atmosphere is very small.*\n\n* Vide Read on Spontaneous Electricity.\n\nMorgan's Lectures, vol. ii.\nMost of the luminous appearances in the atmosphere have of late been attributed to electricity. Of these we shall at present only consider the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, referring the account of other meteors for the article Meteorology.\n\nThe aurora borealis is usually of a reddish colour, inclining to yellow, sending out frequent coruscations of pale light, which seem to rise from the horizon in a pyramidal undulating form, shooting with great velocity towards the zenith. This light sometimes appears remarkably red, as it happened December 5, 1737.\n\nThe aurora borealis appears frequently in the form of an arch; chiefly in spring and autumn, after a dry year. This arch is partly bright, partly dark, but generally transparent; and no change is found to be produced by it on the rays of light which pass through it. It sometimes produces a rainbow.\n\nThis kind of meteor, which becomes more uncommon as we approach towards the equator, is almost constant during the long winter of the polar regions, and appears there with the greatest lustre.\n\nIn the Shetland isles, the merry dancers, as the northern lights are there called, are the constant attendants of clear evenings, and afford great relief amid the gloom of the long winter nights. They commonly appear at twilight, near the horizon, of a dim colour, approaching to yellow; sometimes continuing in that state for several hours, without any perceptible motion; and afterwards breaking out into streams of stronger light, spreading into columns, and changing slowly into numberless different shapes, and varying in colour from all the tints of yellow, to the most obscure russet brown. They often cover the whole hemisphere, then exhibiting the most brilliant appearance. Their motions at this time are exceedingly quick, and they astonish the spectator with the rapid change of their form. They break out in places where none were seen before, skim briskly along the heavens, are suddenly extinguished, and are succeeded by a uniform dusky tract. This again is brilliantly illuminated in the same manner, and as suddenly becomes a dark space. In some nights, they assume the appearance of large columns, on one side of the deepest yellow, and on the other gradually changing, till it becomes indistinguishable from the sky. They have generally a strong tremulous motion from one end to the other, continuing till the whole vanishes. As for us, who see only the extremities of these phenomena, we can have but a faint idea of their splendour and motions. They differ in colour according to the state of the atmosphere, and sometimes assuming the colour of blood, they make a dreadful appearance. The rustic sages who observe them become prophetic, and terrify the spectators with alarm of war, pestilence, and famine; nor indeed were these superstitious preludes peculiar to the northern islands: appearances of a similar nature are of an ancient date; and they were distinguished by the appellations of phaenata, trabea, and bolides, according to their forms and colours. In old times they were either more rare or less frequently noticed; but when they occurred, they were supposed to portend great events, and the timid imagination formed of them aerial conflicts.\n\nIn the northern latitudes of Sweden and Lapland, the aurora borealis is not only an object of pleasing curiosity from the singular beauty of its appearance, but is extremely useful in affording to travellers, by its almost constant effulgence, a very brilliant light. In Hudson's bay, it is said to possess a variegated splendour, equalling that of the full moon. \"In the north-eastern parts of Siberia,\" says Gmelin, \"these northern lights are observed to begin with single bright pillars rising in the north, and almost at the same time in the north-east, which gradually increasing, comprehend a large space of the heavens, rush about from place to place with incredible velocity, and finally almost cover the whole sky up to the zenith, and produce an appearance as if a vast tent was spread in the heavens, glittering with gold, rubies, and sapphire. A more beautiful spectacle cannot be painted; but whoever should see such a northern light for the first time, could not behold it without terror. For however fine the illumination may be, it is attended, as I have learned, with such a hissing, cracking, and rushing noise through the air, as if the largest fireworks were playing off. To describe what they then hear, they make use of the expression spolochi chodiat, i.e., 'the raging hoist is paling.' The hunters who pursue the white and blue foxes in the confines of the icy sea, are often overtaken with these northern lights. Their dogs are then so frightened, that they will not move, but lie obstinately on the ground till the noise has passed. Commonly clear and calm weather follows this kind of northern lights. I have heard this account, not from one person only, but confirmed by the testimony of many who have spent part of several years in these very northern regions, and inhabited different countries from the Yenisei to the Lena; so that no doubt of its truth can remain. This seems, indeed, to be the birthplace of the aurora borealis.\"\n\nThis account of the noises attending the aurora borealis, allowing for some degree of exaggeration, has been corroborated by other testimonies.\n\nSimilar appearances have likewise been observed towards the south pole, and are therefore called aurora australis australis. The best account of these is given by Mr Forster, who in his voyage round the world with Captain Cook, says that he observed them in high southern latitudes, though attended with phenomena somewhat different from those observed here. \"On February 17, 1773, in south lat. 58°, a beautiful phenomenon (he says), was observed during the preceding night, which appeared again this and several following nights. It consisted of long columns of a clear white light, shooting up from the horizon to the eastward, almost to the zenith, and gradually spreading on the whole southern part of the sky. These columns were sometimes bent sideways at their upper extremities, and though in most respects similar to the northern lights (aurora borealis) of our hemisphere, yet differed from them in being always of a whitish colour, whereas ours assume various tints, especially those of a fiery and purple hue. The sky was generally clear when they appeared, and the air sharp and cold, the thermometer standing at the freezing point.\"\nThe periods of the appearances of the aurora borealis are very inconstant. In some years they occur very frequently, and in others they are more rare; and it has been observed that they are more common about the time of the equinoxes than at other seasons.\n\nDr Halley has given us a sort of chronological history of the appearances which may be ranked under the aurora borealis; but for his account of the individual cases we must refer to his paper in the Philosophical Transactions Abridged, vol. iv.\n\nThe particular part of the atmosphere in which these appearances take place, or the height above the earth to which they extend, is by no means certain; various philosophers have attempted to ascertain the height of various aurora borealis by trigonometrical calculation; some have estimated them at a few hundreds, others at some thousands of miles above the earth; but the results of their measurements are so contradictory, that they cannot be relied on.\n\n\"Several of the most celebrated inquirers into nature have given their authority to some of the most extravagant theories, in attempting to assign its proper cause to the aurora borealis. Their imaginations have kindled bonfires in the poles of the earth, and they have represented the northern lights as the effects of flames, to which those lights have scarcely any similarity, and from which they are distinguished by numberless diversities.\n\n\"The salt-pits of the north were at one time regarded as emitting a luminous effluvium from their entrails, copious enough to pervade the whole of our northern atmosphere. The discoveries of electricians have confirmed all these reveries to a shade; whence they would never return to excite the wonder of modern philosophers, if the authors of them had not brought forth other productions, whose merits have made even their mistakes immortal.\"\n\nThe evidence which we have for considering the aurora borealis as an effect of electricity, chiefly consists of the following arguments.\n\n1. If lightning be an effect of electricity, the same cause must, at a certain height in the atmosphere, produce such an appearance as is exhibited by the aurora borealis. The passage of the electric matter through air rarefied to a certain degree, is attended with all the undulating coruscations of this meteor. Indeed there is scarcely a single circumstance attending the passage of a spark or a charge through an exhausted tube, that does not bear a resemblance to something observed in the northern lights. The same peculiar motion, the same variety of colour, the same rapid alternations of flashes, occur both in the experiment, and in the natural phenomenon; the streams of light in both are vivid and pointed; and if, in the experiment, the exhaustion has been properly managed, some parts of the light will be marked with that reddish tinge, which in the aurora borealis has so often struck the vulgar mind with terror and consternation. The experiments to which we particularly allude are those of the conducting glass tube, the luminous conductor and the aurora borealis described in No. 188—190.\n\n2. The striking distance of a charge of electric fluid passing through the air, increases according to the rarefaction of that medium. If, therefore, two clouds in opposite states of electricity have no other circuit, it is probable that they will be discharged through the higher regions of the atmosphere, more especially if they are at such an elevation, as renders their communication with the earth impracticable.\n\n3. The same causes which tend to produce such an accumulation of electricity in the atmosphere as will bring on a thunder-storm, have been found, in certain seasons, and in the more northern climates, to be attended with an aurora borealis.\n\nIt must be confessed, however, that Mr Brook and Mr Bennet, in their observations on the electricity of the atmosphere during an aurora borealis, could observe no particular signs of increased electricity, more than would have occurred in a serene sky without any such appearance.\n\n4. A magnetic needle commonly appears a little disturbed during a strong aurora borealis.\n\nWe have already hinted at the connection between magnetism and electricity, and we shall fully illustrate this in the article MAGNETISM. Till this connection is fully explained, the force of this last argument can scarcely be seen.\n\nA considerable difficulty attends even the most received theories of the aurora borealis, viz. the light appearing always to strike from the poles towards the equator, rather than in the contrary direction. Perhaps this may be explained in the following manner. We shall assume the three following axioms.\n\n1. That all electrics when considerably heated, become conductors of electricity.\n\n2. That, conversely, non-electrics when subjected to violent degrees of cold, ought to become electrics.\n\n3. That cold must also increase the electric powers of such substances as are already electric.\n\nThe air, all round the globe, at a certain height above its surface, is found to be exceedingly cold, and, as far as experiments have yet determined, exceedingly electrical. The inferior parts of the atmosphere between the tropics, are violently heated during the daytime, by the reflection of the sun's rays from the earth. Such air will, therefore, be a kind of conductor, and much more readily part with its electricity to the clouds and vapours floating in it, than the colder air towards the north and south poles. Hence the prodigious appearances of electricity in these regions, shewing itself in thunder and other tempests of the most terrible kind. Immense quantities of the electric fluid are thus communicated to the earth; and the inferior warm atmosphere having once exhausted itself, must necessarily be recruited from the upper and colder region. This becomes very probable from what the French mathematicians observed when on the top of one of the Andes. They were often involved in clouds, which, sinking down into the warmer air, appeared there to be highly electrified, and discharged themselves in violent tempests of thunder and lightning; while in the mean time, on the top of the mountain, they enjoyed a calm and serene sky. In the temperate and frigid zones, the inferior parts of the atmosphere, never being so strongly heated, do not part with their electricity so easily as in the torrid zone, and consequently do not require such recruits from the upper regions; but notwithstanding the difference of heat observed in different parts of the earth near the surface, it is very probable that at considerable heights the degrees of cold are nearly equal all round.\nthe globe. Were there a like equality in the heat of the under part, there could never be any considerable loss of equilibrium in the electricity of the atmosphere; but as the hot air of the torrid zone is perpetually bringing down vast quantities of electric matter from the cold air that lies above it; and as the inferior parts of the atmosphere lying towards the north and south poles do not conduct in any great degree; it thence follows, that the upper parts of the atmosphere lying over the torrid zone will continually require a supply from the northern and southern regions. This easily shews the necessity of an electric current in the upper parts of the atmosphere from each pole towards the equator; and thus we are also furnished with a reason why the aurora borealis appears more frequently in winter than in summer; namely, because at that time the electric power of the inferior atmosphere is greater on account of the cold than in summer; and consequently the abundant electricity of the upper regions must go almost wholly off to the equatorial parts, it being impossible for it to get down to the earth; hence also the aurora borealis appears very frequent and bright in the frigid zones, the degree of cold in the upper and under regions of the atmosphere being much more nearly equal in these parts than in any other. In some parts of Siberia particularly, this meteor appears constantly from October to Christmas, and its corruptions are said to be very terrifying. Travellers agree that here the aurora borealis appears in its greatest perfection; and it is to be remarked, that Siberia is one of the coldest countries in the world. In confirmation of this, it may also be observed, that from the experiments hitherto made with the kite, the air appears considerably more electrical in winter than in summer, though the clouds are known to be often most violently electrified in the summer time; a proof, that the electricity naturally belonging to the air, is in summer much more powerfully drawn off by the clouds than in winter, owing to the excess of heat.\n\nA considerable difficulty, however, still remains from the upright position which the streams of the aurora borealis are generally supposed to have; whereas, according to our hypothesis, they ought rather to run directly from north to south. Dr Halley answered this difficulty by supposing his magnetic effluvia, (to which he attributed this phenomenon), to pass from pole to pole in arches of great circles, rising to a great height above the earth, and consequently darting from the places whence they arose like the radii of a circle; in which case, being let off in a direction nearly perpendicular to the surface of the earth, they must necessarily appear erect to those who see them from any part of the surface, as is demonstrated by mathematicians. It is also reasonable to think that they will take this direction rather than any other, on account of their meeting with less resistance in the very high regions of the air than in such as are lower.\n\nBut the greatest difficulty still remains; for we have supposed the equilibrium of the atmosphere to be broken in the daytime, and restored only at night; whereas, considering the immense velocity with which the electric fluid moves, the equilibrium ought to be restored in all parts almost instantaneously; yet the aurora borealis never appears except in the night, although its brightness is such as must sometimes make it visible to us did it really exist in the daytime.\n\nIn answer to this it must be observed, that though the passage of electricity through a good conductor is almost instantaneous, yet through a bad conductor it takes some time in passing. As our atmosphere, therefore, unless very violently heated, is but a bad conductor of electricity; though the equilibrium in it is broken, it can by no means be instantaneously restored. Add to this, that as it is the action of the sun which breaks the equilibrium, so the same action, extending over half the globe, prevents almost any attempt to restore it till night, when flashes arise from various parts of the atmosphere, gradually extending themselves with a variety of undulations towards the equator.\n\nPART VI.\n\nOF THE EFFECTS OF ELECTRICITY ON VEGETABLE LIFE.\n\nIT has been much disputed whether electricity produces any effects on vegetables; and the experiments that have been made with the view of ascertaining this point are most contradictory.\n\nThe first electrician who seems to have attended to this subject of inquiry was Mr Maimbray of Edinburgh, who, in the year 1746, electrified two myrtles during the whole month of October (i.e. we suppose, for some hours every day). The consequence was, that in the following summer, these electrified myrtles put forth buds and blossoms sooner than their neighbours who had been left to nature*.\n\nMr Maimbray was soon followed by the Abbé Nollet, who made some comparative experiments on the germination of seeds under similar circumstances, except that one pot was electrified three or four hours every day for fifteen days. The result of these experiments was similar to that of Mr Maimbray's†.\n\nSimilar experiments were made by M. Achard of Berlin, and several other philosophers, but still with the same result; till Dr Ingenhousz instituted a very complete set of experiments on the electrification of plants, which were communicated to the world through the medium of Rozier's Journal, at first by M. Swankhardt, and afterwards by Dr Ingenhousz himself, in consequence of some severe animadversions which the communication of M. Swankhardt had called from M. Duvernier. By these experiments the faith of philosophers with respect to the effect of electricity on vegetation was staggered, as they were attended with results very opposite to those of Maimbray, Nollet and Achard.\n\nExperiments\nExperiments have also been made by Dr Carmonay and the Abbé D'Ornoy, rather more favourable to the first opinion; but the manner in which the electricity was applied appears very equivocal, as it is found that even shocks do not pass through the body of the plant, but merely over its surface.\n\nBut the most complete set of experiments on this subject has been made by the Abbé Bertholon, and these we shall give more in detail.\n\n\"In the first place (says the Abbé), there is continually and everywhere diffused in the atmosphere (particularly in the upper regions) a considerable quantity of the electric fluid.\n\n\"This principle being granted: in order to remedy the deficiency of electric fluid which is supposed hurtful to vegetation, we must erect in the spot which we want to fecundate the following new apparatus, which has had all possible success, and which I shall call by the name of the electro-vegetometer. This machine is as simple in its construction as efficacious in its manner of acting; and I doubt not but it will be adopted by all those who are sufficiently instructed in the great principles of nature.\n\n\"This apparatus is composed of a mast AB, fig. 131, or a long pole thrust just so far into the earth as to stand firm and be able to resist the winds. That part of the mast which is to be in the earth must be well dried at the fire; and you must take care to lay on it a good coat of pitch and tar after taking it from the fire, that the resinous particles may enter more deeply into the pores of the wood, which will then be dilated, at the same time that its humidity will be expelled by the heat. Care must likewise be taken to throw around that part fixed in the earth a certain quantity of coal dust, or rather a thick layer of good cement, and to build besides a base of masonry-work of a thickness and depth proportionable to the elevation of the instrument, so as to keep it durable and solid. As to the portion it above the ground, it will be sufficient to put upon it some coats of oil paint, except one chooses rather to lay on a coat of bitumen the whole length of the piece.\n\n\"At the top of the mast there is to be put an iron console or support C; whose pointed extremity you are to fix in the upper end of the mast, while the other extremity is to terminate in a ring, in order to receive the hollow glass tube which is seen at D, and in which there is to be glued an iron rod rising with the point E. This rod, thus pointed at its upper extremity, is completely insulated, by reason of its keeping a strong hold of a thick glass tube, which is filled with a quantity of bituminous matter, mixed with charcoal, brick-dust, and glass-powder; all together forming a sufficiently good and strong cement for the object in view.\n\nTo prevent rain wetting the glass tube, care must be taken to folder to the rod E a funnel of white-iron; which consequently is entirely insulated. From the lower extremity of the rod E hangs a chain G, which enters into a second glass tube H, supported by the prop I. The lower end of the above-mentioned chain rests upon a circular piece of iron wire, which forms a part of the horizontal conductor KLMN. In L is a breaker with a turning joint or hinge, in order to move to the right or left the iron rod LMN; there is likewise another in Q, to give still greater effect to the circular movement. O and P are two supports terminating in a fork, where there is fixed a filken cord tightly stretched, in order to infuse the horizontal conductor: in N are several very sharp iron points.\n\n\"In fig. 132, you see an apparatus in the main like the former, but with some difference in the construction. At the upper extremity of the mast ab there is bored another hole into which enters a wooden cylinder c, which form of this has been carefully dried before a great fire, in order to extract its humidity, dilate its pores, and saturate it with tar, pitch, or turpentine, applied at repeated intervals. The more heat the wood and bituminous matter receives, the more the substance penetrates, and the infusion will be the more complete. It is moreover proper to besmear the circumference of the little cylinder with a pretty thick coat of bitumen. This preparation being made, we next insert the cylinder c into the hole b of the mast; and it is easy to join together these two wooden pieces in the most perfect manner.\n\n\"At the upper extremity of the cylinder c we strongly attach an iron rod gf, which, instead of one, is terminated by several sharp points, all of gilded iron. In e you see a branch of iron resembling the arm of an iron crown, from whence hangs an iron chain hi, at the end of which there is hooked a piece of iron resembling a man's square, and ending in a fork. The piece of iron i is a ring with a handle entering a little into the glass tube m filled with mastic, in the same manner as does the iron rod n. The conductor p is to be considered as an additional piece to act in that marked p. There are likewise put iron splices in q: the support s resembles those of O and P in the former figure. In this new machine you can lengthen or shorten the horizontal conductor as you please; and as the iron ring l turns freely in a circular gorge made in the mast, the conductor is enabled to describe the entire area of a circle.\n\n\"The construction of this electro-vegetometer once well underflooded, it will be easy for us to conceive its effects, these infra. The electricity which prevails in the aerial regions will soon be drawn down by the elevated points of the upper extremity.\n\n\"The electric matter brought down by the point E, or by those marked fff, will be necessarily transmitted both by the rod and chain; because the insulation produced at the upper extremity of the mast completely prevents its communication with the timber. The electric fluid passes from the chain to the horizontal conductor KM or no; it then escapes by the points at P and q.\n\n\"The manner of using this instrument is not more difficult than the knowledge either of its construction or effects. Suppose, for example, we are to place it in the midst of a kitchen garden. By making the horizontal conductor turn round successively, you will be able to carry the electricity over the whole surface of the proposed ground. The electric fluid thus drawn down, will extend itself over all the plants you want to cultivate; and this at a time when there is little or no electricity in the lower regions near the surface of the earth.\n\nOn the other hand, when it happens that the electric fluid shall be in too great abundance in the atmosphere, in order to take off the effect of the apparatus in K, fig. 131, and in m, fig. 132, you have only to hang to it an iron chain reaching to the ground, or else...\nEffects of Electricity on Vegetation.\n\nElectricity effects, viz., that of destroying the insulation, and of an infinitely transmitting the electric fluid in the same proportion as it is drawn by the points; so that there shall never be an overcharge of this fluid in the instrument, and its effect shall be either something or nothing, according as you add or remove the second chain or the additional rod.\n\n\"There will be nothing to fear from the spontaneous discharge of this apparatus, because it is terminated below by proper points in P and q of both machines; however, it will be easy to furnish one, by means of which we may approach the apparatus with perfect security; it is only necessary to hold the hand before it. This has the form of a great C, and is of a height equal to the distance that takes place between the horizontal conductor and the surface of the earth. This discharger near the middle must be furnished with a glass handle; and at that extremity which is directed towards the conductor, there must hang an iron chain made to trail on the ground. This instrument is an excellent safeguard. Sec fig. 133.\n\n\"By means of the electro-vegetometer just now described, one may be able to accumulate at pleasure this wonderful fluid, however diffused in the regions above, and conduct it to the surface of the earth, in those seasons when it is either scantily supplied, or its quantity is insufficient for vegetation; or although it may be in some degree sufficient, yet can never produce the effects of a multiplied and highly increased vegetation. So that by these means we shall have an excellent vegetable manure or nourishment brought down as it were from heaven, and that too at an easy expense; for after the construction of this instrument, it will cost nothing to maintain it: It will be moreover the most efficacious you can employ, no other substance being so active, penetrating, or conducive to the germination, growth, multiplication, or reproduction of vegetables. This heavenly manure is that which nature employs over the whole habitable earth; not excepting even those regions which are deemed barren, but which, however, are often fecundated by those agents which nature knows so well to employ to the most useful purposes. Perhaps there was nothing wanting to bring to a completion the useful discoveries that have been made in electricity, but to show this so advantageous an art of employing electricity as a manure; consequently, that all the effects which we have already mentioned depend upon electricity alone; and lastly, that all these effects, viz., acceleration in the germination, the growth, and production of leaves, flowers, fruit, and their multiplication, &c., will be produced, even at a time when secondary causes are against it; and all this is brought about by the electric fluid, which we have the art of accumulating over certain portions of the earth, where we want to raise those plants that are most calculated for our use. By multiplying these instruments, which are provided at little expense (since iron rods of the thickness of one's finger, and even less, are sufficient for the purpose), we multiply their beneficial effects, and extend their use ad infinitum.\n\n\"This apparatus having been raised with care in the midst of a garden, the happiest effects were perceived, viz., different plants, herbs, and fruits, in greater force than usual, more multiplied, and of better quality. At the same time it was observable, that during the night, the points P and q, as well as the upper extremities, were often garnished with beautiful luminous sparks. These facts are analogous to an observation which I have often made, viz., that plants grow best and are most vigorous near thunder-rods, where their situation favours their development. They likewise serve to explain why vegetation is so vigorous in lofty forests, and where the trees raise their heads thunder far from the surface of the earth, so that they seek rods, as it were, the electric fluid at a far greater height than plants less elevated; while the sharp extremities of their leaves, boughs, and branches, serve as so many points granted them by the munificent hand of nature, to draw down from the atmosphere that electric fluid, which is so powerful an agent in forwarding vegetation, and in promoting the different functions of plants.\n\n\"It is not only by means of the electricity in the atmosphere, collected by the above apparatus, that augment one can supply the electric fluid, which is so necessary to vegetation; but the electricity named air of vegetation answers the same purpose. However although artificial electricity may be, or however impossible it may appear to realize it, yet nothing will be found more easy upon trial. Let us suppose that one wants to augment the vegetation of trees in a garden, orchard, &c., without having recourse to the apparatus destined to pump down as it were the electricity from the atmosphere, it is sufficient to have a large inflating stool. This may be made in two ways; either by pouring a sufficient quantity of pitch and melted wax upon the above stool, whole borders being more raised than its middle, will form a kind of frame; or more simply, the stool (which is likewise called the inflator) shall only be composed of a plate longer than broad, supported by four glass pillars, like those used for electrical machines. One must take care to place above the inflator a wooden tray full of water, and to cause mouth upon the stool a man carrying a small pump in the form of a syringe. If you establish a communication between the man and an electrical machine put in motion (which is easily done by means of a chain that connects with the conductor of the machine), then the man thus insulated (as well as everything upon the stool) will be able, by pushing forward the sucker, to water the trees, by pouring upon them an electrical shower; and thus diffusing over all the vegetables under its influence a principle of fertility that exerts itself in an extraordinary manner upon the whole vegetable economy: and this method has moreover this advantage, that at all times and in all places it may be practised and applied to all plants whatever.\n\n\"Every one knows that the electricity is communicated to the water thus employed; and it would be easy to obtain the most ample conviction (if any one doubted it), by receiving upon his face or hand this electrical shower; he immediately feels small punctures or strokes, which are the effects of the sparks that issue from each drop of water. This is perceived most sensibly if there is presented a metal dish to this electrical dew; for at the very instant of contact, brilliant flashes are produced.\n\n\"That the electricity received by the man from the chain...\"\nEffects of chain may be communicated to the tray, we must put Electricity a small cake of white iron, upon the end of which he may place his foot. The tray filled with water is a kind of magazine or reservoir to serve as a continual supply to the pump. After watering one tree, you transport the flood to a second, a third, and so on successively; which is done in a short time, and requires very little trouble.\n\nInstead of the chain, it is better to employ a cord or twist of pinchbeck or any other metal; by means of which there can be no loss of the electric matter, as there is in the case of the chain by the ring points. Moreover, this metal cord or thread being capable of being untwisted and lengthened, there will be no occasion for transporting too often the electrical machine. It is almost needless to add, that this string or metallic cord, which is always insulated, may rest upon the same kind of supports with those which have been exhibited in OP and figs. 131. and 132. This method is simple, efficacious, and not expensive, and cannot be too much employed.\n\nIf one wants to water either a parterre or common garden, beds and platforms of flowers, or any other plots in which are sown grain or plants of different ages and kinds, no method is more easy and expeditious than the following: Upon a small carriage with two wheels there is placed a framed insulator in form of a cake of pitch and rosin, as we have mentioned before in No. 538. The carriage is drawn the whole length of the garden by a man or horse fixed to it. In proportion as you draw the carriage, the metallic cord winds itself upon a bobbin, which turns as usual. This last is insulated, either because the little apparatus that sustains the bobbin is planted in a mat of rosin (when you choose the axle to be of iron), or else because this moveable axis is a tube of solid glass. There must also be a support, which serves to prevent the gold thread or the metallic cord from trailing on the ground, and thus dissipating the electricity; and, moreover, it serves as an insulator. To accomplish this last purpose, it is necessary that the ring into which it passes be of glass. One may likewise employ the insulators and supports marked OP and figs. 131. and 132. If a gardener, mounted upon an insulator, holds in one hand a pump full of water, and with the other takes hold of a metallic cord, in order to transmit the electricity which comes from the conductor; in this case, the water being electrified, you will have an electrical shower; which falling on the whole surface of the plants which you want to electrify, will render the vegetation more vigorous and more abundant. A second gardener is to give additional pumps full of water to him who is upon the insulator, when he shall have emptied those he holds; and thus in a little time you will be able to electrify the whole garden. This method takes hardly longer time than the ordinary one; and although it should be a little longer, the great advantages resulting from it will abundantly recompense the small additional trouble.\n\nBy repeating this operation several days successively, either upon seed sown or plants in a state of growth, you will very soon reap the greatest advantages from it. This operation, equally easy with the preceding described upon the subject of watering trees, has been put in practice with the greatest success. Several other effects of methods answering the same purpose, might be devised; but they are all of them pretty similar to that just described.\n\nI cannot finish this article without mentioning another method relative to the present object, although it be much less efficacious than the preceding ones. It consists in communicating to water kept in basins, reservoirs, &c. (for the purpose of watering), the electric fluid, by means of a good electrical machine. To this end, one must plaster over with a bituminous cement all the interior surface of the basin destined to receive the water that serves for irrigation; the nature of this cement answering the purpose of insulation, will prevent the electric fluid that communicates with the water from being dissipated; and the water thus charged with electricity will be the more fitted for vegetation.\n\nIf the deficiency of the electric fluid, or rather a small quantity of it, is apt to be hurtful to vegetables, injured by a too great abundance of this matter will likewise sometimes produce pernicious effects. The experiments made by Messrs Nairne, Banks, and other learned men of the Royal Society of London, prove sufficiently this truth. An electric battery, very strong, was discharged upon a branch of balsam still holding its trunk. Some minutes after, there was observed a remarkable alteration in the branch, of which the least woody parts immediately withered, dropped towards the ground, died next day, and in a short time entirely dried up; at the same time that another branch of the same plant that had not been put under the electric chain, was not in the smallest degree affected.\n\nThis experiment repeated upon other plants showed the same effects; and it was remarked that the attraction, occasioned by a strong discharge of the electricity, produced an alteration different according to the different nature of the plants. Those which are least woody, more herbaceous, more aqueous, experience in proportion, impressions that are stronger and much more speedy in their operation.\n\nA branch of each of the following plants, composing an electrical chain, it was observed by these able philosophers, that the balsam was affected by the discharge of the battery in a few moments after, and perished next day. The leaves of a marvell of Peru did not drop till the day following that; and the same phenomenon happened to a geranium. Several days elapsed before there was observed any fatal effect on the cardinal flower. The branch of a laurel did not show any symptoms till after the lapse of about 15 days, after which it died; but it was a full month before they perceived any sensible change on the myrtle; at the same time they constantly observed that the bodies of those plants and branches which had formed no part of the chain, continued to be fresh, vigorous, and covered with leaves in good condition.\n\nIt hardly ever happens that the supersaturation of the electric fluid existing in a small portion of the atmosphere where a plant is situated, can be so great as that which took place by the explosion of the strong battery of Mr Nairne, directed particularly upon one branch; or if this should happen, it can only be upon a few individual plants in a very small number.\nINDEX.\n\nA\n\nACHARD's experiments on ice, No 5\ndivision of the scale of an electrometer, 68\nAction, electric, law of, 366—368\nshown by experiment, 368\nÆpinus's experiments on the tournament, 21\non sulphur, 27\ntheory of electricity, 294—347\ndefect in, supplied, 320\ndefended, 321\nAir, effect of, in electricity, 63\ndecomposed by electricity, 165\nrarefied by an explosion, 168\nwhen hot, a conductor, 227\nhow excited, 229\nby friction, 230\nevaporation, 231\nof a room, to electrify, 234\nplate of, to charge, 235\nessential to electrical phenomena, 237\nAmalgam, electrical,\npreparation of, 13\nib.\nAmber, electricity of, known to Thales, page 645, note (A.)\ngives name to electricity, 1\nAmmonia decomposed by electricity, 166\nApparatus, electrical, Part II.\nAtmosphere, electric, visible, 191\nelectricity of, constant, 495\nalways positive in dry weather, ib.\nstrongest in foggy weather, 503\ntable of observations on the, p. 792.\nperiodical flux and reflux observed in the, 504\ncauses affecting the electricity of the, 511—520\nAtmospheres, electric, hypothesis of, refuted, 408\nAttraction and repulsion, electrical, illustrated, Part III.
