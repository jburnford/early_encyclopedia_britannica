Single microscopes consist of a single lens or mirror; or if more lenses or mirrors be made use of, they only serve to throw light upon the object, but do not contribute to enlarge the image of it. Double or compound microscopes are those in which the image of an object is composed by means of more lenses or mirrors than one.\n\nFor the principles on which the construction of microscopes depends, see Optics. In the present article, it is intended to describe the finished instrument, with all its varied apparatus, according to the latest improvements; and to illustrate by proper details its uses and importance.\n\nI. Of Single Microscopes.\n\nThe famous microscopes made use of by Mr Leeuwenhoek, were all, as Mr Baker affirms us, of the single kind, and the construction of them was the most simple possible; each consisting only of a single lens set between two plates of silver, perforated with a small hole, with a moveable pin before it to place the object on and adjust it to the eye of the beholder. He informs us also, that lenses only, and not globules, were used in every one of these microscopes.\n\nPlate cccxxxvii. and fig. I. The single microscope now most generally known and used is that called Wilson's Pocket Microscope. The body is made of brass, ivory, or silver, and is represented by AA, BB. CC is a long finethreaded male screw that turns into the body of the microscope; D a convex glass at the end of the screw. Two concave round pieces of thin brass, with holes of different diameters in the middle of them, are placed to cover the above mentioned glass, and thereby diminish the aperture when the greatest magnifiers are employed. EE, three thin plates of brass within the body of the microscope; one of which is bent semicircularly in the middle, so as to form an arched cavity for the reception of a tube of glass, the use of the other two being to receive and hold the sliders between them. F, a piece of wood or ivory, arched in the manner of the semicircular plate, and cemented to it. G, the other end of the body of the microscope, where a hollow female screw is adapted to receive the different magnifiers. H is a spiral spring of steel, between the end G and the plates of brass, intended to keep the plates in a right position and counteract the long screw CC. I is a small turned handle, for the better holding of the instrument, to screw on or off at pleasure.\n\nTo this microscope belong six or seven magnifying glasses; five of them are set in silver, brass, or ivory, as in the figure K; and marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the lowest numbers being the greatest magnifiers. L is the seventh magnifier, set in the manner of a little barrel, to be held in the hand for the viewing of any larger object. M is a flat slip of ivory, called a slider, with four round holes through it, wherein to place objects between two pieces of glass or Malacovytal, as they appear at dddd. Six such sliders, and one of brass, are usually sold with this microscope, some with objects placed in them, and others empty for viewing any thing that may offer: but whoever pleases to make a collection, may have as many as he desires. The brass slider is to confine any small object, that it may be viewed without crushing or destroying it. N is a tube of glass contrived to confine living objects, such as frogs, fishes, &c., in order to discover the circulation of the blood. All these are contained in a little neat box of fish-kin or mahogany, very convenient for carrying in the pocket.\n\nWhen an object is to be viewed, thrust the ivory slider, in which the said object is placed, between the two flat brass plates EE; observing always to put that side of the slider where the brass rings are farther from the eye. Then screw on the magnifying glass you intend to use, at the end of the instrument G; and looking through it against the light, turn the long screw CC, till your object be brought to suit your eye; which will be known by its appearing perfectly distinct and clear. It is most proper to look at it first through a magnifier that can show the whole at once, and afterwards to inspect the several parts more particularly with one of the greatest magnifiers; for thus you will gain a true idea of the whole, and of all its parts. And though the greatest magnifiers can show but a minute portion of any object at once, such as the claw of a flea, the horn of a louse, or the like; yet by gently moving the slider which contains the object, the eye may gradually examine it all over.\n\nAs objects must be brought very near the glasses when the greatest magnifiers are made use of, be careful not to scratch them by rubbing the slider against them.\nMicroscope. them as you move it in or out. A few turns of the screw CC will easily prevent this mischief, by giving them room enough. You may change the objects in your sliders for any others you think proper, by taking out the brass rings with the point of a penknife; the tales will then fall out, if you but turn the sliders; and after putting what you please between them, by replacing the brass rings you will fasten them as they were before. It is proper to have some sliders furnished with tales, but without any object between them, to be always in readiness for the examination of fluids, salts, sands, powders, the farina of flowers, or any other casual objects of such sort as need only be applied to the outside of the tale.\n\nThe circulation of the blood may be easiest seen in the tails or fins of fishes, in the fine membranes between a frog's toes, or best of all in the tail of a water-newt. If your object be a small fish, place it within the tube N, and spread its tail or fin along the side thereof: if a frog, choose such a one as can but just be got into your tube; and, with a pen, or small stick, expand the transparent membrane between the toes of the frog's hind foot as much as you can. When your object is so adjusted that no part of it can intercept the light from the place you intend to view, unscrew the long screw CC, and thrust your tube into the arched cavity, quite through the body of the microscope; then screw it to the true focal distance, and you will see the blood puffing along its vessels with a rapid motion, and in a most surprising manner.\n\nThe third or fourth magnifiers may be used for frogs or fishes; but for the tails of water-newts, the fifth or sixth will do; because the globules of their blood are twice as large as those of frogs or fish. The first or second magnifier cannot well be employed for this purpose; because the thickness of the tube in which the object lies, will scarce admit its being brought so near as the focal distance of the magnifier.\n\nAn apparatus for the purpose of viewing opaque objects generally accompanies this microscope; and which consists of the following parts. A brass arm QR, which is screwed at Q, upon the body of the microscope at G. Into the round hole R, any of the magnifiers suitable to the object to be viewed are to be screwed; and under it, in the same ring, the concave polished silver speculum S. Through a small aperture in the body of the microscope under the brass plates EE, is to slide the long wire with the forceps T: This wire is pointed at one of its ends; and so, that either the points or forceps may be used for the objects as may be necessary. It is easy to conceive, therefore, that the arm at R, which turns by a twofold joint at a and b, may be brought with its magnifier over the object, the light reflected upon it by the application of the speculum, and the true focus obtained by turning of the male screw CC as before directed—its objects are sometimes not well fixed for view, either by the forceps or point, the small piece thrown at V is added, and in such cases answers better: it screws over the point of T; it contains a small round piece of ivory, blackened on one side, and left white upon the other as a contrast to coloured objects, and by a small piece of watch-spring fastens down the objects upon the ivory.\n\n2. Single Microscope by reflection. In fig. 2. A is a microscope. Scroll of brass fixed upright upon a round wooden base B, or mahogany drawer or case, so as to stand perfectly firm and steady. C is a brass screw, that passes through a hole in the upper limb of the scroll into the side of the microscope D, and screws it fast to the said scroll. E is a concave speculum set in a box of brass, which hangs in the arch G by two small screws f f, that screw into the opposite sides thereof. At the bottom of this arch is a pin of the same metal, exactly fitted to a hole h in the wooden pedestal, made for the reception of the pin. As the arch turns on this pin, and the speculum turns on the end of the arch, it may, by this twofold motion, be easily adjusted in such a manner as to reflect the light of the sun, of the sky, or of a candle, directly upwards through the microscope that is fixed perpendicularly over it; and by so doing may be made to answer many purposes of the large double reflecting microscope. The body of the microscope may also be fixed horizontally, and objects viewed in that position by any light you choose; which is an advantage the common double reflecting microscope has not. It may also be rendered further useful by means of a slip of glass; one end of which being thrust through between the plates where the sliders go, and the other extending to some distance, such objects may be placed thereon as cannot be applied in the sliders; and then, having a limb of brass that may fasten to the body of the microscope, and extend over the projecting glass a hollow ring wherein to screw the magnifiers, all sorts of subjects may be examined with great convenience, if a hole be made in the pedestal, to place the speculum exactly underneath, and thereby throw up the rays of light. The pocket-microscope, thus mounted, says Mr Baker, \"is as easy and pleasant in its use; as fit for the most curious examination of the animalcules and salts in fluids, of the farinae in vegetables, and of the circulation in small animals; in short, is as likely to make considerable discoveries in objects that have some degree of transparency, as any microscope I have ever seen or heard of.\"\n\nThe brass scroll A is now generally made to unscrew into three parts, and pack with the microscope and apparatus into the drawer of a mahogany pocket-case, upon the lid of which the scroll is made to fix when in use.\n\nThe opaque apparatus also, as above described, is applicable this way by reflection. It only consists in turning the arm R (fig. 1.), with the magnifier over the concave speculum below (fig. 2.), or to receive the light as reflected obliquely from it: the silver speculum screwed into R will then reflect the light, which it receives from the glass speculum, strongly upon the object that is applied upon the wire T underneath.\n\nThis microscope, however, is not upon the most convenient construction, in comparison with others now made: it has been esteemed for many years past from its popular name, and recommendation by its makers. Its portability is certainly a great advantage in its favour; but in most respects it is superceded by the microscopes hereafter described.\n\n3. Microscope for Opaque Objects, called the Single Fig. 3. Opaque Microscope. This microscope remedies the inconvenience of having the dark side of an object next the\nMicroscope the eye, which formerly was an insurmountable objection to the making observations on opaque objects with any considerable degree of exactness or satisfaction: for, in all other contrivances commonly known, the nearness of the instrument to the object (when glasses that magnify much are used) unavoidably overloads it so much, that its appearance is rendered obscure and indistinct. And notwithstanding ways have been tried to point light upon an object, from the sun or a candle, by a convex glass placed on the side thereof, the rays from either can be thrown upon it in such an acute angle only, that they serve to give a confused glare, but are insufficient to afford a clear and perfect view of the object. But this microscope, by means of a concave speculum of silver highly polished, in whose centre a magnifying lens is placed, such a strong and direct light is reflected upon the object, that it may be examined with all imaginable ease and pleasure. The several parts of this instrument, made either of brass or silver, are as follow.\n\nThrough the first side A, passes a fine screw B, the other end of which is fastened to the moveable side C. D is a nut applied to this screw, by the turning of which the two sides A and C are gradually brought together. E is a spring of steel that separates the two sides when the nut is unfastened. F is a piece of brass, turning round in a socket, whence proceeds a small spring tube moving upon a rivet; through which tube there runs a steel wire, one end whereof terminates in a sharp point G, and the other with a pair of pliers H fastened to it. The point and pliers are to thrust into, or take up and hold, any insect or object; and either of them may be turned upwards, as best suits the purpose. I is a ring of brass, with a female screw within it, mounted on an upright piece of the same metal; which turns round on a rivet, that it may be set at a due distance when the least magnifiers are employed. This ring receives the screws of all the magnifiers. K is a concave speculum of silver, polished as bright as possible; in the centre of which is placed a double convex lens, with a proper aperture to look through it. On the back of this speculum a male screw L is made to fit the brass ring I, to screw into it at pleasure. There are four of these concave specula of different depths, adapted to four glasses of different magnifying powers, to be used as the objects to be examined may require. The greatest magnifiers have the least apertures. M is a round object-plate, one side of which is white and the other black: The intention of this is to render objects the more visible, by placing them, if black, on the white side, or, if white, on the black side. A steel spring N turns down on each side to make any object fall; and if rising from the object-plate is a hollow pipe to screw it on the needle's point G. O is a small box of brass, with a glass on each side, contrived to confine any living object, in order to examine it: this also has a pipe to screw upon the end of the needle G. P is a turned handle of wood, to screw into the instrument when it is made use of. Q, a pair of brass pliers to take up any object, or manage it with convenience. R is a soft hair-brush for cleaning the glasses, &c. S is a small ivory box for tales, to be placed, when wanted, in the small brass I or O.\n\nWhen you would view any object with this microscope, screw the speculum, with the magnifier you think proper to use, into the brass ring I. Place your object, either on the needle G in the pliers H, on the object-plate M, or in the hollow brass box O, as may be most convenient: then holding up your instrument by the handle P, look against the light through the magnifying lens; and by means of the nut D, together with the motion of the needle, by managing its lower end, the object may be turned about, raised, or depressed, brought nearer the glass, or removed farther from it, till you find the true focal distance, and the light be seen strongly reflected from the speculum upon the object, by which means it will be shown in a manner surprisingly distinct and clear; and for this purpose the light of the sky or of a candle will answer very well. Transparent objects may also be viewed by this microscope; only observing, that when such come under examination, it will not always be proper to throw on them the light reflected from the speculum; for the light transmitted through them, meeting the reflected light, may together produce too great a glare. A little practice, however, will show how to regulate both lights in a proper manner.\n\n4. Ellis's Simple and Aquatic Microscope. Fig. 4. re-Fig. 4. presents a very convenient and useful microscope, contrived by Mr John Ellis, author of An Essay upon Corallines, &c. To practical botanists, observers of animals, &c. it possesses many advantages above those just described. It is portable, simple in its construction, expeditious, and commodious in use. K represents the box containing the whole apparatus: it is generally made of fish-skin; and on the top there is a female screw, for receiving the screw that is at the bottom of the pillar A; this is a pillar of brass, and is screwed on the top of the box. D is a brass pin which fits into the pillar; on the top of this pin is a hollow socket to receive the arm which carries the magnifiers; the pin is to be moved up and down, in order to adjust the lenses to their focal or proper distance from the object. [N.B. In the representations of this microscope, the pin D is delineated as passing through a socket at one side of the pillar A; whereas it is usual at present to make it pass down a hole bored through the middle of the pillar.] E, the bar which carries the magnifying lens; it fits into the socket X, which is at the top of the pin or pillar D. This arm may be moved backwards and forwards in the socket X, and sideways by the pin D; so that the magnifier, which is screwed into the ring at the end E of this bar, may be easily made to traverse over any part of the object that lies on the stage or plate B. FF is a polished silver speculum, with a magnifying lens placed at the centre thereof, which is perforated for this purpose. The silver speculum screws into the arm E, as at F. G, another speculum, with its lens, which is of a different magnifying power from the former. H, the semicircle which supports the mirror I; the pin R, affixed to the semicircle H, passes through the hole which is towards the bottom of the pillar A. B, the flagge, or the plane, on which the objects are to be placed; it fits into the small dovetailed arm which is at the upper end of the pillar DA. C, a plane glass, with a small piece of black silk stuck on it; this glass is to lay in a groove made in the stage C. M, a hollow glass to be laid occasionally on the flagge in...\nMicroscope stead of the plane glass C. L, a pair of nippers. These are fixed to the stage by the pin at bottom; the steel wire of these nippers slides backwards and forwards in the socket, and this socket is moveable upwards and downwards by means of the joint, so that the position of the object may be varied at pleasure. The object may be fixed in the nippers, stuck on the point, or affixed, by a little gum-water, &c., to the ivory cylinder N, which occasionally screws to the point of the nippers.\n\nTo use this microscope: Take all the parts of the apparatus out of the box; then begin by screwing the pillar A to the cover thereof; pass the pin R of the semicircle which carries the mirror through the hole that is near the bottom of the pillar A; push the stage into the dovetail at B, slide the pin into the pillar (see the N.B. above); then pass the bar E through the socket which is at the top of the pin D, and screw one of the magnifying lenses into the ring at F. The microscope is now ready for use; and though the enumeration of the articles may lead the reader to imagine the instrument to be of a complex nature, we can safely affirm that he will find it otherwise. The instrument has this peculiar advantage, that it is difficult to put any of the pieces in a place which is appropriated to another. Let the object be now placed either on the stage or in the nippers L, and in such manner that it may be as nearly as possible over the centre of the stage; bring the speculum F over the part you mean to observe; then throw as much light on the speculum as you can, by means of the mirror I, and the double motion of which it is capable; the light received on the speculum is reflected by it on the object. The distance of the lens F from the object is regulated by moving the pin D up and down, until a distinct view of it is obtained. The best rule is, to place the lens beyond its focal distance from the object, and then gradually to slide it down till the object appears sharp and well defined. The adjustment of the lenses to their focus, and the distribution of the light on the object, are what require the most attention; on the first the distinctness of the vision depends; the pleasure arising from a clear view of the parts under observation is due to the modification of the light. No precise rule can be given for attaining accurately these points; it is from practice alone that ready habits of obtaining these necessary properties can be acquired, and with the assistance of this no difficulty will be found.\n\n5. A very simple and convenient microscope for botanical and other purposes, though inferior in many respects to that of Mr Ellis, was contrived by the ingenious Mr Benjamin Martin, and is represented at fig. 5, where AB represents a small arm supporting two or more magnifiers, one fixed to the upper part as at B, the other to the lower part of the arm at C; these may be used separately or combined together. The arm AB is supported by the square pillar IK, the lower end of which fits into the socket E of the foot FG; the stage DL is made to slide up and down the square pillar; H, a concave mirror for reflecting light on the object.—To use this microscope, place the object on the stage, reflect the light on it from the concave mirror, and regulate it to the focus, by moving the stage nearer to or farther from the lens at B. The ivory sliders pass through the stage; other objects may be fixed in the nippers MN, and then brought under Microscope.\n\n6. Withering's portable Botanic Microscope. Fig. 6. Fig. 6 represents a small botanical microscope contrived by Dr Withering, and described by him in his Botanical Arrangements. It consists of three brass plates, ABC, which are parallel to each other; the wires D and E are riveted into the upper and lower plates, which are by this means united to each other; the middle plate or stage is moveable on the aforesaid wires by two little sockets which are fixed to it. The two upper plates each contain a magnifying lens, but of different powers; one of these confines and keeps in their places the fine point F, the forceps G, and the small knife H.—To use this instrument, unfasten the upper lens, and take out the point, the knife, and the forceps; then screw the lens on again, place the object on the stage, and then move it up or down till you have gained a distinct view of the object, as one lens is made of a shorter focus than the other; and spare lenses of a still deeper focus may be had if required. This little microscope is the most portable of any. Its principal merit is its simplicity.\n\n7. Botanical Lenses or Magnifiers. The haste with which botanists, &c., have frequently occasion to view objects, renders an extempore pocket-glass indispensably necessary. The most convenient of any yet constructed, appears to be that contrived, in regard to the form of the mounting, by Mr Benjamin Martin; and is what he called a Hand Megaloscope, because it is well adapted for viewing all the larger sort of small objects universally, and by only three lenses it has seven different magnifying powers.\n\nFig. 7. represents the case with the three frames and lenses, which are usually of 1, 1½, and 2 inches focus; they all turn over each other, and that into the case, and are turned out at pleasure.\n\nThe three lenses singly, afford three magnifying powers; and by combining two and two, we make three more: for d with e makes one, d with f another, and e with f a third; which, with the three singly, make six; and lastly, all three combined together make another; so that upon the whole, there are seven powers of magnifying with these glasses only.\n\nWhen the three lenses are combined, it is better to turn them in, and look through them by the small apertures in the sides of the case. The eye in this case is excluded from extra light; the aberration of the superfluous rays through the glasses is cut off; and the eye coincides more exactly with the common axes of the lenses.\n\nA very useful and easy kind of microscope (described by Joblot, and which has been long in use), adapted chiefly for viewing, and confining at the same time, any living insects, small animals, &c., is shown at fig. 8. Fig. 8, where A represents a glass tube, about 1¼ inches diameter, and 2 inches high. B, a case of brass or wood, containing a sliding tube, with two or three magnifying\nMicroscopeing glasses that may be used either separately or combined. In the inside, at the bottom, is a piece of ivory, black and white on opposite sides, that is occasionally removed, and admits a point to be screwed into the centre. The cap screws at D, to admit the placing of the object; the proper distance of the glasses from the object is regulated by pulling up or down the brass tube E at top containing the eye-glasses.\n\nThis microscope is particularly useful for exhibiting the well-known curious curculio imperialis, vulgarly called the diamond beetle, to the greatest advantage; for which, as well as for other objects, a glass bottom, and a polished reflector at the top, are often applied, to condense the light upon the object. In this case, the stand and brass-bottom F, as shown in the figure, are taken away by unscrewing.\n\n9. Mr Lyonet's Single Anatomical Dissecting Microscope.—Fig. 9 represents a curious and extremely useful microscope, invented by that gentleman for the purpose of minute dissections, and microscopic preparations. This instrument must be truly useful to amateurs of the minute of insects, &c., being the best adapted of any for the purposes of dissection. With this instrument Mr Lyonet made his very curious microscopical dissection of the chenille de faule, as related in his Traité Anatomique de la chenille qui rouge le bois de faule, &c.\n\nAB is the anatomical table, which is supported by a pillar NO; this is screwed on the foot CD. The table AB is prevented from turning round by means of two steady pins. In this table or board there is a hole G, which is exactly over the centre of the mirror EF, that is to reflect the light on the object; the hole G is designed to receive a flat or concave glass, on which the objects for examination are to be placed.\n\nRXZ is an arm formed of several balls and sockets, by which means it may be moved in every possible situation; it is fixed to the board by means of the screw H. The last arm IZ has a female screw, into which a magnifier may be screwed as at Z. By means of the screw H, a small motion may be occasionally given to the arm IZ, for adjusting the lens with accuracy to its focal distance from the object.\n\nAnother chain of balls is sometimes used, carrying a lens to throw light upon the object; the mirror is likewise so mounted, as to be taken from its place at K, and fitted on a clamp, by which it may be fixed to any part of the table AB.\n\nTo use the Dissecting Table.—Let the operator sit with his left side near a light window; the instrument being placed on a firm table, the side DH towards the stomach, the observations should be made with the left eye. In dissecting, the two elbows are to be supported by the table on which the instrument rests, the hands resting against the board AB; and in order to give it greater stability (as a small shake, though imperceptible to the naked eye, is very visible in the microscope), the dissecting instruments are to be held one in each hand, between the thumb and two forefingers.\n\nII. Of Double Microscopes, commonly called Compound Microscopes.\n\nDouble microscopes are so called, from being a combination of two or more lenses.\n\nThe particular and chief advantages which the compound microscopes have over the single, are, that the objects are represented under a larger field of view, and with a greater amplification of reflected light.\n\n1. Culpeper's Microscope.—The compound microscope, originally contrived by Mr Culpeper, is represented at fig. 10. It consists of a large external brass body A, Fig. 10, B, C, D, supported upon three ferrules, which are fixed to the stage EF; the stage is supported by three larger ferrules, that are screwed to the mahogany pedestal GH. There is a drawer in the pedestal, which holds the apparatus. The concave mirror J is fitted to a socket in the centre of the pedestal. The lower part LMCD of the body forms an exterior tube, into which the upper part of the body ABLM slides, and may be moved up or down, so as to bring the magnifiers, which are screwed on at N, nearer to or farther from the object.\n\nTo use this microscope: Screw one of the buttons, which contains a magnifying lens, to the end N of the body; place the slider, with the objects, between the plates of the slider-holder. Then, to attain distinct vision, and a pleasing view of the object, adjust the body to the focus of the lens you are using, by moving the upper part gently up and down, and regulate the light by the concave mirror.\n\nFor opaque objects, two additional pieces must be used. The first is a cylindrical tube of brass (represented at L, fig. 11.), which fits on the cylindrical part at Fig. 11. N of the body. The second piece is the concave speculum h; this is to be screwed to the lower end of the aforementioned tube: the upper edge of this tube should be made to coincide with the line which has the same number affixed to it as to the magnifier you are using; e.g., if you are making use of the magnifier marked 5, slide the tube to the circular line on the tube N that is marked also with No. 5. The slider-holder should be removed when you are going to view opaque objects, and a plane glass should be placed on the stage in its place to receive the object; or it may be placed in the nippers, the pin of which fits into the hole in the stage.\n\nThe apparatus belonging to this microscope consists of the following particulars: viz. Five magnifiers, each fitted in a brass button; one of these is seen at N, fig. 10. Six ivory sliders, five of them with objects. A brass tube, to hold the concave speculum. The concave speculum in a brass box. A fish pan. A set of glass tubes. A flat glass fitted to the stage. A concave glass fitted to the stage. A pair of forceps. A steel wire, with a pair of nippers at one end and a point at the other. A small ivory cylinder, to fit on the pointed end of the aforementioned nippers. A convex lens, moveable in a brass semicircle; this is affixed to a long brass pin, which fits into a hole on the stage.\n\nThe construction of the foregoing microscope is very simple, and it is easy in use; but the advantages of the stage and mirror are too much confined for an extensive application and management of all kinds of objects. Its greatest recommendation is its cheapness; and to those who are desirous of having a compound microscope at a low price, it may be acceptable.\n\n2a. Cuff's Microscope. The improved microscope next in order is that of Mr Cuff. Besides remedying the disadvantages above mentioned, it contains the addition-\nMicroscope addition of an adjusting screw, which is a considerable improvement, and highly necessary to the examination of objects under the best defined appearance from the glaases. It is represented at fig. 11, with the apparatus that usually accompanies it. A, B, C, shows the body of this microscope; which contains an eye-glass at A, a broad lens at B, and a magnifier which is screwed on at C. The body is supported by the arm DE, from which it may be removed at pleasure. The arm DE is fixed on the sliding bar F, and may be raised or depressed to any height within its limits. The main pillar ab is fixed in the box b c; and by means of the brass foot d is screwed to the mahogany pedestal XY, in which is a drawer containing all the apparatus. O is a milled-headed screw, to tighten the bar F when the adjusting screw c g is used. f g Is the stage, or plate, which carries the objects; it has a hole at the centre n. G, a concave mirror, that may be turned in any direction, to reflect the light of a candle, or the sky, upon the object.\n\nTo use this microscope: Screw the magnifier you intend to use to the end C of the body; place the slider-holder P in the hole n, and the slider with the object between the plates of the slider-holder; set the upper edge of the bar DE to coincide with the divisions which correspond to the magnifier you have in use, and pinch it by the milled nut; now reflect a proper quantity of light upon the object, by means of the concave mirror G, and regulate the body exactly to the eye and the focus of the glasses by the adjusting screw c g.\n\nTo view opaque objects, take away the slider-holder P, and place the object on a flat glass under the centre of the body, or on one end of the jointed nippers o p. Then screw the silver concave speculum k to the end of the cylinder L, and slide this cylinder on the lower part of the body, so that the upper edge thereof may coincide with the line which has the same mark with the magnifier that is then used; reflect the light from the concave mirror G to the silver speculum, from which it will again be reflected on the object. The glasses are to be adjusted to their focal distance as before directed.\n\nThe apparatus consists of a convex lens H, to collect the rays of light from the sun or a candle, and condense them on the object. L a cylindrical tube, open at each side, with a concave speculum screwed to the lower end h. P the slider-holder: this consists of a cylindrical tube, in which an inner tube is forced upwards by a spiral spring; it is used to receive an ivory slider K, which is to be slid between the plates h and i. The cylinder P fits the hole n in the stage; and the hollow part at k is designed to receive a glass tube. R is a brass cone, to be put under the bottom of the cylinder P, to intercept occasionally some of the rays of light. S, a box containing a concave and a flat glass, between which a small living insect may be confined: it is to be placed over the hole n. T a flat glass, to lay any occasional object upon; there is also a concave one for fluids. O is a long steel wire, with a small pair of pliers at one end, and a point at the other, designed to stick or hold objects; it flips backwards and forwards in the short tube o; the pin p fits into the hole of the stage. W, a little round ivory box, to hold a supply of tale and rings for the microscope. V, a small ivory cylinder, that fits on the pointed end of the steel wire: it is designed for opaque objects. Light-coloured ones are to be stuck upon the dark side, and vice versa. M, a fish-pan, wherein to fasten a small fish, to view the circulation of the blood: the tail is to be spread across the oblong hole k at the small end, and tied fast, by means of a ribbon fixed thereto; the knob l is to be thrown through the slit made in the stage, that the tail may be brought under the magnifier.\n\n3. This microscope has received several material improvements from Mr Martin, Mr Adams, &c. By an alteration, or rather an enlargement, of the body of the tube which contains the eye-glasses, and also of the eye-glasses themselves, the field of view is made much larger, the mirror below for reflecting light is made to move upon the same bar with the stage; by which means the distance of it from the stage may be very easily and suitably varied. A condensing glass is applied under the stage in the slider-holder, in order to modify and increase the light that is reflected by the mirrors below from the light of a candle or lamp. It is furnished also with two mirrors in one frame, one concave and the other plane, of glass silvered; and by simply unscrewing the body, the instrument, when desired, may be converted into a single microscope. Fig. 12. is a representation of the instrument thus improved; and the following is the description of it, as given by Mr Adams in his Essays.\n\nAB represents the body of the microscope, containing a double eye-glass and a body-glass: it is here shown as screwed to the arm CD, from whence it may be occasionally removed, either for the convenience of packing, or when the instrument is to be used as a single microscope.\n\nThe eye-glasses and the body-glasses are contained in a tube which fits into the exterior tube AB; by pulling out a little this tube when the microscope is in use, the magnifying power of each lens is increased.\n\nThe body AB of the microscope is supported by the arm CD; this arm is fixed to the main pillar CF, which is screwed firmly to the mahogany pedestal GH; there is a drawer to this pedestal, which holds the apparatus.\n\nNIS, the plate or stage which carries the slider-holder KL: this stage is moved up or down the pillar CF, by turning the milled nut M; this nut is fixed to a pinion, that works in a toothed rack cut on one side of the pillar. By means of this pinion, the stage may be gradually raised or depressed, and the object adjusted to the focus of the different lenses.\n\nKL is a slider-holder, which fits into a hole that is in the middle of the stage NIS; it is used to confine and guide either the motion of the sliders which contain the objects, or the glasses tubes that are designed to confine small fishes for viewing the circulation of the blood. The sliders are to be passed between the two upper plates, the tubes through the bent plates.\n\nL is a brass tube, to the upper part of which is fixed the condensing lens before spoken of; it fits into the under part of the slider-holder KL, and may be set at different distances from the object, according to its distance from the mirror or the candle.\n\nO is the frame which holds the two reflecting mir-\nMicroscopes, one of which is plane, the other concave. These mirrors may be moved in various directions, in order to reflect the light properly, by means of the pivots on which they move, in the semicircle QSR, and the motion of the semicircle itself on the pin S: the concave mirror generally answers best in the day-time; the plane mirror combines better with the condensing lens, and a lamp or candle. At D there is a socket for receiving the pin of the arm Q (fig. 31.), to which the concave speculum, for reflecting light on opaque objects, is fixed. At S is a hole and slit for receiving either the nippers L (fig. 31.) or the fish-pan I; when these are used, the slider-holder must be removed. T, a hole to receive the pin of the convex lens M.\n\nTo use this microscope: Take it out of the box. Screw the body into the round end of the upper part of the arm CD. Place the brass sliders, which contain the magnifiers, into the dove-tailed slit which is on the under side of the aforementioned arm, as seen at E, and slide it forwards until the magnifier you mean to use is under the centre of the body: opposite to each magnifier in this slit there is a notch, and in the dove-tailed part of the arm CD there is a spring, which falls into the above-mentioned notch, and thus makes each magnifier coincide with the centre of the body. Pass the ivory slider you intend to use between the upper plates of the slider-holder KL, and then reflect as strong a light as you can on the subject by means of one of the mirrors; after this, adjust the object to the focus of the magnifier and your eye, by turning the milled screw M, the motion of which raises and depresses the stage NIS. The degree of light necessary for each object, and the accuracy required in the adjustment of the lenses to their proper focal distance from the object will be easily attained by a little practice.\n\nWhen opaque objects are to be examined, remove the slider-holder, and place the object on a flat glass, or fix it to the nippers L, the pin of these fit into the hole on the stage; screw the concave speculum R into the arm Q (fig. 31.), and then pass the pin of this arm through the socket D (fig. 12.); the light is now to be reflected from the concave mirror to the silver speculum, and from this down on the object. No exact rule can be given for reflecting the light on the object; we must therefore refer the reader to the mother of all aptness, practice. The speculum must be moved lower or higher, to suit the focus of the different magnifiers and the nature of the object.\n\nThe foregoing directions apply equally to the using of this instrument as a single microscope; with this difference only, that the body AB is then removed, and the eye is applied to the upper surface of the arm CD, exactly over the magnifiers.\n\nThis microscope is sometimes made with the following alterations, which are supposed to make it still more convenient and useful. The arm CD that carries the body and magnifiers is made both to turn on a pin, and to slide backwards and forwards in a socket at C; so that, instead of moving the objects below on the stage, and disturbing them, the magnifiers are more conveniently brought over any part of the objects as desired. The condensing glass is made larger, and slides upon the square bar CF quite distinct from the stage, like the mirrors below; and it is thereby made useful for any other objects that may be applied on Microscope glasses fitted to the stage, as well as those put into the slider-holder K. It is thereby not confined to this stage alone as in the preceding. When the body AB is taken away, the arm CD may be slid away from its bar, with the magnifiers, and the forceps, wire, and joint, applied to it; and it thereby serves the purpose of a small single or opaque hand microscope, for any object occasionally applied to this wire. The magnifiers in the slider E are mounted in a wheel case, which perhaps prevents its being in the way so much as the long slider E before described.—This contrivance is represented at X, fig. 12.\n\n4. Martin's New Universal Compound Microscope.—This instrument was originally constructed by Mr. R. Martin, and intended to comprise all the uses and advantages of the single, compound, opaque, and aquatic microscopes. The following is a description of it.\n\nFig. 13. is a representation of the instrument placed up for use. ABCD is the body of the microscope: which consists of four parts, viz. AB the eyepiece, or that containing the eye-glasses, and is screwed into C, which is a moveable or sliding tube on the top; this inner tube contains the body-glass screwed into its lower part. D is the exterior tube or case, in which the other slides up and down in an easy and steady manner. This motion of the tube C is useful to increase and decrease the magnifying power of the body-glass when thought necessary, as before mentioned. E is a pipe or stout screwed on to the body of the microscope D, and at its lower part, over the several magnifying lenses hereafter described. FGHI is the square stem of the microscope, upon which the stage R moves in a horizontal position, upwards or downward, by means of the fine rack-work of teeth and pinion. KL is a strong solid joint and pillar, by which the position of the instrument is readily altered from a vertical one to an oblique or to a perfectly horizontal one as may be required: it is thus well adapted to the case of the observer either sitting or standing; and as it is very often convenient to view objects by direct unreflected light, when the square stem FI is placed in a horizontal position for this purpose, the mirror T is then to be taken off in order to prevent the obstruction of the rays. M is a circular piece of brass, serving as a base to the pillar. NOP, the tripod or foot by which the whole body of the microscope is steadily supported; it folds up when packed into the case. W is a brass frame, that contains the condensing lens, and acts in conjunction with the large concave and plane mirrors below at T; the reflected rays from which, either of the common light or of that of a candle or lamp, it agreeably modifies, and makes ready in the field of view.\n\nThe particulars of the apparatus to this microscope are as follow: Q is a circular brass box, containing five magnifiers or object lenses, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; the digits of which appear severally through a small round hole in the upper plate of it. To the upper side is fixed a small circle of brass, by which it is connected with, and screwed into, the round end of the arm abed; which is a long piece of brass, and moves through either by teeth or pinion, or not, as may be desired, in ef; which is a socket on the upper part of the pillar, and admits, with a motion both easy and steady, the\nMicroscope-brafs arm. R is a fixed stage, upon which the objects to be viewed are to be placed; it is firmly fastened to the square pillar, which is moved by the rack-work. In the middle is a large circular hole, for receiving concave glasses, with fluids, &c., it has also a sliding spring frame to fasten down slips of glass or other things; at abc are three small pockets or holes, intended to receive several parts of the apparatus. S is the refractor, or illuminating lens, for converging the sun's rays upon opaque objects laid upon the stage R. To this purpose it moves on a semicircle upon a long shank g, in a spring socket h, in the arm i; this arm moving every way by a float pin k in the socket a of the stage. In this manner it is easily adjusted to any position of the sun, candle, &c.—T, the reflecting-glass frame, containing a concave and plane speculum, which is moved upon the square pillar by the hand. The use of it is to illuminate all transparent objects that are applied to the stage above.\n\nFig. 14. No. 1. is an auxiliary moveable stage; which by means of a pin k is placed in the hole a of the stage R, and can be moved in a horizontal direction over the whole field of the stage. In this stage, there are three circular holes with shouldered bottoms; a large one in the middle, and on each side a small one, for the reception of the three following necessary articles: No. 2. a watch-glass to be placed in the large hole, to hold fluids containing animals, &c.; a circular piece of ivory, No. 3, one side of which is black, the other white, to support opaque objects of different contrasted colours; and circular plane and concave glasses, No. 4, for contemporaneous transparent objects. —The same use is made of the other small hole as of the large one, only in a lesser degree, to receive small concave glasses, plates, &c.\n\nNo. 5. is the silvered speculum, called a Liberkhun, which makes the single opaque microscope, by being screwed to the slider abcd (fig. 13.) in room of the box of lenses Q, and the body AE above it. The chief use of this is to view very small objects strongly illuminated near the compounded focus of the mirror T (fig. 13.). No. 6. is the forceps or pliers, for holding such kind of objects, and by which they can be applied very readily to the focus of the lens in the liberkhun. They have a motion all ways by means of the spring socket a, the joint b, and the shank c: they are placed in the socket c of the fixed stage R (fig. 13.). No. 7. is a small piece of ivory, to be placed upon the pointed end of the pliers: it is black upon one side, and white upon the other, to receive opaque objects.\n\nNo. 8. is a liberkhun of a larger size than that first mentioned, with a hole in its centre: this is screwed into No. 9. the hole a of a brafs ring, fastened to a long wire b; which moves up and down in the spring socket b of the stage R, in which it also moves sidewise; and thus, with the body AE above, forms an aquatic compound microscope for showing all sorts of objects in water and other fluids placed under it in the watch-glass No. 2. on the stage.\n\nNo. 11. is a cone, with a proper aperture a to exclude superfluous light, that would disturb a critical observation of a curious object; it is placed on the under side of the fixed stage R.\n\nNo. 12. is what is usually called a bug-box, consisting of a concave glass with a plane one screwed over it; by means of which a bag, louse, flea, &c. may be secured and viewed alive. It is to be placed on either of the stages R (fig. 13.), or No. 1. (fig. 14.).\n\nNo. 13. is the fish-pan. In the long concave body ab, a fish may be so confined by the ribbon c, that the transparent tail may be in part over the slit or hole at a. In this state, it is placed on the stage R, with the pin d in the hole c of the stage, and moves freely and horizontally for viewing the circulation of the blood, &c.\n\nNo. 14. is the slider-holder that is placed on the stage R; it receives the sliders and tubes when filled with transparent objects, to be viewed either by the compound or single microscope.\n\nNo. 15. represents the ivory slider, to hold the objects between the tales as usual.\n\nNo. 16. is a useful auxiliary slider framed in brass. In this slider small concave glasses are cemented; and a slip of plane glass slides over them; by which any small living object, as mites, &c. may be confined without injury, and deliberately viewed.\n\nNo. 17. represents a set of glass tubes, three in number, one within another; they are useful for small tadpoles, water newts, eels, &c. when the circulation of the blood is to be viewed. There is a small hole at one end of each tube, that serves to admit the air; for when they are filled with water, the other end is stopped with a cork.\n\nNo. 18. is a small ivory box, containing spare tacks and wires, to supply the sliders with occasionally.\n\nNo. 19. is a brafs cell or button, containing a very small lens, properly set between two small plates of brass, that it may be brought very near to the object when viewed therewith as a single microscope. This magnifier is screwed into the same hole as the wheel of six magnifiers Q are (fig. 13.).\n\nNo. 20. is a lens, adapted to view and examine objects, by magnifying them sufficiently, so as to be able to apply them to the microscope for inspection: on this account it is called the exploraor.\n\nThe preceding are the chief articles of the apparatus: which, on account of their being somewhat different from what is applied to other microscopes, we have been thus particular in describing. In using the microscope, and while viewing objects by either the single or compound instrument, the focal distances of the magnifiers are made perfectly exact by turning of the pinion at the nut w, in one way or the other, very gently in the teeth of the rack-work at X (fig. 13.).\n\nIt is necessary that the centres of the object-lenses or magnifiers, the stage, and the mirrors at bottom, should all be in a right line in the axis of the microscope, when opaque objects are to be viewed, that are placed upon the ivory piece No. 7. or the forceps No. 6. and all other such sort of objects which are placed in the centre of the stage R, or slider-holder No. 14.: But when aquatic or living objects, which require a great space to move in, are to be viewed, then the horizontal motion at ef (fig. 13.) is made use of, and the view may be extended laterally over the whole of the diameter of the object or field of view; and by putting the arm abed forward or backward in its socket ef, the view is extended in the contrary direction.\nMicroscope direction equally well; and in this manner the whole of the objects may be viewed without the least disturbance.\n\nAs the bras arm \\( abcd \\) may be brought to the height of three or four inches above the stage \\( R \\); so, by means of the rack-work motion of the stage, a lens of a greater focal distance than the greatest in the wheel \\( Q \\) may be occasionally applied in place of the wheel, and thereby the larger kind of objects be viewed; the instrument becoming, in this case, what is called a megaloscope.\n\nIn viewing moving living objects, or even fixed ones, when nice motions are requisite, a rack-work and pinion is often applied to the arm \\( abcd \\); the arm is cut out with teeth; and the pinion, as shown at \\( Y \\), is applied to work it. This acts but in one direction; and, in order to produce an equally necessary motion perpendicular to this, rack-work and pinion is applied tangent-wise to the stage, which is then jointed.\n\nWhat has been related above respects the construction of those denominated portable microscopes, in contradiction to those which are portable: their dimensions, however, have been considerably reduced by opticians, in order to render them fit for the pocket; and as they are for the most part constructed on nearly the same principles as those which have been already described, what has been said will sufficiently instruct our readers in using any pocket microscope whatever. Only it may be observed, that in those reduced instruments, both the field of view and the magnifying power are proportionally diminished.\n\nWe shall conclude the account of this sort of microscope with descriptions of a very portable pocket apparatus of microscopic instruments, and of a new microscopic pocket telescope, both invented by the late Mr B. Martin, and since made by most instrument-makers in London.\n\nThe former is represented at fig. 15. It consists of two parts, viz. the body \\( ab \\), and the pedestal \\( k \\), which is joined by a screw at the part between \\( b \\) and \\( c \\). It consists of three cylindric tubes, viz. (1.) the exterior tube, or case, \\( ab \\); (2.) a middle tube \\( cd \\); and (3.) the interior tube \\( fg \\). The middle tube \\( cd \\) is the adjuster; and is connected with the outer tube by the rack-work of teeth and pinion, as shown at \\( e \\): by which means it is moved up and down at pleasure through the smallest space, and carries with it the internal tube \\( fg \\). The interior tube \\( fg \\) receives on its lower part at \\( b \\) the several capsules or boxes 2, 3, 4, 5, (fig. 16.) which contain the object lenses or magnifiers.\n\nThe method of using this compound microscope in the perpendicular position, is as follows: The stage No. 1. is put within the exterior tube at \\( b \\). Under the springs are applied the four ivory sliders, which contain a variety of transparent objects; then move the interior tube \\( fg \\) up and down with the hand, till you discern the object in the slider, and there let it rest. After this, turn the pinion at \\( e \\) very tenderly one way or the other, till you obtain a perfect view of the transparent objects properly illuminated, from a mirror contained in the pedestal or stand \\( k \\), suspended upon, and moveable about, the points of two screws (\\( H \\)). No. 6. (fig. 16.) represents a moveable stage, which is placed in the spring socket \\( m \\). It contains a concave glass, for the reception of animals in fluids; and has the advantage of bringing any part into view by moving the handle at \\( n \\). If living and moving objects are required to be shown, they must be confined in the concave, by putting a glass cover, No. 7., upon the stage; and then a small spider, a louse, a flea, bug, &c. may be seen, and the motion or circulation of the blood, &c. observed with surprising distinctness.\n\nTo view the circulation of the blood in the most eminent degree, it must be done by placing small frogs, tadpoles, water-newts, fishes, &c. in a tube as represented No. 8. (fig. 17.); which tube is placed in the holes \\( o \\) in the opposite sides of the case \\( ab \\), fig. 15., in the lower part.—No. 9. (fig. 16.) is a pair of pincers or pliers \\( d \\), for holding any object; the other end of the steel wire is pointed to receive a piece of ivory \\( b \\), with one end black, and the other white, on which you stick objects of different hue: this also, when used, is placed in the spring socket \\( m \\).\n\nTo use this instrument as a compound opaque, you screw off the body part \\( ab \\), and screw to it the handle \\( r \\) (fig. 16.); by this means you may hold the microscope in a horizontal position, as shown in the figure. The silver dish or speculum (which is contained in the bottom or base \\( k \\), fig. 15.), is then screwed on at \\( b \\). No. 9. is placed in the spring socket \\( m \\), and adjusted backward and forward in \\( m \\), till the reflected light from the speculum falls in a proper manner on the opaque object. Either of the 4 magnifiers, 2, 3, 4, 5, may be used, and brought to a proper focus, as before described by the tooth and pinion \\( e \\) (fig. 15.). If you take off the opaque apparatus, and apply the stage No. 1. (fig. 16.) with an ivory slider, and at the end \\( b \\) screw in either of the two lenses, No. 10. (which are distinguished by the name of illuminators), the microscope being held up to the light (and properly adjusted), the whole field of view will be strongly illuminated, and present a most pleasing appearance of any transparent object. These two convex lenses are of different focuses, and are to be used singly or together; No. 2. being the greatest magnifier, will require the object to be strongly illuminated, and of course both the lenses must be used together. By candle-light, this method of viewing transparent objects will prove very entertaining; by screwing the handle \\( r \\) into the part \\( s \\) of No. 10. it becomes a delightful hand megalocope for viewing flowers, fossils, shells, &c.; and each lens, as before mentioned, having a different focus, produces two magnifying powers used singly, and when combined a third.\n\nThe manner of using this instrument as a single microscope (like Wilson's) is represented in fig. 17. where the button or magnifier at each is to be screwed off, and the circular piece No. 11. is screwed in its place. This piece has a spring socket made to receive the slider-holder No. 12. No. 13. is a circular piece of brass, with a long flank and spring, and is introduced through the outside tube \\( ab \\) at \\( t \\). No. 2, 3, 4, 5, are screwed occasionally in the centre of this piece, and used as single lenses with ivory sliders, &c. No. 14. contains a lens of a great magnifying power, for viewing very minute objects: to render this instrument the most complete single opaque microscope, you have only to screw into No. 13.\nMicroscope, the silver speculum No. 15, which has a small lens set in its centre. The slider-holder No. 12, is taken out of No. 11, and the pincers or nippers db, being detached from the other part of No. 9, are passed through the long spring socket No. 11, and ready to receive any opaque body in the pincers, or on the black and white piece of ivory. To the large screw of No. 13, are applied the two lenses No. 10, which make it the complete megalocope that can be desired.\n\nThe handle r contains the four ivory sliders with objects.\n\nThe flaggreen case which contains this universal microscope and its apparatus, is six inches long, three inches wide, two inches deep; and weighs together 16 ounces. \"Thus (says Mr Martin) so small, so light, so portable, and yet so universally complete, is this pocket microscopic apparatus, that you find nothing material in the large three pillar'd microscope, the opaque microscope, Wilson's single microscope, and the aquatic microscope, all together, which you have not in this; besides some very considerable advantages in regard to the field of view, &c. which they have not (A).\"\n\nThis inventive artist having contrived a construction of the compound microscope so small as to admit of being packed in a common walking cane, thought next of introducing the same instrument into the inside of what he called his Pocket Three-brass drawer Achromatic Telescope. The same eye glasses that serve the purpose of a telescope, answer as the compound magnifier, for viewing transparent and opaque objects in a microscope.\n\nFig. 18, 19, 20, represent the telescope separated by unscrewing it at m, in order that the whole of the necessary parts in use may be exhibited. Fig. 19, represents the exterior tube, which is of mahogany, and its rims of brass. It is detached from the rest of the telescope, as not making any part of the microscope. The brass cover k l, that shuts up the object glass of the telescope, is also the box which contains the two-wheel object frames, and a small plain reflecting mirror.\n\nIn fig. 20. A is the cover taken off, by unscrewing the top part: The mirror B is taken out; and also, by unscrewing the bottom part, the two circular wheels, with the objects shown in C and D.\n\nFig. 18. is a representation of the three internal brass sliding tubes of the telescope, which form the microscopic part. The tubes are to be drawn out as shown in this figure; then, at the lower end of the large tube in the inside, is to be pulled out a short tube b c, that serves as a kind of stage to hold the wheels with objects, and support the reflecting mirror. This tube is to be partly drawn out, and turned so that the circular hole that is pierced in it may coincide with a similar hole that is cut in the exterior tube. This tube is represented as drawn out in the figure;\n\nand the mirror B placed therein, and the wheel with Microscope transparent objects. C (fig. 20.) represents the wheel with transparent objects, and D the wheel with opaque objects. They are both made of ivory; and turn round upon a centre brass pin slit upon the top, which fits upon the edge of the tube; which tube is then to be pushed up into the telescope tube, so that its lower end may rest upon the upper edge of the wheel according to its view at a fig. 18.\n\nIn viewing the objects, the second brass tube of the telescope must be pushed down, till its milled edge at top falls upon that of the exterior tube; taking care that the circular hole is duly placed to the exterior one. These circular holes are not seen in fig. 18, being suppos'd in the opposite side, where the wheel is fixed. The adjustment for the focus is now only necessary; which is obtained by pulling downwards or upwards the proper tube, till the object appear quite distinct. In viewing transparent objects, the instrument may be used in two positions; one vertical, when the light is to be reflected upon the object by the mirror; the other, by looking up directly against the light of a candle, common light, &c.; in which case the mirror must be taken away. In viewing opaque objects, the mirror is not used; but as much common light as possible must be admitted through the circular holes in the sides of the tubes.\n\nThere is a spare hole in the transparent wheel, and also one in the opaque, to receive any occasional object that is to be viewed. Any sort of object whatsoever may be viewed, by only pushing up the microscope tube into its exterior, and bringing the first eye-tube to its focal distance from the object.\n\nThe brass tubes are so contrived, that they stop when drawn out to the full length: so that by applying one hand to the outside tube, and the other to the end of the smallest tube, the telescope at once pull may be drawn out; then any of the tubes (that next to the eye is best) may be pushed in gradually, till the most distinct view of the object be obtained.\n\nThe tubes all slide through short brass spring tubes, any of which may be unscrewed from the ends of the sliding tubes by means of the milled edges which project above the tubes, taken from each other, and the springs set clear if required.\n\nIII. Of Solar Microscopes.\n\nThis instrument, in its principle, is composed of a plate tube, a looking-glass or mirror, a convex lens, and Wilson's single microscope before described. The sun's rays being reflected through the tube by means of the mirror upon the object, the image or picture of the object is thrown distinctly and beautifully upon a screen of white paper or a white linen sheet, placed at a proper distance to receive the same; and may be magnified.\n\n(A) Notwithstanding the properties that have been ascribed to the above instrument, and the praises bestowed upon it by some, which induced us to admit so minute a description; we must apprise our readers, that it has been omitted in Mr Adams's enumeration: and upon inquiry we learn, that it has fallen into neglect among the most judicious opticians, being found too imperfect to serve the purposes of science, and too complicated for the use of persons who seek only entertainment.\nMicroscope magnified to a size not to be conceived by those who have not seen it; for the farther the screen is removed, the larger will the object appear; insomuch, that a loupe may thus be magnified to the length of five or six feet, or even a great deal more; though it is more distinct when not enlarged to above half that size.\n\nThe different forms in which the Solar Microscope is constructed, are as follow.\n\nI. The old construction is represented in fig. 21. A is a square wooden frame, through which pass two long screws affixed by a couple of nuts r, r. By these it is fastened firmly to a window shutter, wherein a hole is made for its reception; the two nuts being let into the shutter, and made fast thereto. A circular hole is made in the middle of this frame to receive the piece of wood B, of a circular figure; whose edge, that projects a little beyond the frame, composes a shallow groove 2, wherein runs a catgut 3; which, by twisting round, and then crossing over a brass pulley 4, (the handle whereof 5, passes through the frame), affords an easy motion for turning round the circular piece of wood B, with all the parts affixed to it. C is a brass tube, which, screwing into the middle of the circular piece of wood, becomes a case for the uncovered brass tube D to be drawn backwards or forwards in. E is a smaller tube, of about one inch in length, cemented to the end of the larger tube D. F is another brass tube, made to slide over the above described tube E; and to the end of this the microscope must be screwed, when we come to use it. G, A convex lens, whose focus is about 12 inches, designed to collect the sun's rays, and throw them more strongly upon the object. G is a looking-glass of an oblong figure, set in a wooden frame, fastened by hinges in the circular piece of wood B, and turning about therewith by means of the above-mentioned catgut. H is a jointed wire, partly brass and partly iron; the brass part, whereof 6, which is flat, being fastened to the mirror, and the iron part 7, which is round, passing through the wooden frame, enable the observer, by putting it backwards or forwards, to elevate or depress the mirror according to the sun's altitude. There is a brass ring at the end of the jointed wire 8, whereby to manage it with the greater ease. The extremities of the catgut are fastened to a brass pin, by turning of which it may be braced up, if at any time it becomes too slack.\n\nWhen this microscope is employed, the room must be rendered as dark as possible; for on the darkness of the room, and the brightness of the sunlight, depend the sharpness and perfection of your image. Then putting the looking-glass G through the hole in your window shutter, fasten the square frame A to the shutter by its two screws and nuts r, r. This done, adjust your looking-glass to the elevation and situation of the sun, by means of the jointed wire H, together with the catgut and pulley, 3, 4. For the first of these raising or lowering the glass, and the other inclining it to either side, there results a twofold motion, which may easily be so managed as to bring the glass to a right position, that is, to make it reflect the sun's rays directly through the lens 5, upon the paper screen, and form thereon a spot of light exactly round. But though the obtaining a perfect circular spot of light upon the screen before you apply the microscope, is a certain proof that your mirror is adjusted right, that proof must not always be expected: for the sun is so low in winter, that if it shine in a direct line against the window, it cannot then afford a spot of light exactly round; but if it be on either side, a round spot may be obtained, even in December. As soon as this appears, screw the tube D into the brass collar provided for it in the middle of your wood-work, taking care not to alter your looking-glass: then screwing the magnifier you choose to employ to the end of your microscope in the usual manner, take away the lens at the other end thereof, and place a slider, containing the objects to be examined, between the thin brass plates, as in the other ways of using the microscope.\n\nThings being thus prepared, screw the body of the microscope over the small end E of the brass tube F; which slip over the small end E of the tube D, and pull out the said tube D less or more as your object is capable of enduring the sun's heat. Dead objects may be brought within about an inch of the focus of the convex lens 5; but the distance must be shortened for living creatures, or they will soon be killed.\n\nIf the light fall not exactly right, you may easily, by a gentle motion of the jointed wire and pulley, direct it through the axis of the microscopic lens. The short tube F, to which the microscope is screwed, renders it easy, by sliding it backwards or forwards on the other tube E, to bring the objects to their focal distance; which will be known by the sharpness and clearness of their appearance: they may also be turned round by the same means without being in the least disordered.\n\nThe magnifiers most useful in the solar microscope are in general, the fourth, fifth, or sixth. The screen on which the representations of the objects are thrown, is usually composed of a sheet of the largest elephant paper, strained on a frame which slides up or down, or turns about at pleasure on a round wooden pillar, after the manner of some fire screens. Larger screens may also be made of several sheets of the same paper pasted together on cloth, and let down from the ceiling with a roller like a large map.\n\n\"This microscope (says Mr Baker) is the most entertaining of any; and perhaps the most capable of making discoveries in objects that are not too opaque: as it shows them much larger than can be done any other way. There are also several conveniences attending it, which no other microscope can have: for the weakest eyes may use it without the least straining or fatigue: numbers of people together may view any object at the same time; and by pointing to the particular parts thereof, and discoursing on what lies before them, may be able better to understand one another, and more likely to find out the truth, than in other microscopes, where they must peep one after another, and perhaps see the object neither in the same light nor in the same position. Those also, who have no skill in drawing, may, by this contrivance, easily sketch out the exact figure of any object they have a mind to preserve a picture of; since they need only fasten a paper on the screen, and trace it out thereon either with a pen or pencil, as it appears before them. It is worth\nMicroscopes while of those who are desirous of taking many draughts in this way, to get a frame wherein a sheet of paper may be put in or taken out at pleasure; for if the paper be single, the image of an object will be seen almost as plainly on the back as on the fore side; and, by standing behind the screen, the shade of the hand will not obstruct the light in drawing, as it must in some degree when one stands before it.\" This construction, however, has now become rather obsolete, and is superseded by the following.\n\nII. The improved Solar Microscope, as used with the improved single Microscope, with teeth and pinion. Fig. 22. represents the whole form of the single microscope; the parts of which are as follows: ABCD the external tube; GHJK the internal moveable one; QM part of another tube within the last, at one end of which is fixed a plate of brass hollowed in the middle, for receiving the glass tubes: there is also a moveable flat plate, between which, and the fixed end of the second tube, the ivory sliders are to be placed. L, a part of the microscope, containing a wire spiral spring, keeping the tube QM with its plates firm against the fixed part IK of the second tube.\n\nEF is the small rack-work of teeth and pinion, by which the tube IG is moved gradually to or from the end AB, for adjusting the objects exactly to the focus of different lengths. NO is a brass slider, with six magnifiers; any one of which may easily be placed before the object. It is known when either of the glasses is in the centre of the eye-hole, by a small spring falling into a notch in the side of the slider, made against each of the glasses. Those parts of the apparatus, fig. 14. marked No 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22, are made use of here to this microscope. GH is a brass cell, which holds an illuminating glass for converging the sun's beams or the light of a candle strongly upon the objects. The aperture of the glass is made greater or less, by two circular pieces of brass, with holes of different sizes, that are screwed separately over the said lens. But at times, objects appear best when the microscope is held up to the common light only, without this glass. It is also taken away when the microscope is applied to the apparatus now to be described.\n\nFig. 23. represents the apparatus, with the single microscope screwed to it, which constitutes the Solar Microscope. AB is the inner moveable tube, to which the single microscope is screwed. CD is the external tube, containing a condensing convex glass at the end D, and is screwed fast into the plate EF, which is cut with teeth at its circumference, and moved by the pinion I, that is fixed with the plate GH. This plate is screwed fast again to the window-shutter, or board fitted to a convenient window of a darkened room, when the instrument is used. KL is a long frame, fixed to the circular plate EF; containing a looking-glass or mirror for reflecting the solar rays through the lens in the body of the tube D. O is a brass milled head, fastened to a worm or endless screw; which on the outside turns a small wheel, by which the reflecting mirror M is moved upwards and downwards.\n\nIn using this microscope, the square frame GH is first to be screwed to the window-shutter, and the room well darkened: which is best done by cutting a round hole of the size of the moveable plate EF, that carries the reflector, in the window-shutter or board; and, by means of two brass nuts a n, let into the shutter to receive the screws PP, when placed through the holes in the square frame GH, at the two holes QQ: which will firmly fasten the microscope to the shutter, and is easily taken away by only uncrewing the screws PP.\n\nThe white paper screen, or white cloth, to receive the images, is to be placed several feet distant from the window: which will make the representations larger in proportion to the distance. The usual distances are from 6 to 16 feet.\n\nThe frame KL, with its mirror M, is to be moved by turning the pinion I, one way or the other, till the beams of the sun's light come through the hole into the room: then, by turning of the worm at O, the mirror must be raised or depressed till the rays become perfectly horizontal, and go straight across the room to the screen. The tube CD, with its lens at D, is now to be screwed into the hole of the circular plate EF: by this glass the rays will be converged to a focus; and from thence proceed diverging to the screen, and there make a large circle of light. The single microscope, fig. 22, is to be screwed on to the end AB (fig. 23.) of the inner tube; and the slider NO, with either of the lenses marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, in the centre of the hole at the end AB. This will occasion a circle of light upon the screen much larger than before. The slider or glass-tube, with the objects to be viewed, is to be placed between the plates at IK against the small magnifier, and moved at pleasure. By shifting the tube AB in or out, you may place the object in such a part of the condensed rays as shall be sufficient to illuminate it, and not scorch or burn it; which will generally require the glass to be about one inch distant from the focus. It now remains only to adjust the object, or to bring it so near to the magnifier that its image formed upon the screen shall be the most distinct or perfect: and it is effected by gently turning the pinion F, fig. 22, a small matter one way or the other. If the object be rather large in size, the least magnifiers are generally used, and vice versa.\n\nNo 1. is the greatest magnifier, and No 6. the least, in the brass slider NO. But, if desired, single lenses of greater magnifying powers are made: and they are applied, by being screwed to the end AB, fig. 22, and the brass slider NO is then taken away.\n\nThe same object may be variously magnified, by the lenses severally applied to it; and the degree of magnifying power is easily known by this rule: As the distance of the object is to that of its image from the magnifier; so is the length or breadth of the object to that of the image.\n\nInstead of the brass sliders with the lenses NO, there is sometimes screwed a lens of a large size, and longer focal distance: the instrument is then converted into a megaloscope; and is adapted for viewing the larger kind of objects contained in large sliders, such as is represented at R. And, in the same manner, small objects of entertainment, painted upon glass like the sliders of a magic lantern, are much magnified, and represented upon the same screen.\n\nThe solar microscopes just described are capable only of magnifying transparent objects; for which pur-\nMicroscope pose the last instrument is extremely well adapted.\n\nBut as opaque objects form the most considerable part of the curious collections in the works of art as well as nature, a solar microscope for this purpose was a long time wanted.—For several years previous to 1774, Mr Martin made several essays towards the construction of such an instrument; and at last completed one about the time just mentioned, which he named,\n\nIII. The Opaque Solar Microscope. With this instrument (to use his own words) “all opaque objects, whether of the animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdom, may be exhibited in great perfection, in all their native beauty; the lights and shades, the prominences and cavities, and all the varieties of different hues, tints, and colours; heightened by reflection of the solar rays condensed upon them.—Transparent objects are also shown with greater perfection than by the common solar microscope.”\n\nFig. 24. represents the solar opaque microscope, mounted for exhibiting opaque objects.\n\nFig. 25. is the single tooth and pinion microscope, as before, which is used for showing transparent objects; the cylindrical tube Y thereof being made to fit into the tube FE of the solar microscope.\n\nABCDEF, (fig. 24.) represents the body of the solar microscope; one part thereof, ABCD, is conical; the other, CDEF, is cylindrical. The cylindrical part receives the tube G of the opaque box, or the tube Y of the single microscope. At the large end AB of the conical part, there is a lens to receive the rays from the mirror, and refract them towards the box HIKL. NOP is a brass frame; which is fixed to the moveable circular plate abc; in this frame there is a plane mirror, to reflect the solar rays on the aforementioned lens. This mirror may be moved into the most convenient position for reflecting the light, by means of the nuts Q and R. By the nut Q it may be moved from east to west; and it may be elevated or depressed by the nut R. Two screws to fasten the microscope to a window shutter. The box for opaque objects is represented at HIKL: it contains a plane mirror M, for reflecting the light which it receives from the large lens to the object, and thereby illuminating it; S is a screw to adjust this mirror, or place it at a proper angle for reflecting the light. VX, two tubes of brass, one sliding within the other, the exterior one in the box HIKL; these carry the magnifying lenses: the interior tube is sometimes taken out, and the exterior one is then used by itself. Part of this tube may be seen in the plate within the box HIKL. At H there is a brass plate, the back part of which is fixed to the hollow tube h, in which there is a spiral wire, which keeps the plate always bearing against the side H of the brass box HIKL. The sliders, with the opaque objects, pass between this plate and the side of the box; to put them there, the plate is to be drawn back by means of the nut g: i k is a door to one side of the opaque box. The foregoing pieces constitute the several parts necessary for viewing opaque objects. We shall now proceed to describe the single microscope, which is used for transparent objects: but in order to examine these, the box HIKL must be first removed, and in its place we must insert the tube Y of the single microscope that we are now going to describe.\n\nFig. 25. represents a large tooth and pinion microscope: at m, within the body of this microscope, are two thin plates, that are to be separated in order to let the ivory sliders pass between them; they are pressed together by a spiral spring, which bears up the under plate, and forces it against the upper one.\n\nThe slider S (under fig. 24.), which contains the magnifiers, fits into the hole n; and any of the magnifiers may be placed before the object, by moving the aforesaid slider: when the magnifier is at the centre of the hole P, a small spring falls into one of the notches which is on the side of the slider.\n\nUnder the plate m are placed two lenses, for enlarging the field of view on the screen: the smaller of the two is fixed in a piece of brass, and is nearest the plate m; this is to be taken out when the magnifiers, No. 4, 5, or 6, are used, or when the megalacope lens T (fig. 24.) is used; but is to be replaced for No. 1, 2, 3.\n\nThis microscope is adjusted to the focus by turning the milled nut O.\n\nTo use the solar microscope:—Make round hole in the window shutter, a little larger than the circle abc; pass the mirror NOP through this hole, and apply the square plate to the shutter; then mark with a pencil the places which correspond to the two holes through which the screw is to pass; take away the microscope, and bore two holes at the marked places, sufficiently large to let the milled screws d e pass through them.\n\nThe screws are to pass from the outside of the shutter, to go through it; and being then screwed into their respective holes in the square plate, they will, when screwed home, hold it fast against the inside of the shutter, and thus support the microscope.\n\nScrew the conical tube ABCD to the circle abc, and then slide the tube G of the opaque box into the cylindrical part CD EF of the body, if opaque objects are to be examined; but if they be transparent objects you mean to show, then place the tube Y within the tube CDEF.\n\nThe room is to be darkened as much as possible, so that no light may enter but what passes through the body of the microscope; for, on this circumstance, together with the brightness of the sunlight, the perfection and distinctness of the image in a great measure depend.\n\nWhen the microscope is to be used for opaque objects, 1. Adjust the mirror NOP, so as to receive the solar rays, by means of the two finger screws or nuts QR; the first, Q, turns the mirror to the right or left; the second, R, raises or depresses it: this you are to do till you have reflected the sun’s light through the lens at AB strongly upon a screen of white paper placed at some distance from the window, and formed thereon a round spot of light. An unexperienced observer will find it more convenient to obtain the light by forming this spot before he puts on either the opaque box or the tooth and pinion microscope.\n\nNow put in the opaque box, and place the object between the plates at H; open the door i k, and adjust the mirror M till you have illuminated the object strongly. If you cannot effect this by the screw S, you must move the screws Q, R, in order to get the light reflected strongly from the mirror NOP, or the mirror.\nMicroscope, mirror M, without which the latter cannot illuminate the object.\n\nThe object being strongly illuminated, shut the door i k, and a distinct view of the object will soon be obtained on your screen, by adjusting the tubes V X, which is effected by moving them backwards or forwards.\n\nA round spot of light cannot always be procured in northern latitudes, the altitude of the sun being often too low; neither can it be obtained when the sun is directly perpendicular to the front of the room.\n\nAs the sun is continually changing its place, it will be necessary, in order to keep his rays fall upon the object, to keep them continually directed through the axis of the instrument, by the two screws Q R.\n\nTo view transparent objects, remove the opaque box, and insert the tube Y fig. 25. in its place; put the slider S into its place at n, and the slider with the objects between the plates at m; then adjust the mirror NOP, as before directed by the screws Q R, so that the light may pass through the object; regulate the focus of the magnifier by the screw O. The most pleasing magnifiers in use are the fourth and fifth.\n\nThe size of the object may be increased or diminished, by altering the distance of the screen from the microscope: five or six feet is a convenient distance.\n\nTo examine transparent objects of a larger size, or to render the instrument what is usually called a megalo-scope, take out the slider S from its place at n, and screw the button T (fig. 24.) into the hole at P, fig. 25. and remove the glass which is under the plate at m, and regulate the light and focus agreeable to the foregoing directions.\n\nN.B. At the end of the tube G there is a lens for increasing the density of the rays, for the purpose of burning or melting any combustible or fusible substance: this lens must be removed in most cases, lest the objects should be burnt. The intensity of the light is also varied by moving this tube backwards or forwards.\n\nApparatus of the Opaque Solar Microscope.—The large square plate and mirror; the body of the microscope; the opaque box and its tube; the tooth and pinion microscope; the slider with the magnifiers; the megalo-scope magnifier; the two screws d and e; some ivory sliders; some sliders with opaque objects; a brass frame, with a bottom of soft deal to stick any object on; a brass cylinder K (fig. 31.), for confining opaque objects.\n\nIV. The Camera Obscura, or Lucernal, Microscope.\n\nThe great facility with which objects can be represented on paper or a rough glass in the camera obscura, and copies drawn from them by any person though unskilled in drawing, evidently suggested the application of the microscope to this instrument. The greatest number of experiments that appear to have been made with this view, were by Mr Martin and Mr Adams; the former of whom frequently applied the microscope to the portable camera, and with much effect and entertainment. But these instruments being found to answer only with the assistance of the sun, Mr Adams directed his experiments to the construction of an instrument of more extended utility, which could be equally employed in the day-time and by night. He accordingly succeeded so far as to produce, by candle-light, the images of objects refracted from a single magnifier upon one or two large convex lenses (of about five inches or upwards in diameter), at the end of a pyramidal shaped box, in a very pleasing and magnified appearance, so as to give opaque objects as well as transparent ones the utmost distinctness of representation; but still the light of a candle or lamp was found generally insufficient to throw the requisite degree of illumination upon the objects. The invention of what is called Argand's lamp, within these few years offered a complete remedy for this defect, by the intensity and steadiness of its light. This did not escape Mr Adams (son of the former), who immediately applied it; and who had likewise altered and improved his father's instrument, both in construction and form, as to render it altogether a different one, and far more perfect and useful.\n\nThe advantages and properties of this excellently conceived instrument are numerous and important. \"As the far greater part of the objects which surround us are opaque (says our author), and very few are sufficiently transparent to be examined by the common microscopes, an instrument that could be readily applied to the examination of opaque objects has always been a desideratum. Even in the examination of transparent objects, many of the fine and more curious portions are lost, and drowned, as it were, in the light which must be transmitted through them; while different parts of the same object appear only as dark lines or spots, because they are so opaque as not to permit any light to pass through them. These difficulties, as well as many more, are obviated in the lucernal microscope; by which opaque objects of various sizes may be seen with ease and distinctness; the beautiful colours with which most of them are adorned, are rendered more brilliant, without changing in the least the real tint of the colour; and the concave and convex parts retain also their proper form.—The facility with which all opaque objects are applied to this instrument, is another considerable advantage, and almost peculiar to itself; as the texture and configuration of the more tender parts are often hurt by previous preparation, every object may be examined by this instrument, first as opaque, and afterwards (if the texture will admit of it) as transparent.—The lucernal microscope does not in the least fatigue the eye; the object appears like nature itself, giving ease to the sight and pleasure to the mind: there is also, in the use of this instrument, no occasion to shut the eye which is not directed to the object. A further advantage peculiar to this microscope is, that by it the outlines of every object may be taken, even by those who are not accustomed to draw; while those who can draw well will receive great assistance, and execute their work with more accuracy and in less time than they would otherwise have been able to have performed it. Transparent objects as well as opaque may be copied in the same manner. The instrument may be used at any time of the day, but the best effect is by night; in which respect it has a superiority over the solar microscope, as that instrument can only be used when the sun shines.\n\nTransparent objects may be examined with the lucernal microscope in three or four different modes,\nMicroscope from a blaze of light almost too great for the eye to bear, to that which is perfectly easy to it: And by the addition of a tin lanthorn to the apparatus, may be thrown on a screen, and exhibited at one view to a large company, as by the solar microscope.\n\nWe shall now proceed to the description of the instrument and apparatus as given by Mr Adams.\n\nFig. 26. represents the improved Lucernal Microscope, mounted to view opaque objects. ABCD is a large mahogany pyramidal box, which forms the body of the microscope; it is supported firmly on the brass pillar FG, by means of the socket H and the curved piece IK.\n\nLMN is a guide for the eye, in order to direct it in the axis of the lenses; it consists of two brass tubes, one sliding within the other, and a vertical flat piece, at the top of which is the hole for the eye. The outer tube is seen at MN, the vertical piece is represented at LM. The inner tube may be pulled out, or pushed in, to adjust it to the focus of the glasses. The vertical piece may be raised or depressed, that the hole, through which the object is to be viewed, may coincide with the centre of the field of view; it is fixed by a milled screw at M, which could not be shown in this figure.\n\nAt N is a dovetail piece of brass, made to receive the dovetail at the end of the tubes MN, by which it is affixed to the wooden box ABCDE. The tubes MN may be removed from this box occasionally, for the convenience of packing it up in a less compass.\n\nOP, a small tube which carries the magnifiers.\n\nO, one of the magnifiers; it is screwed into the end of a tube, which slides within the tube P; the tube P may be unscrewed occasionally from the wooden body.\n\nQRSTVX, a long square bar, which passes through the sockets YZ, and carries the stage or frame that holds the objects; this bar may be moved backward or forward, in order to adjust it to the focus by means of the pinion which is at a.\n\nb, A handle furnished with an universal joint, for more conveniently turning the pinion. When the handle is removed, the nut (fig. 27.) may be used in its stead.\n\nde, A brass bar, to support the curved piece KI, and keep the body AB firm and steady.\n\nfg hi, The stage for opaque objects: it fits upon the bar QRST by means of the socket hi, and is brought nearer to or removed farther from the magnifying lens by turning the pinion a: the objects are placed in the front side of the stage (which cannot be seen in this figure) between four small brass plates; the edges of two of these are seen at k l. The two upper pieces of brass are moveable; they are fixed to a plate, which is acted on by a spiral spring, that presses them down, and confines the slider with the objects: this plate, and the two upper pieces of brass, are lifted up by the small nut m.\n\nAt the lower part of the stage, there is a semicircular lump of glass n, which is designed to receive the light from the lamp, fig. 29. and to collect and throw it on the concave mirror o, whence it is to be reflected on the object.\n\nThe upper part fg hi (fig. 26.) of the opaque stage takes out, that the stage for transparent objects may be inserted in its place.\n\nFig. 28. represents the stage for transparent objects; the two legs 5 and 6 fit into the top of the under part rshi of the stage for opaque objects; 7 is the part which confines or holds the sliders, and through which they are to be moved; 9 and 10 a brass tube, which contains the lenses for condensing the light, and throwing it upon the object; there is a second tube within that, marked 9 and 10, which may be placed at different distances from the object by the pin 11.\n\nWhen this stage is used as a single microscope, without any reference to the lucernal, the magnifiers or object lenses, are to be screwed into the hole 12, and to be adjusted to a proper focus by the nut 13.\n\nN.B. At the end AB (fig. 26.) of the wooden body there is a slider, which is represented as partly drawn out at A: when quite taken out, three grooves will be perceived; one of which contains a board that forms the end of the box; the next contains a frame with a grained glass; and the third, or that farthest from the end AB, two large convex lenses.\n\nFig. 29. represents one of Argand's lamps, which are the most suitable for microscopic purposes, on account of the clearness, the intensity, and the steadiness of the light. The following account of the method of managing them, with other observations, is copied from an account given by Mr Parker with those he sells.\n\nThe principle on which the lamp acts, consists in disposing the wick in thin parts, so that the air may come into contact with all the burning fuel; by which means, together with an increase of the current of air occasioned by rarefaction in the glass tube, the whole of the fuel is converted into flame.\n\nThe wicks are circular; and, the more readily to regulate the quantity of light, are fixed on a brass collar, with a wire handle, by means of which they are raised or depressed at pleasure.\n\nTo fix the wick on, a wooden mandril is contrived, which is tapered at one end, and has a groove turned at the other.\n\nThe wick has a selvage at one end, which is to be put foremost on the mandril, and moved up to the groove; then putting the groove into the collar of the wick-holder, the wick is easily pulled forward upon it.\n\nThe wick-holder and wick being put quite down in their place, the spare part of the wick should, while dry, be set alight, and suffered to burn to the edge of the tubes; this will leave it more even than by cutting, and, being black by burning, will be much easier lighted: for this reason, the black should never be quite cut off.\n\nThe lamp should be filled an hour or two before it is wanted, that the cotton may imbibe the oil and draw the better.\n\nThe lamps which have a reservoir and valve, need no other direction for filling than to do it with a proper trimming pot, carefully observing when they are full; then pulling up the valve by the point, the reservoir, being turned with the other hand, may be replaced without spilling a drop.\n\nThose lamps which fill in the front like a bird-fountain, must be reclined on the back to fill; and this should...\nMicroscope should be done gently, that the oil in the burner may return into the body when so placed and filled; if, by being too full, any oil appears above the guard, only move the lamp a little, and the oil will disappear; the lamp may then be placed erect, and the oil will flow to proper level.\n\nThe oil must be of the spermaceti kind, commonly called chamber oil, which may generally be distinguished by its paleness, transparency, and inoffensive scent; all those oils which are of a red and brown colour, and of an offensive scent, should be carefully avoided, as their glutinous parts clog the lamp, and the impurities in such oil, not being inflammable, will accumulate and remain in the form of a crust on the wick. Seal oil is nearly as pale and sweet as chamber oil; but being of a heavy flueggh quality, is not proper for lamps with fine wicks.\n\nWhenever bad oil has been used, on changing it, the wick must also be changed; because, after having imbibed the coarse particles in its capillary tubes, it will not draw up the fine oil.\n\nTo obtain the greatest degree of light, the wick should be trimmed exactly even, the flame will then be completely equal.\n\nThere will be a great advantage in keeping the lamp clean, especially the burner and air tubes; the neglect of cleanliness in lamps is too common; a candlestick is generally cleaned every time it is used, so should a lamp; and if a candlestick is not to be objected to because it does not give light after the candle is exhausted, so a lamp should not be thought ill of, if it does not give light when it wants oil or cotton: but this last has often happened, because the deficiency is less visible.\n\nThe glass tubes are best cleaned with a piece of wash leather.\n\nIf a fountain lamp is left partly filled with oil, it may be liable to overflow: this happens by the contraction of the air when cold, and its expansion by the warmth of a room, the rays of the sun, or the heat of the lamp when re-lighted: this accident may be effectually prevented by keeping the reservoir filled, the oil not being subject to expansion like air. On this account, those with a common reservoir are best adapted for microscopic purposes.\n\nTo examine Opaque Objects, with the Lucernal Microscope. To render the use of this instrument easy, it is usually packed with as many of the parts together as possible; it occupies on this account rather more room, but is much less embarrassing to the observer, who has only three parts to put on after it is taken out of its box, namely, the guide for the eye, the stage, and the tube with its magnifier.\n\nBut to be more particular: Take out the wooden slider A (fig. 26), then lift out the cover and the gray glass, from their respective grooves under the slider A.\n\nPut the end N of the guide for the eye LMN into its place, so that it may stand in the position which is represented in this figure.\n\nPlace the socket which is at the bottom of the opaque stage, on the bar QXT, so that the concave mirror o may be next the end DE of the wooden body.\n\nScrew the tubes PO into the end DE. The magnifier you intend to use is to be screwed on the end O of these tubes.\n\nThe handle G b, or the milled nut, fig. 27, must be placed on the square end of the pinion a.\n\nPlace the lamp lighted before the glass lamp n, and the object you intend to examine between the spring plates of the stage; and the instrument is ready for use.\n\nIn all microscopes there are two circumstances which must be particularly attended to: first, the modification of the light, or the proper quantity to illuminate the object; secondly, the adjustment of the instrument to the focus of the glass and eye of the observer. In the use of the lucernal microscope there is a third circumstance, which is, the regulation of the guide for the eye.\n\n1. To throw the light upon the object. The flame of the lamp is to be placed rather below the centre of the glass lump n, and as near it as possible; the concave mirror o must be so inclined and turned as to receive the light from the glass lump, and reflect it thence upon the object; the best situation of the concave mirror and the flame of the lamp depends on a combination of circumstances, which a little practice will discover.\n\n2. To regulate the guide for the eye, or to place the centre of the eye-piece L so that it may coincide with the focal point of the lenses and the axis of vision: Lengthen and shorten the tubes MN, by drawing out or pushing in the inner tube, and raising or depressing the eye-piece ML, till you find the large lens (which is placed at the end A B of the wooden body) filled by an uniform field of light, without any prismatic colours round the edge; for till this piece is properly fixed, the circle of light will be very small, and only occupy a part of the lens; the eye must be kept at the centre of the eye-piece L, during the whole of the operation; which may be rendered somewhat easier to the observer, on the first use of the instrument, if he hold a piece of white paper parallel to the large lens, removing it from or bringing it nearer to them till he find the place where a lucid circle, which he will perceive on the paper, is brightest and most distinct; then he is to fix the centre of the eye-piece to coincide with that spot; after which a very small adjustment will set it perfectly right.\n\n3. To adjust the lenses to their focal distance. This is effected by turning the pinion a, the eye being at the same time at the eye-piece L. The gray glass is often placed before the large lenses, while regulating the guide for the eye, and adjusting for the focal distance.\n\nIf the observer, in the process of his examination of an object, advance rapidly from a shallow to a deep magnifier, he will save himself some labour by pulling out the internal tube at O.\n\nThe upper part f g r s of the stage is to be raised or lowered occasionally, in order to make the centre of the object coincide with the centre of the lens at O.\n\nTo delineate objects, the gray glass must be placed before the large lenses; the picture of the object will be formed on this glass, and the outline may be accurately taken by going over the picture with a pencil.\nMicroscope. The opaque part may be used in the daytime without a lamp, provided the large lenses at AB are screened from the light.\n\nTo use the Lucernal Microscope in the examination of Transparent Objects.—The instrument is to remain as before: the upper part fgs of the opaque stage must be removed, and the stage for transparent objects, represented at fig. 28, put in its place; the end 910 to be next the lamp.\n\nPlace the grayed glass in its groove at the end AB, and the objects in the slider-holder at the front of the stage; then transmit as strong a light as you are able on the object, which you will easily do by raising or lowering the lamp.\n\nThe object will be beautifully depicted on the gray glass: it must be regulated to the focus of the magnifier, by turning the pinion a.\n\nThe object may be viewed either with or without the guide for the eye. A single observer will see an object to the greatest advantage by using this guide, which is to be adjusted as we have described above. If two or three wish to examine the object at the same time, the guide for the eye must be laid aside.\n\nTake the large lens out of the groove, and receive the image on the gray glass; in this case, the guide for the eye is of no use: if the gray glass be taken away, the image of the object may be received on a paper screen.\n\nTake out the gray glass, replace the large lenses, and use the guide for the eye; attend to the foregoing directions, and adjust the object to its proper focus. You will then see the object in a blaze of light almost too great for the eye, a circumstance that will be found very useful in the examination of particular objects. The edges of the object in this mode will be somewhat coloured: but as it is only used in this full light for occasional purposes, it has been thought better to leave this small imperfection, than, by remedying it, to sacrifice greater advantages; the more so, as this fault is easily corrected, a new and interesting view of the object is obtained, by turning the instrument out of the direct rays of light, and permitting them to pass through only in an oblique direction, by which the upper surface is in some degree illuminated, and the object is seen partly as opaque, partly as transparent. It has been already observed, that the transparent objects might be placed between the slider-holders of the stage for opaque objects, and then be examined as if opaque.\n\nSome transparent objects appear to the greatest advantage when the lens at 910 is taken away; as, by giving too great a quantity of light, it renders the edges less sharp.\n\nThe variety of views which may be taken of every object by means of the improved lucernal microscope, will be found to be of great use to an accurate observer: it will give him an opportunity of correcting or confirming his discoveries, and investigating those parts in one mode which are invisible in another.\n\nTo throw the image of transparent objects on a screen as in the solar microscope. It has been long a microscopical desideratum, to have an instrument by which the image of transparent objects might be thrown on a screen, as in the common solar microscope: and this not only because the sun is so uncertain in this climate, and the use of the solar microscope requires confinement in the finest part of the day, when time seldom hangs heavy on the mind; but as it also affords an increase of pleasure, by displaying its wonders to several persons at the same instant, without the least fatigue to the eye.\n\nThis purpose is now effectually answered, by affixing the transparent stage of the lucernal to a lanthorn, with one of Argand's lamps.—The lamp is placed within the lanthorn, and the end 910 of the transparent stage is screwed into a female screw, which is riveted in the sliding part of the front of the lanthorn; the magnifying lenses are to be screwed into the hole represented at 12, and they are adjusted by turning the milled nut. The quantity of light is to be regulated by raising and lowering the sliding-plate or the lamp.\n\nApparatus which usually accompanies the improved Lucernal Microscope.—The stage for opaque objects, with its semicircular lump of glass, and concave mirror. The stage for transparent objects, which fits on the upper part of the foregoing stage. The sliding tube, to which the magnifiers are to be affixed; one end of thefe is to be screwed on the end D of the wooden body; the magnifier in use is to be screwed to the other end of the inner tube. Eight magnifying lenses; these are so constructed that they may be combined together, and thus produce a very great variety of magnifying powers. A fish-pan, such as is represented at I. A steel wire L, with a pair of nippers at one end, and a small cylinder of ivory J at the other. A slider of brass N, containing a flat glass slider, and a brass slider into which are fitted some small concave glasses. A pair of forceps. Six large and six small ivory sliders, with transparent objects. Fourteen wooden sliders, with four opaque objects in each slider; and two spare sliders. Some capillary tubes for viewing small animalcula.\n\nIngenious men seldom content themselves with an instrument under one form; hence such a variety of microscopes, hence many alterations in the Lucernal Microscope. Mr Adams himself, we understand, has fitted up this last in a great many different ways; and it is reasonable to think that no person is more likely to give it every improvement of which it is susceptible. Of the alterations by other hands we shall only particularize one, made by Mr Jones of Holborn (B), whose description is as follows:\n\nA represents a portion of the top of the mahogany box.\nMicroscope box in which it packs, to preserve it steady; it slides in a dove-tail groove withinside, a similar groove to which is cut in the top of the box A; so that when the instrument is to be used, it is slided out of the box withinside, and then slid into the groove at top ready for use, almost instantly, as shown in the figure. The adjustment of the objects is at the stage B; for the right focal distance is readily and conveniently made by turning the long screw-rod BB, which goes through the two pillars supporting the box, and works in the base of the brass stage E; which base is also dovetailed, so as to have a regular and steady motion in another brass basis that supports it. In this instrument, therefore, the pyramidal box does not move; but the stage part only, which, from its small weight, moves in the most agreeable and steady manner. While observing the image of the object upon the glass through the sight-hole at G, the object may be moved or changed by only turning the rack-work and pinion applied to the stage by means of the handle D, for that purpose. By this contrivance you have no occasion to change your position during the view of the objects upon one of the slides. This motion changes the objects horizontally only; and as they are generally placed exactly in one line, it answers all the purposes for which this motion is intended very well. But it may sometimes happen that the observer would wish to alter the vertical position of the object; to perform which there is another plane rod at F, that acts simply as a lever for this purpose, and moves the sliding part of the stage E vertically either upwards or downwards.\n\nThus, without altering his position, the observer may investigate all parts of the objects in the most satisfactory manner. Rack-work and pinion might be applied to the stage for the vertical motion also; but as it would materially enhance the expense, it is seldom applied. The brass work at the handle of D contains a Hooke's universal joint.\n\nThe brilliancy of the images of the objects shown upon the large lenses at the end of the box, being very frequently so great as to dazzle the eyes, Mr Jones applies a slight tinge of blue, green, and other coloured glasses, to the sight-hole at G, which softens this glare, and casts an agreeable hue upon the objects.\n\nDescription of those Parts of a Microscopical Apparatus, common to most Instruments, which are delineated at fig. 31.\n\nA and B represent the brass cells which contain the magnifiers belonging to the different kinds of compound microscopes. The magnifiers are sometimes contained in a slide like that which is delineated at S (fig. 24.) The lenses of A and B are confined by a small cap; on unscrewing this, the small lens may be taken out and cleaned. The magnifiers A of the lucernal microscope are so contrived, that any two of them may be screwed together, by which means a considerable variety of magnifying powers is obtained.\n\nTo get at the lenses in the slider S (fig. 24.) take out the two screws which hold on the cover.\n\nC represents the general form of the slider-holder. It consists of a cylindrical tube, in which an inner tube is forced up by a spring. It is used to receive the ivory or any other slider, in which the transparent objects are placed; these are to be slid between the two upper plates: the hollow part in one of the plates is designed for the glass tubes.\n\nD, the condensing lens and its tube, which fits into the slider-holder C, and may be moved up and down in it. When this piece is pushed up as far as it will go, it condenses the light of a candle, which is reflected on it by the plain mirror of the compound microscope, and spreads it uniformly over the object; in this case it is best adapted to the shallowest magnifiers. If the deeper lenses are used, it should be drawn down, or rather removed further from the object, that it may concentrate the light in a small compass, and thus render it more dense. The condensing lens is sometimes fitted up differently; but the principle being the same, it will be easy to apply it to use notwithstanding some variations in the mechanism.\n\nE, a brass cone. It fixes under the slider-holder, and is used to lessen occasionally the quantity of light which comes from the mirror to any object.\n\nF, a box with two flat glasses, which may be placed at different distances from each other in order to confine a small living insect.\n\nG, a small brass box to hold the silver speculum H.\n\nH, a small silver concave speculum, designed to reflect the light from the mirror on opaque objects; it should only be used with the shallow magnifiers. It is applied in different ways to the compound microscope; sometimes to a tube similar to that represented at X, which slides on the lower part of the body; sometimes it is screwed into the ring of the piece Q; the pin of this generally fits into one of the holes in the stage. When this speculum is used, the slider-holder should be removed.\n\nI, a fish-pan, wherein a small fish may be fastened, in order to view the circulation of the blood: its tail is to be spread across the oblong hole at the smallest end, and tied fast by means of the ribbon fixed thereto, by flowing the knob which is on the back of it through the slit made in the stage; the tail of the fish may be brought under the lens which is in use.\n\nK, a cylindrical piece, intended for the solar opaque microscope; by pulling back the spiral spring, smaller or larger objects may be confined in it.\n\nL, A pair of triangular nippers for taking hold of and confining a large object.\n\nM, a long steel wire, with a small pair of pliers at one end and a steel point at the other: the wire slips backwards or forwards in a spring tube, which is affixed to a joint, at the bottom of which is a pin to fit one\nMicrometers\n\nOne of the holes in the stage; this piece is used to confine small objects.\n\nA small ivory cylinder that fits on the pointed end of the steel wire L; it is designed to receive opaque objects. Light-colored ones are to be stuck on the dark side, and vice versa.\n\nM, a convex lens, which fits to the stage by means of the long pin adhering to it. This piece is designed to collect the light from the sun or a candle, and to throw them on any object placed on the stage; but it is very little used at present.\n\nN, a brass slider, into which is fitted a flat piece of glass, and a brass slider containing four small glasses, one or two of them concave, the others flat; it is designed to confine small living objects, and when used is to be placed between the two upper plates of the slider-holder.\n\nO, a glass tube to receive a small fish, &c.\n\nP, represents one of the ivory sliders, wherein objects are placed between two pieces of talc, and confined by a brass ring.\n\nQ, a piece to hold the speculum H; this piece is generally fitted to the microscope represented at fig. 12.\n\nR, a pair of forceps, to take up any occasional object.\n\nS, a camel's hair pencil to brush the dust off the glasses; the upper part of the quill is scooped out, to take up a drop of any fluid, and place it on either of the glasses for examination.\n\nT, an instrument for cutting thin transverse sections of wood. It consists of a wooden base, which supports four brass pillars; on the top of the pillars is placed a flat piece of brass, near the middle of which there is a triangular hole.\n\nA sharp knife, which moves in a diagonal direction, is fixed on the upper side of the aforementioned plate, and in such a manner that the edge always coincides with the surface thereof.\n\nThe knife is moved backwards and forwards by means of the handle a. The piece of wood is placed in the triangular trough which is under the brass plate, and is to be kept steady therein by a milled screw which is fitted to the trough; the wood is to be pressed forward for cutting by the micrometer screw b.\n\nThe pieces of wood should be applied to this instrument immediately on being taken out of the ground, or else they should be soaked for some time in water, to soften them so that they may not hurt the edge of the knife.\n\nWhen the edge of the knife is brought in contact with the piece of wood, a small quantity of spirits of wine should be poured on the surface of the wood, to prevent its curling up; it will also make it adhere to the knife, from which it may be removed by pressing a piece of blotting paper on it.\n\ny, An appendage to the cutting engine, which is to be used instead of the micrometer screw, being preferred to it by some. It is placed over the triangular hole, and kept flat down upon the surface of the brass plate, while the piece of wood is pressed against a circular piece of brass which is on the under side of it. This circular piece of brass is fixed to a screw, by which its distance from the flat plate on which the knife moves may be regulated.\n\nz, An ivory box, containing at one end spare talemicope for the ivory sliders, and at the other spare rings for pressing the tales together and confining them to the slider.\n\nFluid microscopes have been also proposed; the first, it would appear, was suggested by Mr Grey. This was formed of water, and an account of it will be found in No. 221, 223, Phil. Trans. An improved microscope, on a similar principle, has been invented by Mr Brewster, of which the following is a description, taken from a note by the translator of Haüy's Natural Philosophy.\n\n\"A vertical bar\" (says Mr Gregory), \"is fixed upon a horizontal pedestal; and from the top of this bar proceeds a horizontal arm, which supports a circular case containing the lenses; below this another horizontal arm slides up and down, capable of adjustment by means of a screw, and carrying the usual sliders to hold the object which it is proposed to examine; and upon the pedestal is fixed the frame of a mirror, which has both an inclined and a horizontal motion, in order to illuminate any object upon the slider. The upper circular case is hollow, and contains four or more plano-convex lenses, which are constituted each of a drop of very pure and viscous turpentine varnish, taken up by the point of a piece of wood, and dropped upon a piece of very thin and well polished glass. The lenses thus formed may be made of any focal length by taking up a greater or a less quantity of fluid. The lower surface of the glass having been first smoked with a candle, the black pigment immediately below the lenses is then to be removed, so that no light may pass but through the lenses. The piece of glass is then perforated at its centre, and surrounded by a toothed wheel, which, when the wheel is put in the upper circular case, may be turned by a common endless screw, so that the fluid lenses shall be brought severally under an eye-aperture properly disposed, and any object be successfully examined with a variety of magnifying powers.\" Note, p. 365. See also Ferguson's Lectures by Brewster, vol. ii.\n\nAfter what has been related of microscopes, they cannot be said to be complete without the valuable addition of a micrometer; for the use and advantages of which, see the article Micrometer.\n\nHaving presented our readers with descriptions of the various microscopes generally used, we think it our duty to point out to them those which we conceive to be best calculated to answer the purposes of science. The first which presents itself to our mind is that of Ellis: It is better adapted than any other portable microscope, to the purpose of general observation; simple in its construction, and general in its application. To those who prefer a double microscope, we should recommend that figured in Plate CCCXXXVIII. fig. 12. If opaque objects, as insects, &c., be subjects of investigation, the Lucernal Microscope claims the preference; but if amusement alone guides the choice, the Solar Microscope must be fixed upon.\n\nWe shall now proceed to explain some necessary particulars respecting the method of using microscopes; after which, we shall subjoin an enumeration of the principal\nMicroscope cipal objects discovered or elucidated by their means.\n\nOn this subject Mr Adams, in his Essay on the Microscope, has been very copious; with a view, as he informs us, to remove the common complaint made by Mr Baker, \"that many of those who purchase microscopes are so little acquainted with their general and extensive usefulness, and so much at a loss for objects to examine by them, that after diverting their friends some few times with what they find in the slides which generally accompany the instrument, or perhaps with two or three common objects, the microscope is laid aside as of little further value; whereas no instrument has yet appeared in the world capable of affording so constant, various, and satisfactory an entertainment to the mind.\"\n\n1. In using the microscope, there are three things necessary to be considered. (1.) The preparation and adjustment of the instrument itself. (2.) The proper quantity of light, and the best method of directing it to the object. (3.) The method of preparing the objects, so that their texture may be properly understood.\n\n1. With regard to the microscope itself, the first thing necessary to be examined is, whether the glasses be clean or not: if they are not so, they must be wiped with a piece of soft leather, taking care not to soil them afterwards with the fingers; and, in replacing them, care must be taken not to place them in an oblique situation. We must likewise be careful not to let the breath fall upon the glasses, nor to hold that part of the body of the instrument where the glasses are placed with a warm hand; because thus the moisture expelled by the heat from the metal will condense upon the glass, and prevent the object from being distinctly seen. The object should be brought as near the centre of the field of view as possible; for there only it will be exhibited in the greatest perfection. The eye should be moved up and down from the eye-glass, of a compound microscope, till the situation is found where the largest field and most distinct view of the object are to be had: but every person ought to adjust the microscope to his own eye, and not to depend upon the situation it was placed in by another. A small magnifying power should always be begun with; by which means the observer will best obtain an exact idea of the situation and connexion of the whole; and will of consequence be less liable to form any erroneous opinion when the parts are viewed separately by a lens of greater power. Objects should also be examined first in their most natural position; for if this be not attended to, we shall be apt to form very inadequate ideas of the structure of the whole, as well as of the connexion and use of the parts. A living animal ought to be as little hurt or discomposed as possible.\n\nFrom viewing an object properly, we may acquire a knowledge of its nature: but this cannot be done without an extensive knowledge of the subject, much patience, and many experiments; as in a great number of cases the images will resemble each other, though derived from very different substances. Mr Baker therefore advises us not to form an opinion too suddenly after viewing a microscopical object; nor to draw our inferences till after repeated experiments and examinations of the object in many different lights and positions; to pass no judgement upon things extended by force, or contracted by dryness, or in any manner out of a natural state, without making suitable allowances. The true colour of objects cannot be properly determined by very great magnifiers; for as the pores and interfaces of an object are enlarged according to the magnifying power of the glasses made use of, the component particles of its substance will appear separated many thousand times farther asunder than they do to the naked eye: hence the reflection of the light from these particles will be very different, and exhibit different colours. It is likewise somewhat difficult to observe opaque objects; and as the apertures of the larger magnifiers are but small, they are not proper for the purpose. If an object be so very opaque, that no light will pass through it, as much as possible must be thrown upon the upper surface of it. Some consideration is likewise necessary in forming a judgment of the motion of living creatures, or even of fluids, when seen through the microscope; for as the moving body, and the space wherein it moves, are magnified, the motion will also be increased.\n\n2. On the management of the light depends in a great measure the distinctness of the vision; and as, in order to have this in the greatest perfection, we must adapt the quantity of light to the nature of the object and the focus of the magnifier, it is therefore necessary to view it in various degrees of light. In some objects, it is difficult to distinguish between a prominence and a depression, a shadow or a black stain: or between a reflection of light and whiteness, which is particularly observable in the eye of the libellula and other flies: all of these appearing very different in one position from what they do in another. The brightness of an object likewise depends on the quantity of light, the distinctness of vision, and on regulating the quantity to the object; for some will be in a manner lost in a quantity of light scarcely sufficient to render another visible.\n\nThere are various ways in which a strong light may be thrown upon objects; as by means of the sun and a convex lens. For this purpose, the microscope is to be placed about three feet from a southern window; then take a deep convex lens, mounted on a semicircle and stand, so that its position may easily be varied: place this lens between the object and the window, so that it may collect a considerable number of solar rays, and refract them on the object or the mirror of the microscope. If the light thus collected from the sun be too powerful, it may be lessened by placing a piece of oiled paper, or a piece of glass lightly grated, between the object and lens. Thus a proper degree of light may be obtained, and diffused equally all over the surface of an object: a circumstance which ought to be particularly attended to; for if the light be thrown irregularly upon it, no distinct view can be obtained. If we mean to make use of the solar light, it will be found convenient to darken the room, and to reflect the rays of the sun on the above-mentioned lens by means of the mirror of a solar microscope fixed to the window-flutter: for thus the observer will be enabled to preserve the light on his subject, notwithstanding the motion of the sun. But by reason of this motion, and the variable state of the atmosphere, solar observations are rendered both tedious and inconvenient; whence it will be proper for the observer to\nMicroscope be furnished with a large tin lanthorn, formed something like the common magic lanthorn, capable of containing one of Argand's lamps. This, however, ought not to be of the fountain kind, left the rarefaction of the air in the lanthorn should force the oil over. There ought to be an aperture in the front of the lanthorn, which may be moved up and down, and be capable of holding a lens; by which means a pleasant and uniform as well as strong light may easily be procured. The lamp should likewise move on a rod, so that it may be easily raised or depressed. This lanthorn may likewise be used for many other purposes; as viewing of pictures, exhibiting microscopic objects on a screen, &c. A weak light, however, is best for viewing many transparent objects; among which we may reckon the prepared eyes of flies, as well as the animacules in fluids. The quantity of light from a lamp or candle may be lessened by removing the microscope to a greater distance from them, or by diminishing the strength of the light which falls upon the objects. This may very conveniently be done by pieces of black paper with circular apertures of different sizes, and placing a larger or smaller one upon the reflecting mirror, as occasion may require. There is an oblique situation of the mirrors, which makes likewise an oblique reflection of the light easily discovered by practice, (but for which no general rule can be given in theory); and which will exhibit an object more distinctly than any other position, showing the surface, as well as those parts through which the light is transmitted. The light of a lamp or candle is generally better for viewing microscopic objects than day light; it being more easy to modify the former than the latter, and to throw it upon the objects with different degrees of density.\n\n3. Swammerdam has excelled in the preparation of objects almost all other investigators. Neither difficulty nor disappointment could make him abandon the pursuit of any object until he had obtained a satisfactory idea of it. But unhappily the methods he used in preparing his objects for the microscope are now entirely unknown. Boerhaave examined with the strictest attention all the letters and manuscripts of Swammerdam which he could find; but his researches were far from being successful. The following are all the particulars, which have thus come to the knowledge of the public.\n\nFor dissecting small insects, Swammerdam had a brass table made by S. Mulchenbroek, to which were affixed two brass arms moveable at pleasure to any part of it. The upper part of these vertical arms was constructed in such a manner as to have a slow vertical motion; by which means the operator could readily alter their height as he saw convenient. One of these arms was to hold the minute objects, and the other to apply the microscope.\n\nThe lenses of Swammerdam's microscopes were of various sizes as well as foci; but all of them the best that could be procured, both for the transparency of the glass and the fineness of the workmanship. His observations were always begun with the smallest magnifiers, from which he proceeded to the greatest; but in the use of them, he was so exceedingly dexterous, that he made every observation subservient to that which succeeded it, and all of them to the confirmation of each other, and to the completing of the description. Microscope.\n\nHis chief art seems to have been in constructing filaments of an exquisite fineness, and making them very sharp. Thus he was enabled to cut very minute objects to much more advantage than could be done by knives and lancets; for these, though ever so sharp and fine, are apt to disorder delicate substances by displacing some of the filaments, and drawing them after them as they pass through the bodies; but the scissors cut them all equally. The knives, lancets, and styles he made use of in his dissections, were so fine that he could not see to sharpen them without the assistance of a magnifying glass; but with these he could dissect the intestines of bees with the same accuracy that the best anatomists can do those of large animals. He made use also of very small glass tubes no thicker than a brittle, and drawn to a very fine point at one end, but thicker at the other. These were for the purpose of blowing up, and thus rendering visible the smallest vessels which could be discovered by the microscope; to trace their courses and communications, or sometimes to inject them with coloured liquids.\n\nSwammerdam sometimes made use of spirit of wine, water, or oil of turpentine, for suffocating the insects he wished to examine; and would preserve them for a time in these liquids. Thus he kept the parts from putrefying, and gave them besides such additional strength and firmness, as rendered the dissections much more easy than they would otherwise have been. Having then divided the body transversely with the scissors, and made what observations he could without farther dissection, he proceeded to extract the intestines carefully with very fine instruments, to wash away the fat in the like careful manner; and thus to put the parts into such a state as would best expose them to view; but these operations are best performed while the insects are in their nymphal state.\n\nSometimes the delicate viscera of the insects, after having been suffocated as above mentioned, were put into water; after which, having shaken them gently, he procured an opportunity of examining them, especially the air vessels, which last he could thus separate entire from all the other parts, to the admiration of all who beheld them: as these vessels cannot be distinctly seen in any other manner, or indeed in any way whatever, without injuring them. Frequently also he injected water with a syringe to cleanse the parts thoroughly, after which he blew them up with air and dried them; thus rendering them durable, and fit for examination at a proper opportunity. Sometimes he made very important discoveries, by examining insects which he had preserved for several years in balsams. Other insects he punctured with a very fine needle; and after squeezing out all their moisture through the holes made in this manner, he filled them with air, by means of very slender glass tubes; then dried them in the shade; and lastly, anointed them with oil of spike in which a little rosin had been dissolved; and by which means they for a long time retained their proper forms. He was likewise in possession of a singular secret, by which he could preserve the limbs of insects as limber and peripious as ever they had been. He used to make a small puncture or incision in the tails of worms;\nand after having with great caution squeezed out all the humours, as well as great part of the viscera, he injected them with wax in such a manner as to give them the appearance of living creatures in perfect health. He found that the fat of all insects was entirely dissolvable in oil of turpentine; by which means he was enabled plainly to discern the viscera; though, after this dissolution, it was necessary to cleanse and wash them frequently in clean water. In this manner he would frequently have spent whole days in the preparation of a single caterpillar, and cleansing it from its fat, in order to discover the true situation of the insect's heart. He had a singular dexterity in stripping off the skins of caterpillars that were on the point of spinning their cones. This was done by letting them drop by their threads into scalding water, and then suddenly withdrawing them. Thus the epidermis peeled off very easily; and, when this was done, he put them into distilled vinegar and spirit of wine mixed together in equal proportions; which, by giving a due degree of firmness to the parts, gave him an opportunity of separating them with very little trouble from the exuviae, without any danger to the internal parts. Thus the nymph could be shown to be wrapped up in the caterpillar and the butterfly in the nympha; and there is little doubt that those who look into the works of Swammerdam, will be amply recompensed, whether they consider the unexampled labour or the piety of the author.\n\nM. Lyonet, an eminent naturalist, usually drowned the insects he designed to examine; by which means he was enabled to preserve both the softness and transparency of the parts. According to him, the insect, if very small, viz. one tenth of an inch, or little more, in length, should be dissected on a glass somewhat concave. If it should be suspected that the insect will putrefy by keeping for a few days, spirit of wine diluted with water must be substituted instead of pure water. The insect must be suffered to dry; after which it may be fastened by a piece of soft wax, and again covered with water.—Larger objects should be placed in a trough of thin wood; and for this purpose the bottom of a common chip box will answer very well; only surrounding the edge of it with soft wax, to keep in the water or other fluid employed in preserving the insect. The body is then to be opened; and if the parts are soft like those of a caterpillar, they should be turned back, and fixed to the trough by small pins, which ought to be set by a small pair of nippers. At the same time, the skin being stretched by another pair of finer forceps, the insect must be put into water, and dissected therein, occasionally covering it with spirit of wine. Thus the subject will be preserved in perfection, so that its parts may be gradually unfolded, no other change being perceived than that the soft elastic parts become stiff and opaque, while some others lose their colour.\n\nThe following instruments were made use of by M. Lyonet in his dissection of the Chenille de Saule. A pair of scissors as small as could be made, with long and fine arms: A pair of forceps, with their ends so nicely adjusted, that they could easily lay hold of a spider's thread, or a grain of sand: Two fine steel needles fixed in wooden handles, about two inches and three quarters in length; which were the most generally useful instruments he employed.\n\nDr. Hooke, who likewise made many microscopic observations, takes notice, that the common ant or pismire is much more troublesome to draw than other insects, as it is extremely difficult to get the body in a quiet natural posture. If its feet be fettered with wax or glue, while the animal remains alive, it so twirls its body, that there is no possibility of gaining a proper view of it; and if it be killed before any observation is made, the shape is often spoiled before it can be examined. The bodies of many minute insects, when their life is destroyed, instantly shrivel up; and this is observable even in plants as well as insects, the surface of the small bodies being affected by the least change of air; which is particularly the case with the ant. If this creature, however, be dropped into rectified spirit of wine, it will instantly be killed; and when it is taken out, the spirit of wine evaporates, leaving the animal dry, and in its natural posture, or at least in such a state, that it may easily be placed in whatever posture we please.\n\nParts of Insects. The wings, in many insects, are so transparent, that they require no previous preparation; but some of those that are folded under elytra or cases, require a considerable share of dexterity to unfold them; for these wings are naturally endowed with such a spring, that they immediately fold themselves again, unless care be taken to prevent them. The wing of the earwig, when expanded, is of a tolerable size, yet is folded up under a case not one eighth part of its bulk; and the texture of this wing renders it difficult to be unfolded. This is done with the least trouble immediately after the insect is killed. Holding then the creature by the thorax, between the finger and the thumb, with a blunt-pointed pin endeavour gently to open it, by spreading it over the forefinger, and at the same time gradually sliding the thumb over it. When the wing is sufficiently expanded, separate it from the insect by a sharp knife or a pair of scissors. The wing should be pressed for some time between the thumb and finger before it be removed; it should then be placed between two pieces of paper, and again pressed for at least an hour; after which time, as there will be no danger of its folding up any more, it may be put between the tales, and applied to the microscope. Similar care is requisite in displaying the wings of the notonecta and other water insects, as well as most kinds of grylly.\n\nThe minute scales or feathers, which cover the wings of moths or butterflies, afford very beautiful objects for the microscope. Those from one part of the wing frequently differ in shape from such as are taken from other parts; and near the thorax, shoulder, and on the fringes of the wings, we generally meet with hair instead of scales. The whole may be brushed off the wing, upon a piece of paper, by means of a camel's hair pencil; after which the hairs can be separated with the assistance of a common magnifying glass.\n\nIt is likewise a matter of considerable difficulty to dissect properly the protocoe of insects, such as the gnat, tabanus, &c., and the experiment must be repeated a great number of times before the structure and situation\nMicroscope. tuation of the parts can be thoroughly investigated, as\nthe observer will frequently discover in one what he\ncould not in another. The collector of the bee, which\nforms a very curious object, ought to be first carefully\nwashed in spirit of turpentine; by which means it will\nbe freed from the unctuous matter adhering to it:\nwhen dry, it is again to be washed with a camel's hair\npencil to disengage and bring forward the small hairs\nwhich form part of this microscopic beauty. The\nbest method of managing the wings of insects, which\nare in danger of being broken by reason of their hard-\nness, is to soak the case and the rest of the apparatus for\nsome time in spirit of wine or turpentine; then lay\nthem on a piece of paper, and with a blunt knife draw\nout the wing, holding the sheath with the nail of the\nfinger or any blunt instrument; but great care is neces-\nsary to preserve the feelers, which when cleaned add\nmuch to the beauty of the object. The beard of the\nlepus anaticeps is to be soaked in clean soft water, fre-\nquently brushing it while wet with a camel's hair\npencil: after it is dried, the brushing must be repeated\nwith a dry pencil to disengage and separate the hairs,\nwhich are apt to adhere together.\n\nTo view to advantage the fat, brains, and other simi-\nlar substances, Dr Hooke advises to render the sur-\nface smooth, by pressing it between two plates of thin\nglass, by which means the matter will be rendered\nmuch thinner and more transparent; without this pre-\ncaution, it appears confused, by reason of the parts\nlying too thick upon one another. For muscular fibres,\ntake a piece of the flesh, thin and dry; moisten it with\nwarm water, and after this is evaporated the vessels\nwill appear more plain and distinct; and by repeated\nmacerations they appear still more so. The exuviae of\ninsects afford a pleasing object, and require but little\npreparation. If bent or curled up, they will become so\nrelaxed by being kept a few hours in a moist atmosphere,\nthat you may easily extend them to their natural po-\nsitions; or the steam of warm water will answer the\npurpose very well.\n\nThe eyes of insects in general form very curious\nand beautiful objects. Those of the libellula and other\nflies, as well as of the lobster, &c., must first be cleaned\nfrom the blood, &c., after which they should be soaked\nin water for some days: one or two skins are then to be\nseparated from the eye, which would be otherwise too\nopaque and confused; but some care is requisite in this\noperation; for if the skin be rendered too thin, it is\nimpossible to form a proper idea of the organization of\nthe part. In some substances, however, the organiza-\ntion is such, that by altering the texture of the part,\nwe destroy the objects which we wish to observe. Of\nthis sort are the nerves, tendons, muscular fibres,\nmany of which are viewed to most advantage when\nfloating in some transparent fluid. Thus very few of\nthe muscular fibres can be discovered when we attempt\nto view them in the open air, though great numbers\nmay be seen if they be placed in water or oil. By\nviewing the thread of a ligament in this manner, we\nfind it composed of a vast number of smooth round\nthreads lying close together. Elastic objects should\nbe pulled or stretched out while they are under the mi-\ncroscope, that the texture and nature of those parts,\nthe figure of which is altered by being thus pulled out,\nmay be more fully discovered.\n\nOther objects. To examine bones by the microscope, Microcope.\nthey should first be viewed as opaque objects; but af-\nterwards, by procuring thin slices of them, they may\nbe viewed as transparent. The sections should be cut\nin all directions, and be well washed and cleaned; and\nin some cases maceration will be useful, or the bones\nmay be heated red hot in a clear fire, and then taken\nout; by which means the bony cells will appear more\nconspicuous. The pores of the skin may be examined by\ncutting off a thin slice off the upper skin with a razor,\nand then a second from the same place; applying the\nlatter to the microscope. The lizard, guinea, &c., have\ntwo skins, one very transparent, the other thicker and\nmore opaque; and, separating these two, you obtain\nvery beautiful objects.\n\nTo view the scales of fish to advantage, they ought\nto be soaked in water for a few days, and then care-\nfully rubbed to clean them from the skin and dirt\nwhich may adhere to them. The scales of the eel are\na great curiosity; and the more so, as this creature\nwas not known to have any scales till they were disco-\nvered by the microscope. The method of discovering\nthem is this. Take a piece of the skin of an eel from\noff its side, and spread it while moist on a piece of\nglass, that it may dry very smooth: when thus dried,\nthe surface will appear all over dimpled or pitted by\nthe scales, which lie under a sort of cuticle or thin\nskin, which may be raised with the sharp point of a\npenknife, together with the scales, which will then\neasily slip out; and thus we may procure as many as\nwe please.\n\nThe leaves of many trees, as well as of some plants,\nwhen dissected, form a very agreeable object. In or-\nder to dissect them, take a few of the most perfect\nleaves you can find, and place them in a pan with clean\nwater. Let them remain there three weeks, or a\nmonth, without changing the water; then take them up;\nand if they feel very soft, and almost rotten, they\nare sufficiently soaked. They must then be laid on a\nflat board, and holding them by the stalk, draw the\nedge of a knife over the upper side of the leaf, which\nwill take off most of the skin. Then turn the leaf,\nand do the same with the under side; and when the\nskin is taken off on both sides, wash out the pulpy\nmatter, and the fibres will be exhibited in a very\nbeautiful manner. The leaf may be slit into two\nparts, by splitting the stalk; and the skins peeled\nfrom the fibres will also make a good object. This\noperation is best performed in the autumn; the fibres\nof the leaves are much stronger at that season, and\nless liable to be broken.—The internal structure of\nshells may be observed by grinding them down on a\nstone: and all ores and minerals should be carefully\nwashed and brushed with a small brush, to remove any\nforeign matter that may adhere to them.\n\nTo view the circulation of the blood, we must ob-\nserve living animals of the most transparent kind.—\nA small eel is sometimes used for this purpose; in\nwhich case it must be cleaned from the slime naturally\nadhering to it; after which it may be put into a tube\nfilled with water, where it can be viewed in a satis-\nfactory manner. The tail of any other small fish may\nbe viewed in the same manner, or put upon a slip of\nflat glass, and thus laid before the microscope. By\nfilling the tube with water when an eel is made use of,\nMicroscope, we prevent in a great measure the sliminess of the animal from foiling the glass.\n\nThe particles of the blood form a very curious object, and have been carefully viewed by different philosophers; who, nevertheless, differ from one another very much in their accounts of them. The best method of viewing these is to take a small drop of blood when warm, and spread it as thin as possible upon a flat piece of glass. By diluting it a little with warm water, some of the large globules will be separated from the smaller, and many of them subdivided; or a small drop of blood may be put into a capillary glass tube, and then placed before the microscope. Mr Baker advises warm milk as proper to be mixed with the blood; but Mr Huxley, diluted the blood with its own serum: and by this method he could preserve the small particles entire, and view them distinctly; and thus he found that they were not globular, as had been imagined by other anatomists, but flat. Having shaken a piece of the coagulum of the blood in serum till the latter became a little coloured, he spread it with a soft hair pencil on a piece of thin glass, which he placed under the microscope, in such a manner as not be quite horizontal, but rather higher at one end than the other. Thus the serum flows from the higher to the lower part; and, as it flows, some of the particles will be found to swim on their flat sides, and will appear to have a dark spot in the middle; while others will turn over from one side to the other as they roll down the glass. Many cruel experiments have been tried in order to observe the circulation of the blood in living creatures, and an apparatus has been invented for viewing the circulation in the mesentery of a frog; but as this can answer no useful purpose, and will never be put in practice by persons of humanity, we forbear to mention it.\n\nII. Besides the objects for the microscope already mentioned, there are innumerable others, some hardly visible, and others totally invisible, to the naked eye; and which therefore, in a more peculiar sense, are denominated\n\nMicroscopic Animals. They are the animalcules or moving bodies in water, in which certain substances have been infused; and of which there are a great many different kinds. These animalcules are sometimes found in water which we would call pure, did not the microscope discover its minute inhabitants; but not equally in all kinds of water, or even in all parts of the same kind of it. The surfaces of infusions are generally covered with a scum which is easily broken, but acquires thickness by standing. In this scum the greatest number of animalcules are usually found. Sometimes it is necessary to dilute the infusions; but this ought always to be done with water, not only distilled, but viewed through a microscope, lest it should also have animalcules in it, and thus prove a source of deception. It is, however, most proper to observe those minute objects after the water is a little evaporated; the attention being less diverted by a few objects than when they appear in great number. One or two of the animalcules may be separated from the rest by placing a small drop of water on the glass near that of the infusion; join them together by making a small connexion between them with a pin; and as soon as you perceive that an animalcule has entered the microscope, clear drop, cut off the connexion again.\n\nEels in paste are obtained by boiling a little flour and water into the consistence of bookbinders paste; then exposing it to the air in an open vessel, and beating it frequently together to keep the surface from growing mouldy or hard. In a few days it will be found peopled with myriads of little animals visible to the naked eye, which are the eels in question. They may be preserved for a whole year by keeping the paste moistened with water; and while this is done, the motion of the animals will keep the surface from growing mouldy. Mr Baker directs a drop or two of vinegar to be put into the paste now and then. When they are applied to the microscope, the paste must be diluted in a piece of water for them to swim in.\n\nNumberless animalcules are observed by the microscope in infusions of pepper. To make an infusion for this purpose, bruise as much common black pepper as will cover the bottom of an open jar, and lay it thereon about half an inch thick; pour as much soft water into the vessel as will rise about an inch above the pepper. Shake the whole well together; after which they must not be stirred, but be left exposed to the air for a few days; in which time a thin pellicle will be formed on the surface, in which innumerable animals are to be observed by the microscope.\n\nThe microscopic animals are so different from those of the larger kinds, that scarce any sort of analogy seems to exist between them; and one would almost be tempted to think that they lived in consequence of laws directly opposite to those which preserve ourselves and other visible animals in existence. They have been systematically arranged by O. F. Muller; though it is by no means probable that all the different classes have yet been discovered. Such as have been observed, however, are by this author divided in the following manner:\n\nI. Such as have no external organs.\n1. Monas : Pandiforme. A mere point.\n2. Proteus : Mutabilis. Mutable.\n3. Volvox : Sphericum. Spherical.\n4. Enchelis : Cylindracea. Cylindrical.\n5. Vibrio : Elongatum. Long.\n\n* Membranaceous.\n\n6. Cyclidium : Ovalis. Oval.\n7. Paramecium : Oblongum. Oblong.\n8. Kolpoda : Sinuatum. Sinuous.\n9. Goniun : Angulatum. With angles.\n10. Bursaria. Hollow like a purse.\n\nII. Those that have external organs.\n* Naked, or not enclosed in a shell.\n1. Cercaria : Caudatum. With a tail.\n2. Trichoda : Crinitum. Hairy.\n3. Kerona : Corniculatum. With horns.\n4. Himantopus : Cirratus. Ciliated.\n5. Leucophra : Ciliatum undique. Every part ciliated.\n6. Vorticella : Ciliatum apice. The apex ciliated.\n* Covered with a shell.\n7. Brachionus : Ciliatum apice. The apex ciliated.\nIn the treatise on HELMINTHOLOGY under the fifth order of the clas vernes, viz. Infusoria, the genera here enumerated have already been noticed according to an arrangement somewhat different, and a few of the species have been described. For the sake of those who wish to prosecute microscopical inquiries we shall introduce descriptions of a few more, and particularly those whose habitats are known.\n\nI. Monas.\n\nThis is by our author defined to be \"an invisible (to the naked eye), pellucid, simple, punctiform worm;\" but of which, small as it is, there are several species.\n\nThe monas termo or gelatinosa, is a small jelly-like point, which can be but imperfectly seen by the single microscope, and not at all by the compound one. In a full light they totally disappear, by reason of their transparency. Some infusions are so full of them that scarce the least empty space can be perceived; the water itself appearing composed of innumerable globular points, in which a motion may be perceived somewhat similar to that which is observed when the sun's rays shine on the water; the whole multitude of animals appearing in commotion like a hive of bees. This animal is very common in ditch-water, and in almost all infusions either of animal or vegetable substances.\n\nMonas atomus or albidus; white monas with a variable point. This appears like a white point, which through a high magnifier appears somewhat egg-shaped. The smaller end is generally marked with a black point, the situation of which is variable; sometimes it appears on the large end, and sometimes there are two black spots in the middle. This species was found in sea water, which had been kept through the whole winter, but was not very fetid. No other kind of animalcule was found in it.\n\nII. The Proteus.\n\nAn invisible, very simple, pellucid worm, of a variable form.\n\nThe tenax, running out into a fine point. This is a pellucid gelatinous body, stowed with black molecules, and likewise changing its figure, but in a more regular order than the former. It first extends itself in a straight line, the lower part terminating in a bright acute point. It appears to have no intestines; and when the globules are all collected in the upper part, it next draws the pointed end up toward the middle of the body, which assumes a round form. It goes through a number of different shapes, part of which are described under the article Animalcule. It is found in some kinds of river water, and appears confined almost entirely to one place, only bending side-wise.\n\nIII. Volvox.\n\nAn invisible, very simple, pellucid, spherical worm.\n\nThe punctum; of a black colour, with a lucid point. This is a small globe, with one hemisphere opaque and black, the other having a crystalline appearance; and a vehement motion is observed in the black part.\n\nIV. Enchelis.\n\nA simple, invisible, cylindric worm.\n\nThe viridis, or green enchelis, has an obtuse tail, the fore part terminating in an acute truncated angle; the intestines are obscure and indistinct. It continually varies its motion, turning from right to left.\n\nThe punctifera, having the fore part obtuse, the hinder part pointed. It is opaque, and of a green colour, with a small pellucid spot in the fore-part, in which two black points may be seen; and a kind of double band crosses the middle of the body. The hinder part is pellucid and pointed, with an incision supposed to be the mouth, at the apex of the fore part. It is found in marshes.\n\nThe pupula, with the fore part papillary, is found in dunghill water in November and December: it has a rotatory motion on a longitudinal axis, and moves in an oblique direction through the water. Both ends are obtuse; and the hinder part is marked with a transparent circle, or circular aperture.\n\nV. Vibrio.\n\nA very simple, invisible, round, and rather long worm.\n\nThe lineola is found in most vegetable infusions in such numbers, that it seems to fill up almost the whole of their substance. It is so small, that with the best magnifiers we can discern little more than an obscure tremulous motion among them. It is more slender than the monas terma.\n\nThe serpens, with obtuse windings or flexures, is found in river water, but seldom. It is slender and gelatinous, resembling a serpentine line, with an intestine down the middle.\n\nThe spirillum is exceedingly minute, and twisted in a spiral form, which seems to be its natural shape as it never untwists itself, but moves forward in a straight line, vibrating the hind and fore parts. It was found in 1782 in an infusion of the fucus arvensis.\n\nThe vermiculus has a milky appearance, with an obtuse apex, and a languid undulatory motion, like that of the common worm. It is found in marshy water in November.\nNovember, but seldom. It is thought to be the animal mentioned by Leeuwenhoek as found in the dung of the frog and spawn of the male libellula.\n\nThe fagitta, with a fetaceous tail, has a long and flexible body; broadest about the middle, and filled there also with gray molecules; the fore part being drawn out into a thin and transparent neck, and the upper end thick and black. It is found in salt water, and seems to move by contracting and extending its neck.\n\nVI. Cyclidium.\n\nA simple, invisible, flat, pellucid, orbicular or oval worm.\n\nThe bulla, or orbicular bright cyclidium. This is found occasionally in an infusion of hay. It is very pellucid and white, but the edges somewhat darker than the rest. It moves slowly, and in a semicircular direction.\n\nThe millium is very pellucid, and splendid like crystal; and of an elliptical figure, with a line through the whole length of it. The motion is swift, interrupted, and fluttering.\n\nVII. Paramaecium.\n\nAn invisible, membranaceous, flat, and pellucid worm.\n\nThe chrysalis is found in salt water, and differs very little from the former, only the ends are more obtuse, and the margins are filled with black globules.\n\nThe verutum is found in ditches, and has an oblong, green, and gelatinous body, filled with molecules; the lower part thicker than the other; and both ends obtuse. It propagates by division.\n\nVIII. Kolpoda.\n\nAn invisible, pellucid, flat, and crooked worm.\n\nThe lamella is very seldom met with. It resembles a long, narrow, and pellucid membrane, with the hind part obtuse, narrower, and curved towards the top. It has a vacillatory and very singular motion; going upon the sharp edge, not on the flat side as is usual with microscopic animals.\n\nThe gallinula is found in fetid salt water; and has the apex somewhat bent, the belly oval, convex, and striated.\n\nThe rostrum is found, though seldom, in water where the lemma grows; and has a slow and horizontal motion. The fore part is bent into a kind of hook; the hind part obtuse, and quite filled with black molecules.\n\nThe triquetra was found in salt water, and appears to consist of two membranes; the upper side flattened, the lower convex, with the apex bent into a kind of shoulder.\n\nThe affinis is found on the sea-coast, and has an elliptic mass in the middle, but is not folded like the former. The margin of the fore part is notched from the top to the middle; the lower part swells out, and contracts again into a small point.\n\nThe cucullatus is found in an infusion of the fucus arvensis. It is very pellucid and crystalline, with several globules, and has an oblique incision a little below the apex.\n\nThe ren, or crella, is found in an infusion of hay, commonly about 13 hours after the infusion is made, and has a quick and vacillatory motion. Its body is yellow, thick, and somewhat opaque; curved a little in the middle, so that it resembles a kidney; and full of molecules. When the water in which it swims is about to fail, it takes an oval form, is compressed, and at last bursts.\n\nIX. Gonium.\n\nAn invisible, simple, smooth, and angular worm.\n\nThe pulvinatum is found in dunghills; and appears like a little quadrangular membrane, plain on both sides; but with a large magnifier it appears like a bolster formed of three or four cylindric pillows sunk here and there.\n\nThe corrugatum is found in various kinds of infusions; and is somewhat of a square shape, very small, and in some positions appears as streaked.\n\nThe truncatum is found chiefly in pure water, and then but seldom. It has a languid motion, and is much larger than the foregoing. The fore part is a straight line, with which the sides form obtuse angles, the end of the sides being united by a curved line. The internal molecules are of a dark green, and there are two little bright vehicles in the middle.\n\nX. Burforia.\n\nA very simple, hollow, membranaceous worm.\n\nThe truncatella is visible to the naked eye; white, oval, and truncated at the top, where there is a large aperture defending towards the base. Most of them have four or five yellow eggs, at the bottom. They move from left to right, and from right to left; ascending to the surface in a straight line, and sometimes rolling about while they descend.\n\nThe bulina is pellucid and crystalline, having splendid globules of different sizes swimming about with it. The under side is convex, the upper hollow, with the fore part forming a kind of lip.\n\nThe hirundinella has two small projecting wings, which give it somewhat of the appearance of a bird; and it moves something like a swallow. It is invisible to the naked eye; but by the microscope appears a pellucid hollow membrane.\n\nThe duplicilla was found among duckweed, and appears like a crystalline membrane folded up, without any visible interlines except a small congeries of points under one of the folds.\n\nXI. Cercaria.\n\nAn invisible transparent worm with a tail.\n\nThe gyrinus greatly resembles the spermatic animalcules. It has a white gelatinous body; the fore part somewhat globular; the hind part round, long, and pointed. Sometimes it appears a little compressed on each side. When swimming it keeps its tail in continual vibration like a tadpole.\n\nThe gibba is found in the infusions of hay and other vegetables;\nMicroscope vegetables; and is small, opaque, gelatinous, white, and without any visible intestines.\n\nThe *inquieta* is found in salt water, and is remarkable for changing the shape of its body; sometimes it appears spherical, sometimes like a long cylinder, and sometimes oval. It is white and gelatinous, the tail filiform and flexible, the upper part vibrating violently. A pellucid globule may be observed at the base, and two very small black points near the top.\n\nThe *turbo*, with a tail like a bristle, is found among duckweed. It is of a tawny appearance, partly oval and partly spherical; and seems to be composed of two globular bodies, the lowermost of which is the smallest, and it has two little black points like eyes on the upper part. The tail is sometimes straight, sometimes turned back on the body.\n\nThe *poduria* is found in November and December, in marshy places covered with *Lemna*. It is pellucid; and seems to consist of a head, trunk, and tail: the head resembles that of a herring; the trunk is ventricose and full of intestines, of a spiral form and black colour. The tail most commonly appears to be divided into two bristles. The intestines are in a continual motion when the body moves, and by reason of their various shades make it appear very rough. There are likewise some hairs to be perceived. It turns round as upon an axis when it moves.\n\nThe *viridic* is found in the spring in ditches of standing water; and in some of its states has a considerable resemblance to the last, but has a much greater power of changing its shape. It is naturally cylindrical, the lower end sharp, and divided into two parts; but sometimes contracts the head and tail so as to assume a spherical figure.\n\nThe *setifera* is found in salt water, but seldom. It is small, the body rather opaque, and of a round figure. The upper part is bright, and smaller than the rest: the trunk is more opaque; the tail sharp, and near it a little row of short hairs. It has a slow rotatory motion.\n\nThe *hirta* was likewise found in salt water. It is opaque and cylindrical; and when in motion, the body appears to be surrounded with rows of small hairs separated from each other.\n\nThe *pleurometer* is found in water which has been kept for several months. It is membranaceous, roundish, and white, with two blackish points in the fore part, the hinder part being furnished with a slender sharp tail. It has orbicular intestines of different sizes in the middle; the larger of them bright. The motion is vacillatory; and in swimming it keeps one edge of the lateral membrane upwards, the other folded down.\n\nThe *tribos* is flat, pellucid, triangular, having each angle of the base or fore part bent down into two linear arms, the apex of the triangle prolonged into a tail. It is found in salt water.\n\n**XII. Leucophora.**\n\nAn invisible, pellucid, and ciliated worm.\n\nThe *mamilla* is of a dark colour, and filled with globular molecules; short hairs are curved inwards; and it occasionally projects and draws in a little white protuberance. It is pretty common in marshy water.\n\nThe *viridescens* is a large, pear-shaped, greenish-coloured animalcule, filled with opaque molecules, and covered with short hairs; generally moving in a straight line. It is found in salt water.\n\nThe *burata* is found in salt water, and is similar in many respects to the former. It is of a long oval shape, bulging in the middle, and filled with green molecules, everywhere ciliated except at the apex, which is truncated and shaped somewhat like a purse; the hairs are sometimes collected into little fascicles.\n\nThe *potthuma* is globular, and covered as it were with a pellucid net; is found in fetid salt water.\n\nThe *fignata* is common in salt water in the months of November and December. It is oblong and subdepressed, with a black margin filled with little molecules, but more particularly distinguished by a curved line in the middle somewhat in the shape of the letter S; one end of which is sometimes bent into the form of a small spiral.\n\n**XIII. Trichoda.**\n\nAn invisible, pellucid, hairy worm.\n\nThe *gyrus* is one of the smallest of this genus, and is found in salt water. It is smooth and free from hairs, except at the fore part, where there are a few.\n\nThe *nigra* was found in salt water, and has an opaque body; but when at rest one side appears pellucid. When in violent motion, it seems entirely black.\n\nThe *pubes* is found in water where duckweed grows, chiefly in the month of December. It has a bunch above the hind part marked with black spots, depressed towards the top, a little folded, and somewhat convex on the under part. The apex is furnished with hairs, but they are seldom visible till the creature is in the agonies of death, when it extends and moves them vehemently, and attempting as it were to draw in the very last drop of water.\n\nThe *patens* is found in salt water; and is of a long cylindrical shape, filled with molecules, the fore part bright and clear, with a long opening near the top which tapers to a point, and is beset with hairs.\n\nThe *friate* is found in the month of December in river water. It is a beautiful animalcule, of a fox colour. It is of an oblong shape, the lower end somewhat larger than the other. It has a set of streaks running from one end to the other, and at the abdomen a double row of little eggs lying in a transverse direction.\n\nThe *uvula* is found in the infusion of hay and other vegetables. It is six times longer than broad, round, flexuous, of an equal size, the greater part filled with obscure molecules; the fore part rather empty, with an alimentary canal and lucid globules near the middle. The margin of the fore part is covered with short hairs.\n\nThe *linter* is found in air infusion of old grass. It is egg-shaped, oblong, with both extremities raised so that the bottom becomes convex, and the upper part depressed like a boat: it is of different shapes at different ages, and sometimes has a rotatory motion.\n\nThe *pavillar* is found in salt water; and is long, full of gray molecules; the fore part truncated and hairy, and rather smaller than the other.\n\nThe *vermicularis* is found in river water; and is pel-\nMIC\n\nMicroscope lucid in the fore part, with the hind part full of molecules.\n\nThe melita is found in salt water, but very rarely. It is oblong, ciliated, with a globular apex, a dilatable neck, and a kind of peristaltic motion perceivable within it.\n\nThe perillum is frequently found in marshes. It is cylindrical, pellucid, mucilaginous, and capable of being folded up. It appears double; the interior part full of molecules, with an orbicular mucilaginous appendage, which it can open and shut, and which forms the mouth. The external part is membranaceous, pellucid, dilated, and marked with transverse streaks; and it can protrude or draw in the orbicular membrane at pleasure. Some have four articulations in the tail, others five; and it has two pairs of brittle, one placed at the second joint, the other at the last.\n\nThe delphis is found in river water. It is smooth, pellucid, having the fore part dilated into a semicircle, gradually decreasing in breadth towards the tail. The front is hairy, the hairs standing as rays from the semicircular edge: one of the edges is sometimes contracted.\n\nThe delphinus is found in hay that has been infused for some months. It is pellucid, smooth, and egg-shaped; the hinder part terminating in a tail about half the length of the body, dilated at the upper end, truncated, and always bent upwards. It moves sometimes on its belly and sometimes on its side.\n\nThe rofifera is found in water where duckweed has been kept. It is depressed, capable of changing its shape, yellow, with long ciliated hairs; it has four feet tapering to a point, one of them longer than the rest. Both feet and hairs are within the margin. The shape of the body is generally triangular; the apex formed into an obtuse beak, which the creature sometimes draws in so that it appears quite round.\n\nThe charon was found in salt water. It is oval, and resembles a boat as well in its motion as shape; the upper part is hollowed, the under part furrowed and concave; the stern round, with several hairs proceeding from it.\n\nXIV. Kerona.\n\nAn invisible worm with horns.\n\nThe rofifera is found in river water. It has three rows of horns on the back, which occupy almost the whole of it.\n\nThe cypris is found in water covered with lemma. It is somewhat of a pear shape, compressed, with a broad and blunt fore part; the front furnished with hairs, or little vibrating points inserted under the edge, shorter in the hind part, partly extended straight, and partly bent down, having a retrograde motion.\n\nThe calceolium is found in the infusion of vegetables. The body is broad and flat, both sides obtuse, filled with black molecules, and there is a black spot near the hinder part, where there are likewise a few short bristles.\n\nThe pyxulata is found in salt water. It is oval, convex; one edge of the hinder part sinuated, both ends set with hairs, and some horns on the fore part.\n\nMIC\n\nXV. Himantopus.\n\nA pellucid, invisible, and cirrated worm.\n\nThe acarus is lively, conical, ventricose, full of black molecules, with a bright and transparent fore part. The lower part of the apex has rows of long hairs on the under part set like rays. Four locks of long crooked hair or feet proceed from the belly, and it is continually moving these and other hairs in various directions.\n\nThe ludio is a lively diverting animalcule, smooth, pellucid, full of small points, the fore part clubbed and a little bent, the hinder part narrow; the base obliquely truncated, and terminating in a tail stretched out transversely. The top of the head and middle of the back are furnished with long and vibrating hairs; three moveable and flexible curls hang down from the side of the head at a distance from each other. When the creature is at rest, its tail is curled; but when in motion, it is drawn tight and extended upwards.\n\nThe fannie is found, though seldom, in water where the lemma grows. The cilia are longer than the hairs, and are continually vibrating; it has two moveable curls hanging on the side of the head.\n\nThe charon is found in sea water, but rarely. It is oval, pellucid, and membranous, with longitudinal furrows and several bent diverging rows of hair below the middle, but none on the hinder part.\n\nXVI. Vorticella.\n\nA naked worm with rotatory cilia, capable of contracting and extending itself.\n\nThe lunifera is found in salt water; has the fore part obtuse, the base broad, and hollowed away like a crescent, with a short protuberance in the middle of the concave part: the fore part is ciliated.\n\nThe burfata is found in salt water, and is ventricose, crammed with molecules; the fore part truncated, and both sides of it pellucid: there is a prominent papilla in the middle, which when the animalcule is at rest appears notched, the edge of the aperture being ciliated; the hairs are capable of moving in various directions.\n\nThe sputarium is found in October, with the lesser lemma, and is one of the most singular of the microscopic animalcules. When viewed sidewise, it is sometimes nearly cylindrical, only tapering a little towards the hinder part, and having a broad pellucid edge. Viewed from the top, it has sometimes a broad face or disk, furnished with radiating hairs, the under part contracted into a globular shape, of a dark green colour, and filled with small grains.\n\nThe multiformis is found in salt water, and very much resembles the former.\n\nThe nigra is found in August in meadows covered with water. It may be seen with the naked eye, appearing like a black point swimming on the surface. Through the microscope it appears as a small conical body, obtuse and ventricose at one end, and acute at the other. When the extremities are extended, two small white hooks become visible by the affluence of which,\nMicroscope which it moves in the water, and it probably has a rotatory organ: it moves continually in a vacillating manner on the top of the water.\n\nThe acreata is met with in rivers, though very seldom, and in shape somewhat resembles the lower part of a boot. The apex of the upper part is truncated and ciliated, the heel pointed, and the foot round.\n\nThe volga is as broad as long, and the apex truncated and ciliated; both angles of the base projecting outwards, one somewhat like a wart, the other like a finger. It is found in marshy waters.\n\nThe papillaris is likewise found in marshes where the conferva nitida grows. It is ventricose; the fore part truncated, with a papillary tail, and a beautiful papillary excretion on the side.\n\nThe cratogaria is found in the month of April, both in the mud and on the tail of the monoculus quadricornis. They are generally heaped together in a spherical form, and united to one common stalk. They are likewise often to be found without a pedicle, the body rather contracted, the aperture circular, and surrounded with a marked margin. It has two small arms; and with a powerful magnifier a violent rotatory motion may be observed. Sometimes an individual will separate from the community, and move in a kind of spiral line for a little time, and then go back to the rest.\n\nThe rotatoria is the wheel animal described by Mr Baker; and of which an account is given under the article Animalcule.\n\nThe furcata is commonly found in water, and has a cylindric body with a rotatory organ, consisting of a row of hairs at the apex: the tail is divided into two parts, turning a little inwards. When at rest it joins the segments of the tail, but opens them when in motion.\n\nThe citrina is found in stagnant water; the head full of molecules, round, everywhere of an equal size, and very transparent. Both sides of the orifice are ciliated, and each has a rotatory motion appearing sometimes without and sometimes within the edge of the mouth.\n\nThe convallaria is the same with the bell-animal mentioned by Mr Baker. See the article Animalcule.\n\nThe acinafa inhabits that whitish substance which often entirely covers plants, wood, shells, &c. When this substance is examined by a microscope, it appears to be wholly composed of living animals of the polype kind. See Polype.\n\nThe pyraria,\nThe anaflactica, See the article Polype.\nThe digitalis.\n\nXVII. Brachionus.\n\nA contractile worm, covered with a shell, and furnished with rotatory cilia.\n\nThe patella is found in marshy water in the winter-time. It is univalve, the shell oval, plain, crystalline, with the anterior part terminating in two acute points on both sides, though the intervening space is commonly filled up with the head of the animal. By these points it fattens itself, and whirls about the body erect. The rotatory cilia are perceived with great difficulty.\n\nTo what has been already said on this subject, under Microscope, the article Animalcule, we shall here add the following observations from Mr Adams.—\"How many kinds of these invisibles there may be (says he), is yet unknown; as they are discerned of all sizes, from those which are barely invisible to the naked eye, to such as resist the force of the microscope as the fixed stars do that of the telescope, and with the greatest powers hitherto invented appear only as so many moving points. The smallest living creatures our instruments can show, are those which inhabit the waters; for though animalcules equally minute may fly in the air, or creep upon the earth, it is scarcely possible to get a view of them; but as water is transparent, by confining the creatures within it we can easily observe them by applying a drop of it to the glass.\n\n\"Animalcules in general are observed to move in all directions with equal ease and rapidity, sometimes obliquely, sometimes straight forward; sometimes moving in a circular direction, or rolling upon one another, running backwards and forwards through the whole extent of the drop, as if diverting themselves; at other times greedily attacking the little parcels of matter they meet with. Notwithstanding their extreme minuteness, they know how to avoid obstacles, or to prevent any interference with one another in their motions: sometimes they will suddenly change the direction in which they move, and take an opposite one; and, by inclining the glass on which the drop of water is, as it can be made to move in any direction, so the animalcules appear to move as easily against the stream as with it. When the water begins to evaporate, they flock towards the place where the fluid is, and show a great anxiety and uncommon agitation of the organs with which they draw in the water. These motions grow languid as the water fails, and at last cease altogether, without a possibility of renewal if they be left dry for a short time. They sustain a great degree of cold as well as insects, and will perish in much the same degree of heat that destroys insects. Some animalcules are produced in water at the freezing point, and some insects live in snow.\n\n\"—By mixing the least drop of urine with the water in which they swim, they instantly fall into convulsions and die.\n\n\"The same rule seems to hold good in those minute creatures, which is observable in the larger animals, viz. that the larger kinds are less numerous than such as are smaller, while the smallest of all are found in such multitudes, that there seem to be myriads for one of the others. They increase in size, like other animals, from their birth until they have attained their full growth; and when deprived of proper nourishment, they in like manner grow thin and perish.\"\n\nThe modes of propagation among these animalcules are various, and the observation of them is extremely curious. Some multiply by a transverse division, as is observed under the article Animalcule; and it is remarkable, that though in general they avoid one another, it is not uncommon, when one is nearly divided, to see another push itself upon the small neck which joins the two bodies in order to accelerate the separation.—Others, when about to multiply, fix themselves to the bottom of the water; then becoming first oblong, and afterwards round, turn rapidly as on a centre, but perpetually varying the direction of their rotatory motion.\"\nIn a little time, two lines forming a cross are perceived; after which the spherule divides into four, which grow, and are again divided as before. A third kind multiply by a longitudinal division, which in some begins in the fore part, in others in the hind part; and from others a small fragment detaches itself, which in a short time assumes the shape of the parent animalcule. Lastly, others propagate in the same manner as the more perfect animals.\n\nIn our observations under the article Animalcule, we suggested some doubts whether all those minute bodies which go under the name of animalcules really do enjoy animal life; or whether they are not in many cases to be accounted only inanimate and exceedingly minute points of matter actuated by the internal motion of the fluid. This has also been the opinion of others; but to all hypotheses of this kind Mr Adams makes the following reply: \"From what has been said, it clearly appears, that their motions are not purely mechanical, but are produced by an internal spontaneous principle; and that they must therefore be placed among the class of living animals, for they possess the strongest marks and the most decided characters of animation; and, consequently, that there is no foundation for the supposition of a chaotic and neutral kingdom, which can only have derived its origin from a very transient and superficial view of these animalcules.—It may also be further observed, that as we see that the motions of the limbs, &c., of the larger animals, are produced by the mechanical construction of the body, and the action of the soul thereon, and are forced by the ocular demonstration which arises from anatomical dissection to acknowledge this mechanism which is adapted to produce the various motions necessary to the animal; and as, when we have recourse to the microscope, we find those pieces which had appeared to the naked eye as the primary mechanical causes of particular motions, to consist themselves of lesser parts, which are the causes of motion, extension, &c., in the larger; when the structure therefore can be traced no farther by the eye, or by the glances, we have no right to conclude that the parts which are invisible are not equally the subject of mechanism: for this would be only to assert, in other words, that a thing may exist because we see and feel it, and have no existence when it is not the object of our senses.—The same train of reasoning may be applied to microscopic insects and animalcules: we see them move; but because the muscles and members which occasion these motions are invisible, shall we infer that they have not muscles, with organs appropriated to the motion of the whole and its parts? To say that they exist not because we cannot perceive them, would not be a rational conclusion. Our senses are indeed given us that we may comprehend some effects; but then we have also a mind, with reason, bestowed upon us, that, from the things which we do perceive with our senses, we may deduce the nature of those causes and effects which are imperceptible to the corporeal eye.\"\n\nLeaving these speculations, however, we shall now proceed to give a particular\n\nExplanation of the figures of the various animals, with their parts, ova, &c., represented in the plates.\n\nFig. 32, 33, represent the eggs of the phalena Coccinellidae, as they are taken from the tree to which they adhere, and magnified by the microscope. The Microscope's strong groundwork visible in many places shows the gum by which they are fastened together; and this connexion is strengthened by a very tenacious substance interposed between the eggs, and filling up the vacant spaces. Fig. 34 shows a vertical section of the eggs, exhibiting their oval shape. Fig. 35 is a horizontal section through the middle of the egg. These eggs make a beautiful appearance through the microscope. The small figures a, b, c, represent the objects in their natural state, without being magnified.\n\nFig. 36 shows the larva of the musca chameleon, an aquatic insect. When viewed by the naked eye, it appears (as here represented) to be composed of twelve annular divisions, separating it into an head, thorax, and abdomen; but it is not easy to distinguish the two last parts from each other, as the intestines lie equally both in the thorax and abdomen. The tail is furnished with a fine crown or circle of hair, disposed in the form of a ring, and by this means it is supported on the surface of the water, the head and body hanging down towards the bottom, in which posture it will sometimes remain for a considerable time without any motion.—When it has a mind to sink to the bottom, it cloves the hairs of the ring, as in fig. 37. Thus an hollow space is formed, including a small bubble of air; by enlarging or diminishing which, it can rise or sink in the water at pleasure. When the bubble escapes, the insect can replace it from the pulmonary tubes, and sometimes considerable quantities of air may be seen to escape from the tail of the worm into the common atmosphere; which operation may easily be observed when the worm is placed in a glass of water, and affords an entertaining spectacle. The finout of this insect is divided into three parts, of which that in the middle is immovable; the other two, which grow from the sides of the middle one, are moveable, and vibrate like the tongues of lizards or serpents. In these lateral parts lies most of the creature's strength; for it walks upon them when out of the water, appearing to walk on its mouth, and to use it as the parrot does its beak to assist it in climbing.\n\nThe larva is shown, fig. 38, as it appears through a microscope. It grows narrower towards the head, is largest about that part which we may call the thorax, converges all along the abdomen, and terminates at length in a sharp tail surrounded with hairs, as has already been mentioned. The twelve annular divisions are now extremely visible, and are marked by numbers in the plate. The skin appears somewhat hard, and resembling flaggreen, being thick set with grains pretty equally distributed. It has nine holes, or spiracula, probably for the purpose of breathing, on each side; but it has none of these on the tail division a, nor any easily visible on the third from the head. In the latter, indeed, it has some very small holes concealed under the skin, near the place where the embryo wings of the future fly are hid. \"It is remarkable (says Mr Adams) that caterpillars, in general, have two rings without these spiracula, perhaps because they change into flies with four wings, whereas this worm produces a fly with only two.\" The skin of the larva is adorned with oblong black furrows, spots of a light colour, and orbicular rings, from which there generally springs\nMicroscope: a hair; but only those hairs which grow on the insect's sides are represented in the figure. There are also some larger hairs here and there, as at c c. The difference of colour, however, in this worm arises only from the quantity of grains in the same space; for where they are in very great numbers, the furrows are darker, and paler where they are less plentiful.\n\nThe head d' is divided into three parts, and covered with a skin which has hardly any discernible grains.—The eyes are rather protuberant, and lie near the snout; on which last are two small horns at i i. It is crooked, and ends in a sharp point as at f. The legs are placed near the snout between the sinuses in which the eyes are fixed. Each of these legs consists of three joints, the outermost of which is covered with stiff hairs like bristles g g. From the next joint there springs a horny bone h h, used by the insect as a kind of thumb: the joint is also composed of a black substance of an intermediate hardness between bone and horn; and the third joint is of the same nature. In order to distinguish these parts, those that form the upper sides of the mouth and eyes must be separated by means of a small knife; after which, by the assistance of the microscope, we may perceive that the leg is articulated by some particular ligaments, with the portion of the insect's mouth which answers to the lower jaw in the human frame. We may then also discern the muscles which serve to move the legs, and draw them up into a cavity that lies between the snout and those parts of the mouth which are near the horns i i. The insect walks upon these legs, not only in the water, but on the land also. It likewise makes use of them in swimming, keeping its tail on the surface contiguous to the air, and hanging downward with the rest of the body in the water. In this situation, the only perceptible motion it has is in its legs, which it moves in a most elegant manner, from whence it is reasonable to conclude, that the most of this creature's strength lies in its legs, as we have already observed.\n\nThe snout of this larva is black and hard; the back part quite solid, and somewhat of a globular form; the front f sharp and hollow. Three membranaceous divisions may be perceived on the back part; by means of which, and the muscles contained in the snout, the creature can contract or expand it at pleasure.\n\nThe extremity of the tail is surrounded with thirty hairs, and the sides adorned with others that are smaller; and here and there the large hairs branch out into smaller ones, which may be reckoned single hairs. All these have their roots in the outer skin, which in this place is covered with rough grains, as may be observed by cutting it off and holding it against the light upon a slip of glass. Thus also we find, that at the extremities of the hairs there are grains like those on the skin; and in the middle of the tail there is a small opening, within which are minute holes, by which the insect takes in and lets out the air it breathes. These hairs, however, are seldom disposed in such a regular order as is represented in fig. 38, unless when the insect floats with the body in the water, and the tail with its hairs a little lower than the surface, in which case they are disposed exactly in the order delineated in the plate. The least motion of the tail downward produces a concavity in the water; and it then assumes the figure of a wine glass, wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. The tail answers the double purpose of swimming and breathing, and through it the insect receives what is the principle of life and motion to all animals. By means of these hairs also it can stop its motion when swimming, and remain suspended quietly without motion for any length of time. Its motions in swimming are very beautiful, especially when it advances with its whole body floating on the surface of the water after filling itself with air by the tail.—To set out, it first bends the body to the right or left, and then contracts it in the form of the letter S, and again stretches it out in a straight line; by thus contracting and then extending the body alternately, it moves on the surface of the water. It is very quiet, and is not disturbed by handling.\n\nThese creatures are commonly found in shallow standing waters in the beginning of June: but some years much more plentifully than others. They crawl on the grass and other plants which grow in such waters, and are often met with in ditches floating on the surface of the water by means of their tail, the head and thorax at the same time hanging down; and in this posture they turn over the clay and dirt with their finot and feet in search of food, which is commonly a viscous matter met with in small ponds and ditches. It is very harmless, though its appearance would seem to indicate the contrary. It is most easily killed for dissection by spirit of turpentine.\n\nFig. 39 shows in its natural size a beautiful insect, described by Linnæus under the name of Leucopis dorfigera, and which appears to be a kind of intermediate genus between a sphex and a wasp. The antennae are black and cylindrical, increasing in thickness towards the extremity; the joint nearest the head is yellow; the head and thorax are black, encompassed with a yellow line, and furnished with a cross line of the same colour near the head. The femur is yellow, the abdomen black, with two yellow bands, and a deep spot of the same colour on each side between the bands. A deep polished groove extends down the back from the thorax to the anus, into which the ring turns and is deposited, leaving the anus very circular; a yellow line runs on each side of the ring.—The anus and whole body, when viewed with a small magnifier, appear punctuated; but when these points are seen through a large magnifier, they appear hexagonal. Fig. 40 shows the insect very much magnified. Fig. 41 gives a side view of it magnified in a smaller degree.\n\nFig. 42 shows an insect lately discovered by Mr John Adams of Edmonton, as he happened to be at an inn. It was first seen by some labouring people who were there at the time, by whom it was conjectured to be a louse with unusually long horns, a mite, &c. Mr Adams hearing the debate, procured the insect; and having viewed it through a microscope, it presented the appearance exhibited in fig. 42. The insect seems to be quite distinct from the phalangium cancroides of Linnæus. The latter has been described by several authors, but none of their descriptions agree with this. The abdomen of this insect is more extended, the claws larger, and much more obtuse; the body of the other being nearly orbicular, the claws slender, and almost terminating in a point, more transparent, and of a paler colour. Mr Marsham has one\nMicroscope in his possession not to be distinguished from that represented in fig. 42, excepting only that it wants the break or dent in the claws, which is so conspicuous in this. He found that insect firmly fixed by its claws to the thigh of a large fly, which he caught on a flower in Essex in the first week of August, and from which he could not disengage it without great difficulty, and tearing off the leg of the fly. This was done upon a piece of writing paper; and he was surprised to see the little creature spring forward a quarter of an inch, and again seize the thigh with its claws, so that he had great difficulty in disengaging it. The natural size of this creature, which Mr Adams calls the lobster-insect, is exhibited at a.\n\nFig. 43 shows the insect named by M. de Geer Phyllopus, on account of the bladders at its feet, (Thrips phyllopus, Lin.) This insect is to be found in great plenty upon the flowers of dandelion, &c., in the spring and summer. It has four wings, two upper and two under ones (represented fig. 44,) but the two undermost are not to be perceived without great difficulty. They are very long; and fixed to the upper part of the breast, lying horizontally. Both of them are rather pointed towards the edges, and have a strong nerve running round them, which is set with a hair fringe tufted at the extremity. The colour of these wings is whitish; the body of the insect is black; the head small, with two large reticulated eyes. The antennae are of an equal size throughout, and divided into six oval pieces, which are articulated together.—The extremities of the feet are furnished with a membranaceous and flexible bladder, which it can throw out or draw in at pleasure. It presses this bladder against the substances on which it walks, and thus seems to fix itself to them; the bladder sometimes appears concave towards the bottom, the concavity diminishing as it is left pressed. The insect is represented of its natural size at b.\n\nFig. 45 represents the Cimex striatus of Linnaeus, remarkable for very bright and elegantly disposed colours, though few in number. The head, prothorax, and thorax, are black; the thorax ornamented with yellow spots; the middle one large, and occupying almost one third of the posterior part; the other two are on each side, and triangular. The scutellum has two yellow oblong spots, pointed at each end. The ground of the elytra is a bright yellow; spotted and striped with black. The nerves are yellow; and there is a brilliant triangular spot of orange, which unites the crenulaceous and membranaceous parts; the latter are brown, and clouded. It is found in the elm tree in June. It is represented of its natural size at c.\n\nFig. 46 shows the Chrysomela olivacei of Linnaeus, so called from the larva of the insect feeding upon that plant. It is a common insect, and very beautiful. It is of an oblong figure, with black antennae, composed of many joints, nearly oval. The head is a deep and bright blue; the thorax red and cylindrical; the elytra are blue, with a yellow margin, and having three spots of the same colour on each; one at the base, of an oblong form, and two united with the margin; the legs are black; but the under side of the belly is of the same blue colour, with the elytra and head. This little animal, when viewed by the naked eye, scarcely appears to deserve any notice; but when examined by microscope, the microscope, is one of the most pleasing objects we have. It is found in June on the alpine grass after it has run to seed; and it is shown of its natural size at d. De Geer says that it is very scarce in Sweden.\n\nFig. 47 shows an insect of a shape so remarkable, that naturalists have been at a loss to determine the genus to which it belongs. In the Fauna Suecica, Linnaeus makes it an attelabus; but in the last edition of the Systema Naturae, it is ranged as a meloe, under the title of the Meloe monochrous; though of this also there seems to be some doubt. The true figure of it can only be discovered by a very good microscope. The head is black, and appears to be hid or buried under the thorax, which projects forwards like a horn; the antennae are composed of many joints, and are of a dirty yellow colour, as well as the feet; the hinder part of the thorax is reddish, the fore part black.—The elytra are yellow, with a black longitudinal line down the future; there is a band of the same colour near the apex, and also a black point near the base, the whole animal being curiously covered with hair. The natural size of it is shown at e. It was found in May. Geoffroy says that it lives upon umbelliferous plants.\n\nFig. 43—57 exhibit the anatomy of the coluss caterpillar, which lives on the willow. The egg from which it proceeds is attached to the trunk of the tree by a kind of viscid juice, which soon becomes so hard that the rain cannot dissolve it. The egg itself is very small and spheroidal, and, when examined by the microscope, appears to have broad waving furrows running through the whole length of it, which are again crossed by close streaks, giving it the appearance of a wicker basket. It is not exactly known what time they are hatched; but as the small caterpillars appear in September, it is probable that the eggs are hatched some time in August. When small, they are generally met with under the bark of the tree to which the eggs were affixed; and an aqueous moisture, oozing from the hole through which they got under the bark, is frequently, though not always, a direction for finding them. These caterpillars change their colour but very little, being nearly the same when young as when old. Like many others, they are capable of spinning as soon as they come from the egg. They also change their skin several times; but as it is almost impossible to rear them under a glass, so it is very difficult to know exactly how often this moulting takes place.—Mr Adams conjectures that it is more frequently than the generality of caterpillars do, some having been observed to change more than nine times.\n\nThe coluss generally fails for some days previous to the moulting; during which time the fleshy and other interior parts of the head are detached from the old skull, and retire as it were within the neck. The new coverings soon grow on, but are at first very soft.—When the new skin and the other parts are formed, the old skin is to be opened, and all the members withdrawn from it; an operation naturally difficult, but which must be rendered more so from the soft and weak state of the creature at that time. It is always much larger after each change.\n\nFrom Mr Lyonet's experiments, it appears, that the coluss\nMicroscope. Cossus generally passes at least two winters, if not three, before it attains the pupa state. At the approach of winter, it forms a little case, the inside of which is lined with silk, and the outside covered with wood ground like very fine saw-dust. During the whole season it neither moves nor eats.\n\nThis caterpillar, at its first appearance, is not above one-twelfth of an inch long; but at last attains the length of two, and sometimes of three inches. In the month of May it prepares for the pupa state; the first care being to find a hole in the tree sufficient to allow the moth to issue forth; and if this cannot be found, it makes one equal in size to the future pupa. It then begins to form of wood a case or cone; uniting the bits, which are very thin, together by silk, into the form of an ellipsoid, the outside being formed of small bits of wood joined together in all directions; taking care, however, that the pointed end of the case may always be opposite to the mouth of the hole; having finished the outside of the case, it lines the inside with a silken tapestry of a close texture in all its parts, except the pointed end, where the texture is looser, in order to facilitate its escape at the proper time. The caterpillar then places itself in such a posture, that the head may always lie towards the opening of the hole in the tree or pointed end of its case. Thus it remains at rest for some time: the colour of the skin first becomes pale, and afterwards brown; the interior parts of the head are detached from the skull; the legs withdraw themselves from the exterior case; the body shortens; the posterior part grows small, while the anterior part swells so much, that the skin at last bursts; and, by a variety of motions, is pushed down to the tail; and thus the pupa is exhibited, in which the parts of the future moth may be easily traced.\n\nThe covering of the pupa, though at first soft, humid, and white, soon dries and hardens, and becomes of a dark purple colour; the posterior part is moveable; but not the fore part, which contains the rudiments of the head, legs, and wings. The fore-part of the pupa is furnished with two horns, one above and the other under the eyes. It has also several rows of points on its back. It remains for some weeks in the case; after which the moth begins to agitate itself, and the points are then of essential service, by acting as a fulcrum, upon which it may rest in its endeavours to proceed forward, and not slip back by its efforts for that purpose.\n\nThe moth generally continues its endeavours to open the case for a quarter of an hour; after which, by redoubled efforts, it enlarges the hole, and presses forward until it arrives at the edge, where it makes a full stop, lest by advancing further it should fall to the ground. After having in this manner repose itself for some time, it begins to disengage itself entirely; and having rested for some hours with its head upwards, it becomes fit for action. Mr Martham says, that it generally pushes one third of the case out of the hole before it halts.\n\nThe body of the caterpillar is divided into twelve rings, marked 1, 2, 3, &c., as represented in figs. 48, 49, 50, 51, each of which is distinguished from that which precedes, and that which follows, by a kind of neck or hollow; and, by forming boundaries to the rings, we make twelve other divisions, likewise expressed in the figures; but to the first of these the word Microscope ring is affixed, and to the second, division. To facilitate the description of this animal, M. Lyonet supposed a line to pass down through the middle of the back, which he called the superior line, because it marked the most elevated part of the back of the caterpillar; and another, passing from the head down the belly to the tail, he called the inferior line.\n\nAll caterpillars have a small organ, resembling an elliptic spot, on the right and left of each ring, excepting the second, third, and last; and by these we are furnished with a further subdivision of this caterpillar, viz. by lines passing through the spiracula, the one on the right side, the other on the left of the caterpillar. These four lines, which divide the caterpillar longitudinally into four equal parts, mark each the place under the skin which is occupied by a considerable viscous. Under the superior line lies the heart, or rather thread of hearts; over the inferior line, the spinal marrow; and the two tracheal arteries follow the course of the lateral lines. At equal distances from the superior and two lateral lines, we may suppose four intermediate lines. The two between the superior and lateral lines are called the intermediate superior; the two others opposite to them, and between the lateral and inferior lines, are called the intermediate inferior.\n\nFig. 48, 49. Show the muscles of the caterpillar, arranged with the most wonderful symmetry and order, especially when taken off by equal strata on both sides, which exhibits an astonishing and exact form and correspondence in them. The figures show the muscles of two different caterpillars opened at the belly, and supposed to be joined together at the superior lines. The muscles of the back are marked by capitals; the gastric muscles by Roman letters; the lateral ones by Greek characters. Those marked A are called, by M. Lyonet, dividing muscles, on account of their situation.\n\nThe caterpillar was prepared for dissection by being emptied, and the muscles, nerves, &c., freed from the fat in the manner formerly directed: after which the following observations were made.\n\nThe muscle A in the first ring is double; the anterior one being thick at top, and being apparently divided into different muscles on the upper side, but without any appearance of this kind on the under side. One insertion is at the skin of the neck towards the head; the other is a little above; and that of the second muscle A is a little below the first spiraculum, near which they are fixed to the skin.\n\nThe muscle marked a is long and slender, fixed by its anterior extremity under the gastric muscles a and b of the first ring, to the circumflex scale of the base of the lower lip. It communicates with the muscle c of the second ring, after having passed under some of the arteries, and introduced itself below the muscle a.\n\nThe muscle b is so tender, that it is scarcely possible to open the belly of the caterpillar without breaking it. It is sometimes double, and sometimes triple. Anteriorly it is fixed to the posterior edge of the side of the parietal scale, the lower fixture being at the middle of the ring near the inferior line.\n\nThere are three muscles marked §; the first affixed\nMicroscope at one extremity near the lower edge of the upper part of the parietal scale; the other end divides itself into three or four tails, fixed to the skin of the caterpillar under the muscle δ. The anterior part of the second is fixed near the first; the anterior part of the third a little under the first and second, at the skin of the neck under the muscle θ. These two last passing over the cavity of the first pair of limbs, are fixed by several tails to the edge opposite to this cavity. In this subject there are two muscles marked δ, but sometimes there is only one anteriorly; they are fixed to the lower edge of the parietal scale, the other ends being inserted in the first fold of the skin of the neck on the belly-side. Fig. 50. best represents the muscles δ and δ; as in that figure they do not appear injured by any unnatural connexion.\n\nIn the second and four following rings we discern two large dorsal muscles A and B. In the 7th, 9th, and 10th rings are three, A, B, and C; in the 11th are four, A, B, C, and D; and in the anterior part of the 12th ring are five, A, B, C, D, and E. All these ranges of muscles, however, as well as the gastric muscles a, b, c, d, appear at first sight only as a single muscle, running nearly the whole length of the caterpillar; but when this is detached from the animal, it is found to consist of so many distinct muscles, each consisting only of the length of one of the rings, their extremities being fixed to the division of each ring, excepting the middle muscle a, which, at the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th rings, has its insertions rather beyond the division. Each row of muscles appears as one, because they are closely connected at top by some of the fibres which pass from one ring to the other.\n\nThe muscles A, which are 12 in number, gradually diminish in breadth to the lower part of the last ring; at the 8th and three following divisions they communicate with the muscles B, and at the 11th with D. In the lower part of the last ring, A is much broader than it was in the preceding ring; one extremity of it is contracted, and communicates with B; the lower insertion being at the membrane I, which is the exterior skin of the fecal bag. The muscles A and B, on the lower part of the last ring, cannot be seen until a large muscle is removed, which on one side is fixed to the subdivision of the ring and on the other to the fecal bag.\n\nThe right muscles B, which are also 12 in number, begin at the second ring, and grow larger from thence to the seventh. They are usually narrower from thence to the 12th; the deficiency in width being supplied by the six muscles C, which accompany it from the 7th to the subdivision of the 12th ring. The muscles B and C communicate laterally with the 8th, 11th, and 12th divisions. C is wanting at the subdivision of the 12th; its place being here supplied by B, which becomes broader at this part.\n\nThe first of the three floating muscles V originates at the first ring, from whence it introduces itself under N, where it is fixed, and then subdivides, and hides itself under other parts. The second begins at the second division, being fixed to the anterior extremity B of the second ring; from thence directing itself towards the stomach; and, after communicating with the case of the corpus crafum, it divides, and spreads into eight muscles which run along the belly. The third begins at the third division, originating partly at the skin, and partly at the junction of the muscles B of the second and third ring. It directs itself obliquely towards the belly, meeting it near the third spiraculum; and branching from thence, it forms the oblique muscles of some of the visceral.\n\nThe thin long muscle δ, which is at the subdivision of the last ring, and covers the anterior insertion of the muscle (a) where the ring terminates, is fugile. It begins at one extremity of the muscle (c); at the fore part of the ring runs along the subdivision round the belly of the caterpillar, and finishes, on the other side, at the extremity of a similar muscle C.\n\nFig. 49. shows the dorsal muscles of the collios. To view which in an advantageous manner, we must use the following mode of preparation.\n\n1. All the dorsal muscles, 35 in number, must be taken out, as well as the seven lateral ones already described.\n\n2. All the straight muscles of the belly must be taken away, as well as the muscular roots (c), and the ends of the gastric muscles (c), which are at the third and fourth divisions.\n\n3. At the second division the muscle δ must be removed; only the extremities being left to show where it was inserted.\n\nThe parts being thus prepared, we begin at the third ring; where there are found four dorsal muscles C, D, E, and F. The first one C, is inserted at the third division, under the muscles δ and a, where it communicates by means of some fibres with the muscle f of the second ring; proceeding from thence obliquely towards the intermediate superior line, and is fixed at the fourth division. As soon as C is retrenched, the muscle D is seen; which grows wider from the anterior extremity; it lies in a contrary direction to the muscle C, and is inserted into the third and fourth divisions. The muscle E lies in the same direction as the middle C, but not so obliquely; the lower insertion is at the fourth division; the other at the third, immediately under C. The muscle F is nearly parallel to D which joins it; the first insertion is visible, but the other is hid under the muscles E and G at the fourth division.\n\nIn the eight following rings, there are only two dorsal muscles; and of these D is the only one that is completely seen. It is very large, and diminishes gradually in breadth from one ring to the other, till it comes to the last, sending off branches in some places.—E is one of the strait muscles of the back; and is inserted under the dividing muscles δ, at the divisions of its own ring.\n\nOn the anterior part of the 12th ring there are three dorsal muscles, D, E, and F. D is similar to that of the preceding ring, marked also D, only that it is no more than half the length; terminating at the subdivision of its own ring. E is of the same length, and differs from the muscle E of the preceding ring only in its direction. F is parallel to E, and shorter than it; its anterior end does not reach the twelfth division.\n\nOn the posterior part there is only one dorsal muscle, fastened by some short ones to the subdivision of the last ring, traversing the muscles a; and being fixed there as if designed to strengthen them, and\nMicroscope to vary their direction.—Is a single muscle, of which the anterior insertion is visible, the other end being fixed to the bottom of the foot of the last leg; its use is to move the foot. The anterior part of the muscle \\( \\beta \\) branches into three or four heads, which cross the superior line obliquely, and are fixed to the skin a little above it. The other end is fastened to the membrane \\( \\Gamma \\).\n\nFig. 50. and 51. show the muscles of the caterpillar when it is opened at the back. The preparation for this view is to disengage the fat and other extraneous matter, as before directed.\n\nThe first ring has only two gastric muscles (c) and (d): the former is broad, and has three or four little tails: the first fixture is at the base of the lower lip, from whence it descends obliquely, and is fixed between the inferior and lateral line. The small muscle (d) is fastened on one side to the first spiraculum; on the other, a little lower, to the intermediate inferior and lateral line; and seems to be an antagonist to the muscle \\( P \\), which opens the spiracula. The posterior fixture of \\( d \\) is under the muscle \\( C \\), near the skin of the neck; \\( \\beta \\) is fixed a little on the other side of \\( C \\), at the middle of the ring.\n\nIn the second ring there are three gastric muscles, \\( g \\), \\( h \\), and \\( i \\); \\( g \\) and \\( h \\) are fixed at the folds which terminate the ring; but only the anterior part of \\( i \\) is fixed there. The muscle \\( h \\) is triple, and in one of the divisions separated into two parts; that marked \\( i \\) comes nearer the inferior line, and is fixed a little beyond the middle of the ring, where the corresponding muscle of the opposite side is forked to receive it.\n\nIn the third ring, the muscle \\( h \\), which was triple in the foregoing ring, is only double here, that part which is nearest the inferior line being broadest: it has three tails, of which only two are visible in the figure. It is exactly similar to that of the preceding ring; and is crossed in the same manner by the muscle from the opposite side of the ring.\n\nThroughout the eight following rings, the muscle \\( f \\) which runs through them all is very broad and strong. The anterior part of it is fixed at the intermediate inferior line, on the fold of the first division of the ring; the other part is fixed beyond the lower division; with this difference, that at the 10th and 11th rings it is fixed at the last fold of its ring; whereas, in the others it passes over that ring, and is inserted into the skin of the following one. In all these, the first extremity of the muscle \\( f \\) is fastened to the fold which separates the ring from the preceding one, and is parallel to \\( f \\), and placed at the side of it. The first six muscles marked \\( g \\), are forked; that of the fourth ring being more so than the rest, nor does it unite till near its anterior insertion. The longest tail lays hold of the following, and is inserted near the inferior line; the other inserts itself near the same line, at about the middle of its own ring; the two last do not branch out; but terminate at the divisions, without reaching the following ring. The muscle \\( h \\), placed at the side of \\( f \\), has nearly the same direction, and finishes at the folds of the ring.\n\nThe anterior part of the 12th ring has only one gastric muscle, marked \\( e \\); it is placed on the intermediate inferior line; and is inserted at the folds of the upper division, and at the subdivision of this ring. The lower part has a larger muscle marked \\( c \\), with several divisions; one placed under \\( b \\), with one extremity fixed near the lateral line, at the subdivision of its ring; the other to the fecal bag, a little lower than the muscle \\( b \\).\n\nIn fig. 51, all the gastric muscles described in fig. 50, disappear, as well as those lateral and dorsal ones of which the letters are not to be found in this figure.\n\nIn the first ring are the gastric muscles, \\( e \\), \\( f \\), \\( g \\), which are best seen here: the first is narrow and long, passing under and crossing \\( f \\); one of its insertions is at the lower line, the other at the lateral, between the spiraculum and neck: \\( f \\) is short, broad, and nearly straight, placed along the intermediate line; but between it and the lateral it passes under \\( e \\), and is fixed to the fold of the skin which goes from the one bag to the other; the lower insertion is near the second division. There are sometimes three muscles of those marked \\( g \\), and sometimes four: the lower parts of them are fixed about the middle of the ring, and the anterior parts at the fold of the skin near the neck. The muscles \\( i \\) and \\( k \\) are fixed to the same fold; the other end of \\( k \\) being fixed under the muscle \\( P \\), near the spiraculum. Above the upper end of \\( f \\), a muscular body, \\( g \\), may be seen. It is formed by the separation of two floating muscles.\n\nThe second ring has six gastric muscles, \\( k \\), \\( l \\), \\( m \\), \\( n \\), \\( o \\), \\( p \\). The first is a large oblique muscle, with three or four divisions placed at the anterior part of the ring: the head is fixed between the inferior line and its intermediate one, at the fold of the second division; from whence it crosses the inferior line and its corresponding muscle, terminating to the right and left of the line. \\( I \\) is a narrow muscle, whose head is fixed to the fold of the second division; the tail of it lying under \\( n \\), and fastened to the edge of the skin that forms the cavity for the leg. The two muscles marked \\( m \\) have the same obliquity, and are placed the one on the other; the head is inserted in the skin under the muscle \\( \\beta \\), and communicates by a number of fibres with the tail of the muscle \\( y \\); the other end is fixed to the intermediate inferior line at the fold of the third division. The large and broad muscle \\( n \\), covers the lower edge of the cavity of the limb, and the extremity of the tail of \\( l \\). It is fixed first at the skin, near the intermediate line, from whence it goes in a perpendicular direction towards \\( m \\), and introduces itself under \\( o \\) and \\( m \\), where it is fixed. The muscle \\( o \\) is narrow and bent, and covers the edge of the cavity of the leg for a little way; one end terminating there, and the other finishing at the third division near \\( m \\). That marked \\( p \\) is also bent: it runs near the anterior edge of the cavity of the leg; one end meets the head of \\( o \\), the other end terminates at a raised fold near the inferior line. There is a triangular muscle on the side of the lateral muscle \\( o \\), similar to that marked \\( g \\) in the following ring; in this figure it is entirely concealed by the muscle \\( m \\).\n\nThe third ring has no muscle similar to \\( m \\); that marked \\( k \\) differs only from that of the second ring in being crossed by the opposite muscle. Those marked \\( l \\), \\( n \\), \\( o \\), \\( p \\), are similar to those of the preceding one. The muscle \\( q \\) is triangular; the base is fastened to the last fold of the ring; on the lower side it is fixed to the muscle \\( o \\), the top to the skin at the edge of the cavity for the leg.\nThe eight following rings have the gastric muscles, i, k, l, and m. The muscle i is quite straight, and placed at some distance from the inferior line; it is broad at the fourth ring, but diminishes gradually in breadth to the 11th. In the fourth it is united; but divides into two heads, which divericate in the following rings. In the next rings these heads are fixed nearly at the same place with a and f; and in the other two it terminates at the fold of the ring. The anterior insertion of the first and last is at the fold where the ring begins; that of the six others is somewhat lower under the place where the muscle i terminates. The lower part of the oblique muscle k is inserted in the skin near i; the upper part at the intermediate inferior muscle upon the fold which separates the following ring, but is wanting in the 11th. The muscle l is large, and co-operates with M: in the opening and shutting the spiraculum, one of its fixtures is near the intermediate inferior line, at about the same height as i. The tail terminates a little below the spiraculum.\n\nThe twelfth ring has only the single gastric muscle d, which is a bundle of six, seven, or eight muscles: the first fixture of these is at the subdivision of the ring near the inferior line: one or two cross this, and at the same time the similar muscles of the opposite side. Their fixture is at the bottom of the foot; and their office is to assist the muscle a in bringing back the foot, and to loosen the claw from what it lays hold of. One of the insertions of this muscle a is observed in this figure near d, the other near the subdivision of the ring.\n\nFig. 52. and 53. show the organization of the head of the coffin, though in a very imperfect manner, as M. Lyonet found it necessary to employ twenty figures to explain it fully. The head is represented as it appears when separated from the fat, and disengaged from the neck. HH are the two palpi. The truncated muscles D belong to the lower lip, and assist moving it. K shows the two ganglions of the neck united. II are the two vessels which assist in spinning the silk. L, the oesophagus. M, the two dissolving vessels. The Hebrew characters מִנְתַּי show the continuation of the four cephalic arteries. In fig. 52. the ten abductor muscles of the jaw are represented by SS, TT, VV, and Z. Four occipital muscles are seen in fig. 53. under ee and ff. At ak is represented a nerve of the first pair belonging to the ganglion of the neck; b is a branch of this nerve.\n\nFig. 54. exhibits the nerves as seen from the under part; but excepting in two or three nerves, which may be easily distinguished, only one of each pair is drawn, in order to avoid confusion. The nerves of the first ganglion of the neck are marked by capital letters, those of the ganglion (a) of the head by Roman letters; the nerves of the small ganglion by Greek characters. Those of the frontal ganglion, except one, by numbers.\n\nThe muscles of the coffin have neither the colour nor form of those of larger animals. In their natural state they are soft, and of the consistence of a jelly. Their colour is a grayish blue, which, with the silver-coloured appearance of the pulmonary vessels, form a glorious spectacle. After the caterpillar has been soaked for some time in spirit of wine, they lose their elasticity and transparency, becoming firm, opaque, and white, and the air-vesicles totally disappear. The number of muscles in a caterpillar is very great. The greatest part of the head is composed of them, and there is a vast number about the oesophagus, intestines, &c.; the skin is, as it were, lined by different beds of them, placed one under the other, and ranged with great symmetry. M. Lyonet has been able to distinguish 228 in the head, 1647 in the body, and 2066 in the intestinal tube, making in all 4241.\n\nAt first sight the muscles might be taken for tendons, as being of the same colour, and having nearly the same lustre. They are generally flat, and of an equal size throughout; the middle seldom differing either in colour or size from either of the extremities. If they are separated, however, by means of very fine needles, in a drop of some fluid, we find them composed not only of fibres, membranes, and air-vesicles, but likewise of nerves; and, from the drops of oil that may be seen floating on the fluid, they appear also to be furnished with many unctuous particles. Their ends are fixed to the skin, but the rest of the muscle is generally free and floating. Several of them branch out considerably; and the branches sometimes extend so far, that it is not easy to discover whether they are distinct and separate muscles or parts of another. They are moderately strong; and those which have been soaked in spirit of wine, when examined by the microscope, are found to be covered with a membrane which may be separated from them; and they appear then to consist of several parallel bands lying longitudinally along the muscle, which, when divided by means of fine needles, appear to be composed of still smaller bundles of fibres lying in the same direction; which, when examined by a powerful magnifier, and in a favourable light, appear twisted like a flaxen cord. The muscular fibres of the spider, which are much larger than those of the caterpillar, consist of two different substances, one soft and the other hard; the latter being twisted round the former spirally, and thus giving it the twisted appearance just mentioned.\n\nThere is nothing in the caterpillar similar to the brain in man. We find indeed in the head of this insect a part from which all the nerves seem to proceed; but this part is entirely unprotected, and so small, that it does not occupy one-fifth part of the head; the surface is smooth, and has neither lobes nor any anastomosis like the human brain. But if we call this a brain in the caterpillar, we must say that it has thirteen: for there are twelve other such parts following each other in a straight line, all of them of the same substance with that in the head, and nearly of the same size; and from them, as well as from that in the head, the nerves are distributed through the body.\n\nThe spinal marrow in the coffin goes along the belly; is very small, forking out at intervals, nearly of the same thickness throughout, except at the ganglions, and is not enclosed in any case. It is by no means so tender as in man; but has a great degree of tenacity, and does not break without a considerable degree of tension. The substance of the ganglions differs from that of the spinal marrow, as no vessels can be discovered in the latter; but the former\nMicroscope, mer are full of very delicate ones. There are 94 principal nerves, which divide into innumerable ramifications.\n\nThe coccus has two large tracheal arteries, creeping under the skin close to the spiracula: one at the right and the other at the left side of the insect, each of them communicating with the air by means of nine spiracula. They are nearly as long as the whole caterpillar; beginning at the first spiraculum, and extending somewhat farther than the last; some branches also extending quite to the extremity of the body. Round each spiraculum the trachea pushes forth a great number of branches, which are again divided into smaller ones, and these further subdivide and spread through the whole body of the caterpillar. The tracheal artery, with all its numerous ramifications, are open elastic vessels, which may be pressed close together, or drawn out considerably, but return immediately to their usual size when the tension ceases. They are naturally of a silver colour, and make a beautiful appearance. This vessel, with its principal branches, is composed of three coats, which may be separated from one another. The outside is a thick membrane furnished with a great variety of fibres, which describe a vast number of circles round it, communicating with each other by numerous shoots. The second is very thin and transparent, without any particular vessel being distinguishable in it. The third is composed of fleshy threads, generally of a spiral form; and so near each other as scarcely to leave any interval. They are curiously united with the membrane which occupies the intervals; and form a tube which is always open, notwithstanding the flexure of the vessel. There are also many other peculiarities in its structure. The principal tracheal vessels divide into 1326 different branches.\n\nThe heart of the coccus is very different from that of larger animals, being almost as long as the animal itself. It lies immediately under the skin at the top of the back, entering the head, and terminating near the mouth. Towards the last rings of the body it is large and capacious, diminishing very much as it approaches the head, from the fourth to the twelfth division. On both sides, at each division, it has an appendage, which partly covers the muscles of the back, but which, growing narrower as it approaches the lateral line, it forms a number of irregular lozenge-shaped bodies. This tube, however, seems to perform none of the functions of the heart in larger animals, as we find no vessel opening into it which answers either to the aorta or vena cava. It is called the heart, because it is generally filled with a kind of lymph, which naturalists have supposed to be the blood of the caterpillar; and because in all caterpillars which have a transparent skin, we may perceive alternate regular contractions and dilatations along the superior line, beginning at the eleventh ring, and proceeding from ring to ring, from the fourth; whence this vessel is thought to be a string or row of hearts. There are two white oblong bodies which join the heart near the eighth division; and these have been called reniform bodies, from their having somewhat of the shape of a kidney.\n\nThe most considerable part of the whole caterpillar with regard to bulk is the corpus callosum. It is the first and only substance that is seen on opening it. It forms a kind of sheath which envelopes and covers all Microcope, the entrails, and introducing itself into the head, enters all the muscles of the body, filling the greatest part of the empty spaces in the caterpillar. It very much resembles the configuration of the human brain, and is of a milk-white colour.\n\nThe oesophagus descends from the bottom of the mouth to about the fourth division. The fore part, which is in the head, is fleshy, narrow, and fixed by different muscles to the cruralaceous parts of it; the lower part, which passes into the body, is wider, and forms a kind of membranaceous bag, covered with very small muscles; near the stomach it is narrower, and, as it were, confined by a strong nerve fixed to it at distant intervals. The ventricle begins a little above the fourth division, where the oesophagus ends, and finishes at the tenth. It is about seven times as long as broad; and the anterior part, which is broadest, is generally folded. These folds diminish with the bulk as it approaches the intestines; the surface is covered with a great number of aerial vessels, and opens into a tube, which M. Lyonet calls the large intestine.—There are three of these large tubes, each of which differs so much from the rest, as to require a particular name to distinguish it from them.\n\nThe two vessels from which the coccus spins its silk are often above three inches long, and are distinguished into three parts; the anterior, intermediate, and posterior. It has likewise two other vessels, which are supposed to prepare and contain the liquor for dissolving the wood on which it feeds.\n\nFig. 55. shows the wing of an earwig magnified; Plate a represents it of the natural size. The wings of this insect are so artificially folded up under short cases, that few people imagine they have any. Indeed, they very rarely make use of their wings. The cases under which they are concealed are not more than a fifth part of the size of one wing, though a small part of the wing may be discovered, on a careful inspection, projecting from under them. The upper part of the wing is cruralaceous and opaque, but the under part is beautifully transparent. In putting up their wings, they first fold back the parts AB, and then shut up the ribs like a fan; the strong muscles used for this purpose being seen at the upper part of the figure. Some of the ribs are extended from the centre to the outer edge; others only from the edge about half way; but they are all united by a kind of band, at a small but equal distance from the edge; the whole evidently contrived to strengthen the wing, and facilitate its various motions. The insect itself differs very little in appearance in its three different states. De Geer affirms, that the female hatches eggs like a hen, and broods over her young ones as a hen does.\n\nFig. 56. represents a wing of the hemerobius perla magnified. It is an insect which seldom lives more than two or three days.—The wings are nearly of a length, and exactly similar to one another. They are composed of fine delicate nerves, regularly and elegantly disposed as in the figure, beautifully adorned with hairs, and lightly tinged with green. The body is of a fine green colour; and its eyes appear like two burnished beads of gold, whence it has obtained the name of golden eye. This insect lays its eggs on the leaves of the plum or the rose tree; the eggs are of a white colour,\nMicroscope colour, and each of them fixed to a little pedicle or foot-stalk, by which means they stand off a little from the leaf, appearing like the fructification of some of the moths. The larva proceeding from these eggs resembles that of the coccinella or lady-cow, but is much more handsome. Like that, it feeds upon aphides or pucerons, sucking their blood, and forming itself a case with their dried bodies; in which it changes into the pupa state, from whence they afterwards emerge in the form of a fly.\n\nFig. E, F, I, represent the dust of a moth's wing magnified. This is of different figures in different moths. The natural size of these small plumes is represented at H.\n\nFig. 57. shows a part of the cornea of the libellula magnified. In some positions of the light, the sides of the hexagons appear of a fine gold colour, and divided by three parallel lines. The natural size of the part magnified is shown at b.\n\nFig. 58. shows the part c of a lobster's cornea magnified.\n\nFig. 59. shows one of the arms or horns of the lepas anatifa, or barnacle, magnified; its natural size being represented at d. Each horn consists of several joints, and each joint is furnished on the concave side of the arm with long hairs. When viewed in the microscope, the arms appear rather opaque; but they may be rendered transparent, and become a most beautiful object, by extracting out of the interior cavity a bundle of longitudinal fibres, which runs the whole length of the arm. Mr Needham thinks that the motion and use of these arms may illustrate the nature of the rotatory motion in the wheel-animal. In the midst of the arms is an hollow trunk, consisting of a jointed hairy tube, which encloses a long round tongue that can be pushed occasionally out of the tube or sheath, and retracted occasionally. The mouth of the animal consists of six laminae, which go off with a bend, indented like a saw on the convex edge, and by their circular disposition are so ranged, that the teeth, in the alternate elevation and depression of each plate, act against whatever comes between them. The plates are placed together in such a manner, that to the naked eye they form an aperture not much unlike the mouth of a contracted purse.\n\nFig. 60. shows the apparatus of the tabanus or gad-fly, by which it pierces the skin of horses and oxen, in order to suck the blood. The whole is contained in a fleathy case, not expressed in the figure. The feelers a a are of a spongy texture and gray coloured, covered with short hairs. They are united to the head by a small joint of the same substance. They defend the other parts of the apparatus, being laid upon it side by side whenever the animal stings, and thus preserve it from external injury. The wound is made by the two lancets b b and B, which are of a delicate structure, but very sharp, formed like the dissecting knife of an anatomist, growing gradually thicker to the back.—The two instruments c c and C, appear as if intended to enlarge the wound, by irritating the parts round it; for which they are jagged or toothed. They may also serve, from their hard and horny texture, to defend the tube e E, which is of a softer nature, and tubular to admit the blood, and convey it to the stomach. This part is totally enclosed in a line d D, which entirely covers it. These parts are drawn separately at B, C, D, E.\n\nDe Geer observes, that only the females suck the blood of animals; and Reaumur informs us, that having made one, that had sucked its fill, disgorge itself, the blood it threw up appeared to him to be more than the whole body of the insect could have contained.

Some are long; others round, square, &c., varying considerably not only in different fishes, but even in different parts of the same fish. Leeuwenhoek supposed them to consist of an infinite number of small scales or frata, of which those next to the body of the fish are the largest. When viewed by the microscope, we find some of them ornamented with a prodigious number of concentric flutings, too near each other, and too fine, to be easily enumerated. These flutings are frequently traversed by others diverging from the centre of the scale, and generally proceeding from thence in a straight line to the circumference.\n\nFor more full information concerning these and other microscopic objects, the reader may consult Mr Adams's Essays on the Microscope, who has made the most valuable collection that has yet appeared on the subject. See also the articles ANIMALULE, CRYSTALLIZATION, POLYPY, PLANTS, and WOOD, in the present work.\n\nMIDAS, in Fabulous History, a famous king of Phrygia, who having received Bacchus with great magnificence, that god, out of gratitude, offered to grant him whatever he should ask. Midas desired that every thing he touched should be changed into gold. Bacchus consented; and Midas, with extreme pleasure, everywhere found the effects of his touch. But he had soon reason to repent of his folly; for wanting to eat and drink, the aliments no sooner entered his mouth than they were changed in gold. This obliged him to have recourse to Bacchus again, to beseech him to restore him to his former state; on which the god ordered him to bathe in the river Pactolus, which from thence forward had golden lands. Some time after, being chosen judge between Pan and Apollo, he gave another instance of his folly and bad taste, in preferring Pan's music to Apollo's; on which the latter being enraged, gave him a pair of asses' ears. This Midas attempted to conceal from the knowledge of his subjects: but one of his servants saw the length of his ears, and being unable to keep the secret, yet afraid to reveal\nveal it from apprehension of the king's resentment, he opened a hole in the earth, and after he had whispered there that Midas had the ears of an ass, he covered the place as before, as if he had buried his words in the ground. On that place, as the poets mention, grew a number of reeds, which when agitated by the wind uttered the same sound that had been buried beneath, and published to the world that Midas had the ears of an ass. Some explain the fable of the ears of Midas, by the supposition that he kept a number of informers and spies, who were continually employed in gathering every fictitious word that might drop from the mouths of his subjects. Midas, according to Strabo, died of drinking bull's hot blood. This he did, as Plutarch mentions, to free himself from the numerous ill dreams which continually tormented him. Midas, according to some, was son of Cybele. He built a town which he called Ancyra.\n\nMIDAS, Ear-shell. See HALIOTIS, CONCHOLOGY Index.\n\nMID-HEAVEN, the point of the ecliptic that culminates, or in which it cuts the meridian.\n\nMIDDLEBURG, one of the Friendly islands in the South sea. The island was first discovered by Tasman, a Dutch navigator, in January 1742-3; and is called by the natives Ea-Oo-whe: it is about 16 miles from north to south, and in the widest part about 8 miles from east to west. The skirts are chiefly laid out in plantations, the south-west and north-west sides especially. The interior parts are but little cultivated, though very capable of it; but this neglect adds greatly to the beauty of the island; for here are agreeably dispersed groves of cocoa-nuts and other trees, lawns covered with thick grass, here and there plantations and paths leading to every part of the island, in such beautiful disorder, as greatly to enliven the prospect. The hills are low; the air is delightful; but unfortunately water is denied to this charming spot. Yams, with other roots, bananas, and bread-fruit, are the principal articles of food; but the latter appeared to be scarce. Here is the pepper tree, or ava-ava, with which they make an intoxicating liquor, in the same disgusting manner as is practised in the Society islands. Here are several odoriferous trees and shrubs, particularly a species of the lemon tribe; and the botanical gentlemen met with various new species of plants. Here also are a few hogs and fowls.\n\nThere are no towns or villages; most of the houses are built in plantations, which are laid out in different parts, with no other order than what convenience requires. They are neatly constructed, but are less roomy and convenient than those in the Society isles. The floors are a little raised, and covered with thick strong mats. The same sort of matting serves to enclose them on the windward side, the others being open. They have little areas before most of them, which are planted round with trees or ornamental shrubs, whose fragrance perfumes the air. Their household furniture consists of a few wooden platters, cocoa-nut shells, and pillows made of wood, and shaped like four-footed stools or forms: their common clothing, with the addition of a mat, serves them for bedding.\n\nThe natives are of a clear mahogany or chestnut brown, with black hair, in short frizzled curls, which seems to be burnt at the tips; their beards are cut or shaven. The general stature of the men is equal to our middle size, from five feet three to five feet ten inches; the proportions of the body are very fine, and the contours of the limbs extremely elegant, though something more muscular than at Otaheite, which may be owing to a greater and more constant exertion of strength in their agriculture and domestic economy. Their features are extremely mild and pleasing; and differ from the old Otaheitian faces in being more oblong than round, the nose sharper, and the lips rather thinner. The women are, in general, a few inches shorter than the men, but not so small as the lower class of women at the Society islands. The practice of puncturing the skin, and blacking it, which is called tatowining, is in full force among the men here, for their belly and loins are very strongly marked in configurations more compounded than those at Otaheite. The tenderest parts of the body were not free from these punctures; the application of which, besides being very painful, must be extremely dangerous on glandulous extremities.\n\nThe men in general go almost naked, having only a small piece of cloth round the loins, but some wrap it in great abundance round them from their waist: this cloth is manufactured much like that at Otaheite, but overspread with a strong glue, which makes it stiff, and fit to resist the wet. The women are likewise covered from the waist downwards; they often have loose necklaces, consisting of several strings of small shells, seeds, teeth of fishes; and in the middle of all, the round operculum, or cover of a shell as large as a crown-piece. The men frequently wear a string round their necks, from which a mother-of-pearl shell hangs down on the breast; both the ears of the women were perforated with two holes, and a cylinder cut out of tortoise-shell or bone was stuck through both the holes. The most remarkable circumstance observed of this people was, that most of them wanted the little finger on one, and sometimes on both hands: the difference of sex or age did not exempt them from this amputation; for even among the few children that were seen running about naked, the greater part had already suffered such loss. This circumstance was observed by Tasman. Another singularity which was observed to be very general among these people, was a round spot on each cheek-bone, which appeared to have been burnt or blistered. On some it seemed to have been recently made, or others it was covered with scurf, and many had only a slight mark of its former existence: how, or for what purpose it was made, could not be learnt. The women here, in general, were reserved; and turned, with difficulty, from the immodest behaviour of ungovernable females: there were not, however, wanting some who appeared to be of easy virtue, and invited their lovers with lascivious gestures. The language spoken here is soft, and not unpleasing; and whatever they said was spoken in a kind of singing tone. Omai and Mahine, who were both passengers on board the ship, at first declared that the language was totally new and unintelligible to them; however, the affinity of several words being pointed out, they soon caught the particular modification of this dialect, and conversed much better with the natives than any on board the ships could have done, after a long intercourse. They have the neat-\nornaments imaginable, consisting of a number of little flat sticks, about five inches long, of a yellow wood like box, firmly and elegantly connected together at the bottom by a tissue of the fibres of cocoanut, some of which were of their natural colour, and others dyed black; the same fibres were likewise used in the making of baskets, the tails of which was highly elegant, and varied into different forms and patterns. Their clubs are of a great variety of shapes, and many of them so ponderous as scarcely to be managed with one hand. The most common form was quadrangular, so as to make a rhomboid at the broad end, and gradually tapering into a round handle at the other. Far the greater part were carved all over in many chequered patterns, which seemed to have required a long space of time, and incredible patience, to work up; as a sharp stone, or a piece of coral, are the only tools made use of: the whole surface of the plain clubs was as highly polished as if an European workman had made them with the best instruments. Besides clubs, they have spears of the same wood, which were sometimes plain sharp-pointed sticks, and sometimes barbed with a flint-ray's tail. They have likewise bows and arrows of a peculiar construction: the bow, which is six feet long, is about the thickness of a little finger, and when slack forms a slight curve; its convex part is channelled with a single deep groove, in which the bow-string is lodged. The arrow is made of reed, near six feet long, and pointed with hard wood; when the bow is to be bent, instead of drawing it so as to increase the natural curvature, they draw it the contrary way, make it perfectly straight, and then form the curve on the other side. Most of their canoes have outriggers, made of poles; and their workmanship is very admirable: two of these canoes are joined together with a surprising exactness, and the whole surface receives a very curious polish. Their paddles have short broad blades, something like those of Otaheite, but more neatly wrought and of better wood.\n\nThey keep their dead above ground, after the manner of the Society islands; as a corpse was seen deposited on a low hut.\n\nHere were seen several men and women afflicted with leprous diseases, in some of whom the disorder had risen to a high degree of virulence: one man in particular had his back and shoulders covered with a large cancerous ulcer, which was perfectly livid within, and of a bright yellow all round the edges. A woman was likewise unfortunate enough to have her face destroyed by it in the most shocking manner; there was only a hole left in the place of her nose; her cheek was swelled up, and continually oozing out a purulent matter; and her eyes seemed ready to fall out of her head, being bloody and sore. Though these were some of the most miserable objects that could possibly be seen, yet they seemed to be quite unconcerned about their misfortunes, and traded as briskly as any of the rest.\n\nMIDDLEHAM, a town in the north riding of Yorkshire, situated on the river Ure, 255 miles from London. It had once a castle, where was born Edward prince of Wales, only son of Richard III.; and is noted for a woollen manufacture and frequent horse-races. Its market is on Monday; and fairs Nov. 6. and 7. The town stands on a rising ground; and the castle, which was on the south side, was formerly Middlesex, moated round by the help of a spring conveyed in pipes from the higher grounds.\n\nMIDDLESEX, a county of England, which derives its name from its situation amidst the three kingdoms of the East, West, and South Saxons. It is bounded on the north by Hertfordshire; on the south by the river Thames, which divides it from Surrey; on the west by the river Colne, which separates it from Buckinghamshire; and on the east by the river Lea, which divides it from Essex. It extends about 23 miles in length, but hardly 14 in breadth, and is not more than 115 in circumference; but as it comprehends the two vast cities of London and Westminster, which are situated in the south-east part of the country, it is by far the wealthiest and most populous county in England. It is divided into 602 liberties, containing 200 parishes, besides a vast number of chapels of ease, and 5 market towns, exclusive of the cities of London and Westminster. The air is very pleasant and healthy, to which a fine gravelly soil does not a little contribute. The soil produces plenty of corn, and the county abounds with fertile meadows and gardeners' grounds. In a word, the greater part of the county is so prodigiously affluted by the rich compost from London, that the whole of the cultivated part may be considered as a garden. The natural productions are cattle, corn, and fruit; but its manufactures are too many to be enumerated here, there being hardly a single manufacture practised in Great Britain but what is also established in this county.—Though London is the chief city, Brentford is the county town where the members of parliament are elected. It contains 77,712 houses, inhabited by 139,742 families, containing 3,409,583 males, and 2,943,717 females, so that the whole amount of its population is 6,353,299 persons.\n\nMIDDLESEX is also the name of four different counties in the United States of America; one of them is in Massachusetts, another in Connecticut, a third in New Jersey, and the fourth in Virginia.\n\nMIDDLETON, Dr Conyers, a very celebrated English divine, the son of a clergyman in Yorkshire, was born at Richmond in 1683. He distinguished himself, while fellow of Trinity college, Cambridge, by his controversy with Dr Bentley his master, relating to some mercenary conduct of the latter in that station. He afterwards had a controversy with the whole body of physicians, on the dignity of the medical profession; concerning which he published De medicorum apud veteres Romanos deputatim conditione disputatione; qua, contra viros celeberrimos Jacobum Sponium et Richardum Medium, servilem atque ignobilem eam, fuisset offenditur: and in the course of this dispute much resentment and many pamphlets appeared. Hitherto he had stood well with his clerical brethren; but he drew the resentment of the church on him in 1729, by writing \"A Letter from Rome, showing an exact conformity between Popery and Paganism,\" &c.; as this letter, though politely written, yet attacked Popish miracles with a gaiety that appeared dangerous to the cause of miracles in general. Nor were his Objections to Dr Waterland's manner of vindicating Scripture against Tindal's \"Christianity as old as the Creation,\" looked on in a more favourable point of view. In 1741, came out his great work, \"The history of the life of M. Tullius Cicero,\"\nCicero,\" 2 vols 4to; which is indeed a fine performance, and will probably be read as long as taste and polite literature subsist among us: the author has nevertheless fallen into the common error of biographers, who often give panegyrics instead of history. In 1748, he published, \"A free inquiry into the miraculous powers which are supposed to have subsisted in the Christian church from the earliest ages, through several successive centuries.\" He was now attacked from all quarters; but before he took any notice of his antagonists, he supplied them with another subject, in \"An examination of the Lord Bishop of London's discourses concerning the use and extent of prophecy,\" &c. Thus Dr Middleton continued to display talents and learning, which are highly esteemed by men of a free turn of mind, but by no means in a method calculated to invite promotion in the clerical line. He was in 1723 chosen principal librarian of the public library at Cambridge; and if he rose not to dignities in the church, he was in easy circumstances, which permitted him to affect a dignity of mind often forgotten in the career of preferment. He died in 1759, at Hildersham in Cambridgeshire, an estate of his own purchasing; and in 1752, all his works, except the life of Cicero, were collected in 4 vols, 4to.\n\nMIDDLEWICH, a town of Cheshire, 167 miles from London. It stands near the confluence of the Croke and Dan, where are two salt-water springs, from which are made great quantities of salt, the brine being said to be so strong as to produce a full fourth part salt. It is an ancient borough, governed by burgesses; and its parish extends into many adjacent townships. It has a spacious church. By means of inland navigation, it has communication with the rivers Mersey, Dee, Ribble, Ouse, Trent, Darwent, Severn, Humber, Thames, Avon, &c., which navigation, including its windings, extends above 500 miles, in the counties of Lincoln, Nottingham, York, Lancaster, Westmoreland, Stafford, Warwick, Leicester, Oxford, Worcester, &c. The river Wheelock, after a course of about 12 miles from Mowcop-hill, runs into the Dan a little above this town.\n\nMIDHURST, a town of Sussex, 52 miles from London, has been represented in parliament every since the 4th of Edward II. It is a neat small town, on a hill surrounded with others, having the river Arun at the bottom; and is a borough by prescription, governed by a bailiff, chosen annually by a jury at a court-leet of the lord of the manor.\n\nMIDIAN, or MADIAN, in Ancient Geography, a town on the south side of Arabia Petraea, so called from one of the sons of Abraham by Keturah.—Another Midian, near the Arnon and Joppolis, in ruins in Jerome's time. With the daughters of these Midianites the Israelites committed fornication, and were guilty of idolatry. A branch of the Midianites dwelt on the Arabian gulf, and were called Kenites: some of whom turned profelytes, and dwelt with the Israelites in the land of Canaan.\n\nMIDLOTHIAN. See LOTHIAN and EDINBURGHSHIRE.\n\nMIDSHIP-FRAME, a name given to that timber, or combination of pieces formed into one timber, which determines the extreme breadth of the ship, as well as the figure and dimension of all the inferior timbers.\n\nIn the article SHIP-Building, the reader will find a full explanation of what is meant by a frame of timbers. He will also perceive the outlines of all the principal frames, with their gradual dimensions, from the midship-frame, delineated in the plane of projection annexed to that article.\n\nMIDSHIPMAN, a sort of naval cadet, appointed by the captain of a ship of war, to second the orders of the superior officers, and assist in the necessary business of the vessel, either aboard or ashore.\n\nThe number of midshipmen, like that of several other officers, is always in proportion to the size of the ship to which they belong. Thus a first-rate man of war has 24, and the inferior rates a suitable number in proportion. No person can be appointed lieutenant without having previously served two years in the royal navy in this capacity, or in that of mate, besides having been at least four years in actual service at sea, either in merchant ships or in the royal navy.\n\nMidshipman is accordingly the station in which a young volunteer is trained in the several exercises necessary to attain a sufficient knowledge of the machinery, movements, and military operations of a ship, to qualify him for a sea officer.\n\nOn his first entrance in a ship of war, every midshipman has several disadvantageous circumstances to encounter. These are partly occasioned by the nature of the sea service; and partly by the mistaken prejudices of people in general respecting naval discipline, and the genius of sailors and their officers. No character, in their opinion, is more excellent than that of the common sailor, whom they generally suppose to be treated with great severity by his officers, drawing a comparison between them not very advantageous to the latter. The midshipman usually comes aboard tainted with these prejudices, especially if his education has been amongst the higher rank of people; and if the officers happen to answer his opinion, he conceives an early disgust to the service, from a very partial and incompetent view of its operations. Blinded by these prepossessions, he is thrown off his guard, and very soon surprised to find, amongst those honest sailors, a crew of abandoned miscreants, ripe for any mischief or villany. Perhaps, after a little observation, many of them will appear to him equally destitute of gratitude, shame, or justice, and only deterred from the commission of any crimes by the terror of severe punishment. He will discover, that the pernicious example of a few of the vilest in a ship of war is too often apt to poison the principles of the greatest number, especially if the reins of discipline are too much relaxed, so as to foster that idleness and dissipation, which engender sloth, diseases, and an utter profligacy of manners. If the midshipman on many occasions is obliged to mix with these, particularly in the exercises of extending or reducing the sails in the tops, he ought resolutely to guard against this contagion, with which the morals of his inferiors may be infected. He should, however, avail himself of their knowledge, and acquire their expertise in managing and fixing the sails and rigging, and never suffer himself to be excelled by an inferior. He will probably find a virtue in almost every\nevery private sailor, which is entirely unknown to many of his officers; that virtue is emulation, which is not indeed mentioned among their qualities by the gentlemen of terra firma, by whom their characters are often copiously described with very little judgement. There is hardly a common tar who is not envious of superior skill in his fellows, and jealous on all occasions to be outdone in what he considers as a branch of his duty: nor is he more afraid of the dreadful consequences of whittling in a storm, than of being flippantized with the opprobrious epithet of lubber. Fortified against this scandal, by a thorough knowledge of his business, the sailor will sometimes sneer in private at the execution of orders which to him appear awkward, improper, or unlike a seaman. Nay, he will perhaps be malicious enough to suppress his own judgement, and, by a punctual obedience to command, execute whatever is to be performed in a manner which he knows to be improper, in order to expose the person commanding to disgrace and ridicule. Little skilled in the method of the schools, he considers the officer who cons his lesson by rote as very ill qualified for his station, because particular situations might render it necessary for the said officer to assist at putting his own orders in practice. An ignorance in this practical knowledge will therefore necessarily be thought an unpardonable deficiency by those who are to follow his directions. Hence the midshipman who affiliates with these sailors in the tops, till he has acquired a competent skill in the service of extending or reducing the sails, &c. will be often entertained with a number of scurrilous jests, at the expense of his superiors. Hence also he will learn, that a timely application to those exercises can only prevent him from appearing in the same despicable point of view, which must certainly be a cruel mortification to a man of the smallest sensibility.\n\nIf the midshipman is not employed in these services, which are undoubtedly necessary to give him a clearer idea of the different parts of his occupation, a variety of other objects present themselves to his attention. Without presuming to dictate the studies which are most essential to his improvement, we could wish to recommend such as are most suitable to the bent of his inclination. Astronomy, geometry, and mechanics, which are in the first rank of science, are the materials which form the skilful pilot and the superior mariner. The theory of navigation is entirely derived from the two former, and all the machinery and movements of a ship are founded upon the latter. The action of the wind upon the sails, and the resistance of the water at the stem, naturally dictate an inquiry into the property of solids and fluids; and the state of the ship, floating on the water, seems to direct his application to the study of hydrostatics, and the effects of gravity. A proficiency in these branches of science will equally enlarge his views, with regard to the operations of naval war, as directed by the efforts of powder and the knowledge of projectiles. The most effectual method to excite his application to these studies, is, perhaps, by looking round the navy, to observe the characters of individuals. By this inquiry he will probably discover, that the officer who is eminently skilled in the sciences, will command universal respect and approbation; and that whoever is satisfied with the despicable ambition of shining the hero of an assembly, will be the object of universal contempt. The attention of the former will be engaged in those studies which are highly useful to himself in particular, and to the service in general. The employment of the latter is to acquire those superficial accomplishments, that unbend the mind from every useful science, enervate the judgement, and render the hero infinitely more dexterous at falling into his station in the dance than in the line of battle.\n\nUnless the midshipman has an unconquerable aversion to the acquisition of those qualifications which are so essential to his improvement, he will very rarely want opportunities of making a progress therein. Every step he advances in those meritorious employments will facilitate his accession to the next in order. If the dunces, who are his officers or messmates, are rattling the dice, roaring bad verses, hissing on the flute, or scraping discord from the fiddle, his attention to more noble studies will sweeten the hours of relaxation. He should recollect, that no example from fools ought to influence his conduct, or seduce him from that laudable ambition which his honour and advantage are equally concerned to pursue.\n\nMIDWIFE, one whose profession is to deliver women in labour. See MIDWIFERY.\n\nMIDWIFERY,\n\nDefinition. THE art of assisting women in labour. In a more extended sense, it is understood to comprehend also the treatment of the diseases of women and children. In this work we shall consider it in the former limited sense, viz. as relating to the birth of the offspring of man.\n\nHistory of Midwifery.—It must be very obvious that this art must have been almost coeval with mankind: but in Europe it continued in a very rude state till the 17th century; and even after physic and surgery had become distinct professions, it remained almost totally uncultivated.\n\nIt is a curious fact, that in the empire of China the very reverse of this has taken place. In that empire, according to the latest accounts, both physic and surgery are still in a state of the utmost degradation, even more so than among the savages of America; but for some hundred years, the art of midwifery has been practised by a set of men destined to the purpose by order of government. These men, who hold in society the same rank which lithotomists did in this country about the beginning of last century, are called in whenever a woman has been above a certain number of hours in labour, and employ a mechanical contrivance...\nfor completing the delivery without injury to the infant. A certain number of such individuals is allotted to each district of a certain population.\n\nIt is said, that the Chinese government was led to make this provision for alleviating the sufferings of child-bearing women, in consequence of a representation, that annually many women died undelivered, and that in the majority of cases the cause of obstruction might have been removed by very simple mechanical expedients.\n\nBoth Sir George Staunton and Mr Barrow were ignorant of this fact; and the latter in particular expressly mentions, that there are no men-midwives in China. But the writer of this article had his information from a more authentic source than the works of gentlemen who were only a few months in that country, and were in a great measure treated as state prisoners. He has it, through the medium of a friend, from a gentleman who resided upwards of twenty years as surgeon to the British factory at Canton, and who had both the ability and the inclination to learn, during the course of so long a residence, all the customs and prejudices of the natives relating to the preservation of human health.\n\nTowards the end of the 17th century, the same causes which had so long before led to the cultivation of midwifery in China produced the same effect in Europe. The dangers to which women are sometimes exposed during labour excited the compassion of the benevolent; so that a considerable part of the first hospital which was established for the reception of the indigent sick, the Hotel Dieu of Paris, was appropriated to lying in women.\n\nThe opportunities of practice which that hospital afforded, directed the attention of medical men to the numerous accidents which happen during labour, and to the various diseases which occur after delivery. Public teaching followed, and soon after the custom of employing men in the practice of midwifery began.\n\nFrom this period the art became rapidly improved; and it is now in many parts of Europe, and particularly in Great Britain, in as great a state of perfection as physic or surgery.\n\nIn the year 1725, a professorship of midwifery was established in the university of Edinburgh; and the town council at the same time ordained, that no woman should be allowed to practise midwifery within the liberties of the city, without having previously obtained a certificate from the professor of her being properly qualified. This salutary regulation has fallen into desuetude.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the improvement of the art of midwifery was chiefly in consequence of medical men directing their attention to the subject; but the propriety of men being employed in such a profession is much questioned by many individuals of considerate reflection.\n\nDr John Gregory, in his Comparative View, p. 22, says, \"every other animal brings forth its young without any assistance, but we think a midwife understands it better.\" Had this eminent philosopher said, \"other animals content themselves with the clothing which providence has bestowed, but we think it necessary to cover our bodies with the workmanship of weavers,\" very few in this northern climate would have attended to the finer. His son, the present professor, has improved upon the idea. He seems to suppose that women without any instruction, and of course without any knowledge of the subject, are capable of afflicting one another while in labour; and in the sportiveness of his lively imagination, he compares men-midwives to that species of frog, in which, according to the allegation of Reaumur, the male draws out the ova from the female, or, to use the naturalist's words, \"accouche la femelle.\"\n\nIt appears to us that this question, on which much declamation has been employed by the parties who have agitated it, may be brought within a very narrow compass. It may be assumed as a fact established beyond the reach of controversy, that sometimes dangers and difficulties occur during labour (from causes to be explained in a subsequent part of this essay), which can be lessened or removed by those only who have an intimate knowledge of the structure of the human body and of the practice of physic. On such occasions, it must be admitted, medical men alone can be useful. But as such labours occur only in the proportion of two or three in the hundred, the general practice might be confided to midwives, if they could be taught to manage ordinary cases, and to foresee and distinguish difficulties or dangers, so as to procure in sufficient time additional assistance. It is on this point that the decision of the question must depend. It consists with the knowledge of the writer of this article, that women may be taught all this. But there are many who allege, that a little knowledge being a dangerous thing, midwives acquire a self-sufficiency which renders them averse from calling in superior assistance, and that, in consequence, they often occasion the most deplorable accidents both to mother and child. In England this is the popular opinion, so that there women are almost entirely excluded from the practice of midwifery. A similar prejudice against midwives has, it is believed, begun in some parts of Scotland; but it is presumed this will gradually cease, when it is considered that, in general, the Scotch midwives are regularly instructed, and are at the same time both virtuous and industrious. If they attend strictly to their duty, and invariably prefer their patients safety to their own feelings or supposed interest, they will deservedly retain the public confidence. But if in cases of difficulty or danger they trust to their own exertions, or from interested motives decline the assistance of able practitioners, and if they interfere in the treatment of the diseases of women and children, they will in a few years be excluded from practice.\n\nDivision of the subject. In order to exhibit an accurate view of what relates to the birth of man, we shall consider, in the first place, conception; secondly, the effects of impregnation; thirdly, the act of childbearing; and lastly, the deviations from the ordinary course which sometimes happen. These topics will form the subjects of the following chapters.\n\nCHAP. I. Of Conception.\n\nThree circumstances are required for conception in the human race, viz. puberty; a healthy, vigorous, and natural state of the parts subservient to the operation in both sexes; and successful sexual intercourse.\n\n1. The age of puberty in women differs considerably\nin different climates. In Europe it takes place commonly between the fourteenth and sixteenth year. This important era is marked by certain changes both in the mind and body. The girl feels sensations to which she had been formerly unaccustomed. She loses a relish for her former amusements, and even for her youthful companions. She seeks solitude, indulges in the depressing passions, and these are excited by the most apparently trifling causes. She feels occasionally certain desires which modify repulses; and it is by degrees only that she regains her former tranquillity.\n\nThe changes in her body are even more strongly marked than those in her mind. Her breasts assume that form which adds to the beauty of her person, and renders them fit for nourishing her infant; and every part of the genital system is enlarged. A periodical discharge from the uterus renders the woman perfect.\n\nIn young men the same causes produce very different effects. The lad, about fifteen or sixteen, feels a great increase of strength; his features expand, his voice becomes rough, his step firm, his body athletic; and he engages voluntarily in exercises which require an exertion of strength and activity. The changes in his mind are as strongly marked as those in his body. He loses that reflex puerility which had distinguished his early years, and becomes capable of attending steadily to one object. His behaviour to the fair sex is suddenly altered. He no longer thaws that contempt for women, which he had formerly betrayed. He is softened, approaches them with deference, and experiences a degree of pleasure in their company, for which he can scarcely account. In him too there is an important change in the condition of the genital organs.\n\n2. Unless the parts which constitute peculiarity of sex be in a healthy, vigorous, and natural state, conception cannot take place.\n\nIn women, conception is prevented if the organs be too much relaxed; if there be obstruction between the external and internal parts; if any premature discharge take place from the internal parts; if the menstrual evacuation be not natural in every respect, and if the appendages of the uterus, called fallopian tubes, and ovaria, be not of the natural structure.\n\nIn men, the same circumstance happens if the organs be too much relaxed; if the orifice of the urethra be in an improper situation; if the urethra be diseased; if the testes be not in a natural healthy state; and if there be any defect in the erection of penis, which prevents the proper erection of that organ.\n\n3. The sexual intercourse cannot be successful unless somewhat necessary for conception be furnished by both sexes. This consists in the male of a fluid secreted by the testes; and in the female, of the detachment of a substance, supposed to resemble a very minute vehicle situated in the ovarium, and called by physiologists ovum. Each ovarium contains a number of these vesicles. After every conception, certain marks of the detachment of the ovum remain in the respective ovarium.\n\nWhen the circumstances required for conception occur, a being is produced which generally resembles both parents. This resemblance is most strikingly marked in the human subject, when one of the parents is an European, and the other an African. What is called a mulatto is produced.\n\nThe human race possesses the power of propagation in common with all the other species of the animal kingdom, and also, it has been said, with the vegetable kingdom.\n\nAs generation then, as it has been styled, is common to two of the kingdoms of nature, it has been imagined by ingenious men, that this wonderful operation is regulated in both by a certain general law. But they have differed much in their account of this law. The question at issue between the two parties is whether the embryos of animals be prepared by the sexual intercourse out of inorganic materials, or whether they pre-exist in the bodies of animals, and are only developed as it were by that intercourse. The former of these opinions is called the doctrine of epigenesis, the latter that of evolution.\n\nBoth doctrines have been maintained with much ingenuity by equally respectable authorities. Negative arguments have been adduced in favour of the one, positive in support of the other, and it must be confessed that the balance between them seems nearly equal. The preexistence of ova in the oviparous animals appears a positive argument in favour of evolution; but the satirical remark of a late witty author, * that, were Blumenbach's theory true, every individual of the human race must have been lodged in the ovaria of our first parent, by affording a negative argument in favour of epigenesis, restores the balance.\n\nThe various arguments advanced on each side by the opposite parties in this dispute are so very numerous, that we cannot attempt to detail them in this work; and on a subject which has divided the opinions of so many able physiologists, it would be presumption to decide prematurely.\n\nIf generation be regarded as an animal operation, one is led to inquire whether the product be the result of the combined influence of both sexes, or whether it be produced by either sex alone.\n\nThe first opinion was generally adopted by physiologists, till about the end of the 17th century, when an accidental discovery convinced many that the embryo was produced by the male parent alone; and another discovery some years afterwards again overturned that opinion, and rendered it believed by not a few that the embryo is furnished exclusively by the female parent.\n\nSeveral circumstances concurred to render the first opinion probable; the structure of the organs which constitute peculiarity of sex in both parents, the circumstances necessary for successful impregnation, and the multitude of children to both parents, appear very strong arguments in its favour.\n\nThe second theory, although first brought into vogue about the end of the 17th century by the discoveries of Leeuwenhoek, had been formerly proposed by the followers of Pythagoras. Their argument was analogy: the seed, said they, is sown in the earth, nourished and evolved there; so the male semen is sown in the uterus, and in the same manner nourished and evolved.\n\nLeeuwenhoek's discovery seemed a more conclusive argument in favour of the theory than vague analogy.\nHe observed innumerable animalcula in the seminal fluid of the males of many animals. These he imagined to be embryos.\n\nBut as animalcula of apparently the same nature have been observed in many animal fluids besides the semen masculinum, the opinion of Leeuwenhoek and the theory itself are overturned.\n\nIt was owing principally to the labours, industry, and ingenuity of Baron Hiller, that the third theory, that of the pre-existing germ, became fashionable.\n\nHis observations seem to contain a demonstration of the fact.\n\nThose who have adopted this theory, imagine that the semen masculinum possesses the power of stimulating the various parts of the pre-existing embryo. And hence they explain the similitude to both parents, and particularly the appearance of the hybrid productions; to that fluid nourishing certain parts, and new-arranging others. But if this were true, then the semen masculinum of all animals should possess the power of stimulating the forms of all female animals; and besides, in each class of animals it should possess certain specific powers of giving a direction to the growth of parts. Experiment, however, has not proved this to be the case, for the hybrid productions are very limited; and we may be permitted perhaps, without the imputation of arrogance in pretending to search into the intentions of the Author of nature, to observe, that had the semen masculinum been possessed of such powers, the whole species of animals would have been soon confounded, and the whole animal kingdom would soon have returned to that chaos from which it has been allegorically said it originated.\n\nYet we are reduced to the alternative of either rejecting the theory, or of believing that the semen does possess the powers alluded to. If we examine attentively the anatomical discovery on which this theory is built, we shall perhaps be inclined to believe that the foundation of the whole is very insufficient; and hence to conclude that the great superstructure is in a very tottering condition. If it be possible that the attachment of the chick to the yolk of the egg should be in consequence of inoculation, the theory must fall to the ground. Haller has endeavoured to obviate this objection, but not with his usual judgement.\n\nTwo circumstances, however, seem to show that the attachment is really by inoculation: 1. That vesicles are seen in the membrane of the yolk evidently containing blood before the heart of the chick begins to beat; yet these vesicles afterwards appear to depend on the vascular system of the chick. And 2. That in many animals, as in the human subject, the umbilical cord seems to be attached to the abdomen by inoculation; for there is a circle round the root of the cord which resembles a cicatrix, and within a few days after birth, the cord uniformly drops off at that very circle, whatever portion may have been retained after delivery.\n\nThere is one objection equally applicable to all the three theories, viz. the difficulty of explaining the steps of the process. A variety of explanations have been offered by ingenious men. Spallanzani and Mr John Hunter lately, Haller and Bonnet formerly, have rendered themselves conspicuous on this subject. Spallanzani, in particular, appears to many to have produced by his artificial impregnation, the most convincing proofs of the pre-existence of the germ. But what do his celebrated experiments amount? They show, that in all animals it is necessary that the semen masculinum should be applied to the somewhat expelled by the female during the coitus, otherwise impregnation cannot take place. But was not this universally acknowledged before the abbe was born? In the unfortunate frogs who were the subjects of his experiments, the whole operation of generation was completed except the application of the male semen to the substances expelled by the female. Nature, by establishing that the substances should be carried on in water, shows that the semen must be diluted, otherwise it cannot fecundate. The abbe only imitated nature. He left the question in the state in which he found it. His experiment on the bitch may appear more conclusive; but alas! it has never succeeded with any person but himself.\n\nOn the whole, since the process of generation is so obscure that no rational explanation of it has yet been offered, are we not entitled to conclude that the general theory which accounts most satisfactorily for the various phenomena which impregnation exhibits is the best; and consequently, that the product of generation cannot pre-exist in the body of either parent exclusively?\n\n**Chap. II. Effects of Impregnation.**\n\nIn consequence of impregnation, certain important changes take place in the uterine system of the human subject. We shall consider the natural changes only. On some occasions, there are morbid changes; but we shall not notice them, except in so far as some of them serve to illustrate the nature of the usual ones.\n\nThe first visible change is on the ovarium. One of those organs swells out at one point like a small papilla, then bursts, and somewhat is discharged.\n\nA substance is found in the ovarium after this, which is called corpus luteum. Roederer has described very accurately its appearance a few hours after delivery. He says \"corpus luteum locatur in rotundo apice. Totam ovarii craftitiam occupat, immediata pone ovarii membranam illa tede tenuorem locatam; ab ovario cum quo celluloae ope cohaeret separari fine lacteone potest; nulli peculiari ovarii rime respondet: neque canalis in illo excavatus, fed totum folidum est. Luteus color est, sublantia acinosa, acinis admodum compactis et ad sefe preflis ambitus rotundus. Potest aliquo modo, velut in glandulis suprarenalibus, duplex substantia distingui, corticalis et medullaris; quarum illa inequa- lis craftitiei 1—2 lin. lutea comprehendit hanc modularem album, quae tenuis et membrana quasi callofa, ali- um nucleum flavum includit cafficem.\" It is very large soon after conception, and then gradually becomes smaller; but never totally disappears. Roederer observes, \"post puerperium eo magis contrahit et indu- rari illa corpora videntur, quo remoctor fit partus; qualia videlicet observabantur in feminis quae nuper partum non ediderunt.\"\n\n\"Lutea corpora quo serius à partu observantur cuncta glandulis suprarenalibus finiilia ehe videntur, duplici nempe substantia, exteriore corticali, folida seu flava lutea et nucleo fulvo: velut etiam illae glandulae com- preflis sunt.\" In cases where there is a plurality of children, p. 325.\nEffects of children, there is evidently a corpus luteum to each child. In some quadrupeds, as in the bitch or cat, the number of young in the uterus may be generally known by the corresponding corpora lutea in the ovaria.\n\nThe next change in the human uterine system which deserves notice is that in the fallopian tubes. They swell out towards the fimbriated extremity, and form a cavity which has been called antrum. Roederer was the first who observed and accurately delineated this change.\n\nHe says, p. 14, loco citato, \"In hoc etiam utero antrum tubae dextrae apparat, c.f. tab. i. not. 5. ubi quidem in utraque tuba adeest, in his iconis utero ad solam tubam dextram antrum pertinet. Ad uterum feminae oviductum puerperae non longe a fimbria in influentem antrum tuba sinistra prominet: dextra quidem sine antro est, sed versus fimbriam illa flecitur ut ultima flexura dimidium pollicem ultra reliquam tubam effecit. Tubae feminae qua mox a maturo partu mortua est, et alterius tres dies puerperae antris quidem carent, sed multum versus fimbrias dilatantur. An est facta conceptione illa antra nascuntur?\"\n\n\"In uteri, tab. iv. ovario dextro luteum corpus latet in uteri feminis oviductum puerperae ovario sinistro; in uteri, tab. i. ovario sinistro.\" He adds, \"ulteriori indagine illa antra non indigna esse mihi videntur. Licebit forsan conjectare aliquid liquoris ex vesicula graefiana in tubam lapillum et ad introitum morans illam dilatarem.\"\n\nBut the most astonishing changes are those produced in the uterus itself. Its parietes separate, a cavity is formed which becomes filled with a fluid, and the os uteri is closed up. The matter contained within the cavity soon assumes an organized form. It is said that some time after conception, a small vesicle is observed attached at one point to the internal surface of the uterus; that the rest of the parietes is covered with a gelatinous fluid; and that the whole internal surface assumes a flocculent appearance. By degrees the vesicle, which is in fact the ovum containing the embryo, increases so much in size that it nearly fills the whole cavity in which it is contained, and then its structure becomes the object of our lenses.\n\nThe increase of size in the uterus is very gradual. It is at first confined almost entirely to the fundus, and it proceeds so slowly that it does not leave the cavity of the pelvis till nearly the fourth month. The principal change in the cervix for the first five months is the complete closure of the orifice, which is effected by a gelatinous fluid; afterwards the cervix is gradually extended, and at last its form is obliterated, the whole uterus becoming like an oval pouch.\n\nAfter the fifth month the increase of size in the uterus is very rapid. The fundus can be just felt above the pubes about the fifth month, but at the end of the ninth month it extends to the scrobiculus cordis.\n\nSome authors have alleged that the changes in the cervix and in the situation of the fundus are so uniformly regular in every case, that by attending to them it is possible to ascertain the exact period of impregnation. But in this respect they are much mistaken; the changes being not only different in different women, but also in the same woman in different pregnancies.\n\nThe texture of the parietes of the uterus seems much altered after impregnation. It becomes spongy and fibrous. The fibres run in very different directions, and from their power and appearance are certainly muscular. The blood-vessels become much enlarged, but are still in a tortuous direction. They are particularly large at one part of the uterus.\n\nThe lymphatic vessels, which in the unimpregnated uterus cannot be demonstrated by anatomists, become, as well as the blood-vessels, remarkably large.\n\nThe ovum is not often expelled entire till after the eighth or twelfth week after conception. It is shaped somewhat like an egg, and is about the latter period about four inches in length. When cut into, it is found to consist of four layers or membranes, and to contain a fetus surrounded by a certain quantity of water and connected to one part of the parietes (which is considerably thicker than the rest) by a vascular cord.\n\nThe external membrane covers the whole ovum. It is thick, spongy, and very vascular, the vessels evidently deriving their blood from the uterus; it has three perforations which correspond with the openings of the os tineae and fallopian tubes. It has been called decidua, tunica filamentoa &c., but its most ordinary appellation is spongy chorion.\n\nThe second membrane proceeds from the edges of that part into which the vascular rope which connects the fetus is attached. It was first pointed out to anatomists by Dr William Hunter, and called by him decidua reflexa. The name unfortunately records to posterity the absurd idea respecting its origin which was entertained by Dr Hunter. It is not so thick and spongy as the former membrane, nor so vascular. It lies loosely between the external membrane and that to be next described; but it appears only for a short time, as it soon becomes blended with the others.\n\nThe third membrane is thin and transparent, but strong. It is lined with the fourth membrane, and lies in the same situation with it. It contains no vessels at this period of impregnation, conveying red blood in the human subject, but in the cow the vessels are very distinct at every period. This membrane however in the early period of impregnation is very vascular, and its vessels are derived from the fetus. The history of a case of morbid impregnation, where the fetus was extra-uterine, detailed by Dr Clarke in the \"Transactions of a Society for the Improvement of Medical and Chirurgical Knowledge,\" proves this circumstance very clearly. He says, p. 222, \"A laceration was found to be in the fallopian tube about an inch and a half in length, each extremity of which was about an equal distance from the respective termination of the tube in the fimbriae and in the uterus. The diffusion of the tube at this part was nearly of the size of a large walnut, forming a kind of pouch. More of the coagulated blood being removed from the lacerated part, the saggery vessels of the chorion immediately appeared, interposed with small coagula, and lying in contact with the internal surface of the pouch formed by the fallopian tube; these being separated, and the chorion divided, the amnios showed itself, containing a fetus perfectly formed of above six or seven weeks growth &c.\"\n\nThis membrane is called the true chorion.\n\nThe fourth membrane is even thinner and more transparent.\nparent than the former. It lines the whole internal surface of the ovum, and together with the chorion is continued along the vasa cordis which connects the ovum and fetus. Between this membrane and the chorion, near the insertion of the vasa cordis, a small white vehicle appears very distinct at this period; it was first described and delineated by Dr W. Hunter, and was called by him vesicula umbilicalis. At the full period of utero-gestation it is no longer visible, being then quite transparent.\n\nThe fetus at this period is between two and three inches in length, and its external conformation is nearly complete.\n\nThe fluid contained in the ovum is in such quantity as to prevent the fetus from touching the parietes of the covering in which it is included. It is a clear watery fluid, of greater specific gravity than water, and of a saltish taste. When examined chemically it is found not coagulable by heat or alcohol, and to contain a proportion of ammoniacal and sea salt. This fluid is called liquor amnii.\n\nThe connexion of the parts thus enumerated with the uterus cannot be explained, unless the appearance of the ovum at the full period of gestation be described.\n\nThe ovum then consists of three membranes; a spongy vasa cordis substance called placenta, to which the fetus is connected by a vasa cordis rope, and the liquor amnii.\n\nThe three membranes consist of the spongy chorion, the true chorion, and the amnios.\n\nThe spongy chorion covers the whole. Its vessels are numerous, and they can be filled by throwing hot wax into the vessels of the uterus.\n\nThe true chorion and amnios are in the same situation as in the early months, being continued along the. They are quite transparent, and contain no visible vessels of any description.\n\nThe placenta is a large vasa cordis spongy mass, of various forms in different cases, most generally approaching to a round one, placed on the outside of the true chorion, between it and the spongy chorion. Its external surface is lobulated; its internal or that towards the fetus is smooth, except from the rising of the blood-vessels.\n\nIt is not attached to the uterus at any regular place, being sometimes at the cervix or side, but most generally about the fundus. On the one side it receives blood from the mother, and on the other from the child. Mr John Hunter was the first who clearly traced the insertion of the blood-vessels in the uterus into the placenta. He describes it thus (d): \"The late indefatigable Dr M'Kenzie, about the month of May 1754, when attending to Dr Smellie, having procured the body of a pregnant woman who had died undelivered at the full term, had injected both the veins and arteries with particular success; the veins being filled with yellow, the arteries with red.\n\nHaving opened the abdomen, and exposed the uterus, he made an incision into the fore part, quite through its substance, and came to somewhat having the appearance of an irregular mass of injected matter, which afterwards proved to be the placenta. This appearance being new, he flopped, and greatly obliged me by deferring my attendance to examine the parts, in Impregnation, which there appeared something so uncommon.\n\n\"I first raised, with great care, part of the uterus from the irregular mass above mentioned; in doing which, I observed regular pieces of wax, passing obliquely between it and the uterus, which broke off, leaving part upon this mass; and when they were attentively examined, towards the uterus, plainly appeared to be a continuation of the veins passing from it to this substance or placenta.\n\n\"I likewise perceived other vessels, about the size of a crow quill, passing in the same manner, although not so obliquely: these also broke upon separating the placenta and uterus, leaving a small portion on the surface of the placenta; and, on examination, they were discovered to be continuations of the arteries of the uterus. My next step was to trace these vessels into the substance of what appeared placenta, which I first attempted in a vein; but that soon lost the regularity of a vessel, by terminating at once upon the surface of the placenta, in a very fine spongy substance, the interfaces of which were filled with the yellow injected matter. This termination being new, I repeated the same kind of examination on other veins, which always led me to the same terminations, never entering the substance of the placenta in the form of a vessel. I next examined the arteries, and, tracing them in the same manner toward the placenta, found that they made a twist, or clove spiral turn upon themselves, and then were lost on its surface. On a more attentive view, I perceived that they terminated in the same way as the veins; for opposite to the mouth of the artery, the spongy substance of the placenta was readily observed, and was intermixed with the red injection.\n\n\"Upon cutting into the placenta, I discovered, in many places of its substance, yellow injection; in others red, and in many others these two colours mixed. This substance of the placenta, now filled with injection, had nothing of the vasa cordis appearance, nor that of extravasation, but had a regularity in its form, which shewed it to be a natural cellular structure fitted for a reservoir for blood.\n\n\"In some of the vessels leading from the placenta to the uterus, I perceived that the red injection of the arteries (which had been first injected) had passed into them out of the substance of the placenta, mixing itself with the yellow injection. I also observed, that the spongy chorion, called the decidua by Dr Hunter, was very vasa cordis, its vessels coming from, and returning to, the uterus, being filled with the different coloured injections.\"\n\nIt appears then that the placenta has a cellular structure, which receives blood from the arteries of the mother, and that there are veins by which that blood is returned, so that not a drop passes into the fetus. Of this practitioners of midwifery have a very familiar proof. When the placenta is retained attached to the uterus, after the birth of the child, not a drop of blood passes from the umbilical cord, except what was contained in the ramifications of the foetal vessels when the child\n\n(d) Observations on certain parts of the Animal Oeconomy, by John Hunter, p. 127.\nchild was separated. Yet, if a small portion of the edge of the placenta be detached, such a quantity of blood escapes from the uterine vessels of the mother, as sometimes proves fatal to life: a circumstance which clearly shews that the blood is still conveyed into the cellular part of the placenta.\n\nIt has been said, that the placenta on one side receives blood from the fetus. In fact, the greatest part of the placenta seems to be made up of ramifications of the fetal vessels. The internal iliacs of the fetus are conveyed, through the vascular rope which connects the placenta and child, into the placenta: they then ramify into as many minute branches as the pulmonary arteries do in the lungs of the adult; they then terminate in various branches, which, uniting, form one large trunk that is conveyed along the vascular rope, and returns all the blood which had been distributed by the arteries.\n\nAs Mr Hunter remarks, \"the arteries from the fetus pass out to a considerable length, under the name of the umbilical cord; and when they arrive at the placenta, ramify upon its surface, sending into its substance branches which pass through it, and divide into smaller and smaller, till at last they terminate in veins: these uniting, become larger and larger, and end in one which at last terminates in the proper circulation of the fetus. This course of vessels, and the blood's motion in them, is similar to the course of the vessels, and the motion of the blood, in other parts of the body.\"\n\nThe fetus, at the full period, weighs from between 6 and 7, to between 10 and 11 pounds, and measures from 18 to 22 inches. It is placed within the ovum in such a manner as to occupy the least possible space. This position has been beautifully described by Harvey.\n\n\"Infans in utero plurimum repertur, adductis ad abdomen genibus, flexis retrofum cruribus, pedibus decollatis, manubrioque ad caput sublatis, quarum alteram circa tempora vel auriculas, alteram ad genam detinet, ubi maculae albae, tanquam confricationis vestigia, in cute cernuntur: spina in orbe flecitur, caput ad genua incurvato collo propendet. Tali membrorum fit qualum in foemo per quietem querimus.\"\n\nThe fetus is distinguished from the adult by a great many peculiarities in structure: these the limits of this work do not permit us to enumerate. We shall therefore notice only one peculiarity, which distinguishes the fetus not only from the adult, but even from the natus, viz. the distribution of the blood through its body.\n\nIt is well known, that, in the adult and in the natus, all the blood of the body, brought by the two cavae into the anterior auricle of the heart, and from that into the corresponding ventricle, is distributed by the pulmonary artery over the whole substance of the lungs, by means of the most minute ramifications; from whence it is returned by the pulmonary veins into the posterior auricle, and being then sent into the posterior ventricle, is, by its action, transmitted to every part of the body, through the aorta and its ramifications.\n\nBut in the fetus the blood follows another course. All the blood of the fetus is returned from the placenta by the umbilical vein, which, penetrating the abdomen, passes between the lobes of the liver, and thence at right angles divides into two branches nearly, by one of which, called ductus venosus, a considerable quantity of blood is carried into the vena cava; by the other the remainder of the blood is sent to the vena portarum; and, after having circulated through the liver, it too is brought by two short venous trunks, the vena cava hepatica, just above the diaphragm, into the vena cava. All the blood thus received into the vena cava, is carried to the anterior auricle; but a part only is transmitted to the corresponding ventricle, for by a particular apparatus, a quantity is at once sent into the posterior or left auricle. Anatomists have differed in opinion concerning the apparatus by which this is accomplished. As there is a small oval hole of communication between the auricles of the fetus, called foramen ovale, having a valve placed in such a manner as to prevent any fluid from passing from the left into the right, but to admit it from the right into the left, it has been generally imagined that the blood passed through that opening. But the simultaneous action of the auricles in the natus seemed to contradict this opinion. A discovery made by Dr Wolfe of Peterburgh appears to solve the riddle. He observed, that in the calf, before birth, the vena cava, at its entry into the heart, divides into two branches, by the one of which it sends blood to the right, and by the other to the left auricle. It is probable that a similar effect is produced in the human fetus by a different structure.\n\nOf the blood sent by the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery, a small quantity only is carried to the lungs; for near the point at which that artery is divided into the two branches that go into the lobes of the lungs, a large branch is sent off, which joining the aorta and pulmonary artery, carries a great proportion of the blood immediately into it. What is circulated through the lungs is conveyed by the pulmonary veins into the left auricle, &c.\n\nAll the blood thus received into the aorta is distributed through the several parts of the system, and a large part of it is sent out by the internal iliacs, which, passing out at the abdomen, constitute the umbilical arteries, and distribute the blood in the manner already mentioned over the placenta, from which it is returned by the veins.—The great difference then between the fetus and natus in the circulation of the blood, consists in the quantity distributed through the lungs.\n\nTo complete the description of the ovum at the full period of gestation, it only remains that we should say something on the vascular rope, which connects the placenta and fetus, and on the liquor amnii.\n\nThis rope is called the funis umbilicalis. It terminates by one end at the placenta, and by the other at the centre of the abdomen of the fetus. Its length and thickness differ materially in different cases. It is longer in the human subject than in any other animal. It is found generally to be from eighteen to twenty-five inches in length, and in thickness about the size of the little finger. Externally it is formed of the chorion and amnios, together with cellular substance. Internally it is found to be composed of three blood-vessels, and a quantity of gelatinous matter. The vessels consist of two arteries and one vein: the vein being as large as both arteries united. These go in a spiral direction, and often form knots by their coils or twilings. A very small artery and vein are likewise perceived to\ngo along the cord between the two layers of chorion and amnios, which cover it, into the vesicula umbilicalis. These are called omphalo-mefenteric.\n\nIn quadrupeds, a canal, called urachus, is continued from the urinary bladder, along the umbilical cord, and communicates with a membrane, which, like this canal, does not exist in the human subject, called allantois. The urine of the young animal is collected in that membrane.\n\nSome anatomists, as Albinus, have imagined, that the urachus and allantois do exist in the human subject. They were deceived by the appearance of the vesicula mibilicalis and omphalo-mefenteric vessels.\n\nThe liquor amnii is never in such proportion to the fetus in the latter, as in the early periods of pregnancy. It is less pure too at that period, being often polluted with the stools of the fetus. Except in this circumstance, its chemical qualities are the same.\n\nWe shall now offer a few observations on the changes which have been described.\n\n1. The cause of the increase of growth in the uterus is very obscure. The accession of fluids will account for the phenomenon; but a strong objection occurs against considering that as the cause, i.e., that the uterus increases to a certain degree in size, even although the injection of fluids be to another part, as where the fetus is extra-uterine. Boehmer has marked this very accurately in a case of extra-uterine conception, which he has detailed (a). The development of its fibres seems to prove, that the increase of size depends on a certain energy of the uterus itself; perhaps this may appear a very ambiguous mode of expression, yet we can offer no other explanation of this curious phenomenon.\n\n2. The great bulk of the uterus, during the latter months, sufficiently explains the cause of the various complaints which occur at that period. Van Doeveren has described this very accurately. He says, \"uteri gravidii incrementum, adscensus è pelvis cavo, et immatis expansio, innumeris excitat gravidarum morbos; primo quidem arcando abdomen et mechanicè comprimendo viscerà quae in eo continentur, hepatis lienem, ventriculum, intestina, omentum, nec minus partes illi vicinas, nempe, renes, ureteres, aortam, venam cavam, arterias et venas iliacas, nervoque est medulla spinalis proudeutes inferiores; accidit pectoris coactatio, fimbriæ effluxus inde excitati in corde, pulmonibus vaifisque majoribus; ex quibus multiplices modo circulatio, digestio, chylificatio et respiratio leduntur, inque tota corporis economia, ejusque functionibus ingentis, solent produci turbae variaque vita topica excitari, inter quae tensiones, spasmi, dolores, stupores, obturationes, obstructiones, inflammations, congelationes praeceteris memorabiles sunt; unde nascitur magna series morborum abdominis, pectoris, ipsiusque capitis; nec non artuum inferiorum.\"\n\nVol. XIV.

From what source then does it proceed? Most probably from the coats of the amnios.\n\n6. Since from the situation of the fetus it has no direct communication with the atmospheric air, two questions occur on the subject; first, whether it be necessary that the fetus should receive the vivifying somewhat which the natus receives from the atmosphere. 2dly, If this be answered in the affirmative, by what means is this somewhat furnished?\n\n1. On looking into the works of Nature, we find that there is a class of animals placed in a similar situation with the fetus, viz., the locomotive fishes. These receive the vivifying somewhat furnished by the atmosphere through the medium of the fluid in which they are immersed; for their blood is always distributed by the smallest ramifications over a substance in constant contact with the water, before it returns into the arterial system to serve for the purposes of nutrition.\n\nFrom analogy therefore it must be allowed, that the fetus does receive, through some means or other, the vivifying principle of the atmosphere.\n\n2. By what means then is this furnished? Many circumstances concur to prove that it is by means of the placenta. For,\n\n1st, The structure of the placenta resembles much that of the lungs. It is cellular, and has the whole blood of the fetus distributed in the smallest branches over its substance.\n\n2dly, The blood returning from the placenta is sent by the nearest possible means to the left side of the heart. And 3dly, Compression of the umbilical cord to such a degree as to interrupt the circulation through it, destroys the fetus as soon as compression of the trachea does the natus.\n\nIt appears therefore that the placenta serves to the fetus the same purpose which lungs do to the natus.\n\nThe celebrated Haller has objected to this probable use of the placenta in the following words. \"Non panici etiam auctores secundis salutem officium tribuerunt, cum in vena umbilicali sanguis ruber fit et floridus, si cum sanguinis fodiens arteriae comparatur. Id experimentum mea non confirmant. In pullo arteria cerea coccinea, vena violacea est. In fetus humano nunquam floridum sanguinem vidit; neque intelligo ut placenta, in qua certissime nulla sint aeris mutabiles vesiculae profite pulmonis munere fungit.\"\n\nBut later observations have contradicted the assertions of Haller on this occasion. In particular, Dr Jeffray professor of anatomy in the university of Glasgow, in an inaugural dissertation published here in the year 1786, relates an experiment made by him which is completely opposite to the opinion of Haller. \"Puero,\" he says, \"in obstetricatoris fine jacenti, funiculus tribus vinculis circumjectis, et simul in arctum tractis colligatus est; quo dein juxta umbilicum inciso, in arteris umbilicalibus et venis, inter duo vincula placentam proxime, sanguinis copia interceptum est.

The term does not, however, appear to be so arbitrarily established, but that nature may transgress her usual laws; and as many circumstances frequently concur to anticipate delivery, it certainly may in some instances be protracted. Individuals in the same class of quadrupeds, it is well known, vary in their periods of pregnancy. May we not, therefore, from analogy reasonably infer, that women sometimes exceed the more ordinary period? In several tolerably well attested cases, the birth appears to have been protracted several weeks beyond the common term of delivery. If the character of the woman be unexceptionable, a favourable report may be given for the mother, though the child should not be produced till nearly ten calendar months after the absence or sudden death of her husband.\"\n\nSect. II. Phenomena of Natural Labour.\n\nThe sufferings of a woman during labour having been compared to the fatigues of a person on a journey, the phenomena of labour have been divided into three stages. The first stage consists of the opening of the mouth of the womb; the second, of the actual passage of the child; and the third, of the separation and expulsion of the secundines.\n\nPhenomena of the First Stage.—In most instances the bulk of the belly subsides for a day or two before labour begins; but the first evidence of the actual commencement of that process is the occurrence of pains in the belly affecting the loins, and striking down the thighs, occasioning considerable irritation of the bladder and bowels. These pains, &c. however, often take place during some hours of the night, for days, or even weeks, before true labour begins, and are then styled spurious pains. It is not easy on many occasions to distinguish true labour throes from spurious pains, unless the state of the mouth of the womb be examined, so very nearly do they resemble each other. But in general spurious pains recur at irregular intervals, and do not increase in force according to their duration; whereas true pains gradually recur at shorter intervals, and become more and more violent.\n\nSpurious pains are sometimes attended with an occurrence which was first publicly noticed and described by the present professor of midwifery in the university of Edinburgh (E), viz. the protrusion of the urinary bladder. This resembles, to a superficial observer, the bag formed by the membranes which inclose the child, and in consequence has repeatedly been burst by the fingers of the operator. Incurable incontinence of urine, inflammation of the passages, &c. have followed this accident.\n\nProtrusion of the urinary bladder may be readily distinguished from that of the membranes which include the infant by two circumstances. First, the bag recedes completely during the interval of the pain; and secondly, when pushed down, the finger cannot be passed round it at the fore part of the pelvis; it seems as if fixed to the pubis. True labour-pains arise from the contractions of the womb by which that organ is shortened and thickened; and, at the same time, its contents are forced through its orifice. When they become regular and forcing, they have the effect of opening the mouth of the womb, so that a practitioner can readily ascertain the difference between them and spurious pains. The opening of the mouth of the womb, in most instances, is accompanied by the discharge of a slimy, bloody-like matter, termed shews; but in many women there is no such circumstance.\n\nThis process is generally gradual, the pains increasing in frequency and force; and eight, ten, or twelve hours, commonly elapse before they complete the opening of the womb. In some cases the dilatation takes place to a considerable extent before pains occur, so that a few pains accomplish this stage. But these exceptions are not so frequent as those of an opposite description, where one or two complete days are required to open the womb, though the pains be unremitting.\n\nIn proportion as the first stage advances, the membranous bag containing the child is pushed through the mouth of the womb, and forced gradually into the vagina. During the pain it is tense, and during the interval it becomes relaxed. When this happens, the head of the infant can be distinctly felt behind it. At last, the passages being sufficiently opened, the pains having become stronger and more frequent, the membranes give way, and the water contained within them is discharged; which finishes the first stage. Shivering, vomiting, headache, thirst, and pain in the back, take place in many instances during this stage.\n\nPhenomena of the Second Stage.—Sometimes an interval of ease of some minutes duration succeeds the discharge of the waters. The pains then become much more violent and forcing, and the head, by the contractions of the uterus thus becoming more powerful, is pushed through the brim of the pelvis into the vagina. For this purpose the vertex is forced foremost, and the brow is turned to one sacro-iliac synchondrosis, so that the largest part of the head is applied to the widest part of the basin; for as the head is oval, and the opening through which it is to pass is of the same form, this is absolutely necessary.\n\nAfter the head is in the vagina, the pains still continuing, the vertex is turned into the arch of the pubis, and the face into the hollow of the sacrum, by which the largest part of the head is brought into the direction of the widest part at the outlet. All the soft parts are now protruded in the form of a tumour, a portion of the vertex is pushed through the orifice of the vagina, and every pain advances the progress of the infant, till at last the head is expelled. An interval of a minute\n\n---\n\n(E) Roedereri Elementa Artis Obstetricae. Goettingae, 1766. page 98.\n(F) Select Cases in Midwifery, by James Hamilton, M.D. 1795. page 16.\nMIDWIFERY.\n\nChap. III.\n\nWhen these fibres are evolved, if the uterus be distended farther, the edges of the os tineae must be separated, in consequence of which part of the uterine contents passing through it, the contraction of the uterus follows. A fact very familiar to practitioners of midwifery affords apparently a complete confirmation of this hypothesis, viz. that in some women labour occurs as regularly and naturally, in the seventh or eighth month of gestation, as in others it does at the end of the ninth, the cervix uteri having become quite obliterated.\n\n2d. It is probable, however, that in ordinary cases this store of muscular fibres is seldom entirely exhausted, from the circumstance of women having sometimes twins or triplets; some other cause therefore must concur in exciting the action of the uterus. The contents of the uterus perhaps furnish this cause.\n\nIn the latter months of gestation, some parts of the fetus come into contact with the parietes of the uterus, in consequence of the decrease in proportion of the liquor amnii. This is principally the case with respect to the head, which presses on the cervix, and that part of the uterus, it is probable, is more irritable than any other; for we find that the entrance or exit of all hollow muscular organs is more irritable than the other parts, as we see exemplified in the cardia of the stomach, and in the cervix of the urinary bladder.\n\n3d. It is not improbable too, that the pressure of the neighbouring parts contributes somewhat to induce the action of the uterus; for it is remarked by practitioners of midwifery, that women seldom arrive at the full period of gestation in a first pregnancy, and the parietes of the abdomen yield with difficulty at first, as is observed in cases of dropy. Besides all farmers know well, that in every succeeding pregnancy, cows exceed their former period of gestation.\n\nII. The next phenomenon worthy of notice is the manner in which the child's head enters the pelvis. Two circumstances contribute towards this, first the connection of the head of the child with the neck; and secondly, the form of the brim of the pelvis.\n\nThe first of these circumstances has been accurately pointed out by Dr Olborn. He says, \"after the os uteri has been first opened by the membranes and contained waters, forming a wedge-like bag, the next operation and effect of the labour-pains or contractions of the uterus (for they are convertible terms) must be on the body of the child, which being united to the basis of the cranium at the great foramen and nearer the occiput than forehead, the greater pressure will be applied to the occiput, which being likewise smaller, and making less resistance, will be the first part squeezed into the cavity of the pelvis (E).\"\n\nThe latter circumstance has been clearly explained by Professor Saxtorph. He remarks, \"causa hujus directionis capitis, concurrente tota mechanismo perfecti partus, potissimum heret in pelvi. Nam agente utero in foetum, in axi pelvis locatum, caput ejus hucusque liberum, in humore amnii fluctuans, propter molam suam majorem in introitum ipso pelvis magnam refrenationem patitur a prominentia? offis sacri, quae in posteriori parte segmenti inferioris uteri ita impressa est, ut promonitori\n\n(f.) Essays on the Practice of Midwifery, &c. by William Olborn, M.D.\nIt is remarkable, that neither of these celebrated authors discovered that a combination of both the circumstances just enumerated, is necessary to occasion the phenomenon.\n\nTwo advantages result from this position of the head of the child; for, 1st, The largest part of the head is applied to the widest part of the superior aperture; and, 2dly, The head, when the occiput is forced foremost, occupies the least possible space.\n\nIII. The phenomenon which next strikes us, is that change in the position of the head by which the face is turned into the hollow of the sacrum.\n\nAlthough the advantage, and even necessity, of this change in the position of the head, has been long known to practitioners; yet Dr Olborn is, perhaps, the first author who has clearly explained the efficient cause of this. His remarks are these: \"As it (viz. the head) descends obliquely through the pelvis, the prehension of the two converging ilia will not be exactly opposite to each other on the two parietal bones; but one ilium acting or pressing on the part of that bone contiguous to the occiput, and the other on the opposite side next to the face, the head being made up of different bones, united by membranes, and forming various futures and fontanels, which permit the shape to be changed, and the volume to be lessened, it necessarily follows, that the head, thus compressed, will take a shape nearly resembling the cavity through which it passes; and, as from the convergency of the ilia, the cavity of the pelvis somewhat approaches the form of a cone, the child's head is moulded into that shape, the shape of all others best adapted to open the soft parts, and make its way through the os externum. This unequal prehension of the two ilia upon the head, will, in the first instance, direct the occiput, or apex of the cone, to turn under the arch of the pubes, where there is little or no resistance; while the prehension of the other ilium, in its further descent, will have the same effect on the other side, and direct or compel the face to turn into the hollow of the sacrum.\"\n\nThis change of position is productive of three advantages.\n\n1st, The largest part of the head is again adapted to the widest part of the pelvis.\n\n2dly, The smallest possible surface of the head is applied to the surface of the bones of the pubes. And,\n\n3dly, As Dr Olborn, in the passage quoted, very justly observes, the head is moulded into that shape which is best calculated to pass without doing harm, through the soft parts.\n\nIV. The phenomena which occur when the head passes through the external parts, are easily explained.\n\nAfter the head has made that turn, by which the face is placed in the hollow of the sacrum, the coccyx and perineum resist its further descent in that direction, and by forcing the nape of the neck against the inferior edge of the symphysis pubis, every succeeding pain contributes to make the occiput rise up towards the abdomen, by which the chin leaves the top of the thorax, on which it had rested during the preceding process of delivery.\n\nBy this simple mechanism, the soft parts are gradually prepared for the passage of the child, while, at the same time, the shoulders are brought into the most favourable position for passing through the pelvis.\n\nV. The phenomena of the third stage of labour obviously originate from the contraction of the uterus, which both separates and expels the secundines. Some authors have imagined that nature has provided for this purpose a particular apparatus, placed at the fundus uteri; but as the placenta, when attached to the cervix uteri, is thrown off as readily as when it is attached to the fundus, it is very evident that these authors have been deceived by a seeming regularity of fibres, which is sometimes observed.\n\nLastly, The obstructions which nature has opposed to the passage of the child, occasion all the difficulties of human parturition. These obstructions are formed by the situation and shape of the pelvis, and the structure of the soft parts concerned in parturition.\n\nThe pelvis is situated in such a direction, that its axis forms an obtuse angle with that of the body; consequently, it is not placed perpendicularly, but obliquely to the horizon; and hence nothing can pass through it by the force of gravity.\n\nThe shape of the pelvis, too, is such, that the head of the child cannot pass through the outlet in the same direction in which it entered the brim; and, from the structure of the soft parts concerned in parturition, they yield with considerable difficulty.\n\nBy these means, the Author of our existence has guarded against the effects of the erect posture of the body, and has prevented the premature expulsion of the child and the sudden laceration of the soft parts.\n\nSect. IV. Treatment of Natural Labour.\n\nFirst stage.—When this stage proceeds naturally and regularly, there is very little else to be done, after having ascertained that labour has really begun, and that the child is in the ordinary position, than taking care that the bowels be open, and palliating any unpleasant symptoms, such as shivering or vomiting, &c., which may occur.\n\nBut if after the pains have become so regular as, by their continuance, to disturb the ordinary functions of life, that is, most commonly, after they have been quite regular for twelve or fifteen hours; if this stage be not completed, it is necessary to interfere, and to endeavour, by art, to effect the dilatation. The reason for this rule is abundantly evident. If this stage of suffering be longer protracted, the strength of the patient must be exhausted by the long-continued exertion, and, of course, the remaining process of labour cannot be completed. Hence the child may be lost, or alarming discharges...\nNatural discharges of blood may follow the birth of the infant.\n\nThis very obvious effect of the protraction, beyond certain limits, of the first stage of labour, was first publicly insisted on by the present professor of midwifery in the university of Edinburgh.\n\nThe means to be adopted for completing the dilatation, when that assistance becomes necessary, are venesection or opiates, or supporting the os uteri, according to circumstances.\n\nWhen the resistance to the opening of the womb arises from the premature discharge of the water, or from natural rigidity of the womb, copious blood-letting affords the adequate remedy. But if the patient be already reduced by previous disease, so that she cannot safely be bled, an opiate, in the form of glyster, ought to be administered.\n\nAnd when, on the recurrence of every pain, the mouth of the womb is forced down upon the external passage before the child, its edges ought to be supported, in situ, by the fingers cautiously applied to each side.\n\nSecond stage.—When it is found that the head has begun fairly to enter the pelvis in the natural direction, no assistance is necessary till the perineal tumour be formed; and then such support must be given to the protruded parts as shall both relieve the distressing feelings of the patient, and, at the same time, prevent any laceration from happening. Of course, the precise manner of supporting the perineum must be varied according to the circumstances of the case. Inattention to this has very frequently occasioned the most deplorable accidents.\n\nAfter the head is born, it must be ascertained whether there be any portion of the navel-string round the neck of the infant, and if there be, it must be slackened or drawn over the head, otherwise the infant will be lost.\n\nIf possible, time should be allowed for the accommodation of the shoulders, and the expulsion of the body of the infant; and, at any rate, the utmost attention should be paid to supporting the perineum during that part of the process.\n\nThird stage.—When the child is born, and it is ascertained that there is no other infant remaining in the womb, the patient should be allowed to rest for a little, unless pains again come on, by which the fecundines are separated. In that case, the cord is to be firmly grasped, and pulled gently, till the placenta be brought down to the external parts, when it is to be drawn out carefully, in such a manner as to bring off at the same time the complete membranous bag.\n\nShould pains not recur at the distance of an hour after the birth of the infant, it becomes necessary, for several reasons, to introduce the hand into the womb to separate and extract the fecundines.\n\nFirst, If the cord were pulled by before the womb had contracted, or the after-birth had become separated, the womb must inevitably be turned inside out; an accident that has occasionally happened.\n\nSecondly, If a longer period than an hour were suffered to elapse, the passages would become so much contracted, that the force required again to dilate them, would produce inflammation, with all its alarming consequences.\n\nThirdly, If the after-birth were allowed to remain longer than an hour, excessive flooding might take place, which would soon prove fatal.\n\nFourthly, Were the patient to escape the danger of flooding, she would incur that of putrefaction of the placenta, which is equally, though not so rapidly, productive of mortal event.\n\nIn thus introducing the hand to separate the placenta, the two great cautions to be attended to, are to apply the fingers to the substance of the placenta, not to infirmate them between its surface and that of the uterus, and to bring off only that portion of the placenta which can be separated from the uterus without force.\n\nWhen any alarming circumstance happens after the birth of the infant, requiring the extraction of the placenta, the practitioner is not to delay for an hour, indeed not for a minute, giving the requisite assistance.\n\nCHAP. IV. Of the Deviations from Nature in Human Parturition.\n\nFrom the view thus given of human parturition, under the most favourable circumstances, it must be obvious that many deviations from nature may occur.\n\nThese deviations may proceed; first, from the propelling powers concerned in parturition; secondly, from the state of the fecundines; thirdly, from the state of the child itself; or, fourthly, from the state of the passages through which the child is forced. There may also be a combination of these causes. We shall consider each of these causes of deviation in the order just enumerated. But as a minute investigation of the subject would far exceed the necessary limits of this work, we shall treat each of these causes as shortly as possible, and notice only the most striking circumstances.\n\nSect. I. Of the Deviations from Natural Labour, which proceed from the Propelling Powers.\n\nThe propelling powers concerned in parturition consist of voluntary and involuntary muscular action. The diaphragm and abdominal muscles furnish the former, and the uterus the latter.\n\nAn excess or diminution of the action of those powers must interrupt the ordinary progress of labour.\n\na. The violent action of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles, if exerted at the beginning of labour, tends to exhaust the patient and to retard delivery, and if induced when the head is within the vagina may, provided proper precautions be not taken, lacerate the perineum, and render the future life of the patient miserable.\n\nThe action of these muscles being quite voluntary, may be readily prevented by the patient submitting to proper advice.\n\nb. Impaired action of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles, generally originates from the improper exertion of those muscles at the beginning of labour, or from passions of the mind. It always retards delivery, and consequently protracts the sufferings of the patient.\n\nc. Violent\nc. Violent action of the uterus at the beginning of labour, is frequently productive of much mischief. It exhausts the patient, and renders the subsequent process of delivery exceedingly tedious and difficult. It also sometimes occasions an accident which generally proves almost immediately fatal, viz. rupture of the uterus.\n\nThis accident has been described by authors under the title of spontaneous rupture of the uterus. The laceration in the uterus in those cases is sometimes transverse and sometimes longitudinal. When the accident happens from this cause, the laceration is most frequently in the cervix. The accident is preceded by excruciating pain, especially during the action of the uterus, at one part, as in the loins or towards the pubes; and it is announced by a most agonizing increase of the pain succeeded by violent vomiting, the discharge of a little blood, a total cessation of the labour throes, very great irregularity and feebleness of the pulse, cold sweat, coldness of the extremities, difficulty of breathing, inability to lie in the horizontal posture, and sometimes delirium. Along with these symptoms, it often happens that the presenting part of the child recedes entirely, and the limbs of the infant may be readily distinguished through the parietes of the abdomen. But this circumstance does not always take place, for sometimes the head of the child is so firmly wedged within the pelvis, that it does not recede although the other parts be in the cavity of the abdomen.\n\nThe rupture of the uterus is generally fatal. A few cases, however, are on record, where, by prudent management, the patient, even under such dangerous circumstances has been saved. Such are the cases recorded by Dr Hamilton (H), by Dr Douglas (I), and Dr Hamilton, junior (K). But the injuries which must ensue from loss of blood, acute pain, the presence of the child in the cavity of the abdomen, and the probable protrusion and strangulation of the intestines are such, that it cannot be expected that many patients can survive the accident.\n\nThe cause of violent action of the uterus at the beginning of labour, is obviously the premature discharge of the liquor amnii. By this circumstance, the body of the child comes in contact with the parietes of the uterus, by which the action of that organ is immediately and violently excited. How much mischief then may the rash interference of an ignorant operator produce?\n\nThe cause of rupture of the uterus from its own violent action, is the resistance to the passage of the child, either from undilated os uteri, or from deformities of the pelvis, or from wrong position of the child. Whenever, therefore, the rupture is threatened, means must be instantly adopted to remove the resistance, or to suspend the action of the uterus. The former is in general the more easily accomplished.\n\nWhen the uterus has actually burst, the only chance which can be afforded to the patient, is instant delivery; per vias naturales, where that is practicable; and where there is extreme narrowness of the pelvis, by an incision through the parietes of the abdomen. A case where this latter practice was successfully had recourse to occurred a few years ago in Lancashire.\n\nViolent action of the uterus during the latter stage of labour, although not productive of the same dangers which ensue from it at the beginning, is by no means exempt from hazard; for if the soft parts be rigid or not sufficiently relaxed, the woman may be miserably torn.\n\nThe violent action of the uterus towards the termination of labour proceeds from some power of that organ itself, or from the stimulus communicated by the position of the child.\n\nThis circumstance, however, is sometimes beneficial; as, for instance, when the child is in an unfavourable position. Dr Denman was the first who discovered this effect of violent uterine action, and published it in the fifth volume of the London Medical Journal, page 64.\n\nd. Impaired action of the uterus during the first stage of labour is in many instances productive of no other inconvenience than the protraction of labour; but if it exhausts the strength of the patient, it influences materially the subsequent process, as already stated. When it occurs during the second stage, it occasions the most dangerous symptoms. First, If the head of the child continue to press for a considerable time on the soft parts within the pelvis, these parts must necessarily from the impeded circulation become swelled, and consequently the action of the uterus, though it should return, would then be totally insufficient for the expulsion of the child. This effect of the protraction of the second stage was first pointed out to the public in Dr Hamilton's Letters to Dr Othorne. It merits most particular attention; not only as it is one of the most frequent causes of the loss of the infant during labour, and of considerable danger to the parent, but also as it may be very readily prevented by an attentive practitioner. Previous to this swelling becoming so considerable as to impede the progress of the infant, there is a tenderness and heat, and dryness in the passage, which announces the actual commencement of the inflammation. Immediate delivery ought then to be had recourse to.\n\nMany disagreeable symptoms also proceed from the same cause, such as suppression of urine, and violent cramps in the lower extremities.\n\nWhen it is ascertained, that, in consequence of the deficiency of action of the uterus, the child is detained so long in the passage as to endanger the health or life of the mother, it becomes necessary to extract the infant by mechanical means. Two contrivances have been thought of for this purpose, viz. the vectis or lever, and the forceps.\n\nRoonhuyzen, a Dutch practitioner, who flourished about the beginning of the 18th century, contrived the vectis, and from the great success which attended its use in his hands, an edict was issued by the states-general, that no surgeon should practise midwifery without\n\n---\n\n(H) Outlines of Midwifery, p. 348.\n(I) Observations on the rupture of the gravid uterus, &c. by A. Douglas, M. D. &c. 8vo. London 1789.\n(K) Select Cases of Midwifery, p. 138.\nout being possessed of the Roonthuyzen secret, for the instrument was not publicly known. In the year 1756, however, the secret having been purchased by two liberal-minded physicians, Vifcher and Van de Poll, was published by them for the benefit of mankind. Since that time, the instrument has undergone a variety of alterations in its form; for a particular account of which, the reader is referred to Mulder's Historia Forcipis.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Roonthuyzen and his successors employed the vectis as a lever of the first species, the head of the infant being the resistance, the parts of the woman the fulcrum, and the hand of the operator forming the moving power. The injuries arising from this practice have been well explained by Dr Othorne in his Essays on Laborious Labours. Although Dr Bland and Dr Denman still recommend the same practice, there can be no doubt that whenever the use of the vectis proves successful according to their directions, the fortunate termination is to be attributed to the action of the uterus being exerted by the pressure of the instrument; or in other words, the delivery might have been completed without any mechanical interference at all. On the other hand, whenever the action of the uterus is either quite suspended or much weakened, both mother and child suffer from the application of the vectis.\n\nThe late Dr Deafe in altering the shape of the vectis, wished to impress upon the profession the necessity for changing the mode of employing it; and accordingly he called his instrument an extractor. This power, however, seems to be possessed in a superior degree by Dr Lowder's instrument, of which a description is contained in the eighth volume, second decade, of Dr Duncan's Medical Commentaries, p. 400. As this instrument may be used with perfect safety, both to mother and child, and as in some cases it is superior to the forceps, we have represented its form in one of the plates, and now add the description and an account of the manner of applying it from the work already referred to.\n\nThe instrument \"consists of a blade and handle (between which there is a hinge, that renders it portable), measuring in length 11½ inches. Its length, before it be curved is 12½ inches. The curve begins about half an inch from the hinge. It describes, reckoning an inch from its first curvature, as nearly as can be estimated, an arc of 87 degrees of a circle, the radius of which is four inches. The breadth of the blade, at the beginning of the curve, is half an inch, and is gradually increased, till within three quarters of an inch of the extremity, where it measures an inch and three-fourths. Its extremity is semicircular. Within 2½ inches of the extremity there is an oval opening, measuring 2½ inches in length, and 1½ inches at its greatest breadth. By this opening, the depth of the curve is considerably increased, without rendering the instrument inconvenient in its introduction.\"\n\nLet us suppose that it is found necessary to use Lowder's lever, when the head of the child has just begun to enter the cavity of the pelvis. The patient is to be placed in the ordinary position, on the left side, in bed. The occiput of the child is to be carefully distinguished, and the curve of the instrument is to be applied, with all the necessary precautions, over it. The extremity of the blade should be within a very little of the nape of the neck. To accomplish this part of the operation with facility, it is necessary that the operator be well acquainted with the shape of the pelvis, and that he have accustomed himself to apply the instrument over a round substance.\n\nWhen the instrument is applied in this manner, the operator will find, that he can exert very considerable power in drawing down, without pressing on any other part than the occiput of the child. The mother cannot possibly feel the instrument; while, at the same time, the many points of the foetal cranium, on which it rests, prevent any injury whatever to the infant.\n\nIf there be any pains, however slight they may be, the operator should draw down only during the pain; in the intervals, a soft warm cloth should be wrapped round the handle. If there be no pains, he must draw down from time to time, imitating, as nearly as he can, the natural efforts. It is astonishing, of what use even the most trifling pains are, on such occasions. Without pains, a long time is required before the head be made to advance in a perceptible degree (though, after it has advanced a little, it soon yields entirely); while, with them, the progress is often rapid.\n\nThe operator should continue to draw down in the same manner, till the head be completely in the cavity of the pelvis. Should any circumstance, as dangerous uterine haemorrhage, or convulsions, require that the delivery be expeditiously finished, after the head is brought into this position, the forceps must be applied; for it is in the power of the operator, by means of them, to accomplish the extraction of the head within a very short space of time, or at least, within a much shorter space than would be required, were the use of Lowder's lever continued.\n\nBut if there be no dangerous symptom, the operation may be completed by the first instrument, without any assistance from the forceps.\n\nFor this purpose, the operator should continue to draw down, by pressing on the occiput, as already directed, until the face shall have turned into the hollow of the sacrum. The direction of the instrument must then be changed. The reason of this is very obvious. After the face is in the hollow of the sacrum, the occiput becomes engaged in the arch of the pubis, and rises under it, while, at the same time, the chin leaves the top of the breast, on which it had refted during the preceding process of labour, and describes a course equal to a full quarter of a circle, which is the consequence of the occiput describing a similar course under the arch of the pubis. Were the practitioner, then to continue to press in the same direction as he did while the head was passing through the brim, he would counteract this natural process, and hence would retard delivery, and injure the parts against which he would necessarily press the child.\n\nThe instrument must, therefore, be withdrawn from the occiput, and applied with the proper precautions over the chin, when the operator is to imitate the process of nature, by disengaging the chin from the breast, and making the occiput rise under the arch of the pubis, while, with his left hand, he protects the perineum from injury.\n\nFrom these observations it is obvious, that the instrument introduced into practice by Dr Lowder, affords exactly the assistance, in the first order of laborious labour, which is required; for it supplies the place of the propelling\npropelling powers, or increases their efficacy, by acting on the body of the child, without injuring any part of the mother.\n\n\"This property renders it of great use in certain cases of deformed pelvis, viz. where the short diameter of the brim is about three inches. In such cases, the long continued strong action of the uterus, often eventually forces the head into the pelvis; but the strength of the patient is in consequence so much reduced, that after it has proceeded so far, the pains are entirely suspended, and the delivery must necessarily be finished by the use of mechanical expedients; but the child's life is commonly previously destroyed, by the compression of the brain.\n\n\"If, in such cases, it be possible to increase with safety the vis à tergo, the child would then be forced through the brim of the pelvis before the woman's strength were exhausted, and before its life were endangered; consequently, many children, commonly doomed to inevitable destruction, would be preserved.\n\n\"Lowder's lever, I apprehend, possesses this power. It may be calculated, that, by its use, the efficacy of the labour throes is at least doubled. Hence the child, in cases of slight deformity of the pelvis, is forced through the opposing part within one half of the time which would be otherwise required; and this is accomplished without injury either to the mother or infant; for the instrument presses on no part of the former; and it rests on such parts of the latter, that no harm can possibly be done.\n\n\"In face-cases, too, where the interference of the practitioner is necessary (which, indeed, is a rare occurrence), this instrument may be employed with much advantage. The great aim should be, to draw down the occiput.\n\n\"As it appears, therefore, that Lowder's lever is applicable in many cases where the forceps are inadmissible, and that its use is not productive of so much hazard to the mother as that of the forceps, it might perhaps be inferred, that the latter instrument may be banished from practice, as unnecessary and dangerous. Accordingly, many practitioners of midwifery have adopted an opinion of this kind; and, indeed, there are very few who do not employ one or other of these instruments exclusively.\n\n\"But however desirable it may be to lessen the number of mechanical expedients, and to simplify practice, I apprehend, that many lives would be lost if we possessed or employed no such instrument as the forceps. As they have the property of a lever, delivery can in many cases be accomplished much more expeditiously by them than by Dr Lowder's instrument. This seems to be the sole advantage which they possess over it; and that is counterbalanced by several great disadvantages. Many authors, indeed, have alleged, that the forceps have exclusively the power of diminishing the size of the fetal cranium, by the pressure of their blades, and hence have attributed a degree of preeminence to them, which in fact is not their due; for as the size of the child's head is, in natural cases, diminished as far as is necessary, by the contractions of the uterus forcing it forward through the bones of the pelvis, an increase of the vis à tergo will of course increase that diminution, if the shape of the passage require it. While Lowder's lever, therefore, possesses the power of compressing the cranium in common with the forceps, it has a decided superiority over them in this, that it accomplishes that end by similar means with nature.\n\n\"The great disadvantages of the forceps are, that they are inapplicable when the child's head is situated high in the pelvis; that their application is often difficult to the operator, and painful to the patient; and that, as their centre of action is on the parts of the patient, they must injure her in proportion to the resistance opposed to the delivery.\n\n\"On the whole, then, in cases of the first order of labours, both instruments must be occasionally had recourse to. When the head is not completely within the cavity of the pelvis, Lowder's lever must be employed; and even when it is in that position, the same means may be used, if there be pains. But, when the labour throes are entirely suspended, or when any circumstance renders it necessary to terminate the delivery with expedition, the forceps ought to be employed in preference to every other instrument, if the head of the child be within their reach.\"\n\nThe forceps are supposed to have been invented by Dr Hugh Chamberlain, who was physician to King Charles II.; but their form has been greatly altered since his time. The most approved form is that represented in the plate.\n\nThis instrument is only applicable in presentations of the head; but it was formerly, by Dr Smellie and others, recommended in face cases.\n\nIn order that this instrument be applicable, it is necessary that the head be completely, or nearly so, in the cavity of the pelvis; but sometimes a lengthened pair is used for cases where the head is situated high. The employment of long forceps, however, being extremely dangerous, is seldom justifiable; and therefore we shall limit our directions to the use of the common short forceps.\n\nThere are three principal cases in which that instrument may be had recourse to, viz. 1. where the face is in the hollow of the sacrum; 2. where the face is wedged under the pubis; and 3. where it is on one side of the pelvis.\n\nIn whatever situation the head is, the instrument is to be applied over the ears, otherwise there could be no safe and secure hold. In the process of extracting the child with this instrument too, it is to be observed, that the convex edge of the blades is to be brought along the hollow of the sacrum.\n\nThe instrument being applied so cautiously over the ears of the infant that no part of the woman be injured by their introduction, the locking parts are to be brought together, and secured by a ligature; after which the operator, supporting carefully the perineum with one hand, is to draw gently in a direction of from blade to blade during a pain, or now and then to imitate labour throes, while he at the same time favours the mechanism of labour by accommodating the child's head to the passage so as to make it take up the least possible room. If this be done with suitable caution and gentleness, no part of the woman should be injured, and the parts of the infant on which the instrument had refted should not even be marked. But as there can be no doubt, that in the process of using the forceps, the parts of the woman are pressed upon by the blades, if much force be exerted, or if due attention be not\nnot paid to the adaptation of the head of the infant to the apertures through which it is to be brought, the most dreadful effects result from the operation.\n\nSect II. Of the Deviations from Natural Labour, which proceed from the state of the Secundines.\n\nThe membranes which envelope the fetus are in some cases more tender, and in others more rigid, than in general they are found; circumstances which have a considerable effect on the process of parturition. Besides this, the placenta is on some occasions attached to the cervix or os uteri, by which not only is the order of labour interrupted, the placenta being expelled before the child, but also is the patient's life exposed to much danger.\n\na. Where the membranes are too tender, the liquor amnii is discharged at the beginning of labour before the os tineae be dilated, and then all the bad consequences detailed under the article b, Sect. I, necessarily ensue.\n\nb. Where the membranes are too rigid, the labour may be protracted to such a period as shall injure the mother most materially, and at last, as the whole ovum may be expelled entire, the life of the child may be endangered.\n\nAfter the os uteri is completely dilated, if the child included in the membranes do not advance into the cavity of the pelvis, the membranes should be ruptured. But if it do, they ought not to be broken till they press on the external parts.\n\nc. But the most alarming deviation from nature, which can proceed from the state of the secundines, is that which originates from the attachment of the placenta over the cervix or os uteri. As there can be no doubt that the uterine vessels dip into the substance of the placenta, and that they are lacerated when the placenta is separated from its attachment, it is obvious that in such a situation haemorrhage to a most dangerous extent must unavoidably ensue during the process of the labour.\n\nMr Rigby of Norwich was the first British practitioner who publicly explained this cause of haemorrhagy. In the first edition of his work; viz. that published in 1775, he expresses himself in the following words. \"But from the uncertainty with which (as before observed) nature fixes the placenta to the uterus, it may happen to be so situated, that when the full term of pregnancy is arrived, and labour begins, a flooding necessarily accompanies it, and without the intervention of any of the above accidental circumstances; that is, when it is fixed to that part of the womb which always dilates as labour advances, namely, the column and os uteri, in which case it is very certain that the placenta cannot, as before described, remain secure till the expulsion of the child, but must of necessity be separated from it, in proportion as the uterus opens, and by that means an haemorrhage must unavoidably be produced.\n\n\"That floodings, which arise from these two different causes, which I will distinguish by the names of accidental and unavoidable, though they may appear exactly similar in their first symptoms, should terminate very differently, if left to nature, assisted only by the palliative means before mentioned, cannot seem strange; nor can it be a doubt, that of these two kinds of floodings, only one of them, namely, that which is produced by an accidental separation of the placenta, can be relieved by the use of these palliatives; and that the other, in which the placenta is fixed to the os uteri, and the flooding is therefore unavoidable, cannot possibly be suppressed by any other method whatever than the timely removal of the contents of the womb; for supposing the discharge to be for a while restrained by bleeding, medicine, cool air, &c. it will inevitably return, when nature is so far recovered as again to bring on labour; in the first case, if the haemorrhage have been checked by the use of the above means, it is not impossible but labour may come on, and the child be safely expelled by the natural pains before it returns; or if it should return, it may not increase in quantity; as in this case very probably the separated part of the placenta which occasions the discharge remains nearly the same; whereas in the other case, in which the dilatation of the os uteri produces the separation of the placenta, every return of pain must be a return of the bleeding, and it must become greater and greater as the uterus opens more and more, and the placenta is in proportion detached, till it increases to a degree that exhausts the patient, and the days before nature has been able to expel the child. That such must inevitably be the progress and event of floodings arising from such a cause, if left to nature, is too obvious further to be insisted on.\n\n\"That this attachment of the placenta to the os uteri is much oftener a cause of floodings than authors and practitioners are aware of, I am from experience fully satisfied, and to far am I convinced of its frequent occurrence, that I am ready to believe that most, if not all of those cases which require turning the child are produced by this unfortunate original situation of it (L).\"\n\nNo case in practice requires more decision and more attention than this. It must be obvious that no internal remedy can be of any avail in flooding from such a cause, and that the life of the patient can be saved by immediate delivery alone, whenever considerable haemorrhagy takes place. But it is to be recollected that the discharge in many instances threatens for days or even weeks before it becomes serious, and that for the sake of the child, the patient should be allowed to advance as near as her own safety will permit to the full period. These threatenings may often be removed by astringent injections, per vaginam, while at the same time every means of moderating the circulation of the blood should be suggested.\n\nBut whenever the discharge becomes profuse, delivery by art is to be had recourse to. The rule of Mr Rigby, and of some other eminent practitioners, \"to watch from time to time the dilatability of the os uteri,\" and take advantage of that state, sounds well; but\n\n(1) Essay on the Uterine Haemorrhagy which precedes the delivery of the full-grown Fœtus, illustrated by cases by Ed. Rigby, London 1775, p. 14. Vide also 3d edition 1784, same page.\nbut if followed in practice, must either give such a shock to the woman's constitution, as shall end in dropy or marasmus, or must prove immediately fatal.\n\nIn all those cases the os uteri may be forced, and although it be not more open than barely to admit the introduction of the finger, it may in a very few minutes, if the operator have steadiness and perseverance, be rendered capable of allowing the hand to pass.\n\nIf possible, the hand should be carried forward at one side of the placenta, for if that part be torn (which it must be admitted is sometimes inevitable) the infant must be destroyed. After the feet are brought down, the child is to be extracted as expeditiously as regard to its safety will permit, and the hand is then to be again passed into the uterus for the purpose not merely of detaching completely the secundines, but chiefly of securing the contraction of that organ which is the great object of the delivery.\n\nSect. III. Of the Deviations from Natural Labour, which proceed from the state of the Child.\n\nThe regular process of parturition may be interrupted, in consequence of the position and of the shape of the child.\n\n1. Position of the child. The most natural position of the child, at the beginning of labour, is with the head placed at the brim of the pelvis, the face towards the sacro-iliac synchondrosis of one side, and the occiput towards the groin of the opposite side. But there are many deviations from this natural position.\n\na. Although the head be applied to the brim of the pelvis, it may be forced with the fusciput towards the promontory of the sacrum, and the occiput towards the symphysis pubis. In this situation the largest diameter of the head is opposed to the smallest of the pelvis, consequently the head remains firmly fixed in that position, for as the fusciput cannot advance a point beyond the promontory of the sacrum, the occiput is forced just so much below the brim at the pubis as to wedge the head firmly between the sacrum and pubis. By the long-continued pressure the soft parts become much swelled, and at last the head is found to immoveably fixed, that it can neither be made to recede, nor can it advance in the same direction. This constitutes what has been styled the caput incuneatum, or, as it is called by French practitioners, la tête enclavée. This case most commonly is the effect of mismanagement; for if a very little pressure be made on the head when it presents at the brim of the pelvis in this unfavourable position, the pains will readily force it into the passage in the proper direction.\n\nWhen the locked head has actually taken place, the practice must be varied according to the circumstances of the individual case; hence the long forceps, and sometimes even the crotchet, are required. Turning is quite impracticable, and the three-bladed forceps so strenuously recommended by Dr Leake, in this case are totally inapplicable.\n\nb. The long diameter of the head may also be applied to the short diameter at the brim, in a different manner, viz., with the face towards the pubis, and the occiput to the base of the sacrum. The obstructions to the progress of the head are not in this case so great as in the former (a); for as the occiput is round, and its surface inconceivable, while at the same time the promontory of the sacrum is round, the labour throws, after some time, force the occiput either a little to one side, or at least past the promontory. The case, however, is tedious, painful, and even dangerous to the patient; for as the face presents a larger surface to the pubis than the occiput, it must require longer time to pass, and as there are many inequalities on the face, the patient must suffer much pain from their pressure, and from the same circumstance must incur the hazard of having the urinary bladder or the urethra irreparably injured.\n\nIn this case Professor Saxtorph remarks, \"vel occiput primo decedit, quod cum accidit, frons ab oboibus pubis sufflentata elevatur, mentumque pectori infantis imprimitur, urgentibus porro doloribus, verus anum et perineum, adagiatum acuminum occupat, et nullo modo sub arcu oboe pubis extorquere potest inflexible fusciput, hinc partus in exitu pelvis impossibilis redditur.\"\n\nThat this is a mistake, the observation of other practitioners has sufficiently demonstrated; for it is well known that in such cases, after the perineum has been much stretched the occiput is forced through the parts, and immediately slips back towards the anus, while the nape of the neck being applied to the anterior edge of the perineum, moves on it as on an axis, so that the fusciput and face emerge from under the symphysis pubis, the chin leaving the top of the thorax in the same manner as if the face were situated naturally in the hollow of the lacrurn.\n\nAlthough in this case the natural efforts most ordinarily complete the process, yet in many instances the injury which threatens the urinary bladder renders the application of the forceps expedient.\n\nc. Although the head may have entered the pelvis in the most natural position, yet it may not make those changes in situation which are required to accommodate it to the outlet; for the face may turn under the symphysis pubis instead of into the hollow of the sacrum. When this happens the phenomena already described take place.\n\nd. It sometimes happens, that instead of the smooth part of the cranium being forced first into the pelvis, the face presents. In this case it may be situated in three positions, viz. with the chin to the sacrum, or pubis, or side.\n\naa. The first case is esteemed the most dangerous both for the mother and child. For the mother, because the child in this position requires more room than the pelvis affords, consequently the soft parts in contact with the chin and smooth part of the cranium are much comprimised, and hence if the delivery be not speedily accomplished, much injury to those parts will ensue. As the chin too must pass along a curved line formed by the sacrum and coccyx, the obstructions to delivery are very great; and even after the face has been forced so low as to press on the perineum, that part is in much hazard of being torn by the violent distention which it undergoes. The delivery in such cases is very rarely accomplished naturally.\n\nThis species of labour is equally dangerous to the child as to the mother, not only on account of the long-continued pressure on the brain, but also from the occiput being forced so strongly on the superior dorsal vertebra that the free return of the blood from the head is interrupted,\ninterrupted, and hence apoplexy ensues; a circumstance which is proved even by the appearance of children who in such cases are born alive, for the face of such children is perfectly livid. Jacobs has pointed out these dangers pretty accurately. \"Il est dangereux pour l'enfant, (he says), parce que la tête étant pendue et portant sur son cou, elle comprime les vaisseaux sanguins au point que le sang ne peut plus circuler, il meure d'une apoplexie pour peu que l'on tarde à l'extraction.\" École pratique des Accouchemens, par le Professeur J. B. Jacobs. A Paris, 1785. p. 366.\n\nbb. The second case, viz., where the chin is placed towards the pubis and the falciput to the sacrum, is neither so dangerous for the mother nor child. For if by the force of the pains the face be pushed too far forward that the chin becomes engaged within the arch of the pubis, then the inferior edge of the symphysis pubis forms a fulcrum on which the inferior jaw moves, by which the falciput and occiput pass readily and easily along the hollow of the sacrum, their surface being well adapted to that of the sacrum, and the several parts of the face pass in succession through the vulva.\n\ncc. The third case, viz., where the chin is to one side, is still more favourable than the second; for the face passes readily through the oblique diameter of the pelvis till stopped by the tuberosities of the ilia, when the chin turns into the arch of the pubis, and then the same phenomena which occur in the second case take place.\n\nThe cause most generally assigned for face cases is the ill directed exertion of the propelling powers. May it not also depend in many cases on the original position of the fetus?\n\nWhen any extraordinary difficulty occurs in face cases, Lowder's lever is the instrument to which recourse ought to be had. The forceps, as recommended by Smellie and others, being quite insufficient to afford a safe and secure hold of the infant.\n\ne. On some rare occasions the side of the head presents, so that one ear is in the centre of the pelvis. In such a case, the strongest contractions of the uterus cannot make the head enter the pelvis, and the woman would generally die undelivered were it not for the interference of art. Cases of this kind are remarkably rare.\n\nThe hand of the operator must be carried up in such cases, and moderate pressure must be made in such a direction as shall allow the contractions of the uterus to push the smooth part of the cranium into the cavity of the pelvis.\n\nf. The head of the child is not the part always applied to the pelvis; for sometimes the head passes last. Whenever any other part than the head presents, the labour is styled by authors preternatural.\n\nAll preternatural labours have been divided into two orders. A. Presentations of the inferior extremities; and B. Presentations of the superior extremities.\n\nA. Presentations of the lower extremities comprehend cases where one or both feet, one or both knees, and the breech present.\n\ng. Cases where both feet present are more frequent than those where one only presents. It has been calculated that the feet present once in 105 cases of preternatural labour.\n\nSome authors have divided labours of this kind into a great variety of species. There is, however, no necessity for such divisions, and they tend to mislead and embarrass practitioners. All the varieties may be reduced under three heads; for the toes must be either towards the side of the pelvis, or towards the sacrum or pubes.\n\ndd. Where the toes are towards the side of the pelvis, the child is generally placed in such a manner that the abdomen, breast, and face pass in succession along the sacro-iliac synchondrosis of that side. This is the most favourable situation in which the child under such circumstances can be placed; for the largest parts of its body pass through the largest aperture of the pelvis.\n\nIn this case, then, the action of the uterus forcing forward the child, the feet are by degrees excluded through the external parts, the toes being situated between the point of the coccyx and the tuberosity of the ilium; the thighs follow, then the abdomen and thorax; but the farther progress of the child is for some time interrupted by the arms passing up along each side of the head, which add considerably to its bulk; at last, however, the repeated contractions of the uterus force the face into the hollow of the sacrum, and then the nape of the neck turning on the inferior edge of the symphysis pubis as on a pivot, the face is excluded, followed by the falciput and occiput.\n\nWhere the efforts of nature in this process are solely trifled, the child, unless it be small and the pelvis be very capacious, while the soft parts are much relaxed, is generally still-born; for before the obstructions to the delivery of the head be overcome, the long-continued compression of the funis umbilicalis, by intercepting the course of the blood, proves fatal.\n\nee. Authors have generally considered that to be the most favourable position in which the feet can present, where the toes are towards the sacrum. Roederer for example says, \"pedum tunc digiti hi offi facro obvertantur, fetus abdomini incumbens recte situs est (i.).\" But two disadvantages attend this position: First, the largest part of the child's body is forced through the smallest part of the outlet of the pelvis; and secondly, the longest diameter of the head is applied to the shortest diameter of the brim of the pelvis. In such cases, therefore, the patient commonly suffers much pain, and the child's life is destroyed.\n\nff. When the toes are turned to the pubes, it has been universally acknowledged, that the feet are in the worst possible position. Indeed not only do the disadvantages stated as resulting from the last position (ee) equally take place in this one, but another cause of difficulty and danger is added, viz., that the face being applied to the pubes, the progress of the child must be impeded in an inconsiderable degree. Hence in such a case the patient may be very much injured, and the child must be almost inevitably lost.\n\nThe management of footling cases was first explained, in as far as we know, in Dr Hamilton's Select Cases in Midwifery, p. 89.\n\n\"It\n\"It is a curious circumstance that the best mode of delivery in footling cases has not yet been explicitly pointed out by any author. This must appear surprising when it is considered that such presentations frequently occur; that the life of the child depends upon the practice adopted; and that the management of every preternatural labour must be influenced by the rules applicable to footling cases.\n\n\"When the feet present, the infant's situation relatively to the mother must be with its belly placed towards her back, her belly, her side, or some intermediate point. The first of these positions has been generally considered as the most favourable, and the last as the reverse. But a little reflection will convince every practitioner that the infant occupies the least possible space, when its belly is towards the side of the mother, or, to speak more accurately, towards the sacro-iliac synchondrosis; for then the largest part of its body is within the largest diameter of the pelvis at the brim, while in its progress through the pelvis, the breech is not forced through the shortest diameter at the outlet, viz. that between the tubercles of the ilia.\n\n\"In every case therefore where the feet are brought down, the toes should in the process of extraction be turned into such a position, that the belly, the breast, and the face shall be made to pass in succession along the nearest sacro-iliac synchondrosis. After the arms are disengaged, the face can be readily turned into the hollow of the sacrum.\"\n\nh. One foot may present in the same variety of directions as both feet. Where one foot presents naturally, if the pains be regular and strong, the case is attended with less pain to the mother and less danger to the child, than where under the similar circumstances both feet present. It is less painful to the mother, because the child is formed into the shape of a cone, and the apex passes first through the pelvis, by which the parts are gradually prepared, and not suddenly forced open; and, it is less dangerous for the child, because the one leg being folded along the belly and breast, the umbilical cord is protected from compression.\n\nFrom these circumstances, a very erroneous inference has been deduced by some celebrated authors, viz. that in cases where it is necessary to perform the operation styled turning, the one foot should be brought down in preference to both. But as on such occasions the operator cannot be assisted by pains, it is obvious that he could not have a sufficient hold of the child by a single foot.\n\nWith the exceptions just stated, the phenomena where one foot presents are the same with those which occur in cases where both feet are in the passage.\n\ni. When the knees present, all the inconveniences of footling cases take place, with this additional danger to the child, that if the legs be crooked, one or both may be fractured before the knees be expelled.\n\nThe management of knee presentations must depend on the advance which these parts have made at the time assistance is procured. If they be still at the brim of the pelvis, the feet should be hooked down. But if they be fairly within the cavity of the pelvis, or in the vagina, they must be allowed to protrude without the parts until the feet be expelled.\n\nk. Breech cases occur more frequently than footling ones. It has been calculated that they happen once in 52 cases of labour.\n\nThe breech may present in the same variety of positions as the feet, viz., with the belly of the child to the back, to the belly, or to the side of the mother. Certain advantages and disadvantages attend each of these positions.\n\nWhen the belly is to the back of the mother, the thigh bones being straight, pass with difficulty along the curved line of the sacrum; after that obstacle is surmounted, the largest part of the child is applied to the smallest diameter at the brim of the pelvis; and after the body is delivered, the head is situated in such a direction that it cannot enter the brim; for the sinciput is opposite to the promontory of sacrum and the occiput to the symphysis pubis.\n\nIf the belly of the child be to the belly of the mother, then the thigh bones pass very readily along the bones of the pubes, while the spine bending, accommodates itself admirably to the hollow of the sacrum, consequently at first the labour proceeds speedily and safely; but after the breech has passed through the cavity of the pelvis, it is applied with its largest diameter to the shortest diameter at the outlet, and after it has at last overcome the resistance occasioned by that circumstance, and the body is expelled, the face, being towards the symphysis pubis, subjects the patient to all the pain, and the child to all the dangers, already enumerated (ff).\n\nWhen the belly of the child is placed towards the side of the mother in breech cases, then the same advantages attend the situation which have been enumerated under the first footling case (dd); for the largest part of the child is uniformly applied to the largest aperture of the pelvis. Besides this, the child incurs less hazard in this position than where the feet originally present; for the legs being folded on the belly protect the funis umbilicalis from compression.\n\nBreech cases, where the pains are powerful, are to be left entirely to nature, taking care to support the perineum, till the infant be expelled; the navel-string is then to be taken off the stretch, and the child accommodated to the passage on the same principle as footling cases.\n\nWhen the pains prove inadequate to the expulsion of the breech, various methods have been recommended, such as hooking the finger in the groin, first on one side, and then on the other; employing a blunt hook for the same purpose; fixing a garter or piece of tape over one or both thighs, and applying the forceps.\n\nThe first of these methods is useful where there are slight pains, and the infant is not large. The second and third methods are injurious both to the mother and child, for they add to the vis à tergo, without diminishing the resistance. But the fourth method, that is, applying the forceps, is invariably both safe and successful; because, while it enables the practitioner to draw forward the child, without any uterine action, it at the same time puts it in his power to accommodate it to the passage by turning it round in the proper direction.\n\nB. The second division of preternatural labours, includes all cases where any other part than the head or lower extremities presents; such as the neck, the arm or shoulder, the breast, the back, the belly or the side.\nIt is obvious, that a full-grown child cannot possibly be expelled through the natural passageways in such positions, and consequently, unless nature perform the operation first described by Dr Denman, both mother and child must be destroyed; for the unavailing contractions of the uterus will first operate in impeding the circulation of the child; and then by pushing forward its body with great force on the soft parts of the mother, will induce such a degree of pain and inflammation, that she must at last sink exhausted.\n\nThe practice of turning, as it is called, that is, of bringing down the feet in cases belonging to this division of preternatural labours, originally suggested by Pierre Franco, but first properly established by Ambroise Paré, has been the means of saving many valuable lives. Indeed the superiority of this practice to that of making the head present under such circumstances must be very obvious; for after the operator has got hold of the infant's feet, he can complete the delivery without requiring the afflatus of pains.\n\nThe dangers to be dreaded in performing the operation of turning are rupture of the uterus, or subsequent inflammation of the passageways, and loss of the child.\n\nThe first of these, is to be guarded against, by pursuing such means as shall suspend the labour-pains, and remove the uterine stricture, when the opportunity of turning before the discharge of the water which surrounds the infant has been lost. These are blood-letting and opiates in large doses, singly or combined, according to circumstances.\n\nGreat gentleness and caution, on the part of the operator, are indispensably requisite to prevent both rupture of the uterus and the subsequent inflammation of the passageways. When it is added, that a perseverance for several hours is sometimes necessary for accomplishing this operation, it must be obvious, that it demands in many instances a greater degree of patience, as well as dexterity, on the part of the operator, than most cases of surgery.\n\nThe safety of the infant, can only be secured, by attending very accurately to the rules for the management of foaling cases.\n\nDr Denman, whose discovery of the spontaneous evolution has been already mentioned, at one time supposed that in the cases under consideration, the operation of turning might be dispensed with, and that the patient might be saved much hazard, and the practitioner great anxiety and trouble, by waiting for that change.\n\nBut although in the later editions of his valuable work (Introduction to Midwifery), he has relinquished this idea, his observations on the management of preternatural labour of the second order, are evidently influenced by his former opinion.\n\nHe says (vol. ii. p. 249.), \"Yet the knowledge of this fact, however unquestionably proved, does not free us from the necessity and propriety of turning children presenting with the superior extremities, in every case in which that operation can be performed with safety to the mother or give us a better chance of saving the child. Under such circumstances, the instructions given by former writers, and the observations we have before made, must still be considered as proper to guide our conduct. But when we are called to a patient with a preternatural labour, in which there is no room to hope for the preservation of the child, or in which we are assured of its death, or when the operation of turning cannot be performed without violence and some danger to the mother, then the knowledge of this probability of a spontaneous evolution, will set our minds at ease, and disengage us from the consideration of making any hasty attempts to perform a hazardous operation, from which no possible good can be derived, except that of extracting a dead child, and which at all events might be effected by a method much more safe to the mother.\n\n\"The time required for the spontaneous evolution of the child, and the facility with which it may be made, will depend upon a variety of circumstances, but chiefly upon the size of the child, the aptitude of its position, the dimensions of the pelvis, and the power exerted by the uterus. If the child be very large or much below the common size, the slower I believe will be the evolution, nor can it be made at all without a strong action of the uterus. It is possible, therefore, when we have conducted ourselves on the ground of expectation that the evolution would be made, that the pains may fall off or be unequal to the effect, and we may be disappointed. It might then be apprehended, that the difficulty of extracting the child would be infinitely increased. But though the evolution was not perfected, I have not found this consequence; for the child, though not expelled, has been brought into such a state that I could afterwards pass my hand with ease, and bring down its feet, though in an attempt to do this at the beginning of the labour I had been foiled. In one case in which the evolution did not take place, I could not bring down the inferior extremities, but I had no difficulty in fixing an instrument upon the curved part of the body of the child, or in bringing it away with entire safety to the mother. It was before presumed that the child was dead, and the sole object was to free the mother from her danger; and with her safety no appearances of the child, however disagreeable, are to be put in competition. In cases of this kind another mode of practice has been recommended, that of separating the head from the body with a blunt hook or other convenient safe instrument; but as I have never practised the method, I give the description of it in a note.\"\n\nThere are two points in the above observations, in which it appears that Dr Denman has erred. In the first place, in sanctioning delay in having recourse to the operation of turning where the superior extremity presents. In many such cases, if the pains be not speedily suspended, or the position of the child altered, the uterus would burst; an accident which has repeatedly fallen under the observation of the writer of this article.\n\nThe second error is, the supposition that, after it has been found by experience in any given case, that the spontaneous evolution is not to happen, it is easy to extract the child either by the feet or by some instrument. But it will be found in the majority of such cases, that the infant is impacted into to close a body, while the parts are all in a state of swelling and inflammation, that immense difficulty and great danger attend the attempt.\n\nThe following observations on this subject cannot be too strongly impressed on the minds of, especially young, practitioners.\n\n\"Several...\"\n\"Several years ago it was discovered by Dr Denman, that in presentations, such as that in the above case, the position of the child is sometimes altered, and its expulsion accomplished, by the natural contractions of the uterus. Although the doctor, with his usual candour, has allowed, that this favourable event, under such alarming circumstances, is rather to be wished than expected; yet he has offered it as his opinion, that if all interference of art were avoided, \"the woman would not, in this case, die undelivered.\"\n\n\"The preceding history, however, affords a melancholy contradiction to this opinion. The midwife, who attended from the beginning, did nothing to interrupt the natural process, as far as could be learned. Her fatal error was having only looked on, and having neither given that affluence which was necessary, nor sent for others who could do so.\n\n\"The spontaneous evolution, as Dr Denman has called it, can only take place where the child lies in a particular situation, viz. where the action of the uterus cannot be exerted on the presenting part, or where that part is so shaped that it cannot be wedged within the pelvis. A practitioner may, therefore, by a careful examination, be able to decide whether the evolution will happen or not. This observation is by no means a matter of speculation, being, on the contrary, of much practical utility; for, if there be signs which indicate the event alluded to, it follows, as a consequence, not only that the natural process is to be counteracted, but also, that it is to be assisted. Two cases occurred during one year, where the author of these remarks had an opportunity of prognosticating and assuring the evolution, in presence of two gentlemen then attending the professor of midwifery, as annual pupils.\n\n\"That the uterus should continue rigidly contracted on the body of the child, while the strength of the woman was so much exhausted that no pulse could be felt, and that the appeared sinking very fast, is a singular and an instructive fact. It will, it is to be hoped, teach practitioners the fallacy of the assertion, that the longer the operation of turning is delayed, the more easily it will be accomplished.\n\n\"It may seem astonishing, that the body of the child could not be drawn down with the crotchet, since it was in a state of great putridity: But when it is considered, that the long-continued action of the uterus had wedged it very strongly within the pelvis, while, at the same time, the pressure on the soft parts lining that cavity had swelled them much, the circumstance will be readily understood. (x)\"\n\nAuthors have endeavoured to ascertain the causes of preternatural labours; but little satisfaction has been derived from their researches. It is probable, that some cases depend on different causes from others. For example, in some women preternatural labour occurs more than once. Such cases seem to depend on some peculiarity in the uterus or ovum. Again, it is well known to practitioners of midwifery, that, on some occasions, where the child had been found to present naturally at the commencement of labour, the position is perceived to be preternatural after the first stage is completed (o). In these cases, the change of position may perhaps be justly attributed to irregularity of action of the uterus. Besides, there can be little doubt that some cases of preternatural labours originate from the premature rupture of the membranes.\n\n2. The bulk of the fetus also occasions considerable deviations from nature in labour; for it may be either too small or too large.\n\n3. The fetus, at the full period of gestation, is never of so small a size as to occasion any deviation from nature, unless it have been for some time dead. It is indeed a very remarkable fact, that women often carry to the full time a fetus which had died about the fifth or sixth month.\n\nIn such cases, the child is sometimes expelled so rapidly, the pangs opposing little or no resistance, that the uterus is suddenly emptied of its contents; and hence, from the irregularity of its contraction, the placenta is retained, or uterine haemorrhage takes place.\n\nm. The patient, however, is exposed to more dangers from the increased than the diminished bulk of the fetus. The fetus may exceed the ordinary size, either from a natural increase of bulk, or from monstrosity, or from disease.\n\nk. It has been already stated that the fetus at the full term of gestation, generally weighs from seven to nine pounds; but on some rare occasions it is found to exceed ten or twelve pounds, or even thirteen. Although, however, the process of delivery is not so rapid where the child is so large, yet if no other circumstance occurs to impede labour, it will be eventually terminated with safety both to mother and child in most cases. Where indeed, under such circumstances, the patient has not formerly had a child, there is always reason to apprehend that the infant may be destroyed by apoplexy, or the mother may be very much bruised. In some cases of this kind, it becomes necessary to open the head of the infant.\n\n14. When the child is monstrous, from the redundancy of some large parts, as from two heads or two bodies, it is sufficiently obvious that if the mother be at the full term of gestation, the obstacles to delivery will be insurmountable by the natural powers. Fortunately, however, in by far the greatest number of cases of monsters of that kind, the action of the uterus is excited before the ordinary period.\n\nmm. The most frequent disease of children, which proves an obstacle to labour, is the enlargement of the head from hydrocephalus. On some occasions the head is enlarged to an extraordinary size.\n\nSometimes too, the thorax or abdomen is distended and enlarged by a watery fluid. Professor Saxtorph has recorded the following example of an obstacle to delivery from a very uncommon disease. \"D. 18. Sept. 1775. in domo obstetricia regia, mox partu admittatur gravida.

Of the Deviations from Natural Labour, which depend on the State of the Paflages through which the Child is forced.\n\nThe deviations from natural labour occasioned by the state of the paflages, originate either from the soft parts, or the bones.\n\nThe obstacles from the soft parts are tumours within the womb, thickening and induration of the neck and mouth of the womb, enlargement of the ovary, cicatrix in the vagina, collection of faeces within the rectum, swelling of the parts lining the pelvis, malformation and extreme rigidity of the external parts.\n\nIt is a curious fact, not only that conception sometimes takes place when there is a tumour within the womb, but also that pregnancy goes on to the full period. When this has happened, the tumour has been pushed down before the infant, and has filled up the paflages.\n\nIf this obstacle be ascertained at an early period of the labour, which it must be if the practitioner be in any ordinary degree skilful and attentive, the tumour may be pushed back, and the feet of the child may be brought down. In a case of this kind, where the writer of this article was called in after the tumour had become wedged within the pelvis, and the head had been opened, the delivery was accomplished with extreme difficulty, and the poor woman survived only a few hours.\n\nThe following singular case of an excrescence on the os uteri, is stated by Dr Denman, vol. ii. p. 65.\n\n\"In June 1770, I was desired to see a patient in the eighth month of her pregnancy, who in the preceding night had a profuse hemorrhage. Her countenance shewed the effects of the great loss of blood she had sustained; and from the representation of the case given me by the gentleman who was first called in, I concluded that the placenta was fixed over the os uteri. On examination I felt a very large flethy tumour at the extremity of the vagina, repelling and nearly equalling in size the placenta, which I judged it to be. Had this been the case, there could not be a doubt of the propriety and necessity of delivering the patient speedily; and with that intention I palped my finger round the tumour, to discover the state of the os uteri. But this I could not find, and on a more accurate examination, I was convinced that this tumour was an excrescence growing from the os uteri, with a very extended and broad basis. I then concluded that the patient was not with child, notwithstanding the dilatation of the abdomen, but that she laboured under some disease which resembled pregnancy, and that the hemorrhage was the consequence of the disease. A matter which was very evidently perceived when I applied my hand to the abdomen, did not prevail with me to alter this opinion.\n\n\"It was of all others a case in which a consultation was desirable, both to decide upon the disease, and the measures which it might be necessary to pursue; and several gentlemen of eminence were called in. That she was actually pregnant, was afterwards proved to the satisfaction of every one; and it was then concluded, that such means should be used as might prevent or lessen the hemorrhage, and that we should wait and see what efforts might be naturally made for accomplishing the delivery.\n\n\"No very urgent symptom occurred till the latter end of July, when the hemorrhage returned in a very alarming way, and it was thought necessary that the patient should be delivered. There was not a possibility of extirpating the tumour, and yet it was of such a size, as to prevent the child from being born in any other way than by lessening the head. This was performed; but after many attempts to extract the child, the patient was so exhausted, that it became necessary to leave her to her repose, and very soon after our leaving her, she expired.\n\n\"We were permitted to examine the body. There was no appearance of disease in any of the abdominal viscera, or on the external surface of the uterus, which was of its regular form; and when a large oval piece was taken out of the anterior part, the child, which had\n\n(1) Vide Societatis medicæ Haumeris Collectanea, vol. 2d, p. 23.\nhad no marks of putrefaction, was found in a natural position. An incision was made on each side of the cervix to the vagina, and then a large cauliflower excretion was found growing to the whole anterior part of the os uteri. The placenta adhered with its whole surface; so that the blood which had loit must have been wholly discharged from the tumour (m).”\n\nIn two cases, where a great thickening and induration of the neck and mouth of the womb, approaching to the nature of schirrocity, had taken place previous to conception, the natural action of the uterus, though after a very considerable time indeed, assisted by copious blood-letting, eventually overcame the resistance. One of the patients died ten months after, with all the symptoms of real cancer uteri. The other was restored to perfect health after lying-in.\n\nDr Denman has recorded (vol. ii. p. 73.) two cases, where the enlarged ovarium impeded the progress of the child. In the one case the head of the infant was opened, and the delivery completed by the crotchet; but the patient died at the distance of three weeks. In the other, a trocar was passed into the tumour, and a living child was born. The patient recovered from her lying-in; but died hectic at the end of six months. In such cases, the ovary may be pushed back, if the circumstance be discovered early enough.\n\nCicatrix of the vagina, in consequence of former injury, may appear at first to impede the progress of the infant; but it will always be found to yield to the pains, if the strength of the patient be supported, and proper means be adopted to counteract the effects of the long-continued labour throes. A case occurred some time ago to Dr Hamilton, where a subsidence, of the hardness of gristle, as thick as an ordinary sized finger, placed between the vagina and rectum, and apparently extending from the ramus of one ilium to that of the other, presented an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the child. He was called in after an unsuccessful attempt had been made to tear away the infant, and found the woman in a state of extreme danger. He was informed, that five years before that period, she had had a very severe tedious labour, followed by great inflammation and suppuration of the external parts. The indurated part was cut through without the patient making any complaint, and the child was very easily extracted; but she survived the delivery only two days. The relations would not permit the body to be opened.\n\nA collection of faeces within the rectum has been known to occasion such resistance to the passage of the child, that the woman has died undelivered. In general, however, it is in the power of an active practitioner to empty the gut at the beginning of labour. But if, from neglect, the head of the child be jammed in the pelvis, and immovably wedged in consequence of an accumulation of faeces, it then becomes necessary to open the head.\n\nPerhaps the most frequent affection of the soft parts which impedes the process of the infant is, swelling of the parts lining the pelvis. This circumstance has been already hinted at. It can never happen where the parturient practitioner is ordinarily attentive; for the tenderness, heat, and dryness of the passages, which precede the actual swelling, cannot be overlooked by one at all aware of the possibility of such an event. When it has actually happened, nothing can save the mother but opening the head of the infant. After this most unpleasant operation is completed, the extraction of the child is seldom a matter of much difficulty.\n\nMalformation of the external parts in some cases does not prevent conception. Two cases have fallen within the knowledge of the writer of this article, where the woman had conceived though the orifice of the vagina had not been capable of permitting the introduction of even the little finger. And it confits with his knowledge, that about thirty years ago a woman under similar circumstances, was brought into the Royal Infirmary of this place, and was delivered by the caesarean operation. She died within two days.\n\nIt is sufficiently obvious that the safe practice under such circumstances is to enlarge the natural opening, by making an incision in the direction of the perineum, taking care not to wound the sphincter ani.\n\nExtreme rigidity of the external parts is one of the most frequent causes of deviation which depends on the state of the soft parts. It takes place, in a greater or less degree, in the greatest number of women who lie in for the first time; and generally in all women who are considerably advanced in life before they have children.\n\nIt is seldom that the resistance opposed by the external parts is so very great as to prove an invincible obstacle to labour. But, on many occasions, the long-continued pressure of the child on those parts produces the most disagreeable consequences, as inflammation of all these parts and of the bladder. Inflammation in those parts is always dangerous, for there seems to be a remarkable tendency to gangrene. Cases are on record where the whole parts have sloughed off, and where the rectum, vagina, and bladder, have formed one canal. Perhaps death is much preferable to life under such circumstances.\n\nCopious blood-letting, and the liberal use of some unctuous application, with time and patience, in general overcome the rigidity of the external parts. Placing the patient over the streams of hot water was formerly recommended in such cases, but this practice is now exploded.\n\nB. Many deviations from natural labour occur from the state of the bones of the pelvis, for they may be so much altered in shape as either to increase or diminish considerably the aperture of that part.\n\nd. When the apertures of the pelvis are too large, the mother incurs much danger, and the child is not totally exempt from hazard.\n\naa. The danger incurred by the mother arises from there being no resistance to the passage of the child, so that when the action of the uterus begins, the child may be pushed by the force of the pains through the passage before the soft parts be dilated; hence the uterus may be ruptured, or the soft parts lacerated. If\n\n(m) Were such a case again to occur, there could be no doubt respecting the propriety of fixing a ligature round the neck of the tumour.\non the other hand, the external parts be soft and yielding, a considerable portion of the uterus may be excluded without the parts. There is a very wonderful history of a case of this kind alluded to by Saxtorph in the following words, \"Memorabilis adhuc exemplum est illud a cel. Wolfg. Mullnero allatum, ubi totus uterus una cum foetu extra genitalia dilapsus, foetusque vivus extra pelvim veriome extractus fuit, matre poll reductionem uteri superflite. Vide ejus Bahrnehmung von einer famt dem Rinde aufgefallenen Debahrmutter, Nurnberg 1771 (l.)\"\n\nbb. The hazard which the child undergoes is that of being suddenly expelled, included within the entire ovum, so that it may be lost before proper assistance can be afforded. Another danger is, that the membranes having given way, it may be dashed with violence upon the floor on which the patient walks. Whenever from the great width of the hips, there is reason to suspect that the pelvis is too large, the practitioner should continue in constant attendance from the very commencement of labour, and should carefully adopt the appropriate and obvious means to prevent the hazards just enumerated.\n\ne. But deficiency of space in the apertures of the pelvis occurs much more frequently than increase. The apertures of the pelvis may be diminished from natural small size or malformation of the bones, from exostosis, or from altered shape in consequence of mollities ossium.\n\nCases where the sacrum and ilia are of an uncommon small shape are not frequent. Narrowness of the base of the sacrum is sometimes met with; and in a few cases it has been found that the apex of the sacrum has approached too nearly to the anterior part of the pelvis, so as to diminish the apertures at the outlet.\n\nExostoses seldom prove an obstacle to delivery; but one exception to this rule fell under the observation of the writer of this article several years ago. The exostosis extended along the whole extent of the symphys pubis, and was fully as thick as an ordinary fixed finger. The woman had been delivered previous to his being called in, but the exhaustion which followed, (for she had been allowed to continue five days and nights in constant hard labour) occasioned her sinking a very short time after delivery. In this instance both mother and child were lost from the self-sufficiency and ignorance of the midwife.\n\nThe deficiency may exist in the brim, the outlet, or the cavity singly or combined.\n\nThe brim is much more frequently affected by mollities ossium than the outlet; and, as was long ago remarked by Levret, it generally happens, that when the brim is narrowed from this cause, the outlet is widened.\n\nThe brim may be diminished in size by the projection of the promontory of the sacrum, or by the flattening of the pubes, or by the approximation of the bones where the pubes and ilia unite, or by a combination of some of these circumstances. The projection of the promontory of the sacrum, however, is by far the most common. When this happens, the projection sometimes renders one side of the pelvis wider than the other, and this constitutes what authors call the distorted pelvis. Sometimes, however, it leaves both sides of an equal width, and this is called the deformed pelvis.\n\nThe deficiency in the brim produced by these causes is very various; most frequently slight, but sometimes so great that there is not an inch between pubes and facrum.\n\nThe outlet may be diminished by the approximation of the tubercles and rami of the ilchia, or by the apex of the facrum and coccyx projecting more than usually forward, while they are at the same time hooked up.\n\nWhen both the brim and outlet are diminished in aperture, the cavity of the pelvis is generally affected also; but when the deficiency of space is confined to either, the cavity is commonly more shallow than natural, by which both the resistance and the danger are considerably lessened. Melancholy are the cases where the cavity is rendered deeper than usual.\n\nAs the practice in cases of extreme deficiency in the apertures of the pelvis is to be regulated by the degree of narrowness, it is a matter of the first importance to be able to ascertain the dimensions in any given case with tolerable precision.\n\nFor this purpose, instruments called pelvimetres have been invented. M. Coutouli has proposed one for internal use, and M. Baudeloque has recommended one for external application. But however plausible in theory the use of such contrivances may appear, it is now well known that no dependence can be placed upon them in actual practice, and therefore the hand of the operator must be had recourse to for determining both the shape and the extent of the apertures of the pelvis, wherever there is any narrowness. The following directions for this purpose given by Dr Wallace Johnson are extremely judicious.\n\n\"On palping the finger along the vagina, if the coccyx, or any part of the facrum, be felt unusually forwards or near at hand; or if the symphys, or any other part of the pubes, is found projecting rather inwards than outwards, it is evident that the pelvis is distorted. In which case, as well as in those where it is not distorted, but only very small, the principal part of the child's head (allowing the presentation right) remains high, the vertex making only a little round tumor within the brim; so that when the os uteri is opened, and come a little forwards towards the pubes, the capacity of the pelvis may be found out by moving the end of the finger round that part of the head which has entered the upper strait. This method is used by several practitioners in London. However, should the finger not be long enough to effect it properly, as sometimes is the case, there is then another method, which, being more certain, may be used, provided it be done with tenderness and caution, and when the orifices are so well opened as to admit of it with safety. But previous to it, the operator must be well acquainted with the dimensions of his own hand, viz.\"\n\n(l) Dissertatio Inauguralis de Diverfo Partu, &c. Auctore Matth. Saxtorph. p. 46.\n\"First, The fingers of a middle-sized hand (as we may suppose the operator's to be) being gathered together equally into the palm, and the thumb extended and applied closely along the second or middle joint of the finger; the distance between the end of the thumb, and outer edge of the middle joint of the little finger, is usually four inches.\n\n\"Secondly, Whilst they are in the above position, the distance from the thumb, at the root of the nail, in a straight line to the outside of the middle joint of the little finger, is full three inches and a half.\n\n\"Thirdly, The fingers being still in the same situation, and the thumb laid obliquely along the joints next the nails of the first two fingers, and bent down upon them; the distance between the outside of the middle joint of the fore finger, and the outside of that of the little finger is three inches and a quarter.\n\n\"Fourthly, The hand being opened, and the tops of the four fingers being a little bent, so as to come nearly in a straight line; their whole breadth, across the joint next the nails, is two inches and a half.\n\n\"Fifthly, When the first three fingers are thus bent, their breadth across the same joint is two inches.\n\n\"Sixthly, The breadth of the first two, across the nail of the first finger, is one inch and a quarter.\n\n\"And seventhly, The fingers being gathered into a conical form, the thumb lying obliquely upon the palm of the hand with its point upon the first joint of the ring finger, reckoning downwards, will measure in thicknesses, between its back and the fore part of the thumb, two inches and two eighths.\n\n\"Now, as hands are extremely various, the operator ought always to know how much the size of his differs from the above dimensions; and this being rightly understood, the application may be made as follows:\n\n\"The patient, being in the position as for natural delivery, and the operator's left hand being well anointed, and the fingers and thumb gathered into a cone, it must be gently passed into the vagina; and then through the os uteri, unless in this part there is still a rigidity to forbid it; if so, the fingers only must be passed, their extremities formed into the fourth dimension, and then placed edgeway in the strait; which being done, if the fore finger touch the angle of the faenum, and the little one the symphyse of the pubes, the width is then manifestly no more than two inches and a half; a space through which a mature child can neither pass alive, nor be brought so by art, unless it happens to be prematurely small indeed.\"\n\nThree methods of practice have been adopted in cases of such narrowness of the pelvis as renders it impossible for the child to be produced alive, viz. the operation of embryulcia or embryotomy, the Caesarean section, and the division of the symphyse pubis.\n\nI. Embryotomy. The cases requiring this most shocking operation are those where the infant cannot be extracted alive through the natural passages; while there is, nevertheless, such space that it may be torn away piece-meal without injury to the mother. Of premature course, in these cases the life of the woman can be saved only at the expense of her infant.\n\nBut although authors and practitioners in modern times adopt in general this principle, they differ materially in their account of the precise cases requiring the operation.\n\nDr Olborn alleges, that, as the head of the infant at the full time of utero-gestation cannot be diminished to less than three inches between the parietal protuberances by the natural contractions of the uterus forcing it against the bones of the pelvis; whereas the aperture at the brim or outlet falls under three inches, the operator ought to proceed as soon as possible to open the head of the infant.\n\nBut on so very serious an operation as that by which one life is destroyed, it becomes a practitioner to adopt no rule which can be at all liable to error; and it is evident, that there are three very strong objections to this precept of Dr Olborn.\n\nFirst, It is impossible in any case at the beginning of labour, to ascertain that the infant is at the full term of utero-gestation; but it is well known, that a child at the age of between seven and eight months, if born alive, may be reared to maturity, and that such a child is capable of being expelled without injury, through an aperture incapable of permitting the passage of a full grown fetus.\n\nSecondly, The heads of children, even at the full time, are sometimes so small and so yielding as to admit readily of their short diameter being diminished below three inches.\n\nThirdly, Every candid practitioner must allow, that it is quite impossible to ascertain with geometrical accuracy the precise dimensions of the pelvis; and consequently what in any given case may appear to the operator to be less than three inches, may in fact be above these dimensions.\n\nFor these reasons, wherever the narrowness is not obviously very considerable, the prudent rule is to ascertain the effect of the labour-throes, supporting the strength of the patient, and palliating distressing symptoms. By adopting this rule, the practitioner will not only have the consciousness of not having destroyed life unnecessarily, where he is eventually forced to open the head, by the conviction that it is too large to pass unopened, but also the innate satisfaction of sometimes saving a life, which under less cautious management must have been sacrificed. Great care indeed is necessary in such cases not to be deceived in the estimate of the progress of the child, for the swelling of the scalp may mislead a young practitioner.\n\nThere has been a variety of opinion too, respecting the lowest dimensions of the pelvis which permit the operation of embryulcia with safety to the mother; and it is surely unnecessary to state, that unless there be a moral probability of saving the life of the mother by this operation, it ought never to be had recourse to.\n\nDr Kellie, of London (r), and Dr Olborn (q), have recorded some cases where this operation was performed, although\n\n(r) Dr Wallace Johnson.\n(q) Dr Olborn's Essays.\nalthough the narrowness was very great; and the latter gentleman, founding on a single case, affirms the principle, that whenever there is a space equal to an inch and a half between pubes and sacrum, the operation of embryulcia is practicable. But a careful perusal of the case alluded to (A) must satisfy any unprejudiced person that there must have been some mistake, most probably, from the swelling of the soft parts lining the pelvis having added to the apparent narrowness, and having, after the head had been opened above 36 hours, subsided. And at any rate, since experience has now fully established the fact, that the danger resulting from this operation is always in proportion to the degree of resistance, it may be concluded that the operation of embryulcia cannot prove safe to the mother, unless, first, there be an aperture equal to about two inches by four; and, secondly, the narrowness be chiefly, if not altogether, confined either to the brim or the outlet. When both brim and outlet are deficient, and the cavity is deeper than usual, even although the several apertures be quite sufficient to allow the diminished head to be extracted, the injury that must accrue from the violent pressure on all the parts within the pelvis would deter any prudent practitioner from hazarding such an operation.\n\nWhen it is determined to have recourse to the operation of embryotomy, the instruments required are the perforator, the crotchet, and the embryotomy forceps delineated in the plate.\n\nThe operation is to consist of two different processes; first, the diminution of the head; and, secondly, the extraction of the mangled child. In many cases the latter should be performed immediately after the former is accomplished; but whenever the resistance is very considerable, an interval should be interposed between the two. The advantages resulting from this practice were first publicly noticed by Dr Osborn, though there can be little doubt that the practice itself was the effect of necessity. By waiting after the head has been opened, the woman's strength will be restored, so that the assistance of the pains in the expulsion of the child may be obtained; the swelling of the soft parts will subside, by which the resistance may be greatly lessened, as well as the danger of inflammation removed, and the child's body will become putrid, by which its extraction may be greatly facilitated.\n\nIn opening the head, which is to be done by means of the perforator, the two great points to be aimed at are to avoid injuring any part of the woman, and to make a sufficiently large opening of the head. On the complete accomplishment of the latter, the eventual success of the operation must depend in all cases of extreme deficiency of space.\n\nShould it be found expedient to delay the extraction of the infant after the head has been opened and its contents evacuated, the teguments are to be carefully brought over the ragged edges of the bones, so that in the event of labour throes recurring, there shall be no risk of the parts within the pelvis being injured.\n\nWhen it has been found proper to proceed to the extraction of the infant, the first thing to be attempted is to diminish the bulk of the cranium as much as possible. This may be done by means of the embryulcia forceps, delineated in the plates, and contrived it is believed by Dr Lyon of Liverpool. It is an instrument far superior to the almisdach of the Arabians, in use even within these fifty years among the practitioners of this island (B).\n\nAfter the head has been sufficiently reduced in bulk, the crotchet is to be fixed at first on the inside of the cranium; and while two fingers of the left hand are to be kept constantly so applied that if the instrument should slip in the process of extraction, it shall be received on the fingers, and cannot possibly touch any part of the mother, the operator is to draw down with a suitable exertion of force, in such a direction that the largest part of the head shall be brought through the widest part of the pelvis.\n\nIn some cases, much time and very violent exertions are required to accomplish the delivery; but, if the proper precautions to prevent any injury to the passages be adopted, and if at the same time the operator imitate nature by working only from time to time, and increase the force employed gradually as may be required, and persevere patiently, notwithstanding the resistance, taking care to support by nourishment and cordials the strength of the woman, the delivery at last will be completed.\n\nThe dangers to be dreaded from this most shocking operation, are injuries of the passages, from the instrument's slipping through the embarrassment of the practitioner; or violent inflammation of all the contents of the pelvis extending to the abdomen, in consequence of the parts through which the child must be so forcibly extracted being severely bruised. Accordingly, a greater number of women die from the effects of this operation than practitioners are willing to admit; and indeed, in every case of extreme deficiency of space, where embryotomy is performed, the recovery is to be regarded as doubtful.\n\nThis operation is sometimes had recourse to in cases where the forceps should have been used had the child been alive. But such cases are very rare, because the evidence of the infant in utero being dead, is seldom so complete as to justify the practitioner proceeding on the principle that it is so.\n\nII. By the Cesarean section is meant the extraction of the infant through the parietes of the abdomen by an incision into the uterus.\n\nThis bold operation was perhaps never performed by the ancients on the living subject, and certainly was first recommended to practitioners by M. Rouffet in his Traité nouvelle de l'Hystérotomie, &c. 1581. Since that time it has been often performed on the continent, and about twenty times in Great Britain. The success of this operation recorded in the early works has certainly been exaggerated; but it appears by an elaborate memoir by M. Baudelocque, translated into English by\n\n(A) Osborn's Essay, p. 240.\n(B) For an account of the ancient instruments employed in the practice of midwifery, see Sculteti Arnaud. Chir.\nby Dr Hull of Manchester, that during the 50 years preceding 1802, the operation has been had recourse to on the continent 95 times, and that 37 of these cases proved successful. In Great Britain, on the contrary, this operation has never yet succeeded, a circumstance to be attributed partly to the delay which has always taken place after the necessity for such an expedient had been determined, and hence the patient, at the time the operation was performed, must have been in a state of exhaustion; and partly, perhaps chiefly, to the previous very alarming state of health of the subjects of the operation in this island. It is at any rate certain that all over the continent practitioners have less horror at performing the Caesarean section than British practitioners have commonly thrown; and it is deemed necessary in cases where the operation of embryotomy is preferred in this country, and where of course the women are not in such a precarious state of health as those commonly are who have extreme narrowness of the pelvis.\n\nIn consequence of the fatality of the Caesarean section in Great Britain, several eminent practitioners have regarded it as unjustifiable. Dr Olborn has rendered himself particularly conspicuous on this subject, and uses very strong language in reprobation of it. His arguments are, its acknowledged fatality; the capability of completing the delivery by means of the crotchet, in cases of such deformity of the pelvis, that there is no more than one and a half inch between the pubis and sacrum, or to one side of the projecting sacrum; and the impossibility of impregnation taking place in cases of greater deficiency of space. We shall notice these arguments in their turn.\n\n1st, The acknowledged fatality of the operation.—This relates only to the result of the operation in Great Britain; for, as already mentioned, a great proportion of the patients has been saved on the continent. But in insisting on this argument Dr Olborn has overlooked that the object of the operation is to save, if possible, two lives, and at any rate one. Now if it can be satisfactorily proved, that on some occasions the operation of embryotomy is absolutely impracticable, it becomes the duty of the practitioner to save one life at least; and it is well known that the Caesarean operation is far less painful to the woman than that of embryotomy, even where that latter operation is eventually successful. In such cases of extreme deformity, either an attempt should be made to deliver the woman and save the child, or both must be allowed to perish; for the operation of embryotomy, if attempted, must be regarded as wilful murder.\n\n2ndly, The practicability of tearing away the child in pieces by means of the perforation and crotchet, in cases where there is no more than an inch and a half between the pubis and sacrum, or to one side of the projecting sacrum, is alleged by the doctor on the foundation of a single case, that of Elizabeth Sherwood already referred to. But any person who shall take the trouble to have the aperture of Sherwood's pelvis, as stated by Dr Olborn cut out in wood, and to compare this with the basis of an infant's skull as much diminished as possible by the crotchet (which is done in the course of his lectures by the professor of midwifery in this university), will be convinced, that there was some mistake in the supposed dimensions of that woman's pelvis. And it is quite obvious, that unless there be the space already stated, viz. three and a half or four inches by two, it is unsafe to extract the mangled child through the natural passages.\n\n3rdly, The allegation that where there is a greater degree of narrowness of the pelvis than that which was supposed to have happened in the case of Sherwood impregnation cannot take place, is quite inconsistent with facts. One of the most remarkable cases of extreme deformity is that of Elizabeth Thompson, on whom the Caesarean operation was performed at Manchester in 1802. The description as given by Dr Hull (c) is as follows: \"The pelvis of this patient was not nearly so foott as has sometimes been observed. It still had a considerable degree of bony firmness. The osa innominata at their sacro-iliac synchondroses, and at the symphysis pubis, before the pelvis was dried, admitted of a slight degree of motion.—The distance from the crista of one os ilium to the other, at their most remote points, measures ten inches and a half.\n\n\"The alae of both osa ilia are very much bent; and on the left side the curvature is so great, that it measures only two inches from the anterior and inferior spinous process to the opposite posterior point. The lumbar vertebrae project forwards or inwards, and make a considerable curve to the left side of the pelvis. The distance from the lower part of the second lumbar vertebra to the anterior part of the spine of the os ilium, on the left side, is two inches. The distance from the lowest part of the second lumbar vertebra to the anterior part of the spine of the os ilium, on the right side, is five inches.\n\n\"Superior aperture. The conjugate or antero-posterior diameter, from the symphysis pubis to the upper edge of the last lumbar vertebra is one inch and a half. —This diameter is not taken from the os sacrum, or its junction with the last lumbar vertebra, because the point of their junction is so much sunk into the pelvis, that the place it should have occupied, is represented by the junction of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebra. The transverse diameter measures four inches and five-eighths. It is taken from one sacro-iliac symphysis to the other. The distance of the point of this aperture, which is opposite to the anterior part of the right acetabulum, from the lumbar vertebra, is only half an inch. The distance from that part of this aperture, which corresponds with the posterior part of the right acetabulum, to the os sacrum is three-fourths of an inch. The distance of the point, corresponding with the anterior part of the left acetabulum, from the lumbar vertebra is five-eighths of an inch. The distance of the point of this aperture, opposite to the posterior part of the left acetabulum, from the os sacrum, is three-fourths of an inch. The distance of one os pubis from the other, in the points marked in the plate, is seven-eighths of an inch. The distance from the right sacro-iliac symphysis to the symphysis pubis is three inches and three-fourths. The distance\n\n(c) Observations on Mr Simmons's Detection, &c. p. 195.\nMIDWIFERY.\n\nChap. IV.\n\nDistance from the right sacro-iliac symphysis to the left os pubis is three inches and three-eighths. The distance from the left sacro-iliac symphysis to the symphysis pubis is three inches and five-eighths. The distance from the left sacro-iliac symphysis to the right os pubis is three inches and one-fourth. The largest circle, that can be formed in any part of the superior aperture, does not exceed in diameter one inch.\n\n\"Inferior aperture. The distance from one ramus ossis ilii to the other, where they are united with the rami ossium pubis, measures only half an inch. The distance from the tuberosity of one os ilium to the other measures one inch and two-tenths. The conjugate or antero-posterior diameter, taken from the symphysis pubis to the point of the os coccygis is three inches.\n\n\"The angle, included by the rami of the os pubis, is very acute, viz. an angle of about 20 degrees. The perpendicular height from the tubera of the osa ilchia to the inferior margin of the symphysis pubis is two inches and a half. The perpendicular height of the symphysis pubis is one inch and a half. The tuberosity of the left os ilium advances forwards, beyond that of the right, about six-tenths of an inch, and the whole of the rami ossis pubis and ilii on the left side projects beyond those of the right. The perpendicular height of the os sacrum and coccyx is two inches and one-fourth only, the os sacrum being bent so as to form a very acute angle. The acetabula, at their nearest points, are only three inches distant. The symphysis pubis is much more prominent than natural. The upper margin of the symphysis pubis is situated as high as the bottom of the fourth lumbar vertebra.\"\n\nIt appears then, that Dr Othorn's arguments are fallacious, and that cases occur where the operation of embryotomy is neither safe nor practicable. Under such circumstances, the Caesarean section must be had recourse to; and it is therefore to be regarded as an operation of necessity, not one of choice. If this rule be adopted, the cases requiring so formidable an expedient will happily be very seldom met with.\n\nMr Simmons of Manchester, observing that Dr Othorn's third argument is untenable, has proposed in the following words, another substitute for the Caesarean operation.\n\n\"When a case shall arise in which the child cannot be delivered by the crotchet, from the brim of the pelvis being no more than one inch in diameter; I propose to combine the two operations, and to divide the symphysis pubis to make way for the crotchet. Dr Othorn has urged several objections against this proposal, although he admits that the operation at the symphysis is not so certainly fatal as the Caesarean section. Weighty objections doubtless press against it; but whilst there are no other means for preserving life, bad as the chance is, it becomes a question whether it be worth risking; and, after maturely considering the case, should an attempt for saving the life of the mother be judged expedient, as the last resource it may be adopted.\n\n\"The space gained has been differently stated at from three to eight or nine lines in the diameter;—the medium distance would probably be sufficient to accomplish the delivery by the crotchet.\n\n\"The objections urged against this mode of delivery, when the head is of the full size, will not apply to its reduced bulk; and it should be remembered, that the Pretermaturnal Par-\n\ntition.\n\nsymphysis is formed of cartilage and ligament; so that whatever pressure shall be made against the divided edges, will not be made against the sharp angles of bone. That much injury may be done anteriorly will not be denied; but, does the continued pressure of the child's head never produce mischief in other cases? By the introduction of a female found for a guide, a cautious and steady operator will avoid wounding the urethra; and, as the base of the skull will probably be turned sideways, it will suffer less in extraction than in other cases of the crotchet; in which it must in general be injured from pressure against the pubis. If the separation, however, be carried beyond a certain length, laceration will probably ensue; and, should this accident occur, I see no reason to apprehend more danger from it than follows the extraction of a large stone from the bladder through a small opening, which will induce a lacerated wound, but which we know will not uncommonly heal. The sacro-iliac ligaments would certainly not be injured by choice, but the consequences, I believe, are not generally fatal; and, should it be urged that great pain and lancinens will afflict the patient for a long time after, a reply will readily occur, that life was at stake; and surely there are few who would not compound, for the prospect of temporary pain and inconvenience, to have it preferred to them.\n\n\"A spontaneous separation sometimes occurs, both there and at the pubis; and yet the patient has been again restored to health.\n\n\"I do not see, in other respects, in what this compound operation differs from the most difficult crotchet case—the Caesarean section is certainly fatal to the mother in this country—the life of the child, it is agreed, shall not be put in competition with the parent's life—the section of the symphysis is neither so formidable nor so fatal as the Caesarean section—and the crotchet has been successfully applied in dimensions which will probably be thus acquired.\n\n\"Upon the whole, then, in that supposed case of distortion (which I hope will never happen) in which the mother must be doomed to death, from the impossibility of delivering the child by the crotchet, the compound operation I have recommended will furnish a resource, approved by reason and sanctioned by experience; inasmuch as the section of the symphysis pubis has been made, and the crotchet has been used, though separately, yet with safety. Such a case will be attended, unquestionably, with additional hazard; but it offers the only chance to the mother, to the preservation of whose life our chief care should be directed: and, I hope that in future all trace of the Caesarean operation will be banished from professional books; for it can never be justifiable during the parent's life, and stands recorded only to disgrace the art.\"\n\nHe himself has afforded the most satisfactory evidence of the absurdity of his own proposal; for he had not published it many months when the very case he had described as ideal actually occurred in his neighbourhood, and he had the opportunity of making the experiment of his own plan. But he shrunk from it, and no wonder; for the woman was Elizabeth Thompson, whose pelvis has just been described. It is unfortunate that Mr Simmons has not had the candour to confess his error, and to retract his opinions, more especially since his reflections\nWith respect to the mode of performing the Caesarean section, there has been considerable variety of opinion. On theoretical principles, the external incision, viz., that through the parietes abdominis, ought to be in the direction of the linea alba, because there is less chance of any considerable retraction of muscular fibres, or of interfering with the intestines, than if it were made in any other direction. But the result of the practice seems at variance with the theory. According to the testimony of Baudeloque, of 35 operations, where the incision was made on the side of the abdomen, eighteen proved successful; of thirty in the direction of the linea alba, ten only succeeded; and of eight in the manner recommended by Laverjat, that is, by a transverse incision between the recti muscles and spina dorsi, three succeeded. But it may be remarked, that the event, in many of those cases, may have been influenced by a variety of circumstances, totally independent of the line of direction of the external incision.\n\nIn whatever part of the abdomen the external incision be made, it ought to be extended to six inches; and, previous to cutting into the uterus, any active arterial branch, which may have been divided, must be secured; and the liquor amnii, if not already discharged, must be drawn off. The opening into the uterus need not be above five inches in length, and should be made as much towards the fundus as possible. Means are to be employed to prevent the protrusion of the intestines at the time the uterus is emptied. Both fetus and secundines are to be quickly extracted; after which, the hand is to be passed into the uterus, to clear out any coagula which may have formed within its cavity, to prevent the os tineae being plugged up, and, at the same time, to promote the contraction of the uterus. The wound in the uterus is to be left to nature; but that of the parietes of the abdomen is to be carefully closed by means of the interrupted suture and adhesive straps; and the whole belly is to be properly supported by a suitable bandage or waistcoat. In the after-treatment of the patient, the great objects to be held in view, are to support the strength and moderate the degree of local inflammation.\n\nIII. Division of the symphyses pubis.—This was originally proposed and performed by M. Sigault of Paris. His proposal was made in 1768; but he had no opportunity of making the actual experiment till September 1777. The success of his first case was such, that a medal was struck to commemorate the event; and the operation was admired and recommended, with all the extravagance of French enthusiasm.\n\nThe operation consists of the division of the symphyses pubis and separation of the innominate. For this purpose, a catheter is to be introduced into the urethra, and, with a common scalpel, the articulation is to be cut through from the upper edge of the symphysis, to within a quarter of an inch of the inferior edge. By separating the thighs, the divided bones are forced asunder. After this, the operator is either to turn the child, or to extract it by the forceps, according to the circumstances of the case.\n\nThis expedient was proposed as a substitute, both for the operation of embryotomy, and for the Caesarean section, as it was alleged to be perfectly consistent with the safety both of mother and child.\n\nIt is quite unnecessary for us to offer any theoretical objections to this operation, because we can show reason on the event of thirty-five cases, which have been published.—But those who may wish to investigate this subject, may consult Baudeloque, par. 1994 and 2091, inclusive; and Dr Olborn, p. 271. To that latter practitioner's professional zeal and ability is chiefly to be ascribed the total rejection of this operation in Great Britain.\n\nOf the thirty-five subjects of the published cases (for in one woman it was performed twice), fourteen women and eighteen children died.—Of the twenty-one women who survived, nine had either had living children before the Sigaultian operation, or had such at a subsequent period. Most of the remainder suffered much from the operation. Some had incurable incontinence of urine, others lameness, &c. But the most important fact is, that whenever the bones of the pelvis were separated from each other above an inch (and no space of any consequence could be added to the brim, unless they were so), the sacro-iliac synchondroses were torn, and no woman survived that accident.\n\nThese facts have at last convinced foreign practitioners of the futility of this expedient; and, accordingly, for above ten years, it has not been performed on the continent by any practitioners of respectableability.\n\nWhen a woman, with a narrow pelvis, who has had the good fortune to recover after the operation of embryotomy, again falls with child, she should not incur the hazard of a repetition of so horrible an operation; but ought to have premature labour induced between the seventh and the eighth month. Under the direction of an intelligent practitioner this operation is easily performed; and, while it affords the only chance of saving the infant, which it is the duty of the mother and of the practitioner to attempt, it at the same time, by lessening the resistance, diminishes both the suffering and the risk of the patient (n).\n\nFor a further account of the practice in cases of extreme deformity of the pelvis, the reader is referred to Olborn's Essays; Hamilton's Letters to Olborn; Simmons's Reflections, and Hull's Detection of Simmons.\n\nSECT. IV. Of the Deviations from Natural Labour which happen from anomalous circumstances.\n\nCertain circumstances besides those already enumerated occasion deviations in the process of labour. Some of these respect the child, and others the woman.\n\na. The child's life is endangered if the navel-string be so strongly convoluted round its neck, that after the head is born the remainder cannot be expelled without the cord being drawn so tight as to interrupt the circulation through it. Dr Denman, vol. ii. p. 16, has stated this as a cause of protracted labour, and has advised\n\n(n) See a paper on this subject, in the 18th volume of the Medical Facts and Observations, by Mr Barlow.\nvised certain modes of practice in consequence. But if there be pains, there cannot be any material protraction of the labour from this cause.\n\nAll risk of the infant may be prevented by slackening the cord, and waiting for the action of the uterus, if the operator find that he cannot draw the loop of cord which surrounds the child's neck easily over its head. But this in most cases can be readily done.\n\nb. The cord is sometimes pushed down before the presenting part of the child.\n\nIf this happen before the membranes are burst, the only certain method of saving the child is to perform the operation of turning as soon as the state of the passages will permit.\n\nWhen the cord is pushed down along with some other part, as the head, after the waters are discharged, a variety of practice is required according to the circumstances of the particular case; hence merely keeping the cord for a little time beyond the presenting part by means of the fingers, or wrapping it up in a piece of soft rag, and pushing it above the presenting point, or the application of the forceps, are feverishly found useful in different cases.\n\nc. Sometimes one or both arms of the child are forced down along with the head, where proper assistance is not had at the beginning of labour. If the pelvis be roomy, and the woman have formerly had children, the delivery may be at last completed by the natural powers, notwithstanding this increased degree of resistance. But in many cases of this kind an experienced practitioner is not called in till the strength of the woman be very much exhausted, and then it becomes necessary to use the forceps, or even on some occasions to have recourse to the operation of embryolysis.\n\nd. It is well known, that sometimes there is more than one child in the womb. Instances where there are twins are not unfrequent; cases of triplets are alleged to happen once in between three or four thousand births; four at a birth have not occurred in this city for the last twenty-seven years; and there are only two, or at most three, well-authenticated cases of five at a birth having happened within a hundred years in this island.\n\nAll the signs by which the existence of more than one child in utero can be ascertained, previous to the actual commencement of labour, are fallacious; and in general it is not till after the birth of one child that it can be determined that another remains in the womb; and, unless under very particular circumstances, it is of no importance. The circumstances alluded to are where different parts of both children are forced into the passage at the same time. Of this a very remarkable case is recorded in the book of Genesis, verse 27, chap. xxxviii.\n\nWhen the womb appears to remain bulky and hard after the birth of one child, there is reason to suppose that it contains a second. But if there be any doubt on the subject, the practitioner has it in his power to ascertain the point by examination. When there is no second child in the uterus, the further the fingers are carried up within the passage, the more contracted do they feel; whereas, if there be a second child, the more open are they found.\n\nWhen it is ascertained that another infant remains, the woman's belly should be immediately compressed by means of a roller, in order to prevent faintness from the sudden relaxation of the parietes abdominis, and the portion of the naval string remaining attached to the after-birth of the first born should be carefully secured, lest the vessels of the placenta anasto-mose.\n\nIn regard to the subsequent treatment, there has been much variety of opinion among practitioners. Some have propounded waiting till the action of the uterus expel the second as it had done the first infant. Others urge strongly the necessity for immediate delivery.\n\nAgainst the former of these practices it is to be objected; first, that in some cases, days or even weeks have been known to intervene between the birth of one child and the action of the uterus which expelled the second. Secondly, that if this happen, the passages must become contracted and their subsequent dilatation may be productive of inflammatory symptoms. Thirdly, that during the time the uterine action is suspended, internal haemorrhage may take place, and may destroy the patient. And, fourthly, the second child may be suddenly forced down in such a position, as may endanger its life, and at the same time occasion great pain to the mother.\n\nFor these reasons it is now an established rule among judicious practitioners, to examine the situation of the second infant, as soon as the patient shall have recovered from the shock of the birth of the first child; and, if its position be natural and the patient have not been exhausted by the previous labour, and pains come on, to rupture the membranes, and allow the natural powers to complete the delivery. But if the infant present any other part than the head, or though the head do present, if the woman be exhausted, or if there be no appearance of the return of pains within an hour after the birth of the first, then the hand is to be passed up to bring down the feet of the second child, and the delivery is to be expedited. The extraction of the placenta is to be conducted with great care, and every possible precaution is to be adopted against the occurrence of flooding, which is always to be dreaded as the consequence of plurality of children.\n\nThe same principles apply to the management of triplets, &c.\n\nd. Umbilical hernia, to which women are perhaps more subject than to any other species of rupture, may influence the labour materially.\n\nIf it be reducible, it disappears after the fifth month of pregnancy; but immediately after the expulsion of the child it returns, and occasions frightful faintings and floodings. This may be prevented by the simple expedient of having the belly compressed by a roller in such a manner, that in proportion as the infant advances, the compression may be increased.\n\nShould it be irreducible, if the hernia be affected by the continuance of labour, as may be known by the colour &c. the operation of turning must be had recourse to.\n\ne. Convulsions sometimes happen during labour, and occasion great danger both to the mother and the child. The woman is quite insensible during the fit, which consists of violent convulsions of the muscles which move the body, and of those of the eyes, the face, and the lower jaw; it lasts in some cases only a few seconds,\nand others for several minutes. After the fit has ceased, it sometimes happens that the patient remains in a comatose state; in other cases the sensibility returns.\n\nThe circumstances which distinguish this disease from epilepsy were first stated explicitly by Dr Hamilton in the following words: \"The old distinction between eclampsia and epilepsy has been rejected by Dr Cullen, without sufficient reason. The convulsions that occur during pregnancy and labour, should be distinguished by the former name, for the disease is always an acute one, and it never, as far as my experience goes, lays the foundation for habitual epilepsy. To an attentive practitioner, indeed, the phenomena appear similar to those of epilepsy; but, independent of its violence and fatality, there are many circumstances peculiar to it. This has been remarked by several authors, particularly Dr Denman; but those circumstances have never been accurately pointed out in any publication which has fallen into my hands.\n\n\"The eclampsia, peculiar to pregnancy and labour, differs from epilepsy in the following respects:\n\n\"1. The symptoms which precede the attack are well marked, announcing to an experienced practitioner the approach of the disease.\n\n\"2. If the first fit do not prove fatal, and if no means of cure be attempted, it is within a few hours followed by other paroxysms, provided delivery do not take place.\n\n\"3. After the paroxysms, even where they have been very severe, the patient in many cases continues quite sensible during the intervals, and the sensibility returns the moment the fit is off.\n\n\"4. What may appear still more extraordinary is, that, in some cases there is a remarkably increased susceptibility of impression of the external senses; and this superexertion is not confined to patients in whom the convulsions are slight.\n\n\"5. The aura epileptica never occurs in the cases alluded to.\n\n\"6. The pulse is, in every case, affected in some degree during the remissions of the fits. It is slow, or oppressed, or intermittent, or frequent and rapid. But it is most commonly slow and oppressed, becoming fuller and more frequent after blood-letting.\n\nThe symptoms above hinted at, as preceding the fits are, violent headache, or sudden delirium, or violent tremors during the second stage of labour. Impaired or depraved vision commonly prove the immediate harbingers of the fit. The event of this occurrence is always precarious, for a single fit may destroy the patient. Death happens in such cases in two ways; viz., either by rupture of some of the vessels within the head, or by the rupture of the womb itself.\n\nThe cause of the disease is evidently an overload in the vessels within the cranium, and this may be occasioned from a variety of causes, as violent labour throes, pallions of the mind, irritations in the primeæ viae, &c.\n\nIn cases of so very alarming a nature, it is not wonderful that practitioners have differed much respecting the practice to be adopted. The following is what has been recommended by Dr Hamilton in the volume of Dr Duncan's annals already referred to.\n\n\"When fits have actually occurred during the latter months of pregnancy, the first remedy to be employed, after having adopted the suitable means for protecting the tongue, is blood-letting, both general and topical.\n\nOpening the external jugular might answer both purposes, but the reflexions of the patient in many cases makes the surgeon or attendants dread this operation. A quantity of blood, therefore, adapted to the exigency of the case, is to be drawn from the arm, and either a branch of the temporal artery is to be divided, or several leeches are to be applied to the temples. After the bleeding, a powerful laxative glyster ought to be exhibited. And if there be any evidence of disordered primeæ viae, an emetic must, if possible, be given. The state of the os uteri is then to be ascertained; and if labour have not commenced, no attempts whatever are to be made to promote that process. In some rare cases, however, where the bulk of the gravid uterus is enormous, it may be necessary to remove a part of its contents; but such cases cannot happen once in a thousand instances of the disease.\n\nShould the fits still continue, the head must be shaved, and covered with a large blister; and if the oppression or fulness, or hardness of the pulse, be not removed, the blood-letting is to be repeated.\n\nAs soon as the patient becomes capable of swallowing, the camphor, in doses of ten grains, ought to be given every three or four hours. The most efficacious and palatable form in which this medicine can be prescribed, is by suspending it in boiling water, through the medium of alcohol, sugar and magnesia. Its use must be persevered in for several days, gradually lessening the number of doses.\n\nWhere the eclampsia has been preceded by oedema, the digitalis may be employed with much success.\n\nConvulsions during labour are to be treated upon the same principles, with these additional precautions, that delivery is to be accomplished by the most expeditious possible means, and that if the delivery be followed by uterine haemorrhagy, the discharge is for some time to be rather encouraged than checked. I knew two instances of the fits, which had been suspended for some hours, recurring, in consequence of the flooding being stopped, and in both cases the convulsions were removed, by allowing the discharge to return.\n\nWhen the symptoms that precede eclampsia, take place in the latter months of pregnancy, the most certain method of guarding against the threatening accident is, having recourse to immediate blood-letting, and afterwards prescribing camphor, attention to the state of the bowels, and a spare diet.\n\nWhen the same symptoms occur during labour, a copious bleeding should be instantly ordered, and the appropriate means of terminating the delivery should be adopted with as much expedition as may be consistent with the safety both of mother and child.\n\nIn these concise practical suggestions, practitioners will observe circumstances omitted, which have been recommended by gentlemen of deserved professional eminence, and novelties of practice proposed, which I believe have not hitherto been explicitly advised. Some explanation, therefore, of the plan above recommended may perhaps be expected.\n\nThe most obvious remedy apparently omitted is opium. This powerful medicine was not prescribed, as far as we have reason to know, by the practitioners who lived at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. The first author who, in strong terms, affirms the efficacy of opium in such cases, appears to be the translator.\ntranslator of Astruc's Midwivery (a); and his opinion has been adopted by Dr Denman (b), and by Dr Bland (c). But in every case of true eclampsia, during pregnancy or labour, opiates do irreparable mischief, where a copious bleeding has not been prevented; and even where that precaution has been attended to, they have been found useless, if not hurtful. Melancholy experience has completely established in my mind this practical precept; and I consider it to be a matter of very great moment, that it should be universally known; for general practitioners, who are often first called to those cases where the fits happen during pregnancy, are extremely apt to prescribe opium. I can solemnly declare, that no patient to whose assistance I have been called, who had taken a dose of opium previous to my arrival, has recovered, and I have known that medicine given in almost every variety of dose. My father, Dr A. Hamilton, of whose judgement and practical knowledge it does not become me to speak in the terms they so justly merit, prevented my ever employing opium under such circumstances.\n\n\"A second remedy extolled by Dr Denman, and now, after a fair trial, rejected in my practice, is vomiting. This seems to have been a very common prescription in the time of Mauriceau, as he takes great pains to point out its hurtfulness in several parts of his works (d). Where there are unequivocal marks of disordered stomach, an emetic may be prescribed with advantage after blood-letting, but it should be avoided under all other circumstances.\n\n\"With regard to the warm-bath, which is a favourite remedy among foreign practitioners, and has been advised by several British authors, I have never had an opportunity of trying its effects. Upon theoretical principles I should reject it; but my chief reason for never having directed its use, has been the impossibility, in ordinary cases of practice, of commanding a warm-bath into which a woman in such a situation could be put.\n\n\"Dathing cold water by surpise upon the face is a practice suggested by Dr Denman, and on which he had much dependence at one period. Experience lessened his hopes, and, many years ago, prevented my ever indulging any. I gave it several fair trials, (once or twice in public in the lying-in ward of the Royal Infirmary), and had even reason to be convinced, that it rather aggravated than diminished the violence of the paroxysms.\"\n\nIn addition to these observations it may be proper to remark, that a much larger quantity of blood should be drawn in those cases than has commonly been done. Dr H. advises forty ounces to be taken at this first bleeding, and the same quantity to be again drawn within an hour, if the symptoms be not mitigated; and he talks with the utmost confidence of the utility of this practice.\n\nf. Although the woman be delivered safely both of the child and afterbirth, she may sink very soon after in consequence of internal flooding. This is to be suspected if the patient suddenly complain of giddiness or sickness, or ringing in the ears, or impaired vision; or if she become delirious, with a pallid face and cold limbs. The state of the pulse at the wrist too should lead a judicious practitioner to suspect the existence of internal flooding. Positive certainty of this accident may be obtained by feeling through the belly the condition of the uterus; or, more certainly still, by feeling the state of the vagina, for if its parietes approach, there is not much probability of there being any considerable internal haemorrhage; whereas, if it be found filled with coagulated blood, there is a certainty, that the womb too is distended from the same cause.\n\nThis accident is entirely owing to the womb not having contracted with sufficient energy. It very often proves the cause of sudden and unexpected death.\n\nThe boldest and apparently most violent measures are required to save the patient in many of those cases. The womb and vagina must be immediately emptied, and such pressure must be made on the inside of the uterus with the hand, as shall force it into contraction. In some cases cold water in great quantity must be dashed from a height on the naked belly at the same time; and in the mean while the strength of the patient must be supported with large doses of opium. If there be vomiting, which is a frequent symptom in such cases, five grains of solid opium should be given at first, and afterwards three grains every three or four hours, till the pulse becomes steady and the strength recruited, when the opiates are to be withdrawn and lessened by degrees. The writer of this article cannot avoid this opportunity of paying a just tribute of respect to the practical discernment of the able editor of the New London Medical Dictionary, who seems the first author who has mentioned this practice of giving large doses of opium; a practice by which many valuable lives have been saved.\n\nConclusion.—In the preceding account of the deviations, which sometimes happen in the process of human parturition, although we have endeavoured to give a full view of the subject, we have not pursued the beaten track. But as this article may rather be consulted by many as a dictionary, than pursued regularly as a treatise, we shall add the ordinary arrangement of labours, with the reference to the numerical articles, under which the several varieties may be found.\n\nLabours are divided into four classes; viz. natural, laborious, preternatural, and complex.\n\nNatural labour comprehends all cases where the head of the infant is forced foremold; and the whole process is completed with safety, both to mother and child, within twenty-four hours from the commencement. It is described under articles 48. to 60.\n\nLaborious labour is that where, although the head of the infant be forced foremold, the process is protracted beyond...\nbeyond twenty-four hours from the commencement. It is divided into three orders: First, where the natural powers at last, after much suffering on the part of the mother, complete the delivery. See article 64.\n\nSecondly, Where, although the action of the uterus be inadequate to the expulsion of the infant, it is practicable to extract the child through the natural passages, without injury either to it or to the mother. See articles 66. to 74. 82. and 84.\n\nThirdly, Where it is impossible to extract the child alive through the natural passages. See articles 80. and 99. to 133.\n\nPreternatural labours comprehend all cases where any other part of the child than the head is forced forward; and consist of two orders:\n\nFirst, Presentations of the lower extremities, viz. footling cases, article 87. Breech cases, article 91. Cases where one foot presents, article 89. and knee-cases, article 95.\n\nSecondly, Presentations of the superior extremities or other parts than the head or lower extremities, articles 192. to 196.\n\nComplex labours include all cases where any other circumstances than those enumerated under the former three classes take place, viz.\n\nCases where the pelvis is too large, articles 110. and 111.\n\nCases where haemorrhage occurs at the beginning of labour, article 76. or at the conclusion of that process, articles 152. and 153.\n\nCases where there is more than one child, articles 143. 144. 145.\n\nCases where the patient had previously been affected with umbilical hernia, article 146.\n\nCases where convulsions happen, articles 147. 148.\n\nCases where the navel string is twisted round the neck of the infant, article 140. or where it is forced down along with some part of the child, article 141.\n\nAnd cases of rupture of the uterus, article 65.\n\nEXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.\n\nPlate CCC.\n\nFig. 1.

Is a sketch taken from Dr Hunter's magnificent plate, No. 6 of the gravid uterus. All the fore part of the uterus and secundines (which included the placenta) is removed. The navel string is cut, tied, and turned to the left side over the edge of the womb. At the fundus the investing membranes are likewise turned over the edge of the womb, that they might be more apparent. The head of the child is lodged in the lower part of the womb, or in the cavity of the pelvis, and its body lies principally in the right side. Its position is diagonal or oblique, so that its posterior parts are turned forwards, and to the right side of the mother, and its fore parts are directed backwards, and to the left side. Its right foot appears between its left thigh and leg. Every part is stated by Dr Hunter to have been represented just as it was found.\n\nFig. 4.

He was at first a disciple of Gerard Seghers, in whose school he made a distinguished figure; but he quitted that art, and went to Italy, to improve himself in design, and to obtain a more extensive knowledge of the several branches of his art. At Rome he particularly studied and copied the works of the Caracci and Correggio; and was admitted into the academy of Andrea Sacchi, where he gave such evident proofs of extraordinary merit and genius, that he was invited by Andrea to assist him in a grand design which he had already begun. But Miel, through some disgust, rejected those elevated subjects which at first had engaged his attention, refused the friendly proposal of Sacchi, and chose to imitate the style of Bamboccio, as having more of that nature which pleased his own imagination. His general subjects were huntings, car- nivals, gypsies, beggars, pastoral scenes, and conversations; of those he composed his easel pictures, which are the finest of his performances. But he also painted history in a large size in fresco, and in oil; which, though they seem to want elevation of design, and a greater degree of grace in the heads, yet appear superior to what might be expected from a painter of such low subjects as he generally was fond of representing. His pictures of huntings are particularly admired; the figures and animals of every species being designed with uncommon spirit, nature, and truth. The transparency of his colouring, and the clear tints of his skies, enlivens his compositions; nor are his paintings in any degree inferior to those of Bamboccio either in their force or lustre. His large works are not so much to be commended for the goodness of the design as for the expression and colouring; but it is in his small pieces that the pencil of Miel appears in its greatest delicacy and beauty. The singular merit of this master recommended him to the favour of Charles Emmanuel duke of Savoy, who invited him to his court, where he appointed Miel his principal painter, and afterwards honoured him with the order of St Mauritius, and made him a present of a cross set with diamonds of great value, as a particular mark of his esteem. He died in 1664.\n\nMieris, Francis, the Old, a justly celebrated painter, was born at Leyden in 1635; and was at first placed under the direction of Abraham Toorne Vilet, one of the best designers of the Low Countries, and afterwards entered himself as a disciple with Gerard Douw. In a short time he far surpassed all his companions, and was by his master called the prince of his disciples. His manner of painting silks, velvets, stuffs, or carpets, was so singular, that the Mieris different kinds and fabric of any of them might easily be distinguished. His pictures are rarely to be seen, and as rarely to be sold; and when they are, the purchase is extremely high, their intrinsic value being so incontestably great. Besides portraits, his general subjects were conversations, persons performing on musical instruments, patients attended by the apothecary or doctor, chemists at work, mercers shops, and such like; and the usual valuation he set on his pictures was estimated at the rate of a ducat an hour. The finest portrait of this master's hand is that which he painted for the wife of Cornelius Piats, which is said to be still preserved in the family, although very great sums have been offered for it. In the possession of the same gentleman was another picture of Mieris, representing a lady fainting, and a physician applying the remedies to relieve her. For that performance he was paid (at his usual rate of a ducat an hour) so much money as amounted to fifteen hundred florins when the picture was finished. The grand duke of Tuscany wished to purchase it, and offered three thousand florins for it; but the offer was not accepted. However, that prince procured several of his pictures, and they are at this day an ornament to the Florentine collection. One of the most curious of them is a girl holding a candle in her hand, and it is accounted inestimable. This painter died in 1681.\n\nMieris, William, called the Young Mieris, was son of the former, and born at Leyden in 1662. During the life of his father, he made a remarkable progress; but, by being deprived of his director when he was only arrived at the age of nineteen, he had recourse to nature, as the most instructive guide; and by studying with diligence and judgement to imitate her, he approached near to the merit of his father. At first he took his subjects from private life, in the manner of Francis; such as tradesmen in their shops, or a peasant selling vegetables and fruit, and sometimes a woman looking out at a window; all which he copied minutely after nature, nor did he paint a single object without his model. As Mieris had observed the compositions of Gerard Lairesse, and other great historical painters, with singular delight, he attempted to design subjects in that style; and began with the story of Rinaldo sleeping on the lap of Armida, surrounded with the Loves and Graces, the fore ground being enriched with plants and flowers; a work which added greatly to his fame, and was sold for a very high price. This master also painted landscapes and animals with equal truth and neatness; and modelled in clay and wax, in so sharp and accurate a manner, that he might justly be\nbe ranked among the most eminent sculptors. In the delicate finishing of his works, he imitated his father; as he likewise did in the lustre, harmony, and truth, of his paintings, which makes them to be almost as highly prized; but they are not equal in respect of design, or of the striking effect, nor is his touch so very exquisite as that of the father. The works of the old Mieris are better composed, the figures are better grouped, and they have less confusion; yet the younger Mieris is acknowledged to be an artist of extraordinary merit, although inferior to him, who had scarcely his equal. He died in 1747.\n\nMieris, Francis, called the Young Francis, was the son of William, and the grandson of the celebrated Francis Mieris; and was born at Leyden in 1689. He learned the art of painting from his father, whose manner and style he always imitated; he chose the same subjects, and endeavoured to resemble him in his colouring and pencil. But with all his industry he proved far inferior to him; and most of those pictures which at the public sales are said to be of the young Mieris, and many also in private collections ascribed to the elder Francis, or William, are perhaps originally painted by this master, who was far inferior to both; or are only his copies after the works of those excellent painters, as he spent abundance of his time in copying their performances.\n\nMIEZA, in Ancient Geography, a town of Macedonia, which was anciently called Strymonium, situated near Stagira. Here, Plutarch informs us, the stone seats and shady walks of Aristotle were shown. Of this place was Peucestas, one of Alexander's generals, and therefore named Mieszæus, (Arrian.)\n\nMIGDOL, or MAGDOL, in Ancient Geography, a place in the Lower Egypt, on this side Pihahiroth, or between it and the Red Sea, towards its extremity. The term denotes a tower or fortres. It is probably the Magdolum of Herodotus, seeing the Septuagint render it by the same name.\n\nMIGNARD, Nicholas, an ingenious French painter, born at Troyes in 1628; but, settling at Avignon, is generally distinguished from his brother Peter by the appellation of Mignard of Avignon. He was afterwards employed at court and at Paris, where he became rector of the royal academy of painting.\n\nThere is a great number of his historical pieces and portraits in the palace of the Tuileries. He died in 1699.\n\nMignard, Peter, the brother of Nicholas, was born at Troyes in 1613 and acquired so much of the taste of the Italian school, as to be known by the name of the Roman. He was generally allowed to have a superior genius to his brother Nicholas; and had the honour of painting the popes Alexander VII. and Urban VIII. besides many of the nobility at Rome, and several of the Italian princes: his patron, Louis, sat ten times to him for his portrait, and respected his talents so much as to ennoble him, make him his principal painter after the death of Le Brup, and appointed him director of the manufactory. He died in 1695, and many of his pieces are to be seen at St Cloud.\n\nMIGNON, or MINJON, Abraham, a celebrated painter of flowers and still life, was born at Franconfort in 1639; and his father having been deprived of the greatest part of his substance by a series of losses in trade, left him in very necessitous circumstances when he was only seven years of age. From that melancholy situation he was rescued by the friendship of James Murel, a flower painter in that city; who took Mignon into his own house, and instructed him in the art, till he was 17 years old. Murel had often observed an uncommon genius in Mignon: he therefore took him along with him to Holland, where he placed him as a disciple with David de Heem; and while he was under the direction of that master he laboured with incessant application to imitate the manner of De Heem, and ever afterwards adhered to it; only adding daily to his improvement, by studying nature with a most exact and curious observation.\n\n\"When we consider the paintings of Mignon, one is at a loss (Mr Pilkington observes) whether more to admire the freshness and beauty of his colouring, the truth in every part, the bloom on his objects, or the perfect resemblance of nature visible in all his performances. He always shows a beautiful choice in those flowers and fruits from which his subjects are composed: and he groups them with uncommon elegance. His touch is exquisitely neat, though apparently easy and unlaboured; and he was fond of introducing insects among the fruits and flowers, wonderfully finished, so that even the drops of dew appear as round and as translucent as nature itself.\" He had the good fortune to be highly paid for his works in his lifetime; and he certainly would have been accounted the best in his profession even to this day, if John Van Huyssum had not appeared. Weyerman, who had seen many admired pictures of Mignon, mentions one of a most capital kind. The subject of it is a cat, which had thrown down a pot of flowers, and they lie scattered on a marble table. That picture is in every respect so wonderfully natural, that the spectator can scarce persuade himself that the water which is spilled from the vessel is not really running down from the marble. This picture is distinguished by the title of Mignon's Cat. This painter died in 1679, aged only 40.\n\nMIGRATION, the passage or a removal of a thing out of one place into another.\n\nMigration of Birds.—It has been generally believed, that many different kinds of birds annually pass generally from one country to another, and spend the summer or winter where it is most agreeable to them; and that even the birds of our own island will seek the most distant southern regions of Africa, when directed by a peculiar instinct to leave their own country. It has long been an opinion pretty generally received, that swallows reside during the winter season in the warm southern regions; and Mr Adanson particularly relates his having seen them at Senegal when they were obliged to leave this country. But besides the swallow, Mr Pennant enumerates many other birds which migrate from Britain at different times of the year, and are then to be found in other countries; after which they again leave these countries, and return to Britain. The reason of these migrations he supposes to be a defect of food at certain seasons of the year, or the want of a secure asylum from the persecution of man during the time of courtship, incubation, and nutrition. The following is his list of the migrating species:\n\n1. Crows. Of this genus, the hooded crow migrates regularly with the woodcock. It inhabits North Britain the whole year: a few are said annually to breed on\nMigration on Dartmoor, in Devonshire. It breeds also in Sweden and Austria; in some of the Swedish provinces it only shifts its quarters, in others it resides throughout the year. Our author is at a loss for the summer retreat of those which visit us in such numbers in winter, and quit our country in the spring; and for the reason why a bird, whose food is such that it may be found at all seasons in this country, should leave us.\n\n2. Cuckoo. Disappears early in autumn; the retreat of this and the following bird is quite unknown to us.\n\n3. Wryneck. Is a bird that leaves us in the winter. If its diet be ants alone, as several assert, the cause of its migration is very evident. This bird disappears before winter, and revisits us in the spring a little earlier than the cuckoo.\n\n4. Hoopoe. Comes to England but by accident; Mr Pennant once indeed heard of a pair that attempted to make their nest in a meadow at Selborne, Hampshire, but were frightened away by the curiosity of people. It breeds in Germany.\n\n5. Grouse. The whole tribe, except the quail, lives here all the year round; that bird either leaves us, or else retires towards the sea coasts.\n\n6. Pigeons. Some few of the ring doves breed here; but the multitude that appears in the winter is so disproportioned to what continue here the whole year, as to make it certain that the greatest part quit the country in the spring. It is most probable they go to Sweden to breed, and return from thence in autumn; as Mr Ekmark informs us they entirely quit that country before winter. Multitudes of the common wild pigeons also make the northern retreat, and visit us in winter; not but numbers breed in the high cliffs in all parts of this island. The turtle also probably leaves us in the winter, at least changes its place, removing to the southern counties.\n\n7. Stare. Breeds here. Possibly several remove to other countries for that purpose, since the produce of those that continue here seems unequal to the clouds of them that appear in winter. It is not unlikely that many migrate into Sweden, where Mr Berger observes they return in spring.\n\n8. Thrushes. The fieldfare and the redwing breed and pass their summers in Norway and other cold countries; their food is berries, which abounding in our kingdoms, tempts them here in the winter. These two and the Royton crow are the only land birds that regularly and constantly migrate into England, and do not breed here. The hawfinch and crossbill come here at such uncertain times as not to deserve the name of birds of passage.\n\n9. Chatterer. The chatterer appears annually about Edinburgh in flocks during winter; and feeds on the berries of the mountain ash. In South Britain it is an accidental visitant.\n\n10. Grosbeaks. The grosbeak and crossbill come here but seldom; they breed in Austria. The pine grosbeak probably breeds in the forests of the Highlands of Scotland.\n\n11. Buntings. All the genus inhabits England throughout the year; excepting the greater brambling, which is forced here from the north in very severe seasons.\n\n12. Finches. All continue in some parts of these kingdoms, except the siskin, which is an irregular visitant, said to come from Russia. The linnets shift their quarters, breeding in one part of this island, and remove with their young to others. All finches feed on the seeds of plants.\n\n13. Larks, fly-catchers, wagtails, and warblers. All of these feed on insects and worms; yet only part of them quit these kingdoms; though the reason of migration is the same to all. The nightingale, blackcap, fly-catcher, willow-wren, wheat-eat, and whitethroat, leave us before winter, while the small and delicate golden-crested wren braves our severest frosts. The migrants of this genus continue longest in Great Britain in the southern counties, the winter in those parts being later than in those of the north; Mr Stillingsfleet having observed several wheat-eats in the isle of Purbeck on the 18th of November. As these birds are incapable of very distant flights, Spain, or the south of France, is probably their winter asylum.\n\n14. Swallows and goatsucker. Every species disappears at the approach of winter.\n\nWATER-FOWL.\n\nOf the vast variety of water-fowl that frequent Great Britain, it is amazing to reflect how few are known to breed here; the cause that principally urges them to leave this country, seems to be not merely the want of food, but the desire of a secure retreat. Our country is too populous for birds so shy and timid as the bulk of these are: when great part of our island was a mere waste, a tract of woods and fen, doubtless many species of birds (which at this time migrate) remained in security throughout the year.—Egrets, a species of heron now scarcely known in this island, were in former times in prodigious plenty; and the crane, that has totally forsaken this country, bred familiarly in our marshes: their place of incubation, as well as of all other cloven-footed water-fowl (the heron excepted), being on the ground, and exposed to every one. As rural economy increased in this country, these animals were more and more disturbed; at length, by a series of alarms, they were necessitated to seek, during the summer, some lonely safe habitation.\n\nOn the contrary, those that build or lay in the almost inaccessible rocks that impend over the British seas, breed there still in vast numbers, having little to fear from the approach of mankind: the only disturbance they meet with in general being from the desperate attempts of some few to get their eggs.\n\nCLOVEN-FOOTED WATER-FOWL.\n\n15. Herons. The white heron is an uncommon bird, and visits us at uncertain seasons; the common kind and the bittern never leave us.\n\n16. Curlews. The curlew breeds sometimes on our mountains: but, considering the vast flights that appear in winter, it is probable that the greater part retire to other countries: the whimbrel breeds on the Grampian hills, in the neighbourhood of Invercauld.\n\n17. Snipes. The woodcock breeds in the moist woods of Sweden, and other cold countries. Some snipes breed here, but the greatest part retire elsewhere: as do every other species of this genus.\n\n18. Sandpipers. The lapwing continues here the whole year; the ruff breeds here, but retires in winter;\nMigration. The redshank and sandpiper breed in this country, and reside here. All the others absent themselves during summer.\n\n19. Plovers and oyster-catcher. The long-legged plover and sandpiper visit us only in winter; the dotterel appears in spring and in autumn; yet, what is very singular, we do not find it breeds in South Britain. The oyster-catcher lives with us the whole year. The Norfolk plover and sea-lark breed in England. The green plover breeds on the mountains of the north of England, and on the Grampian hills.\n\nWe must here remark, that every species of the genera of curlews, woodcocks, sandpipers, and plovers, that forsakes us in the spring, retires to Sweden, Poland, Prussia, Norway, and Lapland, to breed; as soon as the young can fly, they return to us again, because the frosts which set in early in those countries totally deprive them of the means of subsisting; as the dryness and hardness of the ground, in general, during our summer, prevent them from penetrating the earth with their bills, in search of worms, which are the natural food of these birds. Mr Ekmark speaks thus of the retreat of the whole tribe of cloven-footed waterfowl out of his country (Sweden) at the approach of winter; and Mr Klein gives much the same account of those of Poland and Prussia.\n\n20. Rails and gallinules. Every species of these two genera continues with us the whole year; the land-rail excepted, which is not seen here in winter. It likewise continues in Ireland only during the summer months, when they are very numerous, as Mr Smith tells us in the History of Waterford, p. 336. Great numbers appear in Anglesea the latter end of May; it is supposed that they pass over from Ireland, the passage between the two islands being but small. As we have instances of these birds lighting on ships in the Channel and the bay of Biscay, we may conjecture their winter quarters to be in Spain.\n\nFINNED-FOOTED WATER BIRDS.\n\n21. Phalaropes. Visit us but seldom; their breeding place is Lapland, and other arctic regions.\n\n22. Grebes. The great crested grebe, the black and white grebe, and little grebe, breed with us, and never migrate; the others visit us accidentally, and breed in Lapland.\n\nWEB-FOOTED BIRDS.\n\n23. Auklet. Breed near Foalstone in Lincolnshire, but quit their quarters in winter. They are then shot in different parts of the kingdom, which they visit, not regularly, but accidentally.\n\n24. Auks and guillemots. The great auk or pinguin sometimes breeds in St Kilda. The auk, the guillemot, and puffin, inhabit most of the maritime cliffs of Great Britain, in amazing numbers, during summer. The black guillemot breeds in the Bass island, and in St Kilda, and sometimes in Llandudno rocks. We are at a loss for the breeding place of the other species; neither can we be very certain of the winter residence of any of them, excepting of the lesser guillemot and black-billed auk, which, during winter, visit vast flocks the frith of Forth.\n\n25. Divers. These chiefly breed in the lakes of Sweden and Lapland, and in some countries near the pole; but some of the red-throated divers, the northern Migration, and the smew, may breed in the north of Scotland and its isles.\n\n26. Terns. Every species breeds here; but leaves us in the winter.\n\n27. Petrels. The fulmar breeds in the Isle of St Kilda, and continues there the whole year except September and part of October; the shearwater visits the Isle of Man in April; breeds there; and, leaving it in August or the beginning of September, disperses over all parts of the Atlantic ocean. The stormfinch is seen at all distances from land on the same vast watery tract; nor is ever found near the shore except by some very rare accident, unless in the breeding season. Mr Pennant found it on some little rocky isles off the north of Skye. It also breeds in St Kilda. He also supposes that it nests on the Blasket isles off Kerry, and that it is the gourder of Mr Smith.\n\n28. Mergansers. This whole genus is mentioned among the birds that fill the Lapland lakes during summer. Mr Pennant has seen the young of the red-breasted in the north of Scotland; a few of these, and perhaps of the goosanders, may breed there.\n\n29. Ducks. Of the numerous species that form this genus, we know of few that breed here: The swan and goose, the shelduck, the eider duck, a few shovellers, garganies, and teals, and a very small portion of the wild ducks.\n\nThe rest contribute to form that amazing multitude of water-fowl that annually repair from most parts of Europe to the woods and lakes of Lapland and other arctic regions, there to perform the functions of incubation and nutrition in full security. They and their young quit their retreat in September, and disperse themselves over Europe. With us they make their appearance the beginning of October; circulate first round our shores; and, when compelled by severe frosts, betake themselves to our lakes and rivers. Of the web-footed fowl there are some of hardier constitutions than others: these endure the ordinary winters of the more northern countries; but when the cold reigns there with more than common rigour, they repair for shelter to these kingdoms: this regulates the appearance of some of the diver kind, as also of the wild swans, the swallow-tailed shelduck, and the different sorts of goosanders which then visit our coasts. Barentz found the barnacles with their nests in great numbers in Nova Zembla. (Collect. Voy. Dutch East-India Company, 8vo, 1703, p. 19.) Clusius, in his Exot. 368, also observes, that the Dutch discovered them on the rocks of that country and in Waygate straits. They, as well as the other species of wild geese, go very far north to breed, as appears from the histories of Greenland and Spitzbergen, by Egede and Crantz. These birds seem to make Iceland a resting place, as Horrebouw observes: few continue there to breed, but only visit that island in the spring, and after a short stay retire still further north.\n\n30. Corvoraent. The corvoraent and flag breed on most of our high rocks: the gannet in some of the Scotch isles and on the coast of Kerry: the two first continue on our shores the whole year. The gannet disperses itself all round the seas of Great Britain, in pursuit of the herring and pilchard, and even as far as the Pagus to prey on the sardina.\nBut of the numerous species of fowl here enumerated, it may be observed how very few intrust themselves to us in the breeding season, and what a distant flight they make to perform the first great dictate of nature.\n\nThere seems to be scarcely any but what we have traced to Lapland; a country of lakes, rivers, swamps, and alps, covered with thick and gloomy forests, that afford shelter during summer to these fowls, which in winter disperse over the greatest part of Europe. In those arctic regions, by reason of the thickness of the woods, the ground remains moist and penetrable to the woodcocks, and other slender-billed fowl; and for the web-footed birds, the waters afford larvae innumerable of the tormenting gnat. The days there are long; and the beautiful meteorous nights indulge them with every opportunity of collecting to minute a food; whilst mankind is very sparingly scattered over that vast northern waste.\n\nWhy then should Linnaeus, the great explorer of these rude deserts, be amazed at the myriads of water-fowl that migrated with him out of Lapland? which exceeded in multitude the army of Xerxes; covering, for eight whole days and nights, the surface of the river Calix! His partial observation as a botanist, would confine their food to the vegetable kingdom, almost denied to the Lapland waters; inattentive to a more plenteous table of insect food, which the all-bountiful Creator had spread for them in the wilderness. It may be remarked, that the lakes of mountainous rocky countries in general are destitute of plants: few or none are seen on those of Switzerland; and Linnaeus makes the same observation in respect to those of Lapland; having, during his whole tour, discovered only a single specimen of a lemma triflora, or \"ivy-leaved duck's meat,\" Flora Lap. No. 472; a few of the feirus lacustris, or \"bullrush,\" No. 18; the alopecurus geniculatus, or \"flote foxtail-grass,\" No. 38.; and the ranunculus aquatilis, No. 234.; which are all he enumerates in his Prolegomena to that excellent performance.\n\nWe shall afterwards state the principal arguments for and against the migration of swallows; but here we shall give a short abstract of the arguments used by the Hon. Daines Barrington against the migration of birds in general, from a paper published by him in the 62d volume of the Philosophical Transactions. This gentleman denies that any well-attested instances can be produced of this supposed migration; which, he thinks, if there were any such periodical flight, could not possibly have escaped the frequent observation of seamen. It has indeed been asserted that birds of passage become invisible in their flight, because they rise too high in the air to be perceived, and because they choose the night for their passage. The author, however, expresses his doubts \"whether any bird was ever seen to rise to a greater height than perhaps twice that of St Paul's cross;\" and he further endeavours to show, that the extent of some of these supposed migrations (from the northern parts of Europe, for instance, to the line) is too great to be accounted for, by having recourse to the argument founded on a nocturnal passage.\n\nThe author next recites, in a chronological order, all the instances that he has been able to collect, of birds having been actually seen by mariners when they were crossing a large extent of sea; and he endeavours to show that no stress can be laid on the few casual observations of this kind that have been produced in support of the doctrine of a regular and periodical migration.\n\nMr Barrington afterwards proceeds to invalidate M. Adanson's celebrated observation with respect to the migration of the swallow in particular, and which has been considered by many as perfectly decisive of the present question. He endeavours to show that the four swallows which that naturalist caught, on their settling upon his ship, on the 6th of October, at about the distance of 50 leagues from the coast of Senegal, and which he supposes to have been then proceeding from Europe to pass the winter in Africa, could not be true European swallows; or, if they were, could not have been on their return from Europe to Africa. His objections are founded principally on some proofs which he produces of M. Adanson's want of accuracy on this subject, which has led him, in the present instance, to mistake two African species of the swallow tribe, described and engraved by Brisson, for European swallows, to which they bear a general resemblance; or granting even that they were European swallows, he contends that they were shifting from the Cape de Verd islands to the coast of Africa; \"to which short flight, however, they were unequal, and accord. *Natural History of Selborne,* add, in opposition to the remarks of Mr Barrington, letter ix., the following observations of the Rev. Mr White * in p. 139., a letter to Mr Pennant on this subject.\n\n\"We must not (says he) deny migration in general; because migration certainly does subsist in some places, as my brother in Andalusia has fully informed me. Of the motions of these birds he has ocular demonstration, for many weeks together, both spring and fall: during which periods myriads of the swallow kind traverse the Straits from north to south, and from south to north, according to the season. And these vast migrations consist not only of hirundines, but of bee-birds, hoopoes, oro pendolos, or golden thrushes, &c. &c. and also of many of our soft-billed summer birds of passage; and moreover of birds which never leave us, such as all the various sorts of hawks and kites. Old Belon, 200 years ago, gives a curious account of the incredible armies of hawks and kites which he saw in the spring time traversing the Thracian Bosphorus from Asia to Europe. Besides the above mentioned, he remarks that the procession is swelled by whole troops of eagles and vultures.\n\n\"Now it is no wonder that birds residing in Africa should retreat before the sun as it advances, and retire to milder regions, and especially birds of prey, whose blood being heated with hot animal food, are more impatient of a sultry climate: but then I cannot help wondering why kites and hawks, and such hardy birds as are known to defy all the severity of England, and even of Sweden and all northern Europe, should want to migrate from the south of Europe, and be dissatisfied with the winters of Andalusia.\n\n\"It does not appear to me that much stress may be laid on the difficulty and hazard that birds must run in their migrations, by reason of vast oceans, crofs winds, &c.; because, if we reflect, a bird may travel from England to the equator without launching out and exposing...\"\nMigration posing itself to boundless seas, and that by crossing the water at Dover and again at Gibraltar. And I with the more confidence advance this obvious remark, because my brother has always found that some of his birds, and particularly the swallow kind, are very sparing of their pains in crossing the Mediterranean: for when arrived at Gibraltar, they do not,\n\n\"rang'd in figure, wedge their way,\nand set forth\n\n\"Their airy caravan high over seas\n\"Flying, and over lands with mutual wing\n\"Easing their flight.\"\n\nMilton.\n\nbut scat and hurry along in little detached parties of six or seven in a company; and sweeping low, just over the surface of the land and water, direct their course to the opposite continent at the narrowest passage they can find. They usually slope across the bay to the southwest, and so pass over opposite to Tangier, which it seems is the narrowest place.\n\n\"In former letters we have considered whether it was probable that woodcocks in moon-shiny nights cross the German ocean from Scandinavia. As a proof that birds of less speed may pass that sea, considerate as it is, I shall relate the following incident, which, though mentioned to have happened to many years ago, was strictly matter of fact:—As some people were shooting in the parish of Trotton, in the county of Sussex, they killed a duck in that dreadful winter 1708-9, with a silver collar about its neck (I have read a like anecdote of a swan), on which were engraved the arms of the king of Denmark. This anecdote the rector of Trotton at that time has often told to a near relation of mine; and, to the best of my remembrance, the collar was in the possession of the rector.\n\n\"At present I do not know any body near the sea side that will take the trouble to remark at what time of the moon woodcocks first come. One thing I used to observe when I was a sportsman, that there were times in which woodcocks were so sluggish and sleepy that they would drop again when flushed just before the spaniels, nay just at the muzzle of a gun that had been fired at them: whether this strange laziness was the effect of a recent fatiguing journey, I shall not presume to say.\n\n\"Nightingales not only never reach Northumberland and Scotland, but also, as I have been always told, Devonshire and Cornwall. In those two last counties we cannot attribute the failure of them to the want of warmth: the defect in the west is rather a presumptive argument that these birds come over to us from the continent at the narrowest passage, and do not stroll so far westward.\"\n\nUpon the subject of the migration of the swallow there are three opinions. Some say that it migrates to a warmer climate; some, that it retires to hollow trees and caverns, where it lies in a torpid state; and others have affirmed, that it lies in the same state in the bottom of lakes and under the ice. The first opinion is supported by Maraghi, Ray, Willoughby, Catesby, Reaumur, Adanson, Buffon, &c. The first and second opinion are both adopted by Pennant and White. The third is sanctioned by Schaeffer, Hevelius, Derham, Klein, Ellis, Linnæus, Kalm; and the second and third have been strongly defended by the honourable Migration, Daines Barrington.\n\nThough we cannot help giving a preference to that opinion which appears the most probable, yet we do not think that any one of them is established upon such evidence as so curious a subject requires, and as the advanced state of natural history would lead us to expect. We shall therefore state the arguments upon which each opinion is founded as fairly and distinctly as we can, and as often as possible in the very words of their respective advocates. By doing so, we shall place the whole subject before the eyes of our readers, who will thus have an opportunity of examining it attentively, and of making such observations and experiments as may lead to the truth.\n\nThose who assert that the swallow migrates to a warmer country in winter, argue in this manner: That many birds migrate, is a fact fully proved by the observations of natural historians. Is it not more probable, therefore, that swallows, which disappear regularly every season, retire to some other country, than that they lie in a state of torpor in caverns or lakes? But this opinion does not rest on probability, it is founded on facts.\n\nWe often see them collected in great flocks on churches, rocks, and trees, about the time when they annually disappear. The direction of their flight has been observed to be southward. Mr White, the ingenious historian of Selborne, travelling near the coast of the British Channel one morning early, saw a flock of swallows take their departure. At the beginning of his journey he was environed with a thick fog; but on a large wild heath the mist began to break, and discovered to him numberless swallows, cluttered on the standing bushes, as if they had roosted there; as soon as the sun burst out, they were instantly on wing, and with an easy and placid flight proceeded towards the sea. After this he saw no more flocks, only now and then a straggler.\n\nMr Laffey of Exeter observed attentively the direction which a flock of swallows took in the autumn of 1793. On the 22d of Sept., about seven o'clock in the morning, the wind being easterly, accompanied with a cold drizzling rain, Mr Laffey's house was entirely covered with house-swallows. At intervals large flocks arrived and joined the main body, and at their arrival an unusual chirping commenced. The appearance of the whole company was so lethargic, that he found it an easy matter to catch a considerable number of them, which he kept in a room all that day. By heating the room they all revived: he opened four of them, and found their stomachs quite full. The main body occupied the house top all day, except for two hours. About half an hour after nine in the morning of the 23d, there was a great commotion, with very loud chirping, and within a few minutes after, the whole multitude took their flight, in a direct southeast direction, having ascended to a great height in the atmosphere. He let go the birds which he had caught, at certain intervals till four o'clock, and they all flew toward the same quarter.\n\nNot only has the direction of their flight been observed, but they have also been found on their passage at a great distance from land. Mr Adamson informs us, that about 50 leagues from the coast of Senegal four swallows settled upon the ship on the 6th of October;\nMigration that these birds were taken; and that he knew them to be European swallows, which, he conjectures, were returning to the coast of Africa. Sir Charles Wager's authority may also be appealed to: \"Returning home (says he) in the spring of the year, as I came into foundings in our channel, a great flock of swallows came and settled on all my rigging; every rope was covered, they hung on one another like a swarm of bees; the decks and carvings were filled with them. They seemed almost famished and spent, and were only feathers and bones; but, being recruited with a night's rest, took their flight in the morning.\" This vast fatigue proves that their journey must have been very great, considering the amazing swiftness of these birds; in all probability they had crossed the Atlantic ocean, and were returning from the shores of Senegal, or other parts of Africa; so that this account from that most able and honest seaman, confirms the later information of Mr Adanson.\n\nMr Kalm, who is an advocate for the opinion that swallows lie immersed in lakes during winter, acknowledges that in crossing the Atlantic from Europe a swallow lighted on the ship on the 2d September, when it had palled only two-thirds of the ocean. Since, therefore, swallows have been seen assembled in great flocks in autumn flying off in company towards southern climes, since they have been found both in their passage from Europe and returning again, can there be any doubt of their annual migration?—Mr Barrington's objections to this opinion have been noticed above in No. 5.\n\nThe second notion (says Mr Pennant) has great antiquity on its side. Aristotle and Pliny give it as their belief, that swallows do not remove very far from their summer habitation, but winter in the hollows of rocks, and during that time lose their feathers. The former part of their opinion has been adopted by several ingenious men; and of late several proofs have been brought of some species, at least, having been discovered in a torpid state. Mr Collinson favoured us with the evidence of three gentlemen, eye-witnesses to numbers of sand martins being drawn out of a cliff on the Rhine, in the month of March 1762. And the honourable Daines Barrington communicated to us the following fact, on the authority of Lord Belhaven, That numbers of swallows have been found in old dry walls and in sand-hills near his Lordship's seat in East Lothian; not once only, but from year to year; and that when they were exposed to the warmth of a fire, they revived. We have also heard of the same annual discoveries near Morpeth in Northumberland, but cannot speak of them with the same assurance as the two former: neither in the two last instances are we certain of the particular species.\n\nOther witnesses crowd on us to prove the residence of those birds in a torpid state during the severe season. First, In the chalky cliffs of Sussex; as was seen on the fall of a great fragment some years ago. Secondly, In a decayed hollow tree that was cut down, near Dolgelli, in Merionethshire. Thirdly, In a cliff near Whitby, Yorkshire; where, on digging out a fox, whole buffalos of swallows were found in a torpid condition. And, lastly, The reverend Mr Conway of Sychton, Flintshire, was so obliging as to communicate the following fact: A few years ago, on looking down an old lead-mine in that county, he observed numbers of swallows Migration, clinging to the timbers of the shaft, seemingly asleep; and on flinging some gravel on them, they just moved, but never attempted to fly or change their place: this was between All Saints and Christmas.\n\nThere are doublets the lurking places of the later hatches, or of those young birds which are incapable of distant migrations. There they continue insensible and rigid; but like flies may sometimes be reanimated by an unseasonable hot day in the midst of winter: for very near Christmas a few appeared on the moulding of a window of Merton college, Oxford, in a remarkably warm nook, which prematurely set their blood in motion, having the same effect as laying them before a fire at the same time of year. Others have been known to make this premature appearance; but as soon as the cold natural to the season returns, they withdraw again to their former retreats.\n\nThe above are circumstances we cannot but affront to, though feebly contradictory to the common course of nature in regard to other birds. We must, therefore, divide our belief relating to these two so different opinions; and conclude, that one part of the swallow tribe migrate, and that others have their winter quarters near home. If it should be demanded, why swallows alone are found in a torpid state, and not the other many species of loft-billed birds, which likewise disappear about the same time? reasons might be assigned.\n\nThe third opinion we shall state and support in the third words of Mr Kalm. \"Natural history (says he), as such, that all other histories, depends not always upon the intrinsic degree of probability, but upon facts founded on the testimony of people of noted veracity.—Swallows are seldom seen sinking down into water; swallows have not such organs as frogs or lizards, which are torpid during winter; ergo, swallows live not, and cannot live, under water.—This way of arguing, I believe, would carry us, in a great many cases too far: for though it is not clear to every one, it may however be true; and lizards and frogs are animals of a class widely different from that of birds, and must therefore of course have a different structure; hence it is they are clasped separately. The bear and marmot are in winter in a torpid state, and have, however, not such organs as lizards and frogs; and nobody doubts of their being, during some time, in the most rigid climates, in a torpid state: for the Alpine nations hunt the marmots frequently by digging their holes up; and find them so torpid, that they cut their throats, without their reviving or giving the least sign of life during the operation; but when the torpid marmot is brought into a warm room, and placed before the fire, it revives from its lethargy. The question must therefore be decided by facts; nor are these wanting here. Dr Wallerius, the celebrated Swedish chemist, informs us, That he has seen, more than once, swallows assembling on a reed, till they were all immersed and went to the bottom; this being preceded by a dirge of a quarter of an hour's length. He attests likewise, that he had seen a swallow caught during winter out of a lake with a net, drawn, as is common in northern countries, under the ice; this bird was brought into a warm room, revived, fluttered about, and soon after died.\n\nMr Klein applied to many farmers-general of the king\nMigration, king of Prussia's domains, who had great lakes in their districts, the fishery in them being a part of the revenue.\n\nIn winter the fishery thereon is the most considerable under the ice, with nets spreading more than 200 or 300 fathoms, and they are often wound by screws and engines on account of their weight. All the people that were questioned made affidavits upon oath before the magistrates. First, the mother of the countess Lebdorf said, that she had seen a bundle of swallows brought from the Frühe-Haff (a lake communicating with the Baltic at Pillau), which, when brought into a moderately warm room, revived and fluttered about. Secondly, Count Schlieben gave an information on stamped paper, importing, that by fishing on the lake belonging to his estate of Gerdaun in winter, he saw several swallows caught in the net, one of which he took up in his hand, brought it into a warm room, where it lay about an hour, when it began to stir, and half an hour after, it flew about in the room. Thirdly, Farmer-general (Amtman) Witkowski made affidavit, that, in the year 1740, three swallows were brought up with the net in the great pond at Döblitzken; in the year 1741 he got two swallows from another part of the pond, and took them home (they being all caught in his presence); after an hour's space they revived all in a warm room, fluttered about, and died in three hours after. Fourthly, Amtman Bonke says, that having had the estate of Kleefkow in farm, he had seen nine swallows brought up in the net from under the ice, all which he took into a warm room, where he distinctly observed how they gradually revived; but a few hours after they all died. Another time his people got likewise some swallows in a net, but he ordered them to be again thrown into the water. Fifthly, Andrew Rutka, a master fisherman at Oletsko, made affidavit, in 1747, that 22 years ago, two swallows were taken up by him in a net, under the ice, and, being brought into a warm room, they flew about. Sixthly, Jacob Kofilo, a master fisherman at Stradauen made affidavit, that, in 1736, he brought up in winter, in a net, from under the ice of the lake at Rafki, a seemingly dead swallow, which revived in half an hour's time in a warm room; and he saw, in a quarter of an hour after, the bird grow weaker, and soon after dying. Seventhly, I can reckon myself (says our author) among the eye-witnesses of this paradox of natural history. In the year 1735, being a little boy, I saw several swallows brought in winter by the fishermen from the river Viftula to my father's house; where two of them were brought into a warm room, revived, and flew about. I saw them several times settling on the warm stove (which the northern nations have in their rooms); and I recollect well, that the same forenoon they died, and I had them, when dead, in my hand. In the year 1754, after the death of my uncle Godefroy Wolf, captain in the Polish regiment of foot guards, being myself one of his heirs, I administered for my co-heirs several estates called the Starogly of Döschau, in Polish Prussia, which my late uncle farmed under the king. In January, the lake of Lybthaw, belonging to these estates, being covered with ice, I ordered the fishermen to fish therein, and in my presence several swallows were taken, which the fishermen threw in again; but one I took up myself, brought it home, which was five miles from thence, and it revived, but died about an hour after its reviving.\n\n\"Thele are facts attested by people of the highest quality, by some in public offices, and by others who, though of a low rank, however, made these affidavits upon oath. It is impossible to suppose indiscriminately that they were prompted, by views of interest, to assert as a fact a thing which had no truth in it. It is therefore highly probable, or rather incontestably true, that swallows retire in the northern countries, during winter, into the water, and stay there in a torpid state till the return of warmth revives them again in spring. The question therefore, I believe, ought for the future to be thus stated: The swallows in Spain, Italy, France, and perhaps some from England, remove to warmer climates; some English ones, and some in Germany and other mild countries, retire into crevices and holes in rocks, and remain there in a torpid state. In the colder northern countries the swallows immerse in the sea, in lakes, and rivers; and remain in a torpid state, under ice, during winter. There are still some objections to this latter assertion, which we must remove. It is said, Why do not rapacious fish, and aquatic quadrupeds and birds, devour these swallows? The answer is obvious, swallows choose only such places in the water for their winter retreat as are near reeds and rushes; so that sinking down there between them and their roots, they are by them secured against the rapaciousness of their enemies. But others object, Why are not these birds caught in such fresh waters as are continually harassed by nets? I believe the same answer which has been made to the first objection will serve for this likewise. Fishermen take care to keep off with their nets from places filled with reeds and rushes, for fear of entangling and tearing their net; and thus the situation of swallows under water, is the reason that they are seldom disturbed in their silent winter retreats. What confirms this opinion still more is, that swallows were never caught in Prussia according to the above-mentioned affidavits, but with those parts of the net which passed near to the reeds and rushes; and sometimes the swallows were yet fastened with their feet to a reed, when they were drawn up by the net. As to the argument taken from their being so long under water without corruption, I believe there is a real difference between animals suffocated in water and animals being torpid therein. We have examples of things being a long time under water; to which we may add the intense cold of these northern regions, which preserves them. Who would have thought that snails and polyps might be affected, and could reproduce the parts fevered from their bodies, if it was not a fact? Natural history ought to be studied as a collection of facts, not as the history of our guesses or opinions. Nature varies in an infinite manner; and Providence has diversified the instinct of animals and their economy, and adapted it to the various seasons and climates.\"\n\nWith Mr Kalm's concluding observations we heartily concur. Natural history ought to be studied as a collection of facts; and it was from this very notion that we have stated the above-mentioned opinions fairly, and brought together the facts which the best observers, but advocates for each opinion have judged most proper for supporting.\nMigration supporting them. We are sensible of the great improbability of the third opinion, and know that many arguments have been used to prove its absurdity; such as the swallow is lighter than water, and therefore cannot sink; if it moults at all, it must moult under water during its torpid state, which is very improbable; there is no instance of land animals living so long under water without respiration. Many other arguments of the same sort have been advanced, and certainly afford a short way of deciding the question; but unless they were sufficient to prove the immersion of swallows a physical impossibility, they are of no force when opposed to the evidence of testimony, if there be no cause to suspect the witnessess of inaccuracy or design. The true way to refute such an opinion is by accurate observation and experiment. We have not heard of any accurate inquiries being made by philosophers in those northern countries where swallows are said to pass the winter under water. The count de Buffon, indeed, shut up some swallows in an ice house by way of experiment, which died in a few days; but as he does not tell us what precautions he took to make the experiment succeed, it is not entitled to any attention.\n\nMr John Hunter made a very judicious experiment on the banks of the Thames, which is described by a correspondent in the Gentleman's Magazine, who asserts that he had it from Mr Hunter himself.\n\nOne year in the month of September, he prepared a room, with every accommodation and convenience which he could contrive, to serve as a dormitory for swallows, if they were disposed to sleep in winter. He placed in the centre a large tub of water with twigs and reeds, &c., which reached to the bottom. In the corners of the room he contrived artificial caverns and holes, into which they might retire; and he laid on the floor, or suspended in the air, different lengths of old wooden pipes, which had formerly been employed in conveying water through the streets, &c.\n\nWhen the receptacle was rendered as complete as possible, he then engaged some watermen to take by night a large quantity of the swallows that hang upon the reeds in the Thames about the time of their departure. They brought him, in a hamper, a considerable number; and had so nicely hit the time of their capture, that on the very day following there were none to be seen.\n\nHe put the swallows into the room so prepared, where they continued to fly about, and occasionally perch on the twigs, &c. But not one ever retired into the water, the caverns, holes, or wooden pipes, or shewed the least disposition to grow torpid, &c. In this situation he let them remain till they all died but one. This appearing to retain some vigour, was set at liberty; when it mounted out of sight, and flew away. All the birds lay dead scattered about the room; but not one was found asleep or torpid, or had, if the correspondent remembers, so much as crept into any of the receptacles he had so provided.\n\nThis experiment was ingenious, and certainly does render the doctrine of immersion much more improbable; but it is not decisive; for it may still be urged by the advocates for that doctrine, as Mr Kalm has done, that it may only be in the colder countries where swallows retire into the water. We formerly said that none of the three opinions is supported by such evidence as to satisfy the mind completely. Opinions respecting events which happen every year ought to be confirmed by a great number of observations, and not by a few instances divested of almost all their concomitant circumstances. Can no better proofs be brought to prove the migration of swallows than those of Adanson and Sir Charles Wager, or the circumstances mentioned by Mr White and Mr Larkkey respecting their disappearance? We ought not merely to know that some swallows have taken a further flight in autumn, that some have been found at a great distance from land in the spring, or in harvest; but we ought to know to what countries they actually retire. Before we can rest satisfied, too, that it is a general fact that swallows remain in a torpid state during winter, either in caverns or in the bottom of lakes, &c., we must have more proofs; we must know what species of swallows they are said to be, in what countries this event takes place, and several other circumstances of the same kind.\n\nWe cannot help being of opinion that much remains to be done in order properly to ascertain what becomes of the swallows in Europe during winter. It would be necessary, in the first place, to know accurately what order to determine they remain visible the whole year? or, if they disappear, at what season does this happen, and when do they appear again? 3. Do they ever appear while a strong north wind blows, or do they only come in great numbers with a south wind? We will endeavour to answer some of these questions in part; but must regret, that all the information on this subject which we have been able to collect from the best writers in natural history is very scanty; and we merely give it by way of specimen, hoping that future observations will render it more complete.\n\nThere are five species which visit Britain during the summer months; the common or chimney swallow, the martin, sand martin, swift, and goat-sucker. 1. The chimney swallow frequents almost every part of the old continent; being known (says Dr Latham) from Norway to the Cape of Good Hope on the one side, and from Kamtchatka to India and Japan on the other. It is also found in all parts of North America, and in several of the West Indian islands. In Europe it disappears during the winter months. It appears generally a little after the vernal equinox; but rather earlier in the southern, and later in the northern latitudes. It adheres to the usual seasons with much regularity; for though the months of February and March should be uncommonly mild, and April and May remarkably cold, it never deviates from its ordinary time. In the cold spring of 1742 some appeared in France before the insects on which they feed had become numerous enough to support them, and great numbers died. In the mild and even warm spring of 1774 they appeared no earlier than usual. They remain in some birds, warm countries the whole year. Kolben affirms us vol vi, that this is the case at the Cape of Good Hope; but (he says) they are more numerous in winter. Some birds of this species live, during winter, even in Europe; for example, on the coast of Genoa, where they spend the night in the open country on the orange shrubs.\nThe martins are also widely diffused through the old continent; but the countries where they reside or visit have not been marked by naturalists with much attention.\n\nTwo birds of this species were seen in Perigord in France, on the 27th December 1775, when there was a southerly wind, attended with a little rain.\n\nThe swift visits the whole continent of Europe; has also been observed at the Cape of Good Hope, and in Carolina in North America.\n\nThey are found in every country between Sweden and Africa; they are found also in India. In April the southwest wind brings them to Malta, and in autumn they repass in great numbers.\n\nMr Markwick of Catsfield, near Battle in Sussex, has drawn up an accurate table, expressing the day of the month on which the birds, commonly called migratory, appeared in spring, and disappeared in autumn, for 16 years, from 1768 to 1783 inclusive. The observations were made at Catsfield. From this table we shall extract the dates for five years, and add the very few observations which we have been able to collect reflecting the time when the swallow appears and disappears in other countries.\n\n| First seen | Last seen |\n|------------|-----------|\n| 1779       | October 29 |\n| Chimney Swallow Martins | April 14 |\n| Sand Martin | May 7 |\n| Swift      | 9         |\n| 1780       | November 3 |\n| Chimney Swallow Martins | April 29 |\n| Sand Martin | May 8 |\n| Swift      | May 6     |\n| 1781       | October 15 |\n| Chimney Swallow Martins | April 8 |\n| Sand Martin | May 12 |\n| Swift      | May 12    |\n| 1782       | September 1 |\n| Chimney Swallow Martins | April 22 |\n| Sand Martin | May 15 |\n| Swift      | May 18    |\n| 1783       | November 6 |\n| Chimney Swallow Martins | April 13 |\n| Sand Martin | May 1   |\n| Swift      | July 25   |\n| Chimney Swallow Martins | May 13 |\n\nWe acknowledge it to be rather a curious than an important inquiry; yet it is one which must be highly gratifying to every mind that can admire the wisdom of the Great Architect of nature. The instinct of the swallow is indeed wonderful: it appears among us just at the time when insects become numerous; and it continues with us during the hot weather, in order to prevent them from multiplying too much. It disappears when these insects are no longer troublesome. It is never found in solitude; it is the friend of man, and always takes up its residence with us, that it may protect our houses and our streets from being annoyed with swarms of flies.\n\nMigration of Fishes. See Clupea.\n\nSr Miguel, one of the Azores islands, situated in W. Long. 22. 45. N. Lat. 38. 10. This island appears to be entirely volcanic. The best account we have of it hath been published in the 68th volume of the Philosophical Transactions by Mr Francis Maffon. According to him, the productions differ greatly from those of Madeira, inasmuch that none of the trees of the latter are found here, except the taya: it has a nearer affinity to Europe than Africa. The mountains are covered with the erica vulgaris, and an elegant evergreen shrub very like a phillyrea, which gives them a most beautiful appearance.\n\nIt is one of the principal and most fertile of the Azorian islands, lying nearly east and west. Its length is about 18 or 20 leagues; its breadth unequal, not exceeding five leagues, and in some places not more than two. It contains about 80,000 inhabitants.\n\nIts capital, the city of Ponta del Guda, which contains about 12,000 inhabitants, is situated on the south side of the island, on a fine fertile plain country, pretty regularly built; the streets straight, and of a good breadth. It is supplied with good water, which is brought about the distance of three leagues from the neighbouring mountains. The churches and other religious edifices are elegant and well built for such an island. There is a large convent of Franciscan friars and one of the order of St Augustine, four convents for professed nuns, and three Ricolimentos for young women and widows who are not professed. The vessels anchor in an open road; but it is not dangerous, as no wind can prevent their going to sea in case of stormy weather.\n\nThe country round the city is plain for several miles, well cultivated, and laid out with good taste into spacious fields, which are sown with wheat, barley, Indian corn, pulse, &c., and commonly produce annually two crops; for as soon as one is taken off, another is immediately sown in its place. The soil is remarkably gentle and easy to work, being for the most part composed of pulverized pumice stone. There are in the plains a number of pleasant country seats, with orchards of orange trees, which are esteemed the best in Europe.\n\nThe second town is Ribeira Grande, situated on the north side of the island, containing about as many inhabitants as the city; a large convent of Franciscan friars, and one of nuns. It gives title to a count, called the Conde Ribeira Grande, who first instituted linen and woollen manufactures in the island.\n\nThe third town is Villa Franca, on the south side of the island, about six leagues east of Ponta del Guda.\nMiguel. It has a convent of Franciscan friars and one of nuns, which contains about 300. Here, about half a mile from the shore, lies a small island (Ilhao), which is hollow in the middle, and contains a fine basin with only one entrance into it, fit to hold 50 sail of vessels secure from all weather; at present it wants cleaning out, as the winter rain washes down great quantities of earth into it, which has greatly diminished its depth. But vessels frequently anchor between this island and the main.\n\nBesides these towns are several smaller, viz. Alagao, Agoa de Pao, Brelanha, Fannes de Ajuda, and a number of hamlets, called lugares or places.\n\nAbout four leagues north-east from Villa Franca, lies a place called the Furnas, being a round deep valley in the middle of the east part of the island, surrounded with high mountains, which, though steep, may be easily ascended on horseback by two roads. The valley is about five or six leagues in circuit. The face of the mountains, which are very steep, is entirely covered with beautiful evergreens, viz. myrtles, laurels, a large species of bilberry called uva de ferro &c., and numberless rivulets of the purest water run down their sides. The valley below is well cultivated, producing wheat, Indian corn, flax, &c. The fields are planted round with a beautiful sort of poplars, which grow into pyramidal forms, and by their careless irregular disposition, together with the multitude of rivulets, which run in all directions through the valley, a number of boiling fountains throwing up clouds of steam, a fine lake in the south-west part about two leagues round, compose a prospect the finest that can be imagined. In the bottom of the valley the roads are smooth and easy, there being no rocks, but a fine pulverized pumice stone that the earth is composed of.\n\nThere are numerous hot fountains in different parts of the valley, and also on the sides of the mountains; but the most remarkable is that called the chaldeira, situated in the eastern part of the valley, on a small eminence by the side of a river, on which is a basin about 30 feet diameter, where the water continually boils with prodigious fury. A few yards distant from it is a cavern in the side of the bank, in which the water boils in a dreadful manner, throwing out a thick, muddy, unctuous water, several yards from its mouth with a hideous noise. In the middle of the river are several places where the water boils up so hot, that a person cannot dip his finger into it without being scalded; also along its banks are several apertures, out of which the steam rises to a considerable height, so hot that there is no approaching it with one's hand: in other places, a person would think that 100 smiths bellows were blowing altogether, and sulphurous steams issuing out in thousands of places; so that native sulphur is found in every chink, and the ground covered with it like hoar frost; even the bushes that happen to lie near these places are covered with pure brimstone, condensing from the steam that issues out of the ground, which in many places is covered over with a substance like burnt alum. In these small caverns, from which the steam issues, the people often boil their yams.\n\nNear these boiling fountains are several mineral springs; two in particular, whose waters have a very strong quality, of an acid taste, and bitter to the tongue.\n\nAbout half a mile to the westward, and close by the river side, are several hot springs, which are used by sick people with great success. Also, on the side of a hill west of St Anne's church, are many others, with three bathing houses, which are most commonly used. These waters are very warm, although not boiling hot; but at the same place issue several streams of cold mineral water, by which they are tempered, according to every one's liking.\n\nAbout a mile south of this place, and over a low ridge of hills, lies a fine lake about two leagues in circumference, and very deep, the water thick, and of a greenish colour. At the north end is a plain piece of ground, where the sulphureous steam issues out in many places, attended with a surprising blowing noise. Our author could observe strong springs in the lake, but could not determine whether they were hot or cold; this lake seems to have no visible evacuation. The other springs immediately form a considerable river, called Ribeira Quente, which runs a course about two or three leagues, through a deep rent in the mountains, on each side of which are several places where the smoke issues out. It discharges itself into the sea on the south side, near which are some places where the water boils up at some distance in the sea.\n\nThis wonderful place had been taken little notice of until very lately: so little curiosity had the gentlemen of the island, that scarcely any of them had seen it, until of late some persons, afflicted with very violent disorders, were persuaded to try its waters, and found immediate relief from them. Since that time it has become more and more frequented; several persons who had lost the use of their limbs by the gout palsy have been cured; and also others who were troubled with eruptions on their bodies.\n\nA clergyman, who was greatly afflicted with the gout, tried the said waters, and was in a short time perfectly cured, and has had no return of it since. When Mr Masson was there, several old gentlemen, who were quite worn out with the said disorder, were using the waters, and had received incredible benefit from them; in particular, an old gentleman about 60 years of age, who had been tormented with that disorder more than 20 years, and often confined to his bed for six months together: he had used these waters for about three weeks, had quite recovered the use of his limbs, and walked about in the greatest spirits imaginable. A friar also who had been troubled with the said disorder about 12 years, and reduced to a cripple, by using them a short time was quite well, and went a-hunting every day.\n\nThere are several other hot springs in the island, particularly at Ribeira Grande; but they do not profess the same virtues, at least not in so great a degree.\n\nThe east and west part of the island rises into high mountains; but the middle is low, interspersed with round conic hills, all of which have very recent marks of fire; all the parts below the surface consisting of melted lava lying very hollow.\n\nMost of the mountains to the westward have their tops hollowed out like a punch bowl, and contain wa-\nMilan. Near the west end is an immense deep valley like the Furnas, called the Sete Cidades. This valley is surrounded with very abrupt mountains, about seven or eight leagues round; in the bottom is a deep lake of water about three leagues in circuit, furnished with great numbers of water fowls. This water has no mineral quality; neither are there any hot springs in the valley. All these mountains are composed of a white crumbly pumice stone, which is so loose, that if a person thrust a stick into the banks, whole waggon loads of it will tumble down. The inhabitants of the island relate a story, that he who first discovered it observed an extraordinary high peak near the west end; but the second time he visited it, no such peak was to be seen, which he supposed must have certainly sunk; but, however improbable this story may be, at some period or other it must have certainly been the case.\n\nMILAN, or the duchy of the Milanese, a country of Italy, bounded on the west by Savoy, Piedmont, and Montferrat; by Switzerland on the north; by the territories of Venice, the duchies of Mantua, Parma, and Placentia, on the east; and by the territories of Genoa on the south. It is 150 miles long, and 78 broad.\n\nAnciently this duchy, containing the north part of the old Liguria, was called Insubria, from its inhabitants the Insubres; who were conquered by the Romans, as they were by the Goths; who in their turn were subdued by the Lombards, Diodier, the last king of the Lombards, was taken prisoner by Charlemagne, who put an end to the Longobardic empire, and appointed governors of Milan. These governors, being at a distance from their masters, soon began to assume an independency, which brought a dreadful calamity on the country; for, in 1152, the capital itself was levelled with the ground by the emperor Frederic Barbarossa, who committed great devastations otherwise throughout the duchy. Under this emperor lived one Galvian, a nobleman who was descended from Otho, a Milanese. Galvian, along with William prince of Montferrat, served in the crusade, when Godfrey of Boulogne took Jerusalem: he killed in single combat the Saracen general, whom he stripped of his helmet, which was adorned with the image of a serpent swallowing a youth; and this ever afterwards was the badge of that family. His grandson Galvian, having opposed the emperor, was taken prisoner, and carried in irons into Germany, from whence he made his escape, and returning to Milan, died in the service of his country. From him descended another Otho, at the time that Otho IV. was emperor of Germany, and who soon distinguished himself by the accomplishments both of his mind and body. When he grew up, he was received into the family of Cardinal Octavian Ubaldini at Rome. This prelate, who was himself aspiring at the papedom, was in a short time greatly taken with the address and accomplishments of young Otho, and predicted his future greatness. In the mean time, one Torriano, or Torriano, a Milanese nobleman of unbounded ambition, was attempting to make himself master of Milan. The popular faction had some time before been caballing against the nobility; and at last, Torriano, putting himself at their head, expelled the bishop, and put to death or banished all the nobility; by which means the popular government was fully established; and Torriano, under this pretence, ruled everything as he pleased. He was, however, soon opposed by one Francesco Sepi, who formed a great party, pretending to deliver the city from Torriano's haughtiness and cruelty. But while the two parties were collecting their forces against each other, Cardinal Ubaldini was projecting the destruction of both, by means of his favourite Otho. This prelate had for some time borne an implacable hatred to Torriano, because he had been by him prevented from carrying out of the treasury of St Ambrose's church at Milan, a carbuncle or jewel of great value, which he pretended to reserve for adorning the papal tiara; for which reason he now determined to oppose his ambition.\n\nUbaldini began with naming Otho archbishop of Milan; which, as the pope's legate, he had a right to do. This nomination was confirmed by Pope Urban IV.; and the party of the nobility having now got a head from the pope himself, began to gather strength. Otho in the meantime employed himself in collecting troops; and had no sooner procured a show of an army, than he advanced towards Lago Maggiore, and took possession of Arona, a strong post near that lake: but Torriano, marching immediately against him with all his troops, obliged him to abandon the place, and leave his party to make the best terms they could with the conqueror. This was followed by the destruction of the castles of Arona, Anghiari, and Brebia: soon after which Torriano died, and was succeeded by his brother Philip, who had sufficient interest to get himself elected podesta, or prætor of Milan, for ten years. During his lifetime, however, the party of the nobility increased considerably under Otho, notwithstanding the checks they had received. Philip died in 1265, having lost ground considerably in the affections of the people, though he obtained a great reputation for his courage and conduct. His successor Napi rendered himself terrible to the nobility, whom he proscribed, and put to death as often as he could get them into his power. He proceeded such lengths, and acted with such fury against that unfortunate party, that Pope Clement IV., who had succeeded Urban, at last interdicted Milan, and excommunicated Napi and all his party. By this Napi began to lose his popularity, and the public disaffection towards him was much heightened by the natural cruelty of his temper. But in the mean time, the party of the nobility was in the utmost distress. Otho himself and his friends, having spent all their substance, wandered about from place to place; the pope not being in a capacity of giving them any assistance. Otho, however, was not discouraged by his bad success, but found means still to keep up the spirits of his party, who now chose for their general Squarcini Burii, a man of great eminence and courage, whose daughter was married to Matthew Visconti, afterwards called Matthew the Great. At the same time they renewed their confederacy with the marquis of Montferrat, who was son-in-law to the king of Spain. The marquis agreed to this confederacy chiefly with a view to become master of the Milanese.\n\nThe nobility now again began to make head; and having collected an army, which was joined by 600 Spanish\nSpanish cavalry and a body of foot, gained some advantages. But in the mean time Napi, having gathered together a superior army, suddenly attacked Otho and Burri, and defeated them. After this disaster Otho applied to the pope; from whom, however, he did not obtain the assistance he desired; and in the mean time Napi invited the emperor Rodolph into Italy, with the promise of being crowned at Milan. This invitation was accepted of with great readiness by Rodolph; who constituted Napi his governor and vicar-general in Lombardy, sending to him at the same time a fine body of German horde, the command of which was given to Cafloni, Napi's nephew. On this Otho again applied to the pope (Gregory X.); but he was so far from granting him any assistance; that he is said to have entered into a scheme of assimilating him privately; but Otho escaped the danger, and in 1276 began to recover his affairs. The reason of Pope Gregory's enmity to him was, that he and his party were thought to be Gibelines, and were opposed by great numbers of the nobility themselves; but after that pope's death, the Milanese exiles being united under one head, soon became formidable. They now chose for their general Godfrey count of Languio, a noble Pavian, and an inveterate enemy of the Torriano family. This nobleman being rich and powerful, enlisted many German and other mercenaries, at whose head he marched towards the Lago Maggiore. All the towns in that country opened their gates to him, through the interest of the Visconti family, who resided in these parts. But this success soon met with a severe check in an unfortunate engagement, wherein Godfrey was defeated and taken prisoner; after which he and 34 nobles had their heads struck off, and sent from the field of battle piled up in a common waggon.\n\nThis defeat greatly affected Otho; but having in a short time recovered himself, he again attacked his enemies, and defeated them; but, suffering his troops to grow remiss after their victory, the fugitives rallied, and entirely defeated him. The next year, however, Otho had better success, and totally defeated and took prisoner Napi himself. After this victory Cafloni was obliged to abandon Milan to his competitor, who kept possession of it till his death, which happened in 1295, in the 87th year of his age.\n\nOtho was succeeded by Matthew Visconti above mentioned; and Milan continued in subjection to that family without any very memorable occurrence till the year 1378, when, by the death of Galeazzo II., his brother Barnabo became sovereign of Milan. He was of a brave and active disposition; but excessively profuse in his expenses, as his brother Galeazzo had also been; and to procure money to supply his extravagancies, was obliged to oppress his subjects. Galeazzo had engaged in an enterprise against Bologna, and the siege of it was continued by Barnabo. It lasted for nine years; and during this time is said to have cost 300 millions of gold, a prodigious sum in those days, near 40 millions sterling, the lowest gold coin being in value somewhat more than half-a-crown English. Both the brothers were excessively fond of building. Barnabo erected a bridge over the Adda, consisting of three stories; the lowest for chariots and heavy carriages, the middle for horses, and the uppermost for foot passengers. He built also another bridge which was carried over houses without touching them. To accomplish these, and many other expensive schemes, he became one of the greatest tyrants imaginable, and every day produced fresh instances of his rapacity and cruelty. He instituted a chamber of inquiry, for punishing all those who had for five years before been guilty of killing boars, or even of eating them at the table of another. They who could not redeem themselves by money were hanged, and above 100 wretches perished in that manner. Those who had anything to lose were stripped of all their substance, and obliged to labour at the fortifications and other public works. He obliged his subjects to maintain a great many hunting dogs, and each district was taxed a certain number. The overseers of his dogs were at the same time the instruments of his rapacity. When the dogs were poor and slender, the owners were always fined; but when the dogs were fat, the owners were also fined for suffering them to live without exercise.\n\nThe extravagant behaviour of Barnabo soon rendered public affluence ready for a revolution, which was at last accomplished by his nephew John Galeazzo. He affected a solitary life, void of ambition, and even inclining to devotion; but at the same time took care to have his uncle's court filled with spies, who gave him information of all that passed. He reduced his table and manner of living, pretending that he took these steps as preparations to a retirement from the world, which was soon to take place, after he had paid a religious vow. In short, he acted his part so well, that even Barnabo, though abundantly cautious, had no suspicion of his having any designs against him; and so entirely did he conceal his ambition, that he several times made application to his uncle for his interest to procure him a quiet retreat as soon as his religious vows were performed. One of these was to pay a visit to the church of the blessed Virgin upon Mount Varcezzo. This was to be done with so much secrecy that all kinds of eye witnesses were to be excluded; and it was with difficulty that Barnabo himself and two of his sons were allowed to accompany our devotee. But, in the mean time, the hypocritical Galeazzo had followers advancing from all quarters; so that Barnabo and his sons were immediately feasted, and the houses of those who had sided with them given up to be plundered. The booty in plate, money, and all kinds of rich furniture, was immense. The ministers of the late government were dragged from their hiding places, and put to death; and at last the citadel itself fell into the hands of Galeazzo, who found in it an immense sum of money. Barnabo was carried prisoner to Trittici, a castle of his own building, where he had the happiness to find one person still faithful to him. This was his mistress, named Domina Perera; who, when he was abandoned by all the world, shut herself up a voluntary prisoner in his chamber, and remained with him as long as he lived, which was only seven months after his degradation.\n\nJohn Galeazzo was the first who took upon him the title of the Duke of Milan, and was a prince of great policy and no less ambition. He made war with the Florentines, became master of Pisa and Bologna, and entirely defeated the emperor in 1401, so that he entertained hopes of becoming master of all Lombardy, and cutting off all possibility of invading it either from\nMilan. France or Germany; but his designs were frustrated by death, which happened in 1402, in the 53rd year of his age. After his decease the Milanese government fell into the most violent dissensions, so that it could not be supported, even in time of peace, without an army of 20,000 foot and as many horse. In the year 1421, however, Philip duke of Milan became master of Genoa; but though he gained great advantages in all parts of Italy, the different states still found means to counterbalance his successes, and prevent him from enslaving them: so that Milan never became the capital of any extensive empire; and in 1437 Genoa revolted, and was never afterwards reduced.\n\nPhilip died in 1448, and by his death the male line of the Visconti family was at an end. The next lawful heir was Valentina his sister, who had married the duke of Orleans, son to Charles V. of France. By the contract of that marriage, the lawful progeny of it was to succeed to the duchy of Milan in failure of the heirs male of the Visconti family; but this succession was disputed by Sforza, who had married Philip's natural daughter. It is certain, however, that the rightful succession was veiled in the house of Orleans and the kings of France; and therefore though the Sforza family got possession of the duchy for the present, Louis XII. afterwards put in his claim, being a grandson to John Galeazzo. For some time he was successful; but the French behaved in such an insolent manner, that they were driven out of the Milanese by the Swits and Maximilian Sforza. The Swits and Milanese were in their turn expelled by Francis I., who obliged the Sforza family to relinquish the government for a pension of 30,000 ducats a year. Francis Sforza, the son of Maximilian, however, being assisted by the emperor and the pope, regained the possession of the Milanese about the year 1521; and, eight years after, the French king, by the treaty of Cambrai, gave up his claim on the duchy.\n\nBut, in fact, the emperors of Germany seem to have had the fairest title to the Milanese in right of their being for a long time sovereigns of Italy. On the death of Francis Sforza, therefore, in the year 1536, the emperor Charles V. declared the Milanese to be an imperial fief, and granted the investiture of it to his son Philip II., king of Spain. In his family it continued till the year 1706, when the French and Spaniards were driven out by the Imperialists, and the emperor again took possession of it as a fief. It was confirmed to his house by the treaty of Baden in 1714, by the quadruple alliance in 1718, and by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748.\n\nThe duchy of Milan is one of the finest provinces in Italy. It is bounded on the south by the Apennine mountains, and the territory of Genoa; on the north by Switzerland; on the east by the Venetian territories, and the duchies of Mantua, Parma, and Placentia; and on the west by Savoy, Piedmont, and Montferrat; extending from north to south about 100 miles, and from east to west about 108. It is well watered by the Tegino, the Sesia, the Adda, the Po, the Oglio, the Lombro, Serio, &c. and also by several canals and lakes. Of the latter, the Lago Maggiore is between 30 and 40 miles in length, and in some places six or seven miles broad. In it lie the Boromean islands, as they are called, viz. Isola Bella and Isola Madre, the beauty of which almost exceeds imagination: art and nature seem to have vied with one another in embellishing them. In each of them is a palace with delicious gardens, belonging to the Boromean family. The water of the lake is clear and of a greenish colour, and abounds with fish. The hills with which it is surrounded present a most charming landscape, being planted with vines and chestnut trees, interposed with summer houses. There is a canal running from it towards Switzerland, with which the city of Milan has a communication. It was anciently called Lacus Verbanus. The Lago de Como, which was called by the Latin poets Lacus Larius, but had its modern name from the city near which it lies, extends itself about 30 miles northward from Como, but its greatest breadth is not above five miles. From the Lago Maggiore illies the Tegino; and from that of Como the Adda. Of the other lakes, that of Lugano and Guarda are the chief: that of Guarda was anciently called Benacus.\n\nThe trade and manufactures of this duchy consist principally in silk stuffs, stockings, gloves, and handkerchiefs, linen and woollen cloth, hardware, curious works of crystal, agate, hyacinths, and other gems; but their exports are usually far short of their imports.\n\nAs to the revenue of the duchy, it must without doubt be very considerable. It is said to have amounted to 2,000,000 of dollars while the duchy was in the hands of the Spaniards.\n\nIn the year 1767, the Austrian government of Milan published a law, by which all the rights which the pope or the bishops had till then exercised over ecclesiastics, either with regard to their effects or persons, was transferred to a council established for that purpose at Milan. By the same edict, all ecclesiastics were obliged to sell the estates which they had become possessed of since the year 1722; and no subject, whether ecclesiastic or secular, was to go to Rome to solicit any favour, except letters of indulgence, without the consent of the said council.\n\nThis duchy was subdued by the French in the year 1796, when it was regarded as a constituent part of the Cisalpine republic. When hostilities recommenced in 1799, it was again taken by the allies, but afterwards reconquered by the army of Dijon under Bonaparte, who entered the metropolis on the 2d of June 1800. It now forms part of the kingdom of Italy.\n\nMilan, the capital of the duchy of that name, in Latin Mediolanum, is a very large city, and has a wall and rampart round it, with a citadel; yet it is thought to be incapable of making any great resistance. The gardens within the city take up a great deal of ground. In the citadel is a foundry for cannon, and an arsenal furnished with arms for 12,000 men. The governor of it is quite independent of the governor general of the Milanese, who resides in the city, in a large but old and ill-contrived palace. The yearly income of the governor of Milan is said to be 200,000 guilders. The council belonging to the city is composed of a president and 60 doctors of law, who are all nobles, and independent of the governor general. Milan hath experienced a great variety of fortune, having been subject sometimes to the French, sometimes to the Spaniards, and sometimes to the Germans.\nA great number of persons of rank and fortune live in it, especially during the winter. The ladies in France are not allowed more liberty than those of this city; even the authorities of the monastic life are so far mitigated here, that gentlemen have not only the liberty of talking with the nuns, and of rallying and laughing at the grate, but also of joining with them in concerts of music, and of spending whole afternoons in their company. The place where the beau monde take the air, either in their coaches or on foot, is the rampart betwixt the Porta Orientale and the Porta Tosa, where it is straight and broad, and extremely pleasant, being planted with white mulberry trees, and commanding a prospect on one side of the open country, and on the other of the gardens and vineyards between the ramparts and the city. Milan, which is said to have been built by the Gauls about 200 years after the foundation of Rome, contains a great number of stately edifices, as churches, convents, palaces, and hospitals. The cathedral is a vast pile, all of marble; and though something has been doing for near 400 years towards the outward or inward ornament thereof, it is not yet finished. Of the great number of statues about it, that of St Bartholomew, just flead alive, with his skin hanging over his shoulders; and of Adam and Eve, over the main portal, are the finest. The pillars supporting the roof of the church are all of marble, and the windows finely painted. This church contains a treasure of great value, particularly a shrine of rock crystal, in which the body of St Charles Borromeo is deposited. The other churches most worthy a stranger's notice are those of St Alexander, St Jerome, St Giovanni di Calarotti della Paffione, that of the Jesuits, and of St Ambrose, in which lie the bodies of the saint and of the kings Pepin and Bernard. In the Ambrosian college, founded by Frederic Boromeo, 16 professors teach gratis. In the same college is also an academy of painting, with a museum, and a library containing about 45,000 printed books and manuscripts; among the last of which is a translation of Josephus's History of the Jews, done by Rufinus about 1200 years ago, and written on the bark of a tree; St Ambrose's works on vellum, finely illuminated; the orations of Gregory Nazianzen, and the works of Virgil, in folio, with Petrarch's notes. In the museum are Leonard da Vinci's mathematical and mechanical drawings, in 12 large volumes. The seminary for sciences, the college of the nobles, the Helvetian college, and the mathematical academy, are noble foundations, and flatly buildings. Of the hospitals, the most remarkable are the Lazaretto, and that called the great hospital; the latter of which receives sick persons, foundlings, and lunatics, and has six smaller hospitals depending on it, with a revenue of 100,000 rix dollars.\n\nThe number of the inhabitants of this city is said to be about 250,000. It has been 40 times besieged, taken 20 times, and four times almost entirely demolished; yet it hath always recovered itself. It is said that gunpowder is sold here only by one person, and in one place. The court of inquisition is held in the Dominican convent, near the church of Madonna della Gratia. The houses of entertainment, and the ordinaries here, are represented as very indifferent.—Mr Keyser says, it is not unusual for young travellers, when they go to any of the taverns in Milan, to be asked, \"whether they choose a letto fornito,\" or female bedfellow,\" who continues marked till the enters the bedchamber. Milan is described as inferior to Turin both in beauty and conveniency, many of the streets being crooked and narrow, and paper windows much more frequent than in that city; even in grand palaces, the windows are often composed promiscuously of glass and paper. Two large canals extend from hence, the one to the Teffino, and the other to the Adda; the Teffino having a communication with the Lago Maggiore, and, by a canal, with the Sesia; and the Adda issuing from the Lago di Como, and having a communication by canals with the Lombro and Serio. In a void space in one of the streets of Milan, where stood the house of a barber who had conspired with the commissary of health to poison his fellow citizens, is erected a pillar called Columna Infame, with an inscription to perpetuate the memory of the execrable design. The environs of this city are very pleasant, being adorned with beautiful seats, gardens, orchards, &c. About two Italian miles from it, at the seat of the Simonetti family, is a building, that would have been a masterpiece of its kind had the architect designed it for an artificial echo. It will return or repeat the report of a pistol above 60 times; and any single musical instrument well touched will have the same effect as a great number of instruments, and produce a most surprising and delightful concert.\n\nAccording to Dr Moore, \"there is no place in Italy, perhaps in Europe, where strangers are received in such an easy hospitable manner as at Milan. Formerly the Milanese nobility displayed a degree of splendour and magnificence, not only in their entertainments, but in their usual style of living, unknown in any other country of Europe. They are under a necessity at present of living at less expense, but they still show the same obliging and hospitable disposition. This country having, not very long since, been possessed by the French, from whom it devolved to the Spaniards, and from them to the Germans, the troops of those nations have, at different periods, had their residence here, and in the course of their vicissitudes, produced a style of manners, and stamped a character on the inhabitants of this duchy, different from what prevails in any other part of Italy; and nice observers imagine they perceive in Milanese manners the politeness, formality, and honesty imputed to those three nations, blended with the ingenuity natural to Italians. The great theatre having been burnt to the ground last year, there are no dramatic entertainments, except at a small temporary play-house, which is little frequented; but the company assemble every evening in their carriages on the ramparts, and drive about, in the same manner as at Naples, till it is pretty late. In Italy, the ladies have no notion of quitting their carriages at the public walks, and using their own legs, as in England and France. On seeing the number of servants, and the splendour of the equipages which appear every evening at the Corso on the ramparts, one would not suspect that degree of depopulation, and diminution of wealth, which we are assured has taken place within these few years all over the Milanese; and which proceeds from the burdensome\nMILBORN-PORT, a town of Somersetshire in England, seated on a branch of the river Parrett, 115 miles from London. Though represented in parliament, it is no market town nor corporation; but it appears in Domesday-book to have had a market once, and 56 burgesses. It is in a manner surrounded by Dorsetshire. Here are nine capital burgesses, who yearly choose two bailiffs, that have the government of the borough under them, and jointly return the members to parliament with the two stewards, who are chosen yearly out of nine commonalty stewards, and have the custody of the corporation-seal. These two stewards also distribute the profits of the lands given to the poor here, of which the said commonalty stewards are trustees. The inhabitants are about 1100, the houses not much above 200. There are two fairs, June 6, and October 28.\n\nMILBROOK, a town of Cornwall, on the west side of Plymouth haven. It has a good fishing trade, and has formerly furnished our fleet with many able hands.\n\nMILDENHALL, a town of Suffolk, seven miles from Newmarket, 12 from Bury, and 70 from London. It is a large populous town on the river Lark, a branch of the Ouse, with a harbour for boats. It has a well frequented market on Fridays, especially for fish and wild-fowl. Its church has a tower or steeple 120 feet high. E. Long. o. 26. N. Lat. 5. 2. 29.\n\nMILDEW, is said to be a kind of thick, clammy, sweet juice, exhaled from, or falling down upon, the leaves and blossoms of plants. By its thickness and clamminess it prevents perspiration, and hinders the growth of the plant. It sometimes rests on the leaves of trees in form of a fatty juice, and sometimes on the ears of corn. It is naturally very tough and viscous, and becomes still more so by the sun's heat exhaling its more fluid parts; by which means the young ears of corn are so daubed over, that they can never arrive at their full growth. Bearded wheat is less subject to the mildew than the common sort; and it is observed that newly dunged lands are more liable to mildew than others. The best remedy is a smart shower of rain, and immediately afterwards a brisk wind. If the mildew is seen before the sun has much power, it has been recommended to send two men into the field with a long cord, each holding one end; and drawing this along the field through the ears, the dew will be dislodged from them, before the heat of the sun is able to dry it to that viscous state in which it does the mischief. Some also say, that lands which have for many years been subject to mildews, have been cured of it by sowing foot along with the corn, or immediately after it.\n\nMr J. S. Segar, the author of a treatise upon this subject, observes, that the mildew is of such a sharp corrosive nature, that it raises blisters on the feet of the shepherds who go barefoot, and even consumes the hoofs of the cattle. He suspects that it possesses some arsenical qualities, though he does not pretend to affirm this positively. Its pernicious influence, according to him, is rendered still more powerful by a variety of circumstances; such as sending the cattle into the fields too early in the spring; their drinking water mixed with ice, or but lately thawed; their being kept in stables that are too close and filthy, and which are not sufficiently aired. The same author considers the mildew as a principal cause of epidemical distempers among the cattle. The mildew producing these distempers, he says, is that which dries and burns the grass and leaves. It falls usually in the morning, particularly after a thunder storm. Its poisonous quality (which does not continue above 24 hours) never operates but when it has been swallowed immediately after its falling. The disorder attacks the stomach, is accompanied with pimples on the tongue, loss of appetite, a desiccation of the alimentary in the stomach, a cough, and difficulty of respiration. As a preservative, the author prescribes purging in spring and in winter. The medicine he advises is composed of 30 grains of sulphur of antimony, and 60 grains of resin of jalap. He is against vomiting, and everything that is of a heating nature.\n\nMILE, a measure of length or distance, containing eight furlongs. The English statute mile is 80 chains, or 1760 yards; that is, 5280 feet.\n\nWe shall here give a table of the miles in use among the principal nations of Europe, in geometrical paces, 62,000 of which make a degree of the equator.\n\n| Mile of Russia | Geometrical paces |\n|---------------|------------------|\n|               | 750              |\n\n| Mile of Italy | Geometrical paces |\n|---------------|------------------|\n|               | 1000             |\n\n| Mile of England | Geometrical paces |\n|-----------------|------------------|\n|                 | 1200             |\n\n| Mile of Scotland and Ireland | Geometrical paces |\n|------------------------------|------------------|\n|                               | 1500             |\n\n| Old league of France | Geometrical paces |\n|----------------------|------------------|\n|                      | 1500             |\n\n| The small league, ibid. | Geometrical paces |\n|-------------------------|------------------|\n|                         | 2000             |\n\n| The mean league, ibid. | Geometrical paces |\n|------------------------|------------------|\n|                        | 2500             |\n\n| The great league, ibid. | Geometrical paces |\n|-------------------------|------------------|\n|                         | 3000             |\n\n| Mile of Poland | Geometrical paces |\n|---------------|------------------|\n|               | 3000             |\n\n| Mile of Spain | Geometrical paces |\n|---------------|------------------|\n|               | 3428             |\n\n| Mile of Germany | Geometrical paces |\n|-----------------|------------------|\n|                 | 4000             |\n\n| Mile of Sweden | Geometrical paces |\n|----------------|------------------|\n|                | 5000             |\n\n| Mile of Denmark | Geometrical paces |\n|-----------------|------------------|\n|                 | 5000             |\n\n| Mile of Hungary | Geometrical paces |\n|-----------------|------------------|\n|                 | 6000             |\n\nMILETUS, in Ancient Geography, a town of Crete mentioned by Homer; but where situated does not appear. It is said to be the mother town of Miletus in Caria, whither a colony was led by Sarpedon, Minos's brother, (Ephorus, quoted by Strabo). Milefii, the people, (Ovid).\n\nMiletus, in Ancient Geography, a celebrated town of Asia Minor, on the confines of Ionia and Caria. It was the capital city of all Ionis, and famous both for the arts of war and peace. It was situated about 10 stadia south of the mouth of the river Maeander, near the sea coast. It was founded by a Cretan colony under Miletus, the companion of Bacchus; or (according to others) by Neleus the son of Codrus; or by Sarpedon a son of Jupiter. It has successively been called Lelegis, Pithyusa, and Anacloria. The inhabitants, called Milefii, were very powerful, and long maintained an obstinate war against the kings of Lydia. They early applied themselves to navigation; and planted no less than 80 colonies, or (according to Seneca) 380, in different parts of the world. It was the only town that made head against Alexander, and was with much difficulty taken. It gave birth to Thales,\nMilfoil, Thales, one of the seven wise men, and the first who applied himself to the study of nature. It was also the country of Anaximander, the scholar and successor of Thales, the inventor of sun dials and the gnomon, and the first that published a geographical map; of Anaximenes, scholar and successor to the foregoing; and of other great men. It was noted for its excellent wool, according to Virgil; and was also celebrated for a temple and oracle of Apollo Didymus. This famous people, from being powerful, becoming afterwards opulent and abandoned to pleasures, lost both their riches and their power.—At present it is called by the Turks Melat, and not far distant from it runs the river Mæander. St Paul going from Corinth to Jerusalem passed by Miletus, and as he went by sea, and could not take Ephesus in his way, he caused the bishops and priests of the church of Ephesus to come to Miletus (Acts xx. 15, &c.), which was about 12 leagues from them.\n\nMILFOIL, or Yarrow. See Achillea, Botany Index.\n\nMILFORD, a town of Sussex county, in the Delaware flatte, is situated at the source of a small river, 15 miles from Delaware bay, and 150 southward of Philadelphia. This town, which contains about 80 houses, has been built, except one house, since the revolution. It is laid out with much taste, and is by no means disagreeable. The inhabitants are Episcopalians, Quakers, and Methodists.\n\nMilford Haven, one of the finest harbours in Europe, and indubitably the best in Britain, is situated in Pembrokehire in South Wales, and lies on the north side of the Bristol channel. It is very large, safe, and deep; there is no danger of going in or out with the tide, or almost with any wind. If a ship comes in without a cable or anchor she may run aground on the ooze, and there lie safe till she is refitted; and in an hour's time she may get out of the harbour into the open sea. It lies extremely convenient for ships bound from the English or Bristol channels to Ireland, or farther west, and from thence to the channels. It is said, that 1000 sail of any size may ride secure in this haven. It has 16 deep and safe creeks, five bays, and 13 roads, all distinguished by their several names. The spring tide rises 36 feet, so that ships may at any time be laid aground. Dale harbour is a ready outlet for small vessels, where they may ride in two or three fathoms at low water.—In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, before the Spanish invasion, two forts were begun at the entrance of Milford Haven, one on each side, called Nangle and Dale blockhouses; but they were not then finished.—The Stack-rock rises here above water, lying near the middle of the entrance between Nangle and Dale. Pembrookmouth is the opening of that branch of the haven on which the town of Pembroke is seated, and where the customhouse of Milford is kept. The breadth of the entrance between rock and rock is but 200 yards at high water, and 112 at low water. There is a ridge of rocky ground that has the name of Carr, which runs almost across Milford Haven, from Peter church towards Llandudno, where it renders the landing place difficult to strangers, from its not appearing at low water. The great convenience of this harbour is, that in a hour's time a ship may be in or out of it, and in the way between the Land's End and Ireland. As it lies near the mouth of the Severn, a ship in eight or ten hours may be over on the coast of Ireland, or off the Land's End in the English Channel; and a vessel may get out hence to the west much sooner than from either Plymouth or Falmouth. This harbour has been greatly improved by new works, at the expense of the government. The parliament on April 14, 1759 granted £10,000 for fortifying the harbour of Milford, all of which was expended on the fort at Neyland, which, however, still remains unfinished.\n\nMILITARY, in general, something resembling millet feed.\n\nMiliary Fever. See Medicine Index.\n\nMILITANT, or Church-militant, denotes the body of Christians while here on earth.\n\nMILITARY, something belonging to the soldiery or militia.\n\nMilitary Discipline, the training of soldiers, and the due enforcement of the laws and regulations instituted by authority for their conduct.\n\nNext to the forming of troops, military discipline is the first object that presents itself to our notice; it is the soul of all armies; and unless it be established amongst them with great prudence, and supported with unshaken resolution, they are no better than so many contemptible heaps of rubble, which are more dangerous to the very state that maintains them than even its declared enemies.\n\nMilitary Execution, the ravaging or destroying of a country, or town, that refuses to pay the contribution inflicted upon them.\n\nMilitary Exercise. See Exercise and Words of Command.\n\nMilitary State, in British polity, one of the three divisions of the laity. See Laity.\n\nThis state includes the whole of the soldiery, or such persons as are peculiarly appointed among the rest of the people for the safeguard and defence of the realm.\n\nIn a land of liberty, it is extremely dangerous to make a dilapidated order of the profession of arms. In absolute monarchies, this is necessary for the safety of the prince; and arises from the main principle of their constitution, which is that of governing by fear; but, in free states, the profession of a soldier, taken singly and merely as a profession, is justly an object of jealousy. In these no man should take up arms but with a view to defend his country and its laws; he puts not off the citizen when he enters the camp; but it is because he is a citizen, and would wish to continue so, that he makes himself for a while a soldier. The laws therefore, and constitution of these kingdoms, know no such state as that of a perpetual standing soldiery, bred up to no other profession than that of war; and it was not till the reign of Henry VII. that the kings of England had so much as a guard about their persons.\n\nIn the time of the Anglo-Saxons, as appears from Edward the Confessor's laws, the military force of England was in the hands of the dukes or heretochs, who were constituted through every province and county in the kingdom; being taken out of the principal nobility, and such as were most remarkable for being\nMilitary. ing sapientem, fideles, et animos. Their duty was to lead and regulate the English armies with a very unlimited power; prout eis visum fuerit, ad honorem coronae et utilitatem regni. And because of this great power they were elected by the people in their full assembly, or folk-mote, in the same manner as sheriffs were elected: following still that old fundamental maxim of the Saxon constitution, that where any officer was intrusted with such power, as, if abused, might tend to the opprobrium of the people, that power was delegated to him by the vote of the people themselves. So too, among the ancient Germans, the ancestors of our Saxon forefathers, they had their dukes, as well as kings, with an independent power over the military, as the kings had over the civil state. The dukes were elective, the kings hereditary: for so only can be confidently understood that passage of Tacitus, Reges ex nobilitate, duces ex virtute famuli. In constituting their kings, the family or blood royal was regarded; in choosing their dukes or leaders, warlike merit: just as Caesar relates of their ancestors in his time, that whenever they went to war, by way either of attack or defence, they elected leaders to command them. This large share of power, thus conferred by the people, though intended to preserve the liberty of the subject, was perhaps unreasonably detrimental to the prerogative of the crown: and accordingly we find a very ill use made of it by Edric duke of Mercia, in the reign of King Edmund Ironside; who, by his office of duke or heretoch, was entitled to a large command in the king's army, and by his repeated treacheries at last transferred the crown to Canute the Dane.\n\nIt seems universally agreed by all historians, that King Alfred first settled a national militia in this kingdom, and by his prudent discipline made all the subjects of his dominions soldiers: but we are unfortunately left in the dark as to the particulars of this his so celebrated regulation; though, from what was last observed, the dukes seem to have been left in possession of too large and independent a power: which enabled Duke Harold, on the death of Edward the Confessor, though a stranger to the royal blood, to mount for a short space the throne of this kingdom, in prejudice of Edgar Etheling the rightful heir.\n\nUpon the Norman conquest, the feudal law was introduced here in all its rigour, the whole of which is built on a military plan. In consequence thereof, all the lands in the kingdom were divided into what were called knight's fees, in number above 62,000; and for every knight's fee, a knight or soldier, miles, was bound to attend the king in his wars, for 40 days in a year; in which space of time, before war was reduced to a science, the campaign was generally finished, and a kingdom either conquered or victorious. By this means the king had, without any expense, an army of 60,000 men always ready at his command. And accordingly we find one, among the laws of William the Conqueror, which in the king's name commands and firmly enjoins the personal attendance of all knights and others; quod habeant et teneant se semper in armis et equis, ut decet et oportet: et quod semper sint prompti et parati ad servitium suum integrum nobis expendendum et peragendum, cum opus adveniat, secundum quod debent de feudis et tenementis suis de jure nobis facere. This personal service in process of time degenerated into pecuniary commutations or aids; and at last the military part of the feudal system was abolished at the Restoration, by stat. 12 Car. II. c. 24. See Feudal System.\n\nIn the mean time, we are not to imagine that the kingdom was left wholly without defence in case of domestic insurrections, or the prospect of foreign invasions. Besides those who by their military tenures were bound to perform 40 days service in the field, first the affize of arms, enacted 27 Hen. II. and afterwards the statute of Winchester, under Edward I. obliged every man, according to his estate and degree, to provide a determinate quantity of such arms as were then in use, in order to keep the peace; and constables were appointed in all hundreds by the latter statute, to see that such arms were provided. These weapons were changed, by the statute 4 and 5 Ph. and M. c. 2, into others of more modern service; but both this and the former provisions were repealed in the reign of James I. While these continued in force, it was usual from time to time for our princes to issue commissions of array, and send into every county officers in whom they could confide, to muster and array (or fet in military order) the inhabitants of every district; and the form of the commission of array was settled in parliament in the 5 Hen. IV. But at the same time it was provided, that no man should be compelled to go out of the kingdom at any rate, nor out of his shire, but in cases of urgent necessity; nor should provide soldiers unless by consent of parliament. About the reign of King Henry VIII. and his children, lord-lieutenants began to be introduced, as standing representatives of the crown, to keep the counties in military order; for we find them mentioned as known officers in the statute 4 and 5 Ph. and M. c. 3, though they had not been then long in use; for Camden speaks of them in the time of Queen Elizabeth as extraordinary magistrates, constituted only in times of difficulty and danger.\n\nIn this state things continued till the repeal of the statutes of armour in the reign of King James I.; after which, when King Charles I. had, during his northern expeditions, issued commissions of lieutenancy, and exerted some military powers which, having been long exercised, were thought to belong to the crown, it became a question in the long parliament, how far the power of the militia did inherently reside in the king; being now unsupported by any statute, and founded only upon immemorial usage. This question, long agitated with great heat and resentment on both sides, became at length the immediate cause of the fatal rupture between the king and his parliament: the two houses not only denying this prerogative of the crown, the legality of which claim perhaps might be somewhat doubtful; but also seizing into their hands the entire power of the militia, the illegality of which step could never be any doubt at all.\n\nSoon after the restoration of King Charles II., when the military tenures were abolished, it was thought proper to ascertain the power of the militia, to recognize the sole right of the crown to govern and command them, and to put the whole into a more regular method of military subordination: and the order in which the militia now stands by law, is principally built upon the statutes which were then enacted. It is true, the two last of them are apparently repealed; but many of their provisions\nprovisions are re-enacted, with the addition of some new regulations, by the present militia laws; the general scheme of which is to discipline a certain number of the inhabitants of every county, chosen by lot for three years, and officered by the lord lieutenant, the deputy lieutenants, and other principal landholders, under a commission from the crown. They are not compellable to march out of their counties, unless in case of invasion or actual rebellion, nor in any case compellable to march out of the kingdom. They are to be exercised at stated times: and their discipline in general is liberal and easy; but, when drawn out into actual service, they are subject to the rigours of martial law, as necessary to keep them in order. This is the constitutional security which our laws have provided for the public peace, and for protecting the realm against foreign or domestic violence; and which the statutes declare as essentially necessary to the safety and prosperity of the kingdom.\n\nWhen the nation was engaged in war, more veteran troops and more regular discipline were deemed to be necessary, than could be expected from a mere militia; and therefore at such times more rigorous methods were put in use for the raising of armies and the due regulation and discipline of the soldiery, which are to be looked upon only as temporary excrescences bred out of the dillemper of the state, and not as any part of the permanent and perpetual laws of the kingdom. For martial law, which is built upon no settled principles, but is entirely arbitrary in its decisions, is, as Sir Matthew Hale observes, in truth and reality no law, but something indulged rather than allowed as a law. The necessity of order and discipline in an army is the only thing which can give it countenance; and therefore it ought not to be permitted in time of peace, when the king's courts are open for all persons to receive justice according to the laws of the land. Wherefore, Thomas earl of Lancaster being convicted at Pontefract, Edward II. by martial law, his attainder was reversed Edward III. because it was done in time of peace. And it is laid down, that if a lieutenant, or other, that hath commission of martial authority, doth in time of peace hang or otherwise execute any man by colour of martial law, this is murder; for it is against magna charta. And the petition of right enacts, that no soldier shall be quartered on the subject without his own consent; and that no commission shall issue to proceed within this land according to martial law. And whereas, after the Restoration, King Charles II. kept up about 5000 regular troops, by his own authority, for guards and garrisons, which King James II. by degrees increased to no less than 30,000, all paid from his own civil list; it was made one of the articles of the bill of rights, that the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace, unless it be with consent of parliament, is against law.\n\nBut as the fashion of keeping standing armies (which was first introduced by Charles VII. in France 1445) has of late years universally prevailed over Europe (though some of its potentates, being unable themselves to maintain them, are obliged to have recourse to richer powers, and receive subsidiary pensions for that purpose), it has also for many years past been annually judged necessary by our legislature for the safety of the kingdom, the defence of the possessions of the crown of Great Britain, and the preservation of the balance of power in Europe, to maintain even in time of peace a standing body of troops, under the command of the crown; who are however ipso facto disbanded at the expiration of every year, unless continued by parliament. And it was enacted by statute 12 William III. c. 1. that not more than 12,000 regular forces should be kept on foot in Ireland, though paid at the charge of that kingdom: which permission is extended by statute 8 Geo. III. c. 13. to 16,235 men in time of peace.\n\nTo prevent the executive power from being able to oppress, says Baron Montesquieu, it is requisite that the armies with which it is intrusted should consist of the people, and have the same spirit with the people: as was the case at Rome, till Marius new-modelled the legions by enlisting the rabble of Italy, and laid the foundation of all the military tyranny that ensued. Nothing then, according to these principles, ought to be more guarded against in a free state, than making the military power, when such a one is necessary to be kept on foot, a body too distinct from the people. Like ours, therefore, it should wholly be composed of natural subjects; it ought only to be enlisted for a short and limited time; the soldiers also should live intermixed with the people; no separate camp, no barracks, no inland fortresses should be allowed. And perhaps it might be still better, if, by dismissing a fixed number, and enlisting others at every renewal of their term, a circulation could be kept up between the army and the people, and the citizen and the soldier be more intimately connected together.\n\nTo keep this body of troops in order, an annual act of parliament likewise passes, \"to punish mutiny and defection, and for the better payment of the army and their quarters.\" This regulates the manner in which they are to be dispersed among the several inn-keepers and victuallers throughout the kingdom; and establishes a law-martial for their government. By this, among other things, it is enacted, that if any officer or soldier shall excite, or join any mutiny, or, knowing of it, shall not give notice to the commanding officer, or shall desert, or lift in any other regiment, or flag upon his post, or leave it before he is relieved, or hold correspondence with a rebel or enemy, or strike or use violence to his superior officer, or shall disobey his lawful commands; such offender shall suffer such punishment as a court martial shall inflict, though it extend to death itself.\n\nHowever expedient the most strict regulations may be in time of actual war, yet in times of profound peace, a little relaxation of military rigour would not, one should hope, be productive of much inconvenience. And, upon this principle, though by our standing laws (still remaining in force, though not attended to) defection in time of war is made felony without benefit of clergy, and the offence is triable by a jury, and before the judges of the common law; yet, by our militia laws before mentioned, a much lighter punishment is inflicted for defection in time of peace. So, by the Roman law also, defection in time of war was punished with death, but more mildly in time of tranquillity. But our mutiny act makes no such distinction: for any of the faults above mentioned are, equally at all times, punishable with death itself, if a court martial shall think proper. This discretionary power of\nMilitary. The court martial is indeed to be guided by the directions of the crown; which, with regard to military offences, has almost an absolute legislative power. \"His Majesty (lays the act) may form articles of war, and constitute courts martial, with power to try any crime by such articles, and inflict such penalties as the articles direct.\" A vast and most important truth! an unlimited power to create crimes, and annex to them any punishments not extending to life or limb! These are indeed forbidden to be inflicted, except for crimes declared to be so punishable by this act; which crimes we have just enumerated, and among which, we may observe, that any disobedience to lawful commands is one. Perhaps in some future revision of this act, which is in many respects hastily penned, it may be thought worthy the wisdom of parliament to ascertain the limits of military subjection, and to enact express articles of war for the government of the army, as is done for the government of the navy; especially as, by our present constitution, the nobility and gentry of the kingdom, who serve their country as militia officers, are annually subjected to the same arbitrary rule during their time of exercise.\n\nOne of the greatest advantages of our law is, that not only the crimes themselves which it punishes, but also the penalties which it inflicts, are ascertained and notorious: nothing is left to arbitrary discretion: the king by his judges dispenses what the law has previously ordained, but is not himself the legislator. How much, therefore, is it to be regretted, that a set of men, whose bravery has often preserved the liberties of their country, should be reduced to a state of servitude in the midst of a nation of freemen? for Sir Edward Coke will inform us, that it is one of the genuine marks of servitude, to have the law, which is our rule of action, either concealed or precarious; *Misera est servitus, ubi jus est vagum aut incognitum.* Nor is this state of servitude quite consistent with the maxims of sound policy observed by other free nations. For the greater the general liberty is which any state enjoys, the more cautious has it usually been in introducing slavery in any particular order or profession. These men, as Baron Montesquieu observes, seeing the liberty which others possess, and which they themselves are excluded from, are apt (like eunuchs in the eastern feraglions) to live in a state of perpetual envy and hatred towards the rest of the community, and indulge a malignant pleasure in contributing to destroy those privileges to which they can never be admitted. Hence have many free states, by departing from this rule, been endangered by the revolt of their slaves; while, in absolute and despotic governments, where no real liberty exists, and consequently no injurious comparisons can be formed, such incidents are extremely rare. Two precautions are therefore advised to be observed in all prudent and free governments: 1. To prevent the introduction of slavery at all; or, 2. If it be already introduced, not to intrust those slaves with arms, who will then find themselves an overmatch for the freemen. Much less ought the soldiery to be an exception to the people in general, and the only state of servitude in the nation.\n\nBut as soldiers, by this annual act, are thus put in a worse condition than any other subjects; so, by the humanity of our standing laws, they are in some cases put in a much better. By statute 43 Eliz. c. 3, a Military weekly allowance is to be raised in every county for the relief of soldiers that are sick, hurt, and maimed: not forgetting the royal hospital at Chelsea for such as are worn out in their duty. Officers and soldiers, that have been in the king's service, are by several statutes, enacted at the close of several wars, at liberty to use any trade or occupation they are fit for, in any town in the kingdom (except the two universities), notwithstanding any statute, custom, or charter to the contrary. And soldiers in actual military service may make nuncupative wills, and dispose of their goods, wages, and other personal chattels, without these forms, solemnities, and expenses, which the law requires in other cases. Our law does not indeed extend this privilege so far as the civil law, which carried it to an extreme that borders upon the ridiculous: for if a soldier, in the article of death, wrote anything in bloody letters on his shield, or in the dust of the field with his sword, it was a very good military testament.\n\n**Military Court.** See Chivalry, Court of.\n\n**Military Tenures.** See Tenure, Feudal System, and Knight.\n\n**Military Ways,** (viae militares), are the large Roman roads which Agrippa procured to be made through the empire in the time of Augustus, for the more convenient marching of troops and conveyance of carriages. N. Bergier has written the history of the origin, progress, and amazing extent, of these military roads, which were paved from the gates of Rome to the extreme parts of the empire. See Way.\n\n**Militia,** in general, denotes the body of soldiers, or those who make profession of arms.\n\nIn a more restrained sense, militia denotes the trained bands of a town or country, who arm themselves, upon a short warning, for their own defence. So that, in this sense, militia is opposed to regular or stated troops. See Military State, and Feudal System.\n\n**Milium, millet,** a genus of plants, belonging to the triandra class; and in the natural method ranking under the 4th order, Graminae. See Botany Index.\n\n**Milk,** a well known fluid, prepared by nature in the breasts of women, and the udders of other animals, for the nourishment of their young.—According to Dr Cullen *, milk is a connecting and intermediate substance between animals and vegetables. It seems Mat. Med. immediately to be secreted from the chyle, both being a white liquor of the same consistence: it is most copiously secreted after meals, and of an acetic nature. In most animals who live on vegetables, the milk is acetic; and it is uncertain, though at the same time no observation proves the contrary, whether it is not so likewise in carnivorous animals. But, whatever be in this, it is certain, that the milk of all animals who live on vegetables is acetic. Milk being derived from the chyle, we thence conclude its vegetable nature; for in those who live on both promiscuously, more milk is got, and more quickly, from the vegetable than the animal food. Milk, however, is not purely vegetable; though we have a vegetable liquor that resembles its taste, consistence, colour, aceticity, and the separability of the oily part, viz. an emulsion of the nuces oleoide and farnaceose substances. But these want the coagulable part of milk, which seems\nto be of animal nature, approaching to that of the coagulable lymph of the blood. Milk, then, seems to be of an intermediate nature, between chyle taken up from the intestines and the fully elaborated animal fluid.\n\nIts contents are of three kinds: 1st, An oily part, which, whatever may be said concerning the origin of other oils in the body, is certainly immediately derived from the oil of the vegetables taken in; as with these it agrees very exactly in its nature, and would entirely, if we could separate it fully from the coagulable part. Another mark of their agreement is the separability, which proves that the mixture has been lately attempted, but not fully performed. 2dly, Besides this oily, there is a proper coagulable part: And, 3dly, Much water accompanies both, in which there is dissolved a saline saccharine substance. These three can be got separate in cheese, butter, and whey; but never perfectly so, a part of each being always blended with every other part.\n\nNothing is more common, from what has been said of its immediate nature, than to suppose that it requires no assimilation; and hence has been deduced the reason of its exhibition in the most weakly state of the human body. But wherever we can examine milk, we always find that it coagulates, suffers a decomposition, and becomes acetic. Again, Infants, who feed entirely on milk, are always troubled with eruptions, which every body observes are not of the same quality with the food taken; and therefore it appears, that, like all other food, milk turns naturally acetic in the stomach, and only enters the chyle and blood in consequence of a new recomposition. It approaches then to the nature of vegetable aliment, but is not capable of its noxious venous fermentation, and therefore has an advantage over it; neither from this quality, like animal food, is it heating in the stomach, and productive of fever; though at the same time, from its quantity of coagulable matter, it is more nourishing than vegetables.\n\nMilk is the food most universally fitted to all ages and states of the body; but it seems chiefly designed by nature as the food of infants. When animals are in the fetus state, their solids are a perfect jelly, incapable of an assimilatory power. In such state nature has perfectly assimilated food, as the albumen ovi in the oviparous, and in the viviparous animals certainly somewhat of the same kind, as it was necessary the vessels should be filled with such a fluid as would make way for an after assimilation. When the infant has attained a considerable degree of firmness, as when it is separated from the mother, yet such a degree of weakness still remains as makes somewhat of the same indication necessary; it behoves the infant to have an alkaline food ready prepared, and at the same time its noxious tendency to be avoided. Milk then is given, which is alkaline, and, at the same time, has a sufficient quantity of acidity to correct that alkalinity. As the body advances in growth, and the alkaline tendency is greater, the animal, to obviate that tendency, is led to take vegetable food, as more suited to its strength of assimilation.\n\nDr Cullen observes, that milk is suited to almost all temperaments; and it is even so to stomachs disposed to aceticity, more than those substances which have undergone the venous fermentation; nay, it even cures the heartburn, checks venous fermentation, and precipitates the lees, when, by renewal of fermentation, the wine happens to be fouled. It therefore very properly accompanies a great deal of vegetable aliment; although sometimes its aceticity is troublesome, either from a large proportion taken in, or from the degree of it; for, according to certain unaccountable circumstances, different acids are formed in the stomach in different states of the body; in a healthy body, e.g., a mild one; in the hypochondriac disease sometimes, one of a very acid quality. When the acidity of milk is carried to a great degree, it may prove remarkably refrigerant, and occasion cold crudities, and the recurrence of intermittent fevers. To take the common notion of its passing unchanged into the blood, it can suffer no solution. But if we admit its coagulum in the stomach, then it may be reckoned among soluble or insoluble foods, according as that coagulum is more or less tenacious. Formerly rennet, which is employed to coagulate milk, was thought an acid; but, from late observations, it appears, that, if it be an acid, it is very different from other acids, and that its coagulum is stronger than that produced by acids. It has been imagined, that a rennet is to be found in the stomachs of all animals, which causes coagulation of milk; but according to Dr Cullen the coagulation of milk seems to be owing to a weak acid in the stomach, the relics of our vegetable food, inducing, in healthy persons, a weak and soluble coagulum; but in different stomachs this may be very different, in these becoming heavy and less soluble food, and sometimes even evacuated in a coagulated undissolved state both by stomach and stool.\n\nAs milk is acetic, it may be rendered sometimes purgative by mixing with the bile; and some examples of this have been remarked. More commonly, however, it is reckoned among those foods which occasion coition.\n\nHoffman, in his experiments on milk, found that all kinds of it contained much water; and when this was distilled, found the residues very different in their solubility. But we must not thence conclude, that the same insolubility takes place in the stomach; for extracts made from vegetables with water are often very insoluble substances, and hardly diffusible through water itself; therefore, in Hoffman's extracts, if we may so call them, of milk, somewhat of the same kind might have appeared; and these substances, which in their natural state were not so, might appear very insoluble. However, we may allow that milk is always somehow insoluble in the intestines, as it is of a drying nature, and as cheese, &c. is very coitive. And this effect shows that milk is always coagulated in the stomach; for if it remained fluid, no feces would be produced, whereas sometimes very hard ones are observed. In the blood vessels, from its animal nature, it may be considered as nutritious; but when we consider its vegetable contents, and aceticity in the prime view, we find that, like animal food, it does not excite that degree of fever in the time of digestion, and that from its aceticity it will resist putrefaction. Hence its use in hectic fevers, which, whatever be their cause, appear\nappear only to be exacerbations of natural feverish paroxysms, which occur twice every day, commonly after meals, and at night. To obviate these, therefore, we give such an aliment as produces the least exacerbation of these fevers; and of this nature is milk, on account of its acidulent vegetable nature.\n\nThere appears also somewhat peculiar to milk, which requires only a small exertion of the animal powers in order to its assimilation; and besides, in hectic complaints there is wanted an oily, bland food, approaching to the animal nature; so that on all these accounts milk is a diet peculiarly adapted to them, and, in general, to most convalescents, and to those of inflammatory temperaments. So far of milk in general. We shall now speak of the particular kinds which are in common use.\n\nThe milks of women, mares, and asses, agree very much in their qualities, being very dilute, having little solid contents, and, when evaporated to dryness, having these very soluble, containing much saccharine matter, of a very ready acidulence, and, when coagulated, their coagulum being tender and easily broken down. From this view they have less oil, and seem to have less coagulable matter than the rest.\n\nThe milks of cows, sheep, and goats, agree in opposite qualities to the three just mentioned; but here there is somewhat more of gradation. Cows' milk comes nearest to the former milk: goats' milk is less fluid, less sweet, less glutinous, has the largest proportion of insoluble part after coagulation, and indeed the largest proportion of coagulable part; its oily and coagulable parts are not spontaneously separable, never throwing out a cream, or allowing butter to be readily extracted from it. Hence the virtues of these milks are obvious, being more nourishing, though at the same time less easily soluble in weak stomachs, than the three first, less acidulent than thefe, and so more rarely laxative, and peculiarly fitted for the diet of convalescents without fever. The three first again are less nourishing, more soluble, more laxative, as more acidulent, and adapted to the convalescents with fever.\n\nThese qualities, in particular milks, are considerably diversified by different circumstances. First, Different animals, living on the same diet, give a considerably different milk; for there seems to be something in the constitution, abstracting from the aliment, which constitutes a considerable diversity of milk, not only in the same species of animals, but also in the same animal, at different ages, and at different distances after delivery: this applies to the choice of nurses. Secondly, Milk follows the nature of the aliment more than any other juice in the human body, being more or less fluid and dilute, more or less solid and nourishing, in proportion as these qualities are more or less in the aliment. The nature of the aliment differs according to its time of growth, e.g., old grazes being always found more nourishing than young. Aliment, too, is always varied according to the season, as that is warm or dry, moist or cloudy.\n\nThe milk of each particular kind of animal is fitter for particular purposes, when fed on proper food. Thus the cow delights in the succulent herbage of the vale: if the sheep be fed there he certainly rots, but on the higher and more dry side of the mountain he feeds pleasantly and healthy; while the goat never flops near the bottom, but ascends to the craggy summit; and certainly the milks of these animals are always best on their proper soil, and that of goats is best on a mountainous country. From a dissertation of Linnaeus, we have many observations concerning the diversity of plants on which each animal chooses to feed. All the Swedish plants which could be collected together, were presented alternately to domestic animals, and then it appeared that the goat lived on the greatest variety, and even on many which were poisonous to the rest; that the cow chose the first succulent shoots of the plant, and neglected the fructification; which last was preferred by the goat. Hence may be deduced rules concerning the pasturage of different animals; e.g., Farmers find, that, in a pasture which was only fit to feed a certain number of sheep, an equal number of goats may be introduced, while the sheep are no less nourished than before.\n\nIt is not easy to assign the difference between milk fresh drawn and that detained in the open air for some time: but certainly there is some material one, otherwise nature universally would not have directed infants to sucking; and indeed it seems, better than the other, fitted for digestion and nourishment. Physicians have supposed that this depended on the evaporation of some sputum: but our author cannot conceive any such, except common water here; and besides, these volatile parts can hardly be nutritious. A more plausible account seems deducible from mixture: milk new drawn has been but lately mixed, and is exposed to spontaneous separation, a circumstance hurtful to digestion; none of the parts being, by themselves, so easily assimilated as when they are all taken together. Hence, then, milk new drawn is more intimately blended, and therefore then is most proper to the weakly and infants.\n\nAnother difference in the use of milk exposed for some time to the air, is taking it boiled or unboiled. Physicians have generally recommended the former; but the reason is not easily assigned. Perhaps it is this: Milk kept for some time exposed to the air has gone so far to a spontaneous separation; whereas the heat thoroughly blends the whole, and hence its solution is not so easy in the stomach; and thus boiled milk is more cohesive than raw, and gives more faeces. Again, When milk is boiled, a considerable quantity of air is detached, as appears from the froth on the surface; and air is the chief instrument of fermentation in bodies; so that after this process it is not liable to acidulence: for these reasons it is proper for the robust and vigorous.\n\nAnother difference of milk is, according as it is fluid or coagulated. The coagulated is of two kinds, as induced by rennet, or the natural acidulence of the milk. The former preparation makes the firmer and less easily soluble coagulum; though, when taken with the whey unseparated, it is less difficult of solution, though more so than any other coagulum in the same case. Many nations use the latter form, which is easier soluble, but very much acidulent, and therefore, in point of solution, should be confined to the vigorous, in point of acidulence, to those who like an acidulent food; and in the last case, the Laplanders use it as their chief acidulent.\nMilk.\n\nMilkecent condiment. From the same considerations it is more cooling, and in its other effects like all other milkecent vegetables.\n\nMilk by evaporation yields a sweet saline matter, of which Dr Lewis gives the following proportion:\n\n| Twelve ounces of | Left of dry matter | From which water extracted a sweet saline substance amounting to |\n|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cows milk       | 13 drachms         | 1½ drachms                                                   |\n| Goats milk      | 12½                | 1½                                                          |\n| Human milk      | 8                  | 6                                                            |\n| Asses milk      | 8                  | 6                                                            |\n\nThe saline substance extracted from asses milk was white, and sweet as sugar; those of the others brown or yellow, and considerably less sweet; so that cows milk had the least sweetness of any.\n\nOn distilling 12 quarts of milk in balneo mariae, at least nine quarts of pure phlegm were obtained; the liquor which afterwards arose was acidulous, and by degrees grew feebly more and more acid as the distillation was continued. After this came over a little spirit, and at last, an empyreumatic oil. The remaining solid matter adhered to the bottom of the retort, in the form of elegant shining black flowers, which being calcined and eluated yielded a portion of fixed alkaline salt.\n\nMilk set in a warm place, throws up to the surface an unctuous cream, from which, by agitation, the butter is easily separated. The addition of alkaline salts prevents this separation, not (as some have supposed) by absorbing an acid from the milk, but by virtue of their property of intimately uniting oily bodies with watery liquors. Sugar, another grand intermediate between oils and water, has this effect in a greater degree, though that concrete is by no means alkaline, or an absorbent of acids.\n\nThe sweet saccharine part of the milk remains dissolved in the whey after the separation of the curd or cheesy matter, and may be collected from it in a white crystalline form, by boiling the whey till all remains of the curdled substance have fallen to the bottom; then filtering, evaporating it to a due consistence, letting it to shoot, and purifying the crystals by solution in water and a second crystallization. Much has been said of the medicinal virtues of this sugar of milk, but it does not seem to have any considerable ones; it is from cows milk that it has been generally prepared; and the crystals obtained from this kind of milk have but little sweetness.\n\nWhen milk is suffered to coagulate spontaneously, the whey proves acid, and on standing grows more and more so till the putrefactive state commences. Sour whey is used as an acid, preferably to the directly vegetable or the mineral acids, in some of the chemical arts; as for dissolving iron in order to the staining of linen and leather. This acid was commonly made use of in the bleaching of linen, for dissolving and extracting the earthy particles left in the cloth by the alkaline salts and lime employed for cleansing and whitening it. Butter milk is preferred to plain sour milk or four whey: This last is supposed to give the cloth a yellow colour. Dr Home, in his ingenious treatise on this subject, recommends water acidulated with sulphuric acid (in the proportion of about half an ounce, or at most three quarters of an ounce, to a gallon), as preferable in many respects to the acid of milk, or of the more directly vegetable substances.\n\nHe observes, that the latter are often difficulty procurable, abound with oleaginous particles, and haleen to corruption; whilst the vitriolic acid is cheap, and pure, and disposed to putrefy: That milk takes five days to perform its office, whilst the vitriolic acid does it in as many hours, perhaps in as many minutes: That this acid contributes also to whiten the cloth, and does not make it weaker though the cloth be kept in it for months. He finds, that acids as well as alkalies, extract an oily matter from the cloth, and lose their acidity and alkalinity. Since this treatise appeared, the use of four milk is very generally superseded by oil of vitriol.\n\nIt is observable, that asses milk is greatly disposed, on standing for a little time, to become thick and ropy. In the Bredlaw collection for the year 1729, there is a remarkable account of milk (which probably was that of the ass) grown so thick and tenacious as to be drawn out into long strings, which, when dried, were quite brittle.\n\nNew cows milk, suffered to stand for some days on the leaves of butterwort or sun-dew, becomes uniformly thick, slippery, and coherent, and of an agreeable sweet taste, without any separation of its parts. Fresh milk, added to this, is thickened in the same manner, and this successively. In some parts of Sweden, as we are informed in the Swedish Memoirs, milk is thus prepared for food.\n\nNew milk has a degree of glutinous quality, so as to be used for joining broken stone ware. There is a far greater tenacity in cheese properly prepared.\n\nMilk, when examined by a microscope, appears composed of numerous globules swimming in a transparent fluid. It boils in nearly the same degree of heat with common water; some sorts rather sooner, and some a little later: after boiling, it is less disposed to grow sour than in its natural state. It is coagulated by acids both mineral and vegetable, and by alkalies both fixed and volatile. The coagulum made by acids falls to the bottom of the serum; that made by alkalies swims on the surface, commonly forming (especially with volatile alkalies) a thick coriaceous skin. The serum, with alkalies, proves green or fainous; with acids, it differs little in appearance from the whey that separates spontaneously. The coagulum formed by acids is dissolved by alkalies, and that formed by alkalies is redissolved by acids; but the milk does not in either case resume its original properties. It is coagulated by most of the middle salts, whose basis is an earth or a metallic body; as solution of alum, fixed sal ammoniac, sugar of lead, green and blue vitriol; but not by the chalybeate or purging mineral waters, nor by the bitter salt extracted from the purging waters. Among the neutral salts that have been tried, there is not one that produces any coagulation. They all dilute the milk, and make it less disposed to coagulate with acids or alkalies: Nitre seems to have this effect in a greater degree than the other neutral salts. It is instantly coagulated by highly rectified\nMilk rectified spirit of wine, but scarcely by a phlegmatic spirit. It does not mingle with expressed oils. All the coagula are diffused by gall.\n\nIt has generally been supposed by medical authors, that the milk of animals is of the same nature with chyle, and that the human milk always coagulates in the stomach of infants; but in a late dissertation upon the subject by Mr Clarke, member of the Royal Irish Academy, we find both these positions controverted. According to him, women's milk, in a healthy state, contains no coagulable, mucilaginous, or cheesy principle, in its composition; or it contains so little, that it cannot admit of any sensible proof. Dr Rutty states, that it does not afford even a fifth part of the curd which is yielded by cows' milk; and Dr Young denies that it is at all coagulable either by rennets or acids. This is confirmed by Dr Ferris, who in 1782 gained the Harveian prize medal at Edinburgh by a dissertation upon milk. Mr Clarke informs us, that he has made a vast number of experiments upon women's milk with a view to determine this point. He made use of ardent spirits, all the different acids, infusions of infants' stomachs, and procured the milk of a great many different women; but in no instance, excepting one or two, did he perceive anything like curd. This took place in consequence of a spontaneous acetylation; and only a small quantity of soft flaky matter was formed, which floated in the serum. This he looked upon to be a morbid appearance.\n\nThe general opinion that women's milk is coagulable has arisen from a single circumstance, viz., that infants frequently vomit the milk they suck in a state of apparent coagulation. This greatly perplexed Dr Young; who, after having tried in vain to coagulate human milk artificially, concluded, that the process took place spontaneously in the stomach; and that it would always do so if the milk were allowed to remain in a degree of heat equal to about 96 degrees of Fahrenheit. Mr Clarke took equal quantities of three different kinds of milk, and put them into bottles slightly corked, and these bottles into water, the temperature of which was kept up by a spirit of wine lamp as near as possible to 96° of Fahrenheit: but after frequently examining each bottle during the course of the experiment, at the expiration of several hours there was not the smallest tendency towards coagulation to be perceived in any of them; the cream was only thrown to the surface in a thick and adhesive form, and entirely separated from the fluid below, which had something of a gray and wheyish appearance. As the matter vomited by infants is sometimes more adhesive than we can suppose cream to be, Mr Clarke supposed that the curd might be so entangled with the cream, as to be with difficulty separated from it; but having collected a quantity of rich cream from the milk of different women, he repeated the experiment with precisely the same event, not being able in any one instance to produce the smallest quantity of curd. To determine, however, what effects might be produced upon milk by the stomach of an infant, Mr Clarke made the following experiment: Having taken out the stomach of a fetus which had been deprived of life by the use of instruments, he infused it in a small quantity of hot water, so as to make a strong infusion. He added a tea-spoonful of this infusion to equal quantities of cows and human milk; the consequence of which was, that the cow's milk was firmly coagulated in a short time, but the human milk was not altered in the least; neither was the least coagulation produced by adding a second and third spoonful to the human milk. \"Upon the whole, then, (says Mr Clarke), I am persuaded it will be found, that human milk, in a healthy state, contains little or no curd, and that the general opinion of its nature and properties is founded upon fallacious analogy and superficial observations made on the matter vomited by infants. We may presume, that the cream of women's milk, by its inferior specific gravity, will float on the surface of the contents of the stomach; and being of an oily nature, that it will be of more difficult digestion than any other constituent part of milk. When an infant then sucks very plentifully, so as to over-fill the stomach, or labours under any weakness in the powers of digestion, it cannot appear unreasonable to suppose, that the cream shall be first rejected by vomiting. Analogous to this, we know that adults affected with dyspepsia often bring up greasy fluids from the stomach by eructation, and this especially after eating fat meat. We have, in some instances, known this to blaze when thrown into the fire like spirit of wine or oil.\"\n\nOur author derives a confirmation of his opinion from the following observation, viz., that curds vomited by infants of a few days old are yellow, while they become white in a fortnight or three weeks. This he accounts for from the yellow colour of the cream thrown up by the milk of women during the first four or five days after delivery.\n\nMr Clarke likewise contends that common opinion of the human milk being so prone to acidity, that a great number of the diseases of children are to be accounted for from that principle. \"Whoever (says he) takes the trouble of attentively comparing human milk with that of ruminant animals, will soon find it to be much less prone to run into the acetic acid process. I have very often exposed equal quantities of human and cows' milk in degrees of temperature, varying from the common summer heat, or 65°, to 100°; and I have constantly found that cows' milk acquires a greater degree of acidity in 36 hours than the human did in many days: cows' milk becomes offensively putrid in four or five days; a change which healthy human milk, exposed in the same manner, will not undergo in many weeks, nay, sometimes in many months. I once kept a few ounces of a nurse's milk, delivered about six or seven days, for more than two years in a bottle moderately corked. It stood on the chimney-piece, and was frequently opened to be examined. At the end of this period it showed evident marks of moderate acidity, whether examined by the taste, smell, or paper stained with vegetable blues or purples; the latter it changed to a florid red colour, whereas cows' milk kept a few days changed the colour of the same paper to a green, thereby clearly showing its putrefactive tendency.\"\n\nOur author next goes on to consider of the probability there is of milk becoming so frequently and strongly acid as to occasion most of the diseases of infants. He begins with an attempt to show that the phenomena commonly looked upon to be indications of acrimony are by no means certain. Curdled milk...\nhas already been shown to be no sign of acidity; and\nthe other appearance, which has commonly been\nthought to be so certain, viz. green faeces, is, in the\nopinion of Mr Clarke, equally fallacious. In support\nof this he quotes a letter from Dr Sydenham to Dr\nCole; in which he says, that the green matter vomited\nby hysterical women is not any proof of acid humours\nbeing the cause of that disease, for few sick people do\nthe same. The opinion of green faeces being an effect\nof acidity, proceeds upon the supposition that a mixture\nof bile with an acid produces a green colour; but it is\nfound, that the vegetable acid, which only can exist in\nthe human body, is unable to produce this change of co-\nlour, though it can be effected by the strong mineral\nacids. As nothing equivalent to any of these acids can\nbe supposed to exist in the bowels of infants, we must\ntherefore take some other method of accounting for the\ngreen faeces frequently evacuated by them. \"Why\nshould four milk, granting its existence, give rise to\nthem in infants and not in adults? Have butter milk,\nsummer fruits of the most acetic kind, lemon or orange\njuice, always this effect in adults by their admixture with\nbile? This is a question which, I believe, cannot be\nanswered in the affirmative.\"\n\nOn the whole, Dr Clarke considers the disease of aci-\ndity in the bowels, though so frequently mentioned, to\nbe by no means common. He owns indeed, that it\nmay sometimes occur in infancy as well as in adults,\nfrom weakness of the stomach, colic, or improper\nfood; and an indubitable evidence is afforded by faeces\nwhich stain the blue or purple colour of vegetables to a\nred, though nothing can be inferred with certainty from\nthe colour or smell.\n\nThe doctor next proceeds to state several reasons\nfor his opinion, that the greater number of infantile\ndiseases are not owing to acidity; 1. Women's milk\nin a healthy state contains little or no coagulable\nmatter or curd. 2. It shows less tendency out of the\nbody to become acetic than many other kinds of\nmilk. 3. The appearances which have been generally\nsupposed to characterize its acidity do not afford satis-\nfactory evidence of such a morbid cause. 4. Granting\nthis to be the case, we have plenty of mild absorbents,\ncapable of destroying all the acid which can be suppos-\ned to be generated in the bowels of an infant; yet\nmany children are observed to die in consequence of\nthese diseases supposed to arise from acidity. 5. Though\nthe milk of all ruminant animals is of a much more\nacetic nature than that of the human species, yet\nthe young of these animals never suffer anything like\nthe diseases attributed to acidity in infants. 6. His-\ntory informs us that whole nations use sour curdled\nmilk as a considerable part of their food, without feel-\ning any inconvenience, which, however, must have\nbeen the case, if acidity in the stomach were pro-\nductive of such deleterious effect as has been sup-\nposed.\n\nThe reasoning of Dr Clarke seems here to be very\nplausible, and nothing has as yet been offered to con-\ntradict it. The reviewers in taking notice of the trea-\ntise only observe, that the doctor's positions are sup-\nported by great probability; yet \"they have seen\nthem, or think they have seen them, contradicted by\nthe appearance of diseases and the effects of medi-\ncines;\" so that they must leave the subject to farther\nexamination.\n\nIn a memoir by Messrs Parmentier and Deyeux,\nmembers of the royal college of pharmacy, &c., in Pa-\nris, we have a great number of experiments on the\nmilk of asses, cows, goats, sheep, and mares, as well\nas women. The experiments on cows milk, were made\nwith a view to determine whether any change was\nmade in the milk by the different kinds of food eaten\nby the animal. For this purpose some were fed with\nthe leaves of maize or Turkey wheat; some with cab-\nbage; others with small potatoes; and others with\ncommon grass. The milk of those fed with the maize\nor Turkey wheat was extremely sweet; that from the\npotatoes and common grass much more ferous and in-\nfusible; and that from the cabbages the most disagreeable\nof all. By distillation only eight ounces of a colour-\nless fluid were obtained from as many pounds of each\nof these milks; which from those who fed upon grass\nhad an aromatic flavour; a disagreeable one from cab-\nbage; and none at all from the potatoes and Turkey\nwheat. This liquid became fetid in the space of a\nmonth, whatever substance the animal had been fed\nwith, acquiring at the same time a viscidity and be-\ncoming turbid; that from cabbage generally, but not al-\nways, becoming first putrid. All of them separated a\nfilamentous matter, and became clear on being exposed\nto the heat of 25° of Reaumur's thermometer. In the\nresidues of the distillation no difference whatever\ncould be perceived. As the only difference therefore\nexisting in cows milk lies in the volatile part, our au-\nthors conclude, that it is improper to boil milk either\nfor common or medicinal purposes. They observed al-\nso that any sudden change of food, even from a worse\nto a better kind was attended by a very remarkable di-\nminution in the quantity of milk. All the residues\nof the distillations yielded, in a strong fire, a yellow oil\nand acid, a thick and black empyreumatic oil, a volatile\nalkali, and towards the end a quantity of inflammable\nair, and at last a coal remained containing some fixed\nalkali with muriatic acid.\n\nOn agitating in long bottles the creams from the milk\nof cows fed with different substances, all of them were\nformed into a kind of half-made butter; of which that\nformed from the milk from maize was white, firm,\nand infusible; that from potatoes was softer and more\npinguedinous; but that from common grass was the\nbest of all. Cabbage, as in other cases, gave a strong\ntaste.\n\nIn the course of their experiments, it was endeavoured\nto determine whether butter is actually contained in\nthe cream, or whether it be a chemical production of\nthe operation of churning. They could not find any\nreason absolutely satisfactory on either side, but incline\nto the latter opinion; because when cream is allowed to\nremain among the milk, and the whole curdled promi-\nnently, only fat cheese, without any butter, is pro-\nduced. The oily parts cannot be separated into butter ei-\nther by acids or any other means than churning; even\nthe artificial mixture of oil with the cream is insufficient\nfor the purpose.\n\nThe serum of milk was reduced by filtration to a\nclear and pellucid liquor; and, by mixture with fixed\nalkali, deposited a portion of cheesy matter which had\nbeen dissolved in the whey. The sugar of milk was also found in this liquor.\n\nIn their experiments upon the milk of various animals, it was found that the milk of asses yielded by distillation an infipid liquor, and deposited a liquor similar to the lymph of cows milk. It is coagulated by all the acids, but not into an uniform mass; exhibiting only the appearance of distinct flocculi. It affords but little cream, which is converted with difficulty into a soft butter that soon becomes rancid. It has but a small quantity of saccharine particles, and these are often mixed with muriatic selenite and common salt. Goats milk has a thick cream, and agreeable to the taste; and the milk itself may be preserved longer in a sound state than any other species, the scum on its surface being naturally convertible into palatable cheese. It is easily made into firm butter, which does not soon become rancid, and has a good flavour. The butter milk contains a large quantity of cheesy matter, which readily coagulates; but has still less saccharine matter than that of asses. Sheep's milk can scarcely be distinguished from that of a cow, and easily parts with its cream by standing. It is of a yellow colour, an agreeable flavour, and yields a great proportion of butter; but this is not solid, and soon becomes rancid. Mares milk is the most infipid and least nutritious of any; notwithstanding which it has been much recommended for weak and consumptive patients: in which cases it is probable that it proves efficacious by being more consonant than any other to the debilitated powers of digestion. It boils with a smaller fire than any other kind of milk, is easily coagulated, and the distilled water does not soon change its nature. It has but a small quantity of cheesy matter, and very few oily particles; the cream cannot be made into butter; and the whey contains about as much sugar as cows or goats milk.\n\nIn this memoir our authors remark, that in order to augment the quantity, as well as to improve the quality, of the milk of animals, they should be well fed, their tails kept clean, and their litter frequently renewed: they should be milked at stated hours, but not drained: great attention should also be paid to the breed; because inferior cattle are maintained at as great expense as the most valuable kinds. No change ought to be made in the food; though if the milk be employed for medicinal purposes, it may be improved by a proper mixture of herbs, &c.\n\nIn their experiments on women's milk, Messrs Parentier and Deyeux differ somewhat from Dr Clarke. They first tried the milk of a woman who had been delivered four months; and observed, that after the cream had been separated the other part appeared of a more perfect white, and that it could not be coagulated either by vinegar or mineral acids; which they attributed to a superabundance of serum. But they found that in proportion to the age of the milk it was found to be more easily coagulable; and this was confirmed by experiments made upon the milk of 20 nurses. Its coagulability was not increased by heat. The cream, by agitation, formed a viscid unctuous matter, but could not be changed into perfect butter; but they found that it was extremely difficult to determine the proportions of the various component parts in human milk, as it differs remarkably, not only in different subjects, but in the same subject at different times. In a nurse aged about 32 years, who was extremely subject to nervous affections, the milk was one day found almost quite colourless and transparent. In two hours after, a second quantity drawn from the breast was viscid like the white of an egg. It became whiter in a short time, but did not recover its natural colour before the evening. It was afterwards found that these changes were occasioned by her having some violent hysterical fits in the meantime.\n\nSugar of Milk. Different methods have been proposed for obtaining the sugar of milk. The following is an account of a method used by some of the Tartar nations of preserving their milk by means of frost: in which operation great quantities of the sugar of milk are accidentally formed. The account was given by Mr Fabrig of Peterburgh, who undertook a journey, by order of the academy of Peterburgh, among the Mogul tribes who inhabit the country beyond the lake Baikal, on the banks of the river Salenga. These people allow their milk to freeze in large quantity in iron kettles; and, when it is perfectly congealed, they place them over a gentle fire to soften the edges of the cake, after which it may be taken out with a wooden spatula. They commence these operations at the beginning of the cold, when they have milk in the greatest abundance; after which it may be preserved with great ease throughout the whole winter. Mr Fabrig having frequent opportunities of seeing these cakes, soon observed, that the surface of them was covered to a considerable depth with a farinaceous powder; and having established a dairy upon the same plan with those of the Moguls, he found the same thing take place with himself. This powder was extremely sweet, and he received platefuls of it from the natives, who used it in their food, and sweetened their other viands with it. Having caused a number of cakes of frozen milk to be conveyed to the top of his house, where they were directly exposed to the violent cold, he found that the separation of the saccharine powder was greatly promoted by this means. He scraped the cakes every week to the depth of two inches, and afterwards spread out the powder upon an earthen plate in order to destroy the remains of moisture which might have prevented it from keeping for any length of time. When exposed in this manner it had a very agreeable and strong saccharine taste; dissolved in warm water; and when strongly stirred by means of a chocolate stick, would at all times produce an excellent and well tasted milk. Raw milk affords a much larger quantity of this saccharine matter than such as has been boiled, or which has had the cream taken off it. Neither must the milk be suddenly exposed to the cold before it has lost its natural heat; for the sudden contact of the cold drives all the cheesy and fat part towards the middle, while the external parts consist of little else than water. In order to allow the parts of the milk to be all properly mixed together, Mr Fabrig allowed the milk when newly taken from the cows to cool, and then poured it out into shallow kettles.\n\nOur author is of opinion that this method of making milk would be of great service to navigators to supply themselves with milk during long sea voyages: and\nMilk. He affirms us, from his own experience, that it will always succeed, if proper attention be paid to it. He is of opinion, however, that all countries are not equally proper for the preparation of this saccharine matter; and indeed this seems very evidently to be the case, as the process appears to be a crystallization of the saccharine parts of the milk, and a separation of them from the aqueous ones by means of extreme cold. The country in which he made the experiments is one of the most elevated in all Asia; and so cold, that, though it lies only in the 50th degree of north latitude, its rivers are frozen up for six months of the year. A very dry cold wind also prevails throughout almost the whole year; and the dry winds generally come from the north, being almost always preceded by a warm wind from the south, which blows for some time. The dry rarefied air increases the evaporation from the ice cakes, and leaves nothing but the saccharine or pure constituent parts of the milk, which with the addition of water can always recompose the fluid.\n\nMilk, in the wine trade. The coopers know very well the use of skimmed milk, which makes an innocent and efficacious forcing for the fining down of all white wines, arracks, and small spirits; but is by no means to be used for red wines, because it discharges their colour. Thus, if a few quarts of well skimmed milk be put into a hogshead of red wine, it will soon precipitate the greater part of the colour, and leave the whole nearly white; and this is of known use in the turning of red wines, when pricked, into white; in which a small degree of acidity is not so much perceived.\n\nMilk is, from this quality of discharging colour from wines, of use also to the wine coopers, for the whitening of wines that have acquired a brown colour from the cask, or from having been hastily boiled before fermenting; for the addition of a little skimmed milk, in these cases, precipitates the brown colour, and leaves the wines almost limpid, or of what they call a water whiteness, which is much coveted abroad in wines as well as in brandies.\n\nMilk of Lime; Milk of Sulphur. The name of milk is given to substances very different from milk properly so called, and which resemble milk only in colour. Such is water in which quicklime has been flaked, which acquires a whiteness from the small particles of the lime being suspended in it, and has hence been called the milk of lime. Such also is the solution of liver of sulphur, when an acid is mixed with it, by which white particles of sulphur are made to float in the liquor.\n\nMilk of Vegetables. For the same reason that milk of animals may be considered as a true animal emulsion, the emulsive liquors of vegetables may be called vegetable milks. Accordingly emulsions made with almonds are commonly called milk of almonds. But besides this vegetable milk, which is in some measure artificial, many plants and trees contain naturally a large quantity of emulsive or milky juices. Such are lettuce, spurge, fig tree, and the tree which furnishes the elastic American resin. The milky juices obtained from all these vegetables derive their whiteness from an oily matter, mixed and undissolved in a watery or mucilaginous liquor. Most resinous gums were originally such milky juices, which afterwards become solid by milky way, the evaporation of their more fluid and volatile parts.\n\nMilk Fever. See Medicine Index.\n\nMilk Hedge, the English name of a shrub growing on the coast of Coromandel, where it is used for hedging. The whole shrub grows very bushy, with numerous erect branches, which are composed of cylindrical joints as thick as a tobacco pipe, of a green colour, and from three to five inches long: the joints are thicker than the other parts, but always give way first on any accidental violence offered to the plant. When broken it yields a milk of an excessively caustic quality, which blister any part of the skin it touches. When the joints are broken off at each end, the tube then contains but very little milk. In this state Mr Ives ventured to touch it with his tongue, and found it a little sweet. In the hedges it is seldom very woody; but when it is, the wood is very solid, and the bark gray and cracked. This plant, he informs us, has acquired great reputation in curing the venereal disease, on the following account: A poor Portuguese woman, the eldest female of her family, had wrought surprising cures in the most intractable venereal disorders, even such as the European physicians had pronounced incurable. These facts became so notorious, that the servants of the Company, and especially their surgeons, were induced to offer her a very considerable premium for a discovery of the medicine; but she always refused to comply, giving for a reason, that while it remained a secret, it was a certain provision for the maintenance of the family in the present as well as in future generations. On account of this denial the English surgeons were sometimes at the pains to have her motions without doors carefully watched; and as they were not able to discover that she ever gathered of any other plant or tree but this, they conjectured that the milk of this tree was the specific employed. Mr Ives inquired at the black doctors concerning the virtues of this plant; who all agreed, that it will cure the lues venerea, but differed as to the manner of administering it; some saying that a joint of it should be eaten every morning; others that the milk only should be dropped upon sugar; and then put into milk, oil, &c., and given daily to the patient.\n\nMilk Way. See Astronomy Index.\n\nMill, a machine for grinding corn, &c., of which there are various kinds, according to the different methods of applying the moving power; as water-mills, wind-mills, mills worked by horses, &c. See Mechanics Index.\n\nThe first obvious method of reducing corn into flour for bread would be by the simple expedient of pounding. And that was for ages the only one which was practised by the various descendants of Adam, and actually continued in use among the Romans below the reign of Vespasian. But the process was very early improved by the application of a grinding power, and the introduction of millstones. This, like most of the common refinements in domestic life, was probably the invention of the antediluvian world, and certainly practised in some of the earliest ages after it; and, like most of them, it was equally known in the east and west. Hence the Gauls and Britons appear familiarly acquainted with the use of hand-mills before the time of their submission to the Romans; the Britons particularly\nlarly distinguishing them, as the Highlanders and we distinguish them at present, by the simple appellations of querns, corners, or stones. And to these Romans added the very useful invention of water mills. For this discovery the world is pretty certainly indebted to the genius of Italy; and the machine was not uncommon in the country at the conquest of Lancashire. This, therefore, the Romans would necessarily introduce with their many other refinements among us.\n\nAnd that they actually did, the British appellation of a water-mill fully suggests itself; the melin of the Welsh and Cornish, the mull, meil, and melin of the Armoricans, and the Irish molcan and molcinn, being all evidently derived from the Roman mola and molendinum. The subject Britons universally adopted the Roman name, but applied it, as we their successors do, only to the Roman mill; and one of these was probably erected at every stationary city in the kingdom.\n\nOne plainly was at Manchester, serving equally the purposes of the town and the accommodation of the garrison.—And one alone would be sufficient, as the use of handmills remained very common in both, many having been found about the site of the station particularly; and the general practice having defended among us nearly to the present period. Such it would be peculiarly necessary to have in the camp, that the garrison might be provided against a siege. And the water-mill at Manchester was fixed immediately below the Castlefield and the town, and on the channel of the Medlock. There, a little above the ancient ford, the sluice of it was accidentally discovered about 30 years ago. On the margin of Dyer's croft, and opposite to some new constructions, the current of the river, accidentally swelled with the rains, and obstructed by a dam, broke down the northern bank, swept away a large oak upon the edge of it, and disclosed a long tunnel in the rock below. This has been since laid open in part with a spade. It appeared entirely uncovered at the top, was about a yard in width, and another in depth, but gradually narrowed to the bottom. The sides showed everywhere the marks of the tool on the rock, and the course of it was parallel with the channel. It was barred by the flood about 25 yards only in length, but was evidently continued for several further; having originally begun, as the nature of the ground evinces, just above the large curve in the channel of the Medlock.\n\nFor the first five or six centuries of the Roman state, there were no public bread bakers in the city of Rome. They were first introduced into it from the east, at the conclusion of the war with Perseus, and about the year 167 before Christ. And, towards the close of the first century, the Roman families were supplied by them every morning with fresh loaves for breakfast.—But the same custom, which prevailed originally among the Romans and many other nations, has continued nearly to the present time among the Mancuniens. The providing of bread for every family was left entirely to the attention of the women in it; and it was baked upon stones, which the Welsh denominate greidiols and we griddles. It appears, however, from the kiln-burnt pottery which has been discovered in the British sepulchres, and from the British appellation of an odyne or oven remaining among us at present, that furnaces for baking were generally known among the original Britons. An odyne would, therefore, be erected at the mansion of each British baron, for the use of himself and his retainers. And, when he and they removed into the vicinity of a Roman station, the oven would be rebuilt with the mansion, and the public bakehouses of our towns commence at the first foundation of them. One bakehouse would be constructed, as we have previously shown one mill to have been set up, for the public service of all the Mancunian families.\n\nOne oven and one mill appear to have been equally established in the town. And the inhabitants of it appear immemorially accustomed to bake at the one and grind at the other. Both, therefore, were in all probability constructed at the first introduction of water-mills and ovens into the country. The great similarity of the appointments refers the consideration directly to one and the same origin for them. And the general nature of all such institutions points immediately to the first and actual introduction of both. And, as the same establishments prevailed equally in other parts of the north, and pretty certainly obtained over all the extent of Roman Britain, the same erections were as certainly made at every stationary town in the kingdom.\n\nMILL, JOHN, a very learned divine, was born at Shap in Westmorland, about the year 1645; and became a servitor of Queen's college, Oxford. On his entering into orders he became an eminent preacher, and was made prebendary of Exeter. In 1681, he was created doctor of divinity; about the same time he was made chaplain in ordinary to King Charles II. and in 1683, he was elected principal of St Edmund's hall in Oxford. His edition of the Greek Testament, which will ever render his name memorable, was published about a fortnight before his death, which happened in June 1707. Dr Mills was employed 30 years in preparing this edition.\n\nMILLSTONE, the stone by which corn is ground.—The millstones which we find preserved from ancient times are all small, and very different from those in use at present. Thoreby mentions two or three such found in England, among other Roman antiquities, which were but 20 inches broad; and there is great reason to believe that the Romans, as well as the Egyptians of old, and the ancient Jews, did not employ horses, or wind, or water, as we do, to turn their mills, but made their slaves and captives of war do this laborious work: they were in this service placed behind these millstones, and pushed them on with all their force. Sampson, when a prisoner to the Philistines, was treated no better, but was condemned to the millstone in his prison. The runner or loose millstone, in this sort of grinding, was usually very heavy for its size, being as thick as broad. This is the millstone which is expressly prohibited in Scripture to take in pledge, as lying loose it was more easily removed. The Talmudists have a story, that the Chaldeans made the young men of the captivity carry millstones with them to Babylon, where there seems to have been a scarcity at that time; and hence, probably, their paraphrase renders the text \"have borne the mills or millstones?\" which might thus be true in a literal sense. They have also a proverbial expression of a man with a millstone about his neck; which they use to express a man under the severest weight.\nweight of affliction. This also plainly refers to this small sort of stones.\n\n**Millstone**, a stone which has been clasped among volcanic products, on account of its appearance, which is a blackish gray, porous, and very much resembling a lava of Mount Vesuvius.\n\n**Millenarians**, or **Chiliasts**, a name given to those in the primitive ages, who believed that the saints will reign on earth with Christ 1000 years. See **Millennium**.\n\n**Milliner**, or **Milliner**, one who sells ribbons and dresses, particularly head dresses for women; and who makes up those dresses.\n\nOf this word different etymologies have been given. It is not derived from the French. The French cannot express the notion of milliner, otherwise than by the circumlocution *marchand* or *marchande des modes*.\n\nNeither is it derived from the Low Dutch language, the great, but neglected, magazine of the Anglo-Saxon. For Sewell, in his Dictionary English and Dutch, 1738, describes milliner to be \"en kraamer van lint en andere optoefelen, Franche kraamer;\" that is, \"a pedlar who sells ribbons and other trimmings or ornaments; a French pedlar.\"\n\nLittleton, in his English and Latin dictionary, published 1677, defines milliner, \"a jack of all trades?\" q. d. **millenarius**, or **mille mercurium venditor**; that is, \"one who sells a thousand different sorts of things.\" This etymology seems fanciful: But, if he rightly understood the vulgar meaning of the word milliner in his time, we must hold that it then implied what is now termed \"a haberdasher of small wares,\" one who dealt in various articles of petty merchandise, and who did not make up the goods which he sold.\n\nBefore Littleton's time, however, a somewhat nicer characteristic than seems compatible with his notion, appears to have belonged to them; for Shakespeare, in his Henry IV., makes Hotspur, when complaining of the dainties of a courtier, say,\n\n\"He was perfumed like a milliner.\"\n\nThe fact seems to be, that there were milliners of several kinds: as, horse milliners, (for so those persons were called who make ornaments of coloured worsted for horses); haberdashers of small wares, the milliners of Littleton; and milliners such as those now peculiarly known by that name, whether male or female, and to whom Shakespear's allusion seems most appropriate.\n\nLastly, Dr Johnson, in his dictionary, derives the word from **milaner**, an inhabitant of Milan, from whence people of this profession first came, as a Lombard is a banker.\n\n**Mille passus**, or **Millia Passuum**; a very common expression among the ancient Romans for a measure of distance, commonly called a mile. **Milliarium**, rarely used. Which Hesychius made to consist of seven stadia; Plutarch, little short of eight; but many others, as Strabo and Polybius, make it just eight stadia. The reason of this difference is because, that the former had a regard to the Grecian foot, which is greater than the Roman or Italic. This distance is oftentimes called *lapis*, which see. Each passus consisted of five feet (Columella).\n\n**Millennium**, \"a thousand years;\" generally employed to denote the thousand years, during which, according to an ancient tradition in the church, grounded on some doubtful texts in the Apocalypse and other Scriptures, our blest Saviour shall reign with the faithful upon earth after the first resurrection, before the final completion of beatitude.\n\nThough there has been no age of the church in which the millennium was not admitted by individual divines of the first eminence, it is yet evident from the writings of Eusebius, Irenaeus, Origen, and others among the ancients, as well as from the histories of Dupin, Mosheim, and all the moderns, that it was never adopted by the whole church, or made an article of the established creed in any nation.\n\nAbout the middle of the fourth century the Millenarians held the following tenets:\n\n1. That the city of Jerusalem should be rebuilt, and that the land of Judea should be the habitation of those who were to reign on earth 1000 years.\n\n2. That the first resurrection was not to be confined to the martyrs; but that after the fall of Antichrist all the just were to rise, and all that were on the earth were to continue for that space of time.\n\n3. That Christ shall then come down from heaven, and be seen on earth, and reign there with his servants.\n\n4. That the saints during this period shall enjoy all the delights of a terrestrial paradise.\n\nThese opinions were founded upon several passages of Scripture, which the Millenarians among the fathers understood in no other than a literal sense, but which the moderns, who hold that opinion, consider as partly literal and partly metaphorical. Of these passages, that upon which the greatest stress has been laid, we believe to be the following:—And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled; and after that he must be loosed a little season. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again till the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. This passage all the ancient Millenarians took in a sense grossly literal; and taught, that during the millennium the saints on earth were to enjoy every bodily delight. The moderns, on the other hand, consider the power and pleasure of this kingdom as wholly spiritual; and they represent them as not to commence till after the conflagration of the present earth. But that this last supposition is a mistake, the very next verse except one affirms us: for we are there told, that \"when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth;\" and we have no reason to believe...\nMillennium believe that he will have such power or such liberty in \"the new heavens and the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.\"\n\nFor this and other reasons, which our limits will not permit us to enumerate, the most judicious critics contend, that the prophecies of the millennium point, not to a resurrection of martyrs and other just men to reign with Christ a thousand years in a visible kingdom upon earth, but to that state of the Christian church, which, for a thousand years before the general judgement, will be so pure and so widely extended, that, when compared with the state of the world in the ages preceding, it may, in the language of Scripture, be called a resurrection from the dead. In support of this interpretation they quote two passages from St. Paul, in which a conversion from Paganism to Christianity, and a reformation of life, is called a resurrection from the dead:\n\n\"Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin; but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead.\" Romans vii. 13.\n\n\"Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.\" Ephesians v. 14.\n\nIt is likewise to be observed, that in all the descriptions of the resurrection and future judgement which are given us at such length in the gospels and epistles, there is no mention made of a first and second resurrection at the distance of a thousand years from each other. There is indeed an order in the resurrection: for we are told, that \"every man shall rise in his own order; Christ the first fruits, afterwards they that are Christ's at his coming, &c.\" But were the millenarian hypothesis well founded, the words should rather have run thus: \"Christ the first fruits, then the martyrs at his coming, and a thousand years afterwards the residue of mankind. Then cometh the end, &c.\"\n\nThese arguments strongly incline us to believe, that by the reign of Christ and the saints for a thousand years upon earth, nothing more is meant, than that before the general judgement the Jews should be converted, genuine Christianity be diffused through all nations, and mankind enjoy that peace and happiness which the faith and precepts of the gospel are calculated to confer on all by whom they are sincerely embraced.\n\nOur Saviour's own account of his religion is, that from a small beginning it will increase to the full harvest. The millennium therefore is to be considered as the full effect of the Christian principles in the hearts of men, and over the whole world; and the divines who have treated of this subject endeavour to prove, that this is to be expected from the facts which have already existed, and from the importance of the Christian doctrine.\n\n1. The gradual progress of Christianity is no objection to this fact. This is similar to the progress and advancement from less to greater perfection in every thing which possesses vegetable or animal life. The same thing is observed in the arts, in civilization, in societies, and in individuals—and why should it not be admitted to have place in religion? There is indeed a general principle on which a gradual progression, both in the natural and moral world, is founded. The Almighty never employs supernatural means where the thing can be accomplished by those which are natural. This idea is of the most general extent through the whole of the present system of nature. The possibility of another plan could easily be admitted; but in this case there would be a total alteration of every part of the works of God or of man that we are acquainted with. In the same manner, if the religion of Christ had been irresistible, it would have totally altered its natural consequences. It was necessary, therefore, from the present condition of man, as an active, intelligent, and accountable being, that means should be employed; and wherever means are employed, the effects produced must be gradual, and not instantaneous.\n\n2. Though the progress of a divine revelation be gradual, yet it is to be expected, from the wisdom and compassion of God, that it will still be advancing in the hearts of men, and over the world. In the first age of the church, the word of God, supported by miracles, and by the animated zeal of men who spoke what they saw and heard, grew and prevailed. In this case supernatural means were necessary, because the prejudices of the world could not be subdued without them. It was the first watering of a plant which you afterwards leave to the dew of heaven. Miracles at the same time were employed only as the means of conviction; and they were not continued, because in this case they would have become a constant and irresistible principle, incompatible with the condition of man as a reasonable agent. After this power was withdrawn, there were many ages of ignorance and superstition in the Christian church. But what is necessary to be established on this subject is, not that the progress of Christianity has never been interrupted, but that on the whole it has been advancing. The effects of this religion on mankind, in proportion as it was received, were immediate and visible: it destroyed the gross superstition of idol worship; it abolished the practice, which was general in the heathen world, of reducing to the lowest state of servitude the greatest part of our brethren: it softened the horrors of war, even when the vices of mankind made defence necessary: it entered into social and private life; and taught men benevolence, humanity and mercy. It is in these blessed effects that we can observe the progress of Christianity even to this day. Superstition and idolatry were soon engraven on the item which our Saviour planted in the world; but the simplicity of the gospel has been gradually undermining the fabric of superstition; and the men who are most nearly interested in the deceit are now almost ashamed to show their faces in the cause. The practice of slavery has, generally speaking, been extinguished in the Christian world; yet the remains of it have been a disgrace to the Christian name, and the professors of that religion have now begun to see the inconsistency. War is not only carried on with less animosity, and less havoc of the human species; but men begin to cultivate more generally, and to delight in, the arts of peace. The increasing spirit of charity and benevolence, of which it were easy to give unexampled instances in the present age, is a decided proof of the increasing influence of Christianity. At the same time, if, instead of these general principles, we were to descend to private examples of infidelity or of wickedness, it would be easy to bring proofs in support of an opposite opinion; but the reasoning would by no means be equally conclusive; for if the general principles by which society is regulated be more liberal and merciful, it:\nMillennium it is evident that there is more goodness in a greater number of the human race. Society is nothing more than a collection of individuals; and the general tone, especially when it is on the side of virtue, which almost in every instance opposes the designs of leading and interested men, is a certain evidence of the private spirit. To show that this reformation is connected with Christianity, it is unnecessary to state any comparison between the influence of heathen, and the influence of Christian principles: between civilization as depending on the powers of the human understanding, and on the efficacy of the word of God. The whole of this controversy may be appealed to an obvious fact, viz. that as any nation has come nearer to the simplicity of the gospel in the standard of its worship, it has been more polished of those national virtues which we have ascribed to the influence of Christianity. This fact is worth a thousand volumes of speculation on this subject.\n\n3. A revelation sanctioned by God, for a benevolent purpose, will be expected to produce effects corresponding to the wisdom which gave it, and to the purpose for which it is employed. It may be gradual; but it will be increasing, and it must increase, to the full harvest. He that has begun the good work will also finish it. It is reasonable to expect this illustrious success of the gospel, both from the nature of the thing, and from the prophecies contained in the sacred scriptures. The precepts of the gospel, in their genuine sense, are admirably calculated for the peace and welfare both of individuals and society. The greatest liberality of mind, the greatest generosity of temper, the most unbounded love, and the greatest indifference to the accumulation of this world's property, if they glowed from breast to breast, and operated with equal force on all men, would be productive of equal good and happiness to all. We are scarcely able to perceive the force of this at first view, because the deceit and imposition which yet exist in the world, prevent the operation of the best principles even in the best hearts. But in proportion to the improvement of mankind, what is their real interest, and what are the real objects of happiness, will gradually unfold. The contempt of vice will be greater in proportion to the scarcity of it: for one villain gives countenance and support to another, just as iron sharpeneth iron. This opens to our view another fact connected with the practice of Christianity, namely, that the nearer it arrives to its perfect state, it will be the more rapid in its progress. The beauty of holiness will be more visible; and, in the strong language of the prophet, \"the earth shall bring forth in one day, and a nation shall be born at once.\"* This future perfection of the gospel is consistent with its nature and importance.—We can scarcely believe that means so admirably adapted to the reformation of mankind should be without their effect; and if the most difficult part be already accomplished, we have no reason to apprehend that the scheme will not be completed. This fact is also clearly the subject of ancient prophecy. For thus faith the Lord +, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream. And it shall come to pass, from one Sabbath to another, and from one new moon to another, shall all hail come to worship before me, saith the Lord.\"—Violence shall be no more heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy border; but thou shalt call Millennium thy walls salvation, and thy gates praise.\" (Isa. lx. 18.)\n\nWithout entering more minutely on the prophecy already quoted from chap. xx. of the book of the Revelation, it is sufficient to observe, that Dr Whitby, in his treatise on the millennium at the end of his commentary, proves, in the clearest manner, from the spirit of the passage and the similarity of the expressions with those of other prophets, that it refers to a state of the church for a thousand years, which shall be like life from the dead. The commencement of this period is connected with two events: the fall of antichrist, and the conversion of the Jews. The latter of these events must be considered as a key to all the prophecies concerning the millennium. As the Jews were the ancient people of God, and as their conversion is to be the previous step to the general knowledge of Christianity, the prophecies of the millennium have a chief relation to this important event. We have already observed, that God never interposes with miraculous power to produce what can be effected by natural means; and from what we know of human nature, we cannot but perceive that the conversion of the Jews will powerfully operate to the general conversion of mankind. Freed from those prejudices which now make them the objects of hatred in all nations, and fired with that zeal by which new converts are always actuated, they will preach the gospel with a fervour of which we, who have long been blessed with its rays, can hardly form a conception; and, by their present dispersion over the whole earth, they will be enabled to adapt their instructions to every individual of the human race in the language of his fathers. Indeed, if they are not at some future period to be employed by Providence for this purpose, it is difficult, if not impossible, to give any reason for their dispersed state and political existence. Just now it must be confessed that they are the most implacable enemies of the Christian name; but their conversion is not on that account more unlikely or improbable than were events which have taken place of nearly equal importance a very few years ago. On the whole, the perfection of Christianity is a doctrine of reasonable expectation to the church; and it is impossible for the advocates for natural religion to deny, that unlimited obedience to its precepts is consistent with the purest state of liberty and of happiness. This is the only millennium which the prophets and apostles, as we understand them, promise to the saints; but as men figuring in the very first ranks of learning have thought otherwise, we would not be too confident that our interpretation is just.—Such of our readers as wish for further information, will find it in the works of Mr Mede, Bishop Newton, Dr Whitby and Dr Gill; and to those masterly writers we refer them for that satisfaction which in such an article as this cannot be given.\n\nMILLEPEPS, or WOOD LOUSE; a species of ONISCUS. See ENTOMOLOGY Index.\n\nMILLEPORA, in Natural History, a name by which Linnaeus distinguishes that genus of lithophytes, of a hard structure and full of holes, which are not fluted or radiated, and whose animal is the hydra, in which it differs from the madrepora, and comprehending 14 different species.\n\nIn the millepora, the animal which forms and inhabits it occupies the substance; and it is observed that\nthe millepora grow upon one another; their little animals produce their spawn; which attaching itself either to the extremity of the body already formed, or underneath it, gives a different form to this production.

From this pillar the miles were counted, and at the end of every mile a stone was put down. The milliary column was erected by Augustus Caesar, and, as we are informed by travellers, is still to be seen.\n\nMILLING of Cloth.

Uncertain whether Bath Millo, (Judges ix. 20.) denotes a place; if it did, it lay near Sechem.\n\nMILLOT, Claude Francis Xavier, of the French academy, was born at Besançon, March 1726, and was for some time a Jesuit. He was consecrated for the pulpit, and continued to preach after he left the society: But the weakness of his voice, his timidity, and the awkwardness of his manner, not permitting him to continue in this profession, he relinquished it, although he had preached Advent sermons at Verfaelles, and Lent sermons at Lunéville. The marquis de Felino, minister of Parma, instituted an historical class for the benefit of the young nobility; and, at the desire of M. le Duc de Nivernois, he gave the charge of it to the abbé Millot. The minister having occasioned a kind of rebellion among the people by some innovations which he had made in the state, the abbé continued attached to the interests of his patron, and would not desert him till the storm was blown over. When he was told that he would lose his place by this conduct, he replied, \"My place is with a virtuous persecuted man who has been my benefactor; and that I shall never lose.\" At length, having filled the historical chair with great approbation, he returned to France, and was appointed preceptor to M. le Duc d'Enghien. In this situation he died, A.D. 1785, aged 59. The abbé Millot did not shine in company; he was cold and reserved in his manner; but everything he said was judicious, and exactly in point.—D'Alembert said, that of all his acquaintance the abbé Millot had the fewest prejudices and the least pretension. He composed several works, which are digested with great care, and written in a pure, simple, and natural style. The principal are, 1. Éléments de l'Histoire de France, depuis Clovis jusqu'à Louis XIV. 3 vols. in 12mo. The author, selecting the most curious and important facts, has suppressed every thing foreign to the subject; and has not only arranged the materials in their proper order, but chosen them with the greatest judgment. Querlon thought this the best abridgement which we have of the history of France, and preferred it to that of the president Henault. 2. Éléments de l'Histoire d'Angleterre, depuis son origine sous les Romains, jusqu'à George II. 3 vols. 12mo. In this valuable abridgement, the author satisfies, without tiring, his readers. It is all that is necessary for those who wish to gain a general knowledge of the English history, without entering minutely into its particular parts.—3. Éléments de l'Histoire Universelle, 9 vols. 12mo. A certain critic maintains, that this work is merely a counterfeit of Voltaire's general history. But this censure is altogether unjust. The ancient history in this work is wholly composed by the abbé Millot; and, no less than the modern part, discovers his abilities in the choice of facts, in diverting them of useless circumstances, in relating them without prejudice, and in adorning them with judicious reflections. 4. L'Histoire des Troubadours, 3 vols. 12mo, compiled from the manuscripts of M. de Saint Palaie. This work appears rather tedious, because it treats of men almost unknown, and most of them deserving to be so. What is there quoted from the Provençal poets is not at all interesting; and, according to the observation of a man of wit, \"it serves no purpose to search curiously into a heap of old ruins while we have modern palaces to engage our attention.\" 5. Mémoires Politiques et Militaires, pour servir à l'Histoire de Louis XIV. et de Louis XV. compiled from original papers collected by Adrian Maurice duc de Noailles, marshal of France, in 6 vols. 12mo. 6. The abbé Millot published also several Discourses, in which he discusses a variety of philosophical questions, with more ingenuity of argument than fire of expression; and a translation of the most select harangues in the Latin historians; of which it has been remarked, as well as of the orations of the abbé d'Olivet, that they are coldly correct, and elegantly insipid. The character of the author, more prudent and circumstantial than lively and animated, seldom elevated his imagination above a noble simplicity without warmth, and a pure style without ostentation. Some of the critics, however, have accused him of declamation in some parts of his histories, particularly in those parts which concern the clergy. But, in our opinion, the word declamation is totally inapplicable to the writings of the abbé Millot. He flatters, it is true, neither priests nor statesmen; and he relates more instances of vicious than of virtuous actions, because the one are infinitely more common than the other: But he relates them coldly; and he appears to be guided more by sincerity and a love of truth, than by that partial philosophy which blames the Christian religion for those evils which it condemns.\n\nMILO, a celebrated athlete of Crotona in Italy. His father's name was Diotimus. He early accustomed himself to carry the greatest burdens, and by degrees became a prodigy of strength. It is said that he carried on his shoulders a young bullock, four years old, for above forty yards; and afterwards killed it with one blow of his fist, and ate it up in one day. He was seven times crowned at the Pythian games, and six at the Olympian. He presented himself a seventh time; but no one had the courage or boldness to enter the lists against.\nagainst him. He was one of the disciples of Pythagoras; and to his uncommon strength, it is said, the learned preceptor and his pupils owed their life: The pillar which supported the roof of the school suddenly gave way; but Milo supported the whole weight of the building, and gave the philosopher and his auditors time to escape. In his old age, Milo attempted to pull up a tree by the roots, and break it. He partly effected it; but his strength being gradually exhausted, the tree when half cleft re-united, and his hands remained pinched in the body of the tree. He was then alone; and, being unable to disentangle himself, he was devoured by the wild beasts of the place, about 500 years before the Christian era.\n\nMilo, T. Anius, a native of Lanuvium, who attempted to obtain the consulship at Rome by intrigue and seditions tumults. Clodius the tribune opposed his views; yet Milo would have succeeded but for the following event: As he was going into the country, attended by his wife and a numerous retinue of gladiators and servants, he met on the Appian road his enemy Clodius, who was returning to Rome with three of his friends and some domestics completely armed.—A quarrel arose between the servants. Milo supported his attendants, and the dispute became general.—Clodius received many severe wounds, and was obliged to retire to a neighbouring cottage. Milo pursued his enemy in his retreat, and ordered his servants to despatch him. The body of the murdered tribune was carried to Rome, and exposed to public view. The enemies of Milo inveighed bitterly against the violence and barbarity with which the sacred person of a tribune had been treated. Cicero undertook the defence of Milo; but the continual clamours of the friends of Clodius, and the sight of an armed soldiery, which surrounded the seat of judgement, so terrified the orator, that he forgot the greatest part of his arguments, and the defense he made was weak and injudicious.—Milo was condemned, and banished to Madilia. Cicero soon after sent his exiled friend a copy of the oration which he had prepared for his defense, in the form in which we have it now; and Milo, after he had read it, exclaimed, \"O Cicero, hast thou spoken before my accusers in these terms, Milo would not be now eating figs at Marseilles.\" The friendship and cordiality of Cicero and Milo were the fruits of long intimacy and familiar intercourse. It was the successful labours of Milo that the orator was recalled from banishment, and restored to his friends.\n\nMilo, (anciently Melos), an island in the Archipelago, about 50 miles in circumference, with a harbour, which is one of the largest in the Mediterranean. The principal town is of the same name as the island, and was prettily built, but abominably nasty: the houses are two stories high, with flat roofs; and are built with a sort of pumice stone, which is hard, blackish, and yet very light.\n\nThis island was formerly rich and populous. From the earliest times of antiquity it enjoyed pure liberty. The Athenians, not being able to persuade the Melians to declare in their favour in the Peloponnesian war, made a descent upon the island, and attacked them vigorously. In two different expeditions they failed of their purpose: but returning with more numerous forces, they laid siege to Melos; and obliging the besieged to surrender at discretion, put to the sword all the men who were able to bear arms. They spared only the women and children, and these they carried into captivity. This act of cruelty puts humanity to the blush, and disgraces the Athenian name. But war was then carried on with a degree of wild rage, unexampled in the present times. Republics know not how to pardon, and always carry their vengeance to an extravagant height. When Lygander, the Macedonian general, came to give law to the Athenians, he expelled the colony which they had sent to Melos, and re-established the unfortunate remains of its original inhabitants.\n\nThis island lost its liberty when Rome, aspiring to the empire of the world, conquered all the isles of the Archipelago. In the partition of the empire, it fell to the share of the eastern emperors, was governed by particular dukes, and was at last conquered by Soliman II. Since that period, it has groaned under the yoke of Turkish despotism, and has lost its opulence and splendour. At the commencement of the present century, it boasted of 17 churches and 11 chapels, and contained more than 20,000 inhabitants. It was very fertile in corn, wine, and fruits; and the whole space from the town to the harbour, which is nearly two miles, was laid out in beautiful gardens. M. Tournefort, who visited it in the year 1700, gives a fine description of it. \"The earth, being constantly warmed by subterranean fires, produced almost without interruption plentiful crops of corn, barley, cotton, exquisite wines, and delicious melons. St Elias, the finest monastery in the island, and situated on the most elevated spot, is encircled with orange, citron, cedar, and fig trees. Its gardens are watered by a copious spring. Olive trees, of which there are but few in the other parts of the island, grow in great numbers around this monastery. The adjacent vineyards afford excellent wine. In a word, all the productions of the island are the very best of their kinds; its partridges, quails, kids, and lambs, are highly valued, and yet may be bought at a very cheap price.\"\n\nWere M. Tournefort to return to Milo, M. Savary affirms us; he would no longer see the fine island which he has described. \"He might still see alum, in the form of feathers, and fringed with silver thread, hanging from the arches of the caverns; pieces of pure sulphur filling the cliffs of the rocks; a variety of mineral springs; hot baths (though these are now only a set of small dirty caves); the same subterraneous fires which in his days warmed the bosom of the earth, and were the cause of its extraordinary fertility; but instead of 5000 Greeks, all paying the capitation tax (A), he would now find no more than about 700 inhabitants.\n\n(A) Grown up men are the only persons who pay the capitation tax. Therefore, by adding to the number of 5000 who paid the tax, the women, boys, and girls, we find that Melos, in the days of Tournefort, contained at least 20,000 souls.\ninhabitants on an island 18 leagues in circumference. He would fain behold the finest lands lying uncultivated, and the most fertile valleys converted into moorlands; of the gardens scarcely a vestige left; three-fourths of the town in ruins, and the inhabitants daily decreasing. In short, during the last 50 years, Melos has assumed quite a different appearance. The plague, which the Turks propagate everywhere, has cut off one part of its inhabitants; the injudicious administration of the Porte, and the oppressive extortions of the captain pacha, have destroyed the rest. At present, for want of hands, they cannot cut out a free channel for their waters, which stagnate in the valleys, corrupt, and infect the air with their putrid exhalations. The salt marshes, of which there are numbers in the island, being equally neglected, produce the same effects. Add to these inconveniences, those sulphurous exhalations which arise all over the island, and by which the inhabitants of Melos are afflicted with dangerous fevers during three-fourths of the year. Perhaps they may be obliged to forsake their country. Every countenance is yellow, pale, and livid; and none bears any marks of good health. The prudent traveller will be careful to spend but a very short time in this unwholesome country, unless he chooses to expose himself to the danger of catching a fever. To sleep over night, or to spend but one day in the island, is often enough to occasion his being attacked with that distemper.\n\n\"Yet (continues our author) a judicious and enlightened government might expel those evils which ravage Melos. Its first care would be to establish a lazaret, and to prohibit vessels whose crews or cargoes are infected with the plague from landing. Canals might next be cut, to drain the marshes, whose exhalations are so pernicious. The island would then be repeopled. The sulphurous vapours are not the most noxious. These prevailed equally in ancient times, yet the island was then very populous. M. Tournefort, who travelled through it at a time less distant from the period when it was conquered by the Turks, and when they had not yet had time to lay it waste, reckons the number of its inhabitants (as we have said) at about 20,000. The depopulation of Melos is therefore to be ascribed to the dilapidation of the Porte, and is detestable police.\"\n\nThe women of Milo, once so celebrated for their beauty, are now frowzy, unhealthy, and disgustingly ugly; and render themselves still more hideous by their drabs, which is a kind of loose jacket, with a white coat and petticoat, that scarcely covers two-thirds of their thighs, barely meeting the stocking above the knee. Their hind hair hangs down the back in a number of plaits; that on the fore part of the head is combed down each side of the face, and terminated by a small stiff curl, which is even with the lower part of the cheek. All the inhabitants are Greeks, for the Turks are not fond of trifling themselves in the small islands; but every summer the captain bathaw goes round with a squadron to keep them in subjection, and to collect the revenue. When the Ruffians made themselves masters of the Archipelago, many of the islands declared in their favour; but being abandoned by the peace, they were so severely maltreated by the grand signior, that they have professed a determination to remain perfectly quiet in future. As the Turks, however, do not think them worth a garrison, and will not trust them with arms and ammunition, all those which the Ruffians may choose to invade will be obliged to submit. The two points which form the entrance of the harbour, crossing each other, render it imperceptible until you are close to it. Thus, while you are perfectly secure within it, you find great difficulty in getting out, particularly in a northerly wind; and as no trade is carried on except a little in corn and salt, Milo would scarcely ever be visited, were it not that, being the first island which one makes in the Archipelago, the pilots have chosen it for their residence. They live in a little town on the top of a high rock, which, from its situation and appearance, is called the Castle—Partridges still abound in this island, and are so cheap, that you may buy one for a charge of powder only. The peasants get them by standing behind a portable screen, with a small aperture in the centre, in which they place the muzzle of their piece, and then draw the partridges by a call. When a sufficient number are collected, they fire among them, and generally kill from four to seven at a shot; but even this method of getting them is so expensive, from the scarcity of ammunition, that the people can never afford to shoot them, except when there are gentlemen in the island, from whom they can beg a little powder and shot.\n\nMilo is 60 miles north of Candia; and the town is situated in E.

It consists of two long whitish irregular bodies, each included in a very thin fine membrane. M.

It is the only sea port in the county; and goods are brought hither in small vessels from Grange in Lancashire. Here are two paper mills. It has a market on Friday, and a fair on Old May day; and there is a good stone bridge over the river Betha, which runs through the town.\n\nMILTIADES, an Athenian captain, son of Cypselus. He obtained a victory in a chariot race at the Olympic games. He led a colony of Athenians to the Chersonesus. The causes of this appointment are striking and singular. The Thracian Dolonci, harassed by a long war with the Ablynthians, were directed by the oracle of Delphi to take for their king the first man they met in their return home, who invited them to come under his roof and partake his entertainments. This was Miltiades, whom the appearance of the Dolonci, with their strange arms and garments, had struck. He invited them to his house, and was made acquainted with the commands of the oracle. He obeyed; and when the oracle of Delphi had approved a second time the choice of the Dolonci,\nMiltiades, Ionci, he departed for the Cheroneus, and was in veiled by the inhabitants with sovereign power. The first measures he took were to stop the further incursions of the Abynthians, by building a strong wall across the isthmus. When he had established himself at home, and fortified his dominions against foreign invasion, he turned his arms against Lampacus. His expedition was unsuccessful; he was taken in an ambush, and made prisoner. His friend Croesus king of Lydia was informed of his captivity, and procured his release. He lived few years after he had recovered his liberty. As he had no issue, he left his kingdom and possessions to Stefagoras the son of Cimon, who was his brother by the same mother. The memory of Miltiades was greatly honoured by the Dolonci, and they regularly celebrated festivals and exhibited shows in commemoration of a man to whom they owed their greatness and preservation.\n\nMiltiades, the son of Cimon, and brother of Stefagoras mentioned in the preceding article, was some time after the death of the latter, who died without issue, sent by the Athenians with one ship to take possession of the Cheroneus. At his arrival Miltiades appeared mournful, as if lamenting the recent death of his brother. The principal inhabitants of the country visited the new governor to console with him; but their confidence in his sincerity proved fatal to them. Miltiades seized their persons, and made himself absolute in Cheroneus. To strengthen himself, he married Hegeipina, the daughter of Olorus the king of the Thracians. His triumph was short. In the third year of his government, his dominions were threatened by an invasion of the Scythian Nomades, whom Darius had some time before irritated by entering their country. He fled before them; but as their hostilities were of short duration, he was soon restored to his kingdom. Three years after, he left Cheroneus; and set sail for Athens, where he was received with great applause. He was present at the celebrated battle of Marathon; in which all the chief officers ceded their power to him, and left the event of the battle to depend upon his superior abilities. He obtained an important victory over the more numerous forces of his adversaries. Some time after, Miltiades was intrusted with a fleet of 70 ships, and ordered to punish those islands which had revolted to the Persians. He was successful at first, but a sudden report that the Persian fleet was coming to attack him, changed his operations as he was besieging Paros. He raised the siege, and returned to Athens. He was accused of treason, and particularly of holding correspondence with the enemy. The falsity of these accusations might have appeared, if Miltiades had been able to come into the assembly. But a wound which he had received before Paros detained him at home; and his enemies, taking advantage of his absence, became more eager in their accusations, and louder in their clamours. He was condemned to death; but the rigour of his sentence was retracted on the recollection of his great services to the Athenians, and he was put into prison till he had paid a fine of 50 talents to the state. His inability to discharge so a great a sum detained him in confinement; and his wounds becoming incurable, he died a prisoner about 489 years before the Christian era. His body was ransomed by his son Cimon; who was obliged to borrow and pay the 50 talents, to give his father a decent burial.—The accusations against Miltiades were probably the more readily believed by his countrymen, when they remembered how he made himself absolute in Cheroneus; and in condemning the barbarity of the Athenians towards a general, who was the source of their military prosperity, we must remember the jealousy which ever reigns among a free and independent people, and how watchful they are in defence of the natural rights which they see wrested from others by violence. Cornelius Nepos has written the life of Miltiades the son of Cimon; but his history is incongruous and unintelligible, from his confounding the actions of the son of Cimon with those of the son of Cypselus. Greater reliance is to be placed on the narration of Herodotus, whose veracity is confirmed, and who was indubitably better informed and more capable of giving an account of the life and exploits of men who flourished in his age, and of which he could see the living monuments. Herodotus was born about six years after the famous battle of Marathon; and C. Nepos, as a writer of the Augustan age, flourished about 450 years after the age of the father of history.\n\nMilton, John, the most illustrious of the English poets, was descended of a gentry family, seated at a place of their own name, viz. Milton, in Oxfordshire. He was born December 9, 1628, and received his first rudiments of education under the care of his parents, assisted by a private tutor. He afterwards passed some time at St Paul's school, London; in which city his father had settled, being engaged in the business of a scrivener. At the age of 17, he was sent to Christ's college, Cambridge; where he made great progress in all parts of academical learning; but his chief delight was in poetry. In 1628, he proceeded bachelor of arts, having performed his exercises for it with great applause. His father designed him for the church; but the young gentleman's attachment to the Muses was so strong, that it became impossible to engage him in any other pursuits. In 1632, he took the degree of master of arts; and having now spent as much time in the university as became a person who determined not to engage in any of the three professions, he left the college, greatly regretted by his acquaintance, but highly displeased with the usual method of training up youth there for the study of divinity; and being much out of humour with the public administration of ecclesiastical affairs, he grew dissatisfied with the established form of church government, and disliked the whole plan of education practised in the university. His parents who now dwelt at Horton, near Colnbrook, in Buckinghamshire, received him with unabated affection, notwithstanding he had thwarted their views of providing for him in the church, and they amply indulged him in his love of retirement; wherein he enriched his mind with the choicest stores of Grecian and Roman literature; and his poems of Comus, L'Allegro, Il Penseroso, and Lycidas, all wrote at this time, would have been sufficient, had he never produced any thing more considerable, to have transmitted his fame to the latest posterity. However, he was not so absorbed in his studies as not to make frequent excursions to London; neither did so much excellence fail.\npals unnoticed among his neighbours in the country, with the most distinguished of whom he sometimes chose to relax his mind, and improve his acquaintance with the world as well as with books.—After five years spent in this manner, he obtained his father's permission to travel for farther improvement. At Paris he became acquainted with the celebrated Hugo Grotius; and from thence travelling into Italy, he was everywhere caressed by persons of the most eminent quality and learning.\n\nUpon his return home, he set up a genteel academy in Alder-gate street.—In 1641, he began to draw his pen in defence of the Presbyterian party; and the next year he married the daughter of Richard Powell, Esq., of Forest Hill in Oxfordshire. This lady, however, whether from a difference on account of party, her father being a zealous royalist, or some other cause, soon thought proper to return to her relations; which so incensed her husband, that he resolved never to take her again, and wrote and published several tracts in defence of the doctrine and discipline of divorce. He even made his addresses to another lady; but this incident proved the means of a reconciliation with Mrs Milton.\n\nIn 1644, he wrote his Tract upon Education; and the restraint on the liberty of the press being continued by act of parliament, he wrote boldly and nobly against that restraint. In 1645, he published his juvenile poems; and about two years after, on the death of his father, he took a smaller house in High Holborn, the back of which opened into Lincoln's-Inn Fields.—Here he quietly prosecuted his studies, till the fatal catastrophe and death of Charles I.; on which occasion he published his Tenure of Kings and Magistrates, in justification of the fact. He was now taken into the service of the commonwealth, and made Latin secretary to the council of state, who resolved neither to write to others abroad, nor to receive any answers, except in the Latin tongue, which was common to them all. The famous Exon Basilica coming out about the same time, our author, by command, wrote and published his Iconoclastes the same year. It was also by order of his masters, backed by the reward of 100l. that in 1651 he published his celebrated piece, entitled Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio; \"A Defence of the People of England, in answer to Salmasius's Defence of the King; which performance spread his fame over all Europe. He now dwelt in a pleasant house with a garden in Petty France, Westminster, opening into St James's Park. In 1652 he buried his wife, who died not long after the delivery of her fourth child; and about the same time he also lost his eye-sight, by a gutta serena, which had been growing upon him many years.\n\nCromwell took the reins of government into his own hand in the year 1653; but Milton still held his office. His leisure hours he employed in prosecuting his studies; wherein he was so far from being discouraged by the loss of his sight, that he even conceived hopes this misfortune would add new vigour to his genius; which in fact seems to have been the case.—Thus animated, he again ventured upon matrimony: his second lady was the daughter of Captain Woodstock of Hackney: she died in childbirth about a year after. On the deposition of the protector, Richard Crom-\n\nwell, and on the return of the long parliament, Milton being still continued secretary, he appeared again in print; pleading for a farther reformation of the laws relating to religion; and, during the anarchy that ensued, he drew up several schemes for re-establishing the commonwealth, exerting all his faculties to prevent the return of Charles II. England's destiny, however, and Charles's good fortune, prevailing, our author chose to consult his safety, and retired to a friend's house in Bartholomew-Cloake. A particular prosecution was intended against him; but the just esteem to which his admirable genius and extraordinary accomplishments entitled him, had raised him so many friends, even among those of the opposite party, that he was included in the general amnesty.\n\nThis storm being over, he married a third wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Mr Minshall a Cheshire gentleman; and not long after he took a house in the Artillery Walk, leading to Bunhill Fields. This was his last stage: here he sat down for a longer continuance than he had been able to do anywhere; and though he had lost his fortune (for everything belonging to him went to wreck at the Restoration), he did not lose his taste for literature, but continued his studies with almost as much ardour as ever; and applied himself particularly to the finishing his grand work, the Paradise Lost; one of the noblest poems that ever was produced by human genius.—It was published in 1667, and his Paradise Regained came out in 1670.—This latter work fell short of the excellence of the former production; although, were it not for the transcendent merit of Paradise Lost, the second composition would doubtless have stood foremost in the rank of English epic poems. After this he published many pieces in prose; for which we refer our readers to the edition of his Historical, Poetical, and Miscellaneous Works, printed by Millar, in 2 vols. 4to, in 1753.\n\nIn 1674, this great man paid the last debt to nature at his house in Bunhill Fields, in the 66th year of his age; and was interred on the 12th of November, in the chancel of St Giles's, Cripplegate.—A decent monument was erected to his memory, in 1737, in Westminster Abbey, by Mr Benyon, one of the auditors of the impress.—Milton was remarkably handsome in his person; but his constitution was tender, and by no means equal to his incessant application to his studies.—Though greatly reduced in his circumstances, yet he died worth 1500l. in money, besides his household goods.—He had no son; but left behind him three daughters, whom he had by his first wife.\n\nMilton, the name of several places in England; particularly,\n\nMilton, or Middleton, in Dorsetshire, south-west of Blandford, near the road to Dorchester, 114 miles from London. It is chiefly noted for its abbey, built by King Athelstan. The church stands near the south side of the abbey. It is a large and magnificent pile of Gothic architecture, and contains several ancient monuments. Here is an almshouse for six people, who have 12s. a-week, and three yards of cloth for a gown, one pair of shoes and stockings, and 10s. each on St Thomas's day yearly. Here is a free school, and a market on Tuesdays.\n\nMilton, in Kent, near Sittingbourne and the Isle of Sheppey, 6 miles north-west of Faversham, and 40\nMIM\n\nIt is also called Middleton from its situation near the middle of the county, i.e., from Deptford to the Downs. The kings of Kent had a palace here, which was cattellated, and stood below the church; but was burnt down in Edward the Confessor's time by Earl Goodwin, &c. Its church stands near a mile off. On approaching the town up the Thames, by the East Swale, it seems hid among the creeks: yet it is a large town; and has a considerable market on Saturdays, and a fair on July 24. The oysters taken here are the most famous of any in Kent. This town is governed by a portreeve, chosen yearly on St James's day, who supervises the weights and measures all over the hundred of Milton.\n\nMILTON, in Kent, a mile on the east side of Gravesend, was incorporated with it in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, by the name of the portreeve, jurats, and inhabitants of the towns of Gravesend and Milton, King Henry VIII. raised a platform or blockhouse here, for the defence both of this town and Gravesend, and the command of the river. It has a fair January 25.\n\nMILVIUS, MOLVIUS, or Mulvius, Pons; a bridge on the Tiber, built by Aemilius Scaurus the censor, in the time of Sylla, at two miles distance from the city, on the Via Flaminia, and repaired by Augustus. From this bridge the ambassadors of the Allobroges were brought back to Rome, by Cicero's management, and made a discovery of Catiline's conspiracy (Sallust). Near it Maxentius was defeated by Constantine (Eutropius). Now called Ponte Molle.\n\nMILVUS, a species of Falco. See Falco, Ornithology Index.\n\nMIMI, Mimes, in the ancient comedy, were buffoons or mimics, who entertained the people by taking off certain characters, using such gestures as suited the persons or subjects they represented. There were on the Roman stage female performers of this kind called mimea. The word is derived from imitari, I imitate. Some of the mimi acted their parts to the sound of the tibia; these they called mimauli.\n\nMimi were also a kind of farces or ludicrous comedies, generally performed by one person. They had no acts, nor any exordium.—The mimi were introduced upon the Roman stage long after comedy and tragedy had arrived at their full perfection. The actor wore no mask, but smeared his face with soot, was draped in lambkin, wore garlands of ivy, and carried a basket of flowers and herbs, in honour of Bacchus, and diverted the audience with apish tricks and ridiculous dances. This was the flate of the mimi soon after their first introduction; but they underwent many alterations, which it would take up too much room to relate, and which are not of sufficient importance to justify a detailed account. See Pantomimes.\n\nMIMESIS, in Rhetoric, the imitating the voice and gestures of another person.\n\nMINNERMUS, an ancient poet and musician, flourished about the beginning of the fifth century B.C. He was of Smyrna, and contemporary with Solon. Athenæus gives him the invention of pentameter verse. His elegies, of which only a few fragments are preserved, were so much admired in antiquity, that Horace preferred them to those of Callimachus. He composed a poem of this kind, as we learn from Pausanias.\n\nUpon the battle fought between the people of Smyrna, and the Lydians under Gyges. He likewise was author of a poem in elegiac verse, quoted by Strabo, which he entitled Nanno, and in which we may suppose he chiefly celebrated a young and beautiful girl of that name, who, according to Athenæus, was a player on the flute, with whom he was enamoured in his old age. With respect to love matters, according to Propertius, his verses were more valuable than all the writings of Homer.\n\nPlus in amore valet Minnermi versus Homero.\nLib. I. Eleg. ix. v. ii.\n\nAnd Horace bears testimony to his abilities in describing that seducing passion:\n\nSi Minnermus uti cenet, sine amore jocique\nNil est jucundum, vivas in amore jocique.\nLib. I. Epit. vi. v. 65.\n\nIf, as wife Minnermus said,\nLife unblest with love and joy\nRanks us with the fenclods dead,\nLet these gifts each hour employ.\n\nAlluding to some much admired lines of the Greek poet, which have been preferred by Stobæus.\n\nΤις δὲ βίος, τι δὲ τρέμων ἀπὸ περιόδου Ἀφροδίτης, &c.\n\nWhat is life and all its pride;\nIf love and pleasure be denied;\nSnatch, snatch me hence, ye Fates, whene'er\nThe am'rous bliss I cease to share.\nOh let us crop each fragrant flow'r\nWhile youth and vigour give us pow'r:\nFor frozen age will soon destroy\nThe force to give or take a joy;\nAnd then, a prey to pain and care,\nDetected by the young and fair,\nThe sun's blest beams will hateful grow,\nAnd only shine on scenes of woe.\n\nMIMOSA, the sensitive plant, a genus of plants belonging to the monœcia clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 33rd order, Lomentaceæ. See Botany and Materia Medica Index.\n\nThe name mimosa, signifying \"mimic,\" is given to this genus on account of the sensibility of the leaves, which, by their motion, mimic or imitate, as it were, the motion of animals.\n\nMINA, or Maneh, a species of money which properly signifies one part or ounce. It is observed that this word occurs only in the books of Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, and Ezekiel. This prophet (xlv. 12.) tells us, that the minah or maneh was valued at 60 shekels, which in gold make of our English money about 54½ pounds, and in silver almost seven pounds. Thus for the Hebrew maneh. But the Greek or Attic mina, which is probably that mentioned in the books of the Maccabees and in the New Testament, is valued at 100 drachme, or about 2l. 17s. sterling. There was also a lesser mina, which was valued at 75 drachme.\n\nMINAGNGHINIM, a pulsative instrument of music, among the Hebrews, which was a square table of wood, fitted with a handle; over this table was\nMINCHA, in the Jewish customs, offerings of meal, cakes, or biscuits, made in the temple of the Lord. The Seventy have sometimes preferred this word in their translation; but instead of mincha they read manna, which doubtless was the received pronunciation in their time. We find manna in the same sense, in Baruch i. 10. Levit. ii. 3. &c. See the Greek of Jerem. xvii. 26. Dan. ii. 46. 2 Kings viii. 5. 9. xvii. 7. xx. 12. 2 Chron. vii. 7. Nehem. xiii. 5. 9. &c.\n\nMINCHING-HAMPTON, a town of Gloucestershire, 20 miles from Bath and Bristol, and near 90 from London, with a market on Tuesdays, and two fairs. The parish is pretty large, being bounded on the north by the Stroud, and on the south by the brook Avon; and has 12 hamlets belonging to it, with a common called Amberley. Here is a good large rectory church, built in form of a cross, and worth 200l. a-year. Near it are very large camps, with deep trenches; and near Dunkirk in this parish are fulling mills.\n\nMINCIUS, a river of the Trampadana in Italy; running from, or rather transmitted through, the Lacus Benacus, from north to south, into the Padus; but originally rising in the Rhetian Alps. Now Mincio or Menzo, running through the duchy of Mantua into the Po.\n\nMIND, a thinking intelligent being, otherwise called spirit, in opposition to matter or body. See METAPHYSICS, Part III.\n\nMINDANAO, or MAGINDANAO, a large island of Asia in the East Indies, and one of the Philippines; 160 miles in length, and 120 in breadth. The interior parts contain several chains of lofty mountains, between which are extensive plains, where vast herds of cattle roam at large in the most delicious pastures. Several deep valleys also intersect, as it were, certain parts of the country, through which, during the rainy seasons, vast torrents pour from the mountains, and force their impetuous way to the sea. The rains and vapours which lodge in the plains diffuse themselves into meandering rivulets, and, collecting a variety of small streams in their course, approach the sea in the form of considerable rivers.—The sovereign of Magindanao is a powerful prince, and has several inferior chiefs, who acknowledge him as their head. Nevertheless, there are others of them who refuse submission to him, and are consequently in a continual state of war; so that peace, at least, does not appear to be one of the blessings of this island. The Spaniards, indeed, assert their right to the entire dominion of Magindanao; but it is mere assertion; for though they have forts, &c. on the island, it is by no means in a state of subjection to their nation.\n\nThe air is esteemed salubrious, particularly in the vicinity of the sea. The heat there is not, in any degree, so intense as might be expected in a country which is situated on the very verge of the torrid zone. The prevalence of the easterly winds, in that part of the coasts which is washed by the Pacific ocean, renders the air cool and pleasant, the trade wind blowing incessantly on its shores. It acts, indeed, with so much power as to sweep the whole breadth of the island; and though in its passage it loses much of its strength, it retains a sufficient degree of force to afford refreshing breezes to the inhabitants of the western shore. The interior parts are much colder, from a very cloudy atmosphere, which frequently hangs over the summits of the mountains in thick and humid vapors. The soil, which is very exuberant, is suited to the cultivation of the whole vegetable tribes. Rice is produced in the greatest abundance; a peck, or 133 pounds, may be purchased for a Spanish dollar. Every part of the island abounds with buffaloes, cows, hogs, goats, &c. It affords also great variety of fowls, and a species of duck, whose head is of a fine scarlet colour. Here is also a small breed of horses, remarkable for their spirit. The natives, however, principally employ buffaloes in the various branches of husbandry and agriculture.\n\nThe city of Magindanao is situated on the south-east side of the island, has a river capable of admitting small vessels, and carries on a considerable trade with Manila, Sooloo, Borneo and the Moluccas. Their exports are rice, tobacco, bees wax, and spices; in return for which they receive coarse cloths of Cordamand, China ware, and opium. The village or town of Sambongan is situated on the banks of a small rivulet, which empties itself immediately into the sea, and is agreeably shaded by groves of cocoa trees. The number of its inhabitants is about 1000, among which are included the officers, soldiers, and their respective families. In its environs there are several small look-out houses, erected on posts of twelve feet high, in all of which a constant guard is kept; so that it appears as if the Spaniards were in a continual state of enmity with the natives. The houses are built of those simple materials which are of very general use in the eastern seas. They are erected on posts, and built of bamboo, covered with mats; the lower apartments serve for their hogs, cattle, and poultry, and the upper ones are occupied by the family.\n\nMINDELHEIM, a town of Germany, in the circle of Suabia, and in Algow, with a castle. It is capital of a small territory between the rivers Iller and Lech, subject to the house of Bavaria. It was taken by the Imperialists after the battle of Hochstetten, who erected it into a principality in favour of the duke of Marlborough; but it returned back to the house of Bavaria by the treaty of Rastadt. It is 33 miles south-east of Ulm. E. Long. 10. 40. N. Lat. 48. 5.\n\nMINDELHEIM, a district of Germany, in Suabia, lying between the bishopric of Augsburg and the abbacy of Kempten, which is 20 miles in length and 16 in breadth.\n\nMINDEN, a considerable town of Germany, in the circle of Westphalia; and capital of a territory of the same name; seated on the river Weser, which renders it a trading place. It formerly belonged to the king of Prussia, who secularized the bishopric. It is 27 miles east by south of Osnaburg, and 37 west of Hanover. E. Long. 9. 5. N. Lat. 52. 22.\n\nMINDEN (the principality of), in Germany, lies in the circle of Westphalia, to the north of the county of Ravensburg, and along each side of the river Weser.\nMindora, It is about 22 miles square, and Minden and Petershagen are the principal places. It was formerly a bishopric, but is now secularized; and was ceded to the elector of Brandenburg by the treaty of Westphalia.\n\nMINDORA, an island of Asia, in the East Indies, and one of the Philippines, 50 miles in circumference, and separated from Luconia by a narrow channel. It is full of mountains, which abound in palm trees and all sorts of fruits. The inhabitants are idolaters, and pay tribute to the Spaniards, to whom this island belongs.\n\nMINE, in Natural History, a deep pit under ground, from whence various kinds of minerals are dug out; but the term is more particularly applied to those which yield metals. Where stones only are procured, the appellation of quarries is universally bestowed upon the places from which they are dug out, however deep they may be.\n\nThe internal parts of the earth, as far as they have been yet investigated, do not consist of one uniform substance, but of various strata or beds of substances, extremely different in their appearances, specific gravities, and chemical qualities, from one another. Neither are these strata similar to one another either in their nature or appearance in different countries; so that even in the short extent of half a mile, the strata will be found quite different from what they are in another place. As little are they the same either in depth or solidity. Innumerable cracks and fissures, by the miners called lodes, are found in every one of them; but these are so entirely different in size and shape, that it is impossible to form any inference from their size in one place to that in another. In these lodes or fissures the metallic ore is met with; and, considering the great uncertainty of the dimensions of the lodes, it is evident that the business of mining, which depends on that size, must in like manner be quite uncertain and precarious. Mr Price, in his treatise on the Cornish mines, observes, that \"the comparative smallness of the largest fissures to the bulk of the whole earth is really wonderful. In the finest pottery we can make, by a microscopic view, we may discover numerous cracks and fissures, so small as to be impenetrable by any fluid, and impervious to the naked eye; as, by the laws of nature originally imposed by the Creator, it happens that matter cannot contract itself into solid large masses, without leaving fissures between them, and yet the very fissures are as necessary and useful as the strata through which they pass. They are the drains that carry off the redundant moisture from the earth; which, but for them, would be too full of fens and bogs for animals to live or plants to thrive on. In these fissures, the several ingredients which form lodes, by the continual passing of waters, and the menstrua of metals, are brought out of the adjacent strata, collected and conveniently lodged in a narrow channel, much to the advantage of those who search for and pursue them; for if metals and minerals were more dispersed, and scattered thinly in the body of the strata, the trouble of finding and getting at them would be endless; and the expense of procuring them exceed the value of the acquisition.\n\nThe insides of the fissures are commonly coated over with a hard, crystalline, earthy substance or rind, which very often, in the breaking of hard ore, comes off along with it, and is commonly called the caps or walls of the lode; but Mr Price is of opinion, that the proper walls of the lode are the sides of the fissure itself, and not the coat just mentioned, which is the natural plaster upon those walls, furnished perhaps by the contents of the fissures, or from oozings of the surrounding strata.\n\nThe breadth of a lode is easily known by the distance betwixt the two incrusted sides of the stones of ore; and if a lode yields any kind of ore, it is a better sign that the walls be regular and smooth, or at least that one of them be so, than otherwise; but there are not many of these fissures which have regular walls until they have been sunk down some fathoms.\n\nThus the inner part of the fissure in which the ore lies, is all the way bounded by two walls of stone, which are generally parallel to one another, and include the breadth of the vein or lode. Whatever angle of inclination some fissures make in the solid strata at their beginning, they generally continue to do the same all along. Some are very uncertain in their breadth, as they may be small at their upper part and wide underneath, and vice versa. Their regular breadth, as well as their depth, is subject to great variation; for though a fissure may be many fathoms wide in one particular place, yet a little further east or west it may not perhaps be one inch wide. This excessive variation happens generally in very compact strata, when the vein or fissure is squeezed, as it were, through hard rocks which seem to compress and straiten it. A true vein or fissure, however, is never entirely obliterated, but always shows a string of metallic ore or of a veiny substance; which often serves as a leader for the miners to follow until it sometimes leads them to a large and richly impregnated part. Their length is in a great measure unlimited, though not the space best fitted for yielding metal. The richest state for copper, according to Mr Price, is from 40 to 80 fathoms deep; for tin, from 20 to 60; and though a great quantity of either may be raised at 80 or 100 fathoms, yet, \"the quality (says our author) is often too much decayed and dry for metal.\"\n\nMr Price informs us, that the fissures or veins of the Cornish mines extend from east to west; or, more properly, one end of the fissure points west and by south, or west and by north; while the other tends east and by south, or east and by north. Thus they frequently pass through a considerable tract of country with very few variations in their directions, unless they be interrupted by some intervening cause.—But, besides this east and west direction, we are to consider what the miners call the underlying or hade of the vein or lode; viz. the deflection or deviation of the fissure from its perpendicular line, as it is followed in depth like the slope of the roof of a house, or the descent of the steep side of a hill. This slope is generally to the north or south; but varies much in different veins, or sometimes even in the same vein; for it will frequently slope or underlie a small space in different ways, as it may appear to be forced by hard strata on either side.—Some of the fissures do\nnot vary much from a perpendicular, while some deviate more than a fathom; that is, for every fathom they descend in perpendicular height, they deviate likewise as much to the south or north. Others differ so much from the perpendicular, that they assume a position almost horizontal; whence they are also called horizontal or flat lodes, and sometimes lode plots. Another kind of these has an irregular position with regard to the rest; widening horizontally for a little way, and then descending perpendicularly almost like stairs, with only a small string or leader to follow after; and thus they alternately vary and yield ore in several flat or horizontal fissures. This, by the Cornish miners, is called (but in Mr Price's opinion erroneously) a floor or squat; which, properly speaking, is a hole or chasm impregnated with metal, making no continued line of direction or regular walls. Neither does a floor of ore descend to any considerable depth; for underneath it there appears no sign of a vein or fissure, either leading directly down or any other way. This kind of vein is very rare in Britain. The fissures most common in Britain are the perpendicular and inclined, whether their direction be north or south, east or west.\n\nThe perpendicular and horizontal fissures (according to our author) probably remain little altered from their first position, when they were formed at the inundation of the strata immediately after the waters left the land. The perpendicular fissures are found more commonly situated in level ground, at a distance from hills, and from the sea shore; but with regard to the latter, we find that the upper and under masses of strata differ in their solidity and other properties.\n\n\"Hence, (says our author) it is very plain, that inclined fissures owe their deflection or underlie to some secondary cause, violence, or subsidence, of the earth: for though perpendicular fissures are seldom to be seen, yet such as are inclined at very considerable depths, become more and more perpendicular, as the more central strata, by reason of the vast superincumbent weight, do not seem so likely to be driven out of their position as those which lie nearer the surface.\"\n\nThe fissures are often met with fractured as well as inclined; the reason of which, in Mr Price's opinion, has been a subsidence of the earth from some extraordinary cause. \"The original position (says he) must have been horizontal, or parallel to the surface of the earth: but we often find these strata very sensibly declined from that first position; nay, sometimes quite reversed, and changed into perpendicular. When we see a wall lean, we immediately conclude that the foundation has given way, according to the angles which the walls make with the horizon; and when we find the like declination in strata, we may conclude, by parity of reason, that there has been a like failure of what supported them, in proportion to that declination; or that whatever made the strata to fall so much awry, must also cause everything included in those strata to fall proportionally. Wherever the greatest subsidence is to the north, the top of the lode or fissure will point to the north, and of consequence underlie to the south, and vice versa: the side or heave of the lode manifests the greater subsidence of the strata; but the same lode is frequently fractured and heaved in several places, all of which, by due observation, will show us they were occasioned by many several shocks or fulminations, and that the strata were not unfooted, thicken, or brought to fall only once or twice, but several times.\"\n\nMr Price in the course of his work, observes, that though the metallic veins generally run from east to west, they are frequently intersected by veins or lodges, as he calls them, of other matters, which run from north to south. Some of these cross veins contain lead or antimony, but never tin or copper. Sometimes one of these unmetallic veins intersects the true one at right angles, sometimes obliquely; and sometimes the mixture of both is so intimate, that the most expert miners are at a loss to discover the separated part of the true vein. When this last is intercepted at right angles, it is moved either north or south, a very little way, perhaps not more than one fathom; in which case, the miners having worked to a small distance in one of these directions, if they find themselves disappointed, turn to the other hand, and seldom fail of meeting with what they expected. Sometimes they are directed in their search by the pointing of a rib or string of the true vein; but when the interruption happens in an oblique direction, the difficulty of finding the vein again is much greater.\n\nWhen two metallic veins in the neighbourhood of each other run in an oblique direction, and of consequence meet together, they commonly produce a body of ore at the place where they intersect; and if both are rich, the quantity will be considerable; but if one be poor and the other rich, then both are either enriched or impoverished by the meeting. After some time they separate again, and each will continue its former direction near to the other; but sometimes, though rarely, they continue united.\n\nIt is a sign of a poor vein when it separates or diverges into strings; but on the contrary, when several of them are found running into one, it is accounted a promising sign. Sometimes there are branches without the walls of the vein in the adjacent strata, which often come either obliquely or transversely into it. If these branches are impregnated with ore, or if they underlie faster than the true vein, that is, if they dip deeper into the ground, then they are said to overtake or come into the lode, and to enrich it; or if they do not, then they are said to go off from it, and to impoverish it. But neither these nor any other marks either of the richness or poverty of a mine are to be entirely depended upon; for many mines, which have a very bad appearance at first, do nevertheless turn out extremely well afterwards; while others, which in the beginning seemed very rich, turn gradually worse and worse: but in general, where a vein has a bad appearance at first, it will be imprudent to be at much expense with it.\n\nVeins of metal, as has been already observed, are frequently, as it were, so complicated between hard strata, that they are not an inch wide; nevertheless, if they have a string of good ore, it will generally be worth while to pursue them; and they frequently turn out well at last, after they have come into softer ground. In like manner, it is an encouragement to go on if the branches or leaders of ore enlarge either in width or depth as they are worked; but it is a bad sign if they continue horizontal without inclining downwards; though it is not proper always to discontinue the working.\ning of a vein which has an unfavourable aspect at first. Veins of tin are worth working when only three inches wide, provided the ore be good; and copper ores when six inches wide will pay very well for the working. Some of the great mines, however, have very large veins, with a number of other small ones very near each other. There are also veins, crossing one another sometimes met with, which are called contras, vulgarly counter. Sometimes two veins run down into the ground in such a manner that they meet in the direction of their depth; in which case, the same observations apply to them which are applicable to those that meet in a horizontal direction. Sometimes a vein will suddenly disappear without giving any warning, by becoming narrower, or of worse quality; which by the miners is called a shaft or leap, and is very common in the mines of Cornwall. In one day's time they may thus be disappointed in the working of a rich vein of tin, and have no further sign of anything to work upon. At the fractured extremity of their vein they perceive a body of clay or other matter; and the method of recovering their vein is to drive on the work in the direction of the former part, so that their new work shall make the same angle with the clay that the other part of the vein does. Sometimes they sink a shaft down from the surface; but it is generally a matter of difficulty to recover a vein when thus lost.\n\nThe method of discovering mines is a matter of so much difficulty, that it seems surprising how those who were totally unacquainted with the nature of metals first came to think of digging them out of the earth. According to Lucretius, the discovery was made by the conflagration of certain woods, which melted the veins of metal in the earth beneath them; but this seems rather to be improbable. Aristotle, however, is of the same opinion with Lucretius, and tells us, that some shepherds of Spain having let fire to the woods, the earth was thus heated to such a degree that the silver near the surface of it melted and flowed into a mass; and that in a short time the metallic mass was discovered by the rending of the earth in the time of an earthquake; and the same story is told by Strabo, who attributes the discovery of the mines of Andalusia to this accident. Cadmus is said by some to have been the first who discovered gold; while others ascribe this to Thoas the Thracian, to Mercury the son of Jupiter, or to Pius the king of Italy; who having left his own country, went into Egypt, where he was elected king after the death of Mizraim the son of Ham; and, on account of his discovery, was called the Golden God. Others say, that Echid or Cæacus the son of Jupiter, or Sol the son of Oceanus, was the first discoverer; but Aeschylus attributes the discovery not only of gold, but of all other metals, to Prometheus. The brass and copper mines in Cyprus were first discovered by Cinyras the son of Agryops; and Hesiod ascribes the discovery of the iron mines of Crete to the Cretan Dactyli Idaei. The extraction of lead or tin from its ore in the island of Cassiterides, according to several ancient authors, was discovered by Midacritus.—The Scripture, however, ascribes the invention of brass and iron, or at least of the methods of working them, to Tubal Cain before the flood.\n\nIn more modern times, we know that mines have been frequently discovered by accident; as in sea cliffs, among broken craggy rocks, by the washing of the tide or floods, also by irruptions and torrents of water issuing out of hills and mountains, and sometimes by the wearing of high roads. Mr Price mentions another way by which mines have been discovered, viz., by fiery eruptions; which, he says, he has heard from persons whose veracity he is unwilling to question. \"The tinners (says he) generally compare these effluvia to blazing stars or other whimsical likenesses, as their fears or hopes suggest; and search with uncommon eagerness the ground over which these jack-a-lanterns have appeared and pointed out. We have heard, but little of these phenomena for many years; whether it be, that the present age is less credulous than the foregoing, or that the ground, being more perforated by innumerable new pits sunk every year, some of which, by the statutory laws, are prevented from being filled up, has given these vapours a more gradual vent, it is not necessary to inquire, as the fact itself is not generally believed.\"\n\nMines, however, are now most commonly discovered by investigating the nature of such veins, ores, and stones as may seem most likely to turn to account; but there is a particular sagacity, or habit of judging from particular signs, which can be acquired only by long practice. Mines, especially those of copper, may also be discovered by the harsh and disagreeable taste of the waters which issue from them; though it is probable that this only happens when the ore lies above the level of the water which breaks out; for it does not seem likely that the taste of the ore could affect, unless we were to suppose a pond or lake of water standing above it. The presence of copper in any water is easily discovered by immersing in it a bit of polished iron, which will thus instantly be turned of a copper colour, by reason of the precipitation of the metal upon it. A candle, or piece of tallow put into water of this kind, will in a short time be tinged of a green colour.\n\nAnother and still more remarkable method of discovering mines is said to be by the virgula divinatoria, or \"divining rod;\" which, however incredible the stories related concerning it may be, is still relied on by some, and among others by Mr Price. It is not known who was the inventor of this method; but Agricola supposes that it took its rise from the magicians, who pretended to discover mines by enchantment. No mention is made of it, however, before the 11th century, since which time it has been in frequent use; and the Corpuscular Philosophy has even been called in to account for it. But before we pretend to account for phenomena so very extraordinary as those reported of the virgula divinatoria, it is necessary, in the first place, to determine whether or not they exist. Mr Price, as has been already hinted, believes in it, though he owns that by reason of his constitution of mind and body, he is almost incapable of co-operating with its influence. The following account, however, he gives from Mr William Cookworthy of Plymouth, a gentleman of known veracity and great chemical abilities.\n\nHe had the first information concerning this rod from one Captain Ribeira, who deserted from the Spanish service in Queen Anne's reign, and became captain-commandant in the garrison of Plymouth; in which...\nwhich town he satisfied several intelligent persons of the virtues of the rod, by many experiments on pieces of metal hid in the earth, and by an actual discovery of a copper mine near Oakhampton, which was wrought for some years. This captain very readily showed the method of using the rod in general, but would not by any means discover the secret of distinguishing the different metals by it; though, by a constant attention to his practice, Mr Cookworthy discovered it. Captain Ribeira was of opinion, that the only proper rods for this purpose were those cut from the nut or fruit trees; and that the virtue was confined to certain persons, and those, comparatively speaking, but few: but Mr Price says, that the virtue resides in all persons and in all rods under certain circumstances.\n\n\"The rod (says he) is attracted by all the metals, by coals, lime-stone, and springs of water, in the following order: 1. Gold; 2. Copper; 3. Iron; 4. Silver; 5. Tin; 6. Lead; 7. Coals; 8. Lime-stone and springs of water. One method of determining the different attractions of the rod is this: Stand, holding the rod with one foot advanced; put a guinea under that foot, and an halfpenny under the other, and the rod will be drawn down; shift the pieces of money, and the rod will be drawn towards the face, or backwards to the gold, which proves the gold to have the stronger attraction.\n\n\"The rods formerly used were shoots of one year's growth that grew forked; but it is found, that two separate shoots tied together with packthread or other vegetable substance answer rather better than such as are naturally forked, as the shoots of the latter are seldom of an equal size. They are to be tied together by the greater ends, the small ones being held in the hands. Hazel rods cut in the winter, such as are used for fishing rods, and kept till they are dry, do best; though, where these are not at hand, apple-tree suckers, rods from peach trees, currants, or the oak, though green, will answer tolerably well.\"\n\nOur author next proceeds to describe the manner of holding the rod; of which he gives a figure, as he says it is difficult to be described. The small ends being crooked, are to be held in the hands in a position flat or parallel to the horizon, and the upper part in an elevation not perpendicular to it, but at an angle of about 70 degrees. \"The rod (says he) being properly held by those with whom it will answer, when the toe of the right foot is within the semidiameter of the piece of metal or other subject of the rod, it will be repelled towards the face, and continue to be so while the foot is kept from touching or being directly over the subject; in which case it will be feebly and strongly attracted, and be drawn quite down. The rod should be firmly and steadily grasped; for if, when it has begun to be attracted, there be the least imaginable jerk or opposition to its attraction, it will not move any more till the hands are opened, and a fresh grasp taken. The stronger the grasp the livelier the rod moves, provided the grasp be steady and of an equal strength. This observation is very necessary; as the operation of the rod in many hands is defeated purely by a jerk or counteraction: and it is from thence concluded, that there is no real efficacy in the rod, or that the person who holds it wants the virtue; whereas, by a proper attention to this circumstance in using it, five persons in six have the virtue, as it is called; that is, the nut or fruit-bearing rod will answer in their hands. If a rod, or the least piece of one of the nut-bearing or fruit kind, be put under the arm, it will totally destroy the operation of the *virgula divinatoria*, in regard to all the subjects of it, except water, in those hands in which the rod naturally operates. If the least animal thread, as silk, or worsted, or hair, be tied round or fixed on the top of the rod, it will in like manner hinder its operation; but the same rod placed under the arm, or the same animal substances tied round or fixed on the top of the rod, will make it work in those hands, in which without these additions it is not attracted.\"\n\nSuch are the accounts of this extraordinary rod, to which it is probable that few will assent; and we believe the instances of mines having been discovered by it are but very rare. Another and very ancient mode of discovering mines, less uncertain than the divining rod, but extremely difficult and precarious, is that called *flooding*; that is, tracing them by loose stones, fragments, or *bodes*, which may have been separated or carried off to a considerable distance from the vein, and are found by chance in running waters, on the superficies of the ground, or a little under.—\"When the tinners (says Mr Price) meet with a loose single stone of tin ore, either in a valley or in ploughing or hedging, though at 100 fathoms distance from the vein it came from, those who are accustomed to this work will not fail to find it out. They consider, that a metallic stone must originally have appertained to some vein, from which it was severed and cast at a distance by some violent means. The deluge, they suppose, moved most of the loose earthy coat of the globe, and in many places washed it off from the upper towards the lower grounds, with such a force, that most of the backs or sides of veins which protruded themselves above the surface were hurried downwards with the common mass: whence the skill in this part of their business lies much in directing their measures according to the situation of the surface.\" Afterwards, however, our author complains that this art of *flooding*, as he calls it, is in a great measure lost.\n\nThe following account of a method of finding silver mines by Alonzo Barba seems to be similar to that of flooding just now mentioned. \"The veins of metal (says he) are sometimes found by great stones above ground; and if the veins be covered, they hunt them out after this manner; viz. taking in their hands a sort of mattock, which has a steel point at one end to dig with, and a blunt head at the other wherewith to break stones, they go to the hollows of the mountains, where the current of rain water descends, or to some other part of the skirts of the mountains, and there observe what stones they meet with, breaking in pieces those that seem to have any metal in them; whereof they find many times both middling sort of stones and small ones also of metal. Then they consider the situation of that place, and whence these stones can tumble, which of necessity must be from higher ground, and follow the track of them up the hill as long as they can find any of them,\" &c.\n\n\"Another way (says Mr Price) of discovering lodes\nis by working drifts across the country, as we call it, that is, from north to south, and vice versa. I tried the experiment in an adventure under my management, where I drove all open at grats about two feet in the shelf, very much like a level to convey water upon a mill wheel; by so doing I was sure of cutting all lodes in my way: and I did accordingly discover five courses, one of which has produced above 180 tons of copper ore, but the others were never wrought upon. This method of discovering lodes is equally cheap and certain; for 100 fathoms in shallow ground may be driven at 50s. expense.\"\n\nIn that kind of ground called by our author feasible, and which he explains by the phrase tender-standing, he tells us, that \"a very effectual, proving, and consequential way is, by driving an adit from the lowest ground, either north or south; whereby there is a certainty to cut all lodes at 20, 30, or 40 fathoms deep, if the level admits of it.\" In driving adits or levels across, north or south, to unwater mines already found, there are many fresh veins discovered, which frequently prove better than those they were driving to.\"\n\nAfter the mine is found, the next thing to be considered is, whether it may be dug to advantage. In order to determine this, we are duly to weigh the nature of the place, and its situation, as to wood, water, carriage, healthiness, and the like; and compare the result with the richness of the ore, the charge of digging, stamping, walking, and melting.\n\nParticularly the form and situation of the spot should be well considered. A mine must either happen, 1. In a mountain; 2. In a hill; 3. In a valley; or, 4. In a flat. But mountains and hills are dug with much greater ease and convenience, chiefly because the drains and burrows, that is, the adits or avenues, may be here readily cut, both to drain the water and to form gangways for bringing out the lead, &c. In all the four cases, we are to look out for the veins which the rains or other accidental thing may have laid bare; and if such a vein be found, it may often be proper to open the mine at that place, especially if the vein prove tolerably large and rich: otherwise the most commodious place for situation is to be chosen for the purpose, viz. neither on a flat, nor on the tops of mountains, but on the sides. The best situation for a mine, is a mountainous, woody, wholesome spot; of a safe easy ascent, and bordering on a navigable river. The places abounding with mines are generally healthy; as standing high, and everywhere exposed to the air; yet some places where mines are found prove poisonous, and can upon no account be dug, though ever so rich; the way of examining a suspected place of this kind, is to make experiments upon brutes, by exposing them to the effluvia or exhalations, to find the effects.\n\nDevonshire and Cornwall, where there are a great many mines of copper and tin, is a very mountainous country, which gives an opportunity in many places to make adits or subterraneous drains to some valley at a distance, by which to carry off the water from the mine, which otherwise would drown them out from getting the ore. These adits are sometimes carried a mile or two, and dug at a vast expense, as from 200l. to 400l. especially where the ground is rocky; and yet they find this cheaper than to draw up the water out of the mine quite to the top, when the water runs in plenty, and the mine is deep. Sometimes, indeed, they cannot find a level near enough to which an adit may be carried from the very bottom of the mine; yet they find it worth while to make an adit at half the height to which the water is to be raised, thereby saving half the expense.\n\nMr Coffin, considering that sometimes from small streams, and sometimes from little springs or collections of rain water, one might have a good deal of water above ground, though not a sufficient quantity to turn an overhot wheel, thought that if a sufficient fall might be had, this collection of water might be made useful in raising the water in a mine to the adit, where it may be carried off.\n\nBut now the most general method of draining mines is by the steam engine. See Steam-Engine.\n\nMine, in the military art, denotes a subterraneous canal or passage, dug under the wall or rampart of a fortification, intended to be blown up by gunpowder.\n\nThe alley or passage of a mine is commonly about four feet square; at the end of this is the chamber of the mine, which is a cavity of about five feet in width and in length, and about six feet in height; and here the gunpowder is stored. The faucisse of the mine is the train, for which there is always a little aperture left.\n\nTwo ounces of powder have been found, by experiment, capable of raising two cubic feet of earth; consequently 200 ounces, that is, 12 pounds 9 ounces, will raise 200 cubic feet, which is only 16 feet short of a cubic toise, because 200 ounces, joined together, have proportionally a great force than two ounces, as being an united force.\n\nAll the turnings a miner uses to carry on his mines, and through which he conducts the faucisse, should be well filled with earth and dung; and the masonry in proportion to the earth to be blown up, as 3 to 2. The entrance of the chamber of the mine ought to be firmly shut with thick planks, in the form of a St Andrew's cross, so that the enclosure be secure, and the void spaces shut up with dung or tempered earth. If a gallery be made below or on the side of the chamber, it must absolutely be filled up with the strongest masonry, half as long again as the height of the earth; for this gallery will not only burst, but likewise obstruct the effect of the mine. The powder should always be kept in sacks, which are opened when the mine is charged, and some of the powder fired about: the greater the quantity of earth to be raised is, the greater is the effect of the mine, supposing it to have the due proportion of powder. Powder has the same effect upon masonry as upon earth, that is, it will proportionally raise either with the same velocity.\n\nThe branches which are carried into the solidity of walls do not exceed three feet in depth, and two feet six inches in width nearly: this sort of mine is most excellent to blow up the strongest walls.\n\nThe weight of a cubic foot of powder should be 80lb.; 1 foot 1 inch cube will weigh 100lb. and 1 foot 2 inches and \\(\\frac{1}{16}\\) 150lb.; and 200lb. of powder will\nbe 1 foot 5 inches cube; however there is a diversity in this, according to the quantity of saltpetre in the gunpowder.\n\nIf, when the mines are made, water be found at the bottom of the chamber, planks are laid there, on which the powder is placed either in sacks or barrels of 100lb. each. The faucille must have a clear passage to the powder, and be laid in an auger or wooden trough, through all the branches. When the powder is placed in the chamber, the planks are laid to cover it, and others again across these; then one is placed over the top of the chamber, which is shaped for that purpose; between that and those which cover the powder, props are placed, which shore it up; some inclining towards the outside; others to the inside of the wall; all the void spaces being filled with earth, dung, brick, and rough stones. Afterwards planks are placed at the entrance of the chamber, with one across the top, whereon they buttress three strong props, whose other ends are likewise propped against another plank situated on the side of the earth in the branch; which props being well fixed between the planks with wedges, the branch should then be filled up to its entrance, with the forementioned materials. The faucilles which pass through the side branches must be exactly the same length with that in the middle, to which they join; the part which reaches beyond the entrance of the mine is that which conveys the fire to the other three; the faucilles being of equal length, will spring together.\n\nFrom a great number of experiments, it appears:\n\n1. That the force of a mine is always towards the weakest side; so that the disposition of the chamber of a mine does not at all contribute to determine this effect.\n2. That the quantity of powder must be greater or less, in proportion to the greater or less weight of the bodies to be raised, and to their greater or less cohesion; so that you are to allow for each cubic fathom\n\n| Of loose earth, | 9 or 10lb. |\n| Firm earth and strong sand, | 11 or 12 |\n| Flat clayey earth, | 15 or 16 |\n| New masonry, not strongly bound, | 15 or 20 |\n| Old masonry, well bound, | 25 or 30 |\n\n3. That the aperture, entonnoir of a mine, if rightly charged, is a cone, the diameter of whose base is double the height taken from the centre of the mine.\n4. That when the mine has been overcharged, its entonnoir is nearly cylindrical, the diameter of the upper extreme not much exceeding that of the chamber.\n5. That besides the shock of the powder against the bodies it takes up, it likewise crushes all the earth that borders upon it, both underneath and sidewise.\n\nTo charge a mine so as to have the most advantageous effect, the weight of the matter to be carried must be known; that is, the solidity of a right cone, whose base is double the height of the earth over the centre of the mine; thus, having found the solidity of the cone in cubic fathoms, multiply the number of fathoms by the number of pounds of powder necessary for raising the matter it contains; and if the cone contains matters of different weights, take a mean weight between them all, always having a regard to their degree of cohesion.\n\nAs to the disposition of mines, there is but one general rule, which is, That the side towards which one would determine the effect be the weakest; but this varies according to occasions and circumstances.\n\nThe calculation of mines is generally built upon this hypothesis, That the entonnoir of a mine is the frustum of an inverted cone, whose altitude is equal to the radius of the excavation of the mine, and the diameter of the whole lesser base is equal to the line of least resistance; and though these suppositions are not quite exact, yet the calculations of mines deduced from them have proved successful in practice; for which reason this calculation should be followed till a better and more simple be found out.\n\nM. de Valiere found that the entonnoir of a mine was a paraboloid, which is a solid generated by the rotation of a semiparabola about its axis; but as the difference between these two is very insignificant in practice, that of the frustum of a cone may be used.\n\nMINEHEAD, a town of Somersetshire, 166 miles from London. It is an ancient borough, with a harbour in the Bristol channel, near Dunster castle, much frequented by passengers to and from Ireland. It was incorporated by Queen Elizabeth, with great privileges, on condition the corporation should keep the quay in repair; but its trade failing off, the quay was neglected, and they lost their privileges. A statute was obtained in the reign of King William, for recovering the port, and keeping it in repair, by which they were to have the profits of the quay and pier for 36 years, which have been computed at about 200l. a-year; and they were at the expense of new-building the quay. In pursuance of another act, confirming the former, a new head has been built to the quay, the beach cleared, &c., so that the biggest ship may enter, and ride safe in the harbour. The town contains about 500 houses, and 2000 souls. It was formerly governed by a portreeve, and now by two constables chosen yearly at a court leet held by the lord of the manor. Its chief trade is with Ireland, from whence about 40 vessels used to come hither in a year with wool; and about 400 chaldrons of coals are yearly imported at this place, Watchet, and Porlock, from South Wales, which lies directly opposite to it about seven leagues over, the common breadth of this channel all the way from Holmes to the Land's End. Here are several rich merchants, who have some trade also to Virginia and the West Indies; and they correspond much with the merchants of Barnstaple and Bristol in their foreign commerce. Three or four thousand barrels of herrings, which come up the Severn in great shoals about Michaelmas, are caught, cured, and shipped off here every year, for the Mediterranean, &c. The market here is on Wednesday, and fair on Whitmon-Wednesday.\n\nMINERAL, in Natural History, is used in general for all fossil bodies, whether simple or compound, dug out of a mine; from whence it takes its denomination.

The rudest and most barbarous nations could not be ignorant of some of the properties of the substances which were most familiar to their observation; and mankind have made little progress in civilization, when they are entirely unacquainted with the nature of those matters from which some of the metals are extracted.\n\nPrecious stones, it seems not at all improbable, first attracted the notice of mankind. The richness of colour, brilliancy, lustre, and durability of these bodies, could not fail to excite admiration, and make them be sought after as ornaments, even by the least civilized people, and in countries where they are most abundant. They were well known, it would appear from the sacred writings, among the Jews and Egyptians in the time of Moses. At this period, however, both the Jews and Egyptians had advanced far in refinement.\n\nBut this knowledge was too limited to be dignified with the name of Mineralogy. It wanted that comprehensive, connected, and scientific view which could entitle it to that denomination. And indeed it may be said to be only of modern date that the knowledge of minerals rose to the rank of science, and assumed anything like a regular and connected form.\n\nDiocorides and Theophrastus among the Greeks, and Writers on Pliny among the Romans, have, it is true, described a few mineral bodies; and Avicenna, an Arabian philosopher and physician, who flourished in the end of the 10th and beginning of the 11th century, arranged those objects into four great classes, viz. 1. Stony bodies. 2. Saline bodies. 3. Inflammable bodies; and 4. Metals—an arrangement, which, it is curious to remark, must be well-founded; for it has been adopted, sometimes indeed with slight deviations, by almost all mineralogical writers.\nwriters since that period. But still the knowledge of minerals was bounded by very narrow limits.\n\nThe variety and value of mineral productions in Germany have excited more attention to these studies, and have thus rendered this knowledge of more interest and importance than in any other country. To Germany indeed it must be acknowledged that mineralogy is indebted in a great measure for its origin, and for a very ample share of its progressive improvement. George Agricola, a native of Milvia, in which country he settled as a physician, lived during the first half of the 16th century. Being strongly attached by inclination to the study of minerals, he removed to Chemnitz in Hungary, where he might have an opportunity of prosecuting his favourite studies; and there, by the most unrestrained application to mineralogy, and particularly to the various operations on the metals, he became the most celebrated metallurgist of his time. He is supposed to be the first German author who professedly wrote on mineral substances. The following titles chiefly comprehend the various heads into which his works on metallurgy and mineralogy are divided, De Ortu et Caufis Subterraneorum; De Natura eorum, que affluunt ex Terra; De Natura Fossilium; de Medicatis Fontibus; De Subterraneis Animalitum; De Veteribus et Novis Metalibus; and De Re Metallica. His arrangement of minerals is into two great divisions. 1. Simple or Homogeneous Minerals; and 2. Heterogeneous Minerals. The first, or simple minerals, includes four subdivisions, viz. 1. Terra; 2. Succus Concretus; 3. Lapis; 4. Metallum. The second great division, the heterogeneous minerals, comprehends two subdivisions, viz. 1. Compound minerals; 2. Mixed minerals.\n\nSeveral writers on mineralogy appeared in the course of the 17th century; and about the beginning of the 18th Becher proposed an arrangement of bodies on chemical principles, or according to their constituent parts. In the year 1736, Linnaeus published a system of mineralogy, in which mineral bodies are divided into three classes, viz. 1. Petrae; 2. Minerae; 3. Fossilia. These are subdivided into orders: the first containing three, Vitreofentes, Calcarei, Arguri; the second containing three, Salia, Sulphurea, Mercurialis; and the third also containing three, Concreta, Petrificata, Terra. Three years afterwards the system of Cramer appeared, according to which all mineral substances are arranged into seven classes, of which the following are the titles. 1. Metals; 2. Semimetals; 3. Salts; 4. Inflammable substances; 5. Stones; 6. Earths; and 7. Waters. About ten years after the first publication of the mineral system of Linnaeus, Wallerius professor of mineralogy at Upsal, and his contemporary, communicated to the world a more enlarged and improved arrangement of mineral bodies than any which had hitherto appeared. According to the system of Wallerius, all minerals are distributed into four classes, each of which is subdivided into four orders. The first class, Terra, includes the orders Macree, Pingues, Mineralae, and Arenacei; the second class, Lapides, belong the orders Calcarei, Vitreofentes, Arguri, Saxa; the third class, Minerae, comprehends the orders Salia, Sulphurea, Semimetallica and Metallica; and the fourth, Concreta, is composed of the orders Pori, Petrificata, Figurata, and Calculi.\n\nOf the systematic writers on mineralogy from the time of Linnaeus, which have now been mentioned, and of others which the limits of this historical sketch do not permit us to notice, it is to be observed, that by all of them, although the general arrangement of Avicenna was not followed, yet in the subordinate divisions his classes were adopted, and constituted some of their orders. The classes of Avicenna were not restored till Cronstedt, the time of Cronstedt, a Swedish mineralogist, in whose system, which was published in the year 1758, they resumed the place which they formerly held. The system of Cronstedt is divided into four classes, Terra, Salia, Phlogistica, and Metallica. The first class, Terra, includes nine orders, Calcaree, Siliceae, Granitinae, Argillaceae, Micaeae, Fluores, Aphyllinae, Zoolithae, and Magnesiae. To the second class, Salia, belong two orders, Acida and Alkalina. The third class, Phlogistica, consists only of one order; and the fourth class, Metallica, is composed of two orders, Metallica perfecta and Semimetallica. The system of Cronstedt, the first complete which had yet been offered to the world, and which, by comparing it with the systems accounted by some the most perfect of the present day, will be found not much different in its arrangement, continued to be read and studied for more than twenty years, and was translated into different languages. This arrangement is founded on chemical principles. The first class, for instance, is divided into nine orders already enumerated, and corresponding, as he supposed, to nine earths, of one of which the stones included in each order are chiefly composed. But as the improvements in chemical analysis led to greater accuracy of investigation, the earths which Cronstedt supposed to be simple were found to be compound. The number of simple or primitive earths was then diminished to five; and thus the number of genera, as they appeared in the Scagriographia Regni Mineralis of Bergman, published in 1782, was also five. At that period five earths only were known. The same method of constructing the genera is still followed, so that the number of genera has increased in proportion to the number of earths which have been since discovered.\n\nIn the year 1780, a translation of Cronstedt's mineral system appeared in Germany, accompanied with notes by Werner, the celebrated professor of mineralogy at Freiberg in Saxony. Six years before this time Werner had published a separate treatise on the classification of minerals, in which he exhibited his method of describing them by means of external characters. The notes on Cronstedt's system are to be considered as a farther illustration of this method, as well as a catalogue of minerals belonging to Paul Von Ohain, which was drawn up by the same naturalist and published in 1791. In Germany the method of Werner, we believe, is almost exclusively adopted; and it is chiefly followed in most other countries, France excepted, where mineralogical knowledge is also greatly cultivated.\n\nMr Kirwan first introduced the knowledge of this system into Britain, in his treatise on mineralogy published in 1784; and about ten years afterwards it was still farther elucidated by the same author in an improved and enlarged edition of that work. In preparing the latter edition, Mr Kirwan enjoyed the peculiar advantage of consulting one of the completest and best arranged collections of minerals which had yet been made in any country. This is the Leakean collection of fossils, which Mr Kirwan pronounces to be the most perfect monument of mineralogical ability now extant.\nThat the possession of this cabinet, Mr Kirwan proceeds to state, should escape the vigilance of the most learned nations, and fall to the lot of Ireland, hitherto so inattentive to matters of this nature, was little to be expected. Through the active zeal however of two of its most enlightened patriots (A), and the influence secured to them by former services of the most essential nature, the funds requisite for its purchase, and for building a repository to receive it, were obtained.*\n\nThis splendid and extensive collection, we are farther informed, was made by Leifke whose name it now bears, and who was one of the earliest and most eminent of the disciples of Werner. It was arranged between the years 1782 and 1787, according to the principles of Werner, and with his assistance. After the death of Mr Leifke, a catalogue was drawn up by Karlten another of Werner's disciples. This catalogue in its arrangement corresponds to the arrangement of the cabinet, which is divided into five parts.\n\nThe first part, which is denominated the characteristic part, consists of 550 specimens. These are intended for the illustration of the external characters or the principles of the classification.\n\nThe second, which is the systematic or crytognostic part, comprehends all simple minerals distributed according to their genera and species agreeable to the method then followed by Werner. This part contains 3268 specimens.\n\nThe third part, which is called the geognostic or geological, includes the substances found in the different kinds of rocks, as they are divided into primitive, transition, stratiform, alluvial, and volcanic mountains. This part of the collection is peculiarly rich in petrifications; and the whole number of specimens which it contains extends to 1100.\n\nThe fourth part is intended to illustrate the mineralogy of every country on the globe, by exhibiting its mineral productions. The order of arrangement of this part is from America to Asia, Europe, and Africa. As there are many countries yet unexplored, it is the most imperfect division of the whole collection; and indeed, as Mr Kirwan observes, it can only be completed by national opulence.\n\nThe fifth part is called the economical collection. It is formed of 474 specimens of minerals which are employed in arts and manufactures, as in architecture, sculpture, agriculture, jewellery, colouring, dyeing, clothing, pottery, glazing, enamelling, polishing of metals, furnace building, medicine, metallurgy, &c. The whole cabinet consists of 7331 specimens.\n\nSuch is the valuable source from which Mr Kirwan derived the information detailed in his system of mineralogy. And here we are led to throw out a hint that the friends of this science could not more effectually promote its knowledge, and encourage its progress, than by establishing similar collections wherever it is taught and studied. But patriotism and power are unfortunately often directed to deeds of splendour and magnificence, than they are occupied in forming and accomplishing the humbler and more permanent plans of national utility.\n\nBut to resume our narrative of the history of mineralogy, we cannot help expressing our regret that Mr Kirwan has never found it convenient to revise and improve his system as he might have done, aided by the immense stock of mineralogical knowledge which has been accumulated since its first publication. This is the more to be regretted, because, notwithstanding the rapid progress of the science, and the great improvements which the system of Werner has received, no good or even tolerable account of it has yet appeared in the English language.\n\nFrance, where many branches of natural history have long flourished, has contributed largely to the science of mineralogy. Even the period of war, which at first sight would appear to be extremely adverse to the tranquil pursuits of knowledge, has in this case proved peculiarly favourable to the study of mineralogy in that kingdom. The knowledge of minerals has not only been encouraged and promoted in France, by being forced to direct her attention to her own resources, while her intercourse with other countries from which she derived various commodities indissolubly necessary for economical purposes was interrupted; but also by the subjugation to her overgrown power, of those parts of Europe where mineralogy has been most cultivated and improved, thus affording every facility of correspondence, and rendering accessible those mineral treasures which exhibit the best and fullest illustration of the science. The French government, indeed, whatever form it may have assumed, has invariably been impressed with the importance of mineralogy; and even during the horrors of revolution, has never failed to promote its progress, by forming and supporting extensive collections, and establishing able and enlightened teachers at the expense of the nation.\n\nOf the works on mineralogy which have appeared in France, we shall only mention the treaties of Brochant, Hauy, and Brongniart. They are the sources from which the information in the following treatise is chiefly derived, and they may be recommended as the best guides to the study of this department of natural history.\n\nThe system of Brochant is formed entirely on the principles of Werner's classification, and is undoubtedly the most perspicuous account of the system of the German mineralogist which has yet been published. The principles on which the elaborate and ingenious method of arrangement proposed by the celebrated Hauy have been already detailed. (See Crystallization.)\n\nHere we shall only remark that the study of the regular forms of minerals with a view to methodical arrangement was successfully prosecuted by Bergman and Romé de Lisle; but has been extended and carried to the highest degree of perfection by the sagacity, profound physical knowledge, and mathematical address of the Abbé Hauy. But although the mineral system of Hauy this distinguished philosopher be founded on characters the most certain and the most uniformly permanent, yet\n\n(A) The Right Honourable John Forster late Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, and the Right Honourable W. B. Cunningham.\nMINERALOGY.\n\nHistory. It may be doubted whether the previous knowledge necessary to understand it, and in some cases the difficulty of applying its principles in ascertaining some of the most essential characters, may not preclude this work from being so generally and practically useful as other systems. The scientific mineralogist however will always regard it as a monument of indefatigable industry and patient research which has rarely been equalled, and will derive from it the most material aid in his studies.\n\nThe system of Hauy consists of four classes. I. The first class consists of substances which are composed of an acid united to an earth or an alkali, and sometimes to both; and it contains three orders; 1. Earths combined with an acid; 2. Alkalies combined with an acid; and, 3. Earths and alkalies combined with an acid. II. This class includes only earthy substances, but sometimes combined with an alkali. It constitutes the siliceous genus of other systems. III. The third class comprehends combustible substances which are not metals. It is divided into two orders; the first containing simple, and the second compound combustibles. IV. The metals form the fourth class. It is divided into three orders, which are characterized by different degrees of oxidation. Besides these classes there are three appendices. The first contains those substances whose nature is not sufficiently known to have their places accurately assigned in the system. The second appendix includes aggregates of different mineral substances. It is divided into three orders. The first treats of primitive rocks; the second of secondary and tertiary rocks; and the third of breccias. The third appendix is devoted to the consideration of volcanic products. This is divided into six classes; but it is to be observed, that the volcanic products of this mineralogist comprehend, not only such substances as are universally allowed to have a volcanic origin, but also basalts, traps, and other minerals, the origin of which is still questioned.\n\nThe system of Brongniart takes a wider range than other systems, including substances which are not treated of by writers on mineralogy. It is divided into five classes. The first contains those substances, excluding the metals, which are combined with oxygen. It contains two orders; the first including air and water, and the second the acids. The second class, which treats of saline bodies, is divided into two orders: the first comprehends the alkaline salts, and the second the earthy salts. The third class, containing the stones, is divided into three orders: the first, hard stones; the second magnesian; and the third argillaceous. The fourth class contains the combustible substances, which are divided into two orders; first compound, and second, simple combustibles. The fifth class includes the metals, which are divided into two orders; first, the brittle, and second the ductile metals. The treatise of Brongniart, notwithstanding some peculiarities in the classification which are not quite familiar to us, will be found one of the most useful that has hitherto appeared, not only on account of the accuracy of the descriptions, which are divested of every kind of redundancy, but also on account of the interesting geological divisions which are introduced, as well as numerous and important practical details in metallurgy and other useful arts.\n\nThe following treatise will be divided into two parts. The first part will contain the classification and description of minerals; and the second part will be destined to the analysis of minerals and to metallurgy, or the method of extracting metals from their ores.\n\nPART I. OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS.\n\nThe method to be followed in this treatise is nearly that of Werner, all the material parts of which we shall freely borrow from the work of Brochant already noticed, as the best on the subject which we have had an opportunity of consulting. We shall however occasionally avail ourselves of any useful information which may be derived from the mineralogy of Kirwan, Brongniart, and Hauy; and in particular we shall insert the essential characters of the species given by the latter.\n\nThe universal characters employed by Werner in the description of minerals are seven in number: 1. Colour; 2. Cohesion; 3. Unctuousness; 4. Coldness; 5. Weight; 6. Smell; 7. Taste. The table and the illustrations which follow are chiefly taken from Weaver's translation of Werner's treatise on that subject.\n\nIn the following table is exhibited the arrangement of the generic external characters of fossils.\n### Part I.\n\n#### MINERALOGY.\n\n**Common Generic External Characters.**\n\nI.

In deriving the characters of minerals from colour, three things are considered: 1. The several principal colours, with their varieties. 2. The shade of colour. 3. The tarnished colours.\n\n---\n\n**I. Principal Colours.**\n\nThe several principal colours are not derived from the division of the solar ray by means of the prism, but are such as are considered simple in common life. The principal colours are the eight following; viz. white, gray, black, blue, green, yellow, red, and brown.\n\nA. **WHITE** is the first principal colour, and it includes the following eight varieties.\n\n1. **Snow white**, as snow white quartz, white lead ore, Carrara marble.\n\n2. **Reddish**\n2.

Red is the seventh principal colour, and it includes the following 15 varieties:\n\n1. Morning or aurora red, as in red lead ore, red orpiment.\n\n2. Hyacinth red, as in the hyacinth, and a variety of brown blende.\n\n3. Brick red, as in porcelain jasper.\n\n4. Scarlet red, as in light red cinnabar.\n\n5. Copper red, as in native copper.\n\n6. Blood red, as in Bohemian garnet, and red carnelian.\n\n7. Carmine red, as in red copper ore, and clear red cinnabar.\n\n8. Cochineal red, as in cinnabar, sometimes jasper, and red quartz.\n\n9. Crimson red, as in ruby, oriental garnet, and red cobalt ore.\n\n10. Columbine red, as in precious garnet, and red cobalt ore.\n\n11.

Peach blossom red, as in striated and earthy red cobalt ores.\n\n14. Cherry red, as in red antimony ore and ruby.\n\n15. Brownish red, as in red argillaceous iron stone, and red earthy iron stone.\n\nH. Brown is the eighth and last of the principal colours. It is divided into the eight following varieties:\n\n1. Reddish brown, as in brown tin stone, and brown blende.\n\n2. Clove brown, as in rock crystal, brown iron ore, and thunderestone.\n\n3. Hair brown, as in wood tin ore from Cornwall.\n\n4. Yellowish brown, as in brown iron ochre and jasper.\n\n5. Tombac brown, or pinchbeck brown, as in brown mica.\n\n6. Wood brown, as in bituminous wood, a variety of asbestos.\n\n7. Liver brown, as in brown cobalt ore, and brown jasper.\n\n8. Blackish brown, as in lowland argillaceous iron ore, mineral pitch, and bituminous wood.\n\nII. Shade or Intensity of Colour.\n\nColours may be determined by the relation in which they stand to each other with regard to intensity or shade. Thus among the principal colours, there are some which are light, as white and yellow; and some which are dark, as blue and black; and besides, the varieties of the principal colours differ from each other in respect to shade. Thus among the blue colours, indigo blue is dark, azure blue clear, and sky blue light; and even the varieties may afford a diversity of shade, as, for instance, clear canary green, light canary green.\n\nHere it ought to be remarked, that the peculiar shade of colour in a mineral is frequently owing to its greater or less transparency, the paleness being in proportion to the degree of transparency, and the darkness to the degree of opacity. The degree of lustre also in minerals produces great variety in the shade of colour.\n\nIn discriminating the shade or intensity of colour, four degrees have only in general been adopted. These are the following: 1. Dark. 2. Clear. 3. Light. 4. Pale.\n\n1. Dark, as in Bohemian garnet, which is dark blood red.\n\n2. Clear, as in green hornstone, which is clear mountain green.\n\n3. Light, as in red carnelian, which is light blood red.\n\n4. Pale, as in aquamarine, which is pale mountain green.\n\nIII. Tarnished Colours.\n\nTarnished colours afford peculiar characteristic marks of many minerals. By tarnishing, is meant a difference in the colour of the surface after exposure to the air from what the fresh fracture of the mineral exhibits. Some minerals are always found tarnished in their natural position in the earth, as in common galena, gray ore of antimony and blende; some tarnish on every fresh fracture being made, as in native arsenic and copper pyrites; while others are tarnished in both cases, as in native arsenic, and purple copper ore.\n\nThe colours of tarnished minerals are divided into:\n\n1. Simple, and 2. Variegated.\n\n1. Simple Tarnished Colours afford five varieties.\n\na. Gray is the tarnished colour of white cobalt ore, and steel gray of brown hematites.\n\nb. Black is the tarnished colour of native arsenic, brown hematites, and gray cobalt ore.\n\nc. Brown is the tarnished colour of native silver, which is white.\n\nd. Reddish, of native bismuth, the fresh fracture of which is silver white.\n\ne. Yellowish, of white cobalt ore, and argentiferous arsenical pyrites.\n\n2. Variegated Tarnished Colours include four varieties.\n\na. Pavonine tarnished, as in copper pyrites, purple copper ore and common pyrites.\n\nb. Iridescent tarnished, as in gray antimonial ore, galena, specular iron ore.\n\nc. Columbine tarnished, as in copper pyrites.\n\nd. Steel coloured tarnished, as in gray cobalt ore.\n\nIV. The Play of Colour.\n\nThe play of colour in a mineral can only be observed in sunshine or in a strong light. By this is understood that property which some minerals possess of refracting from particular spots the different rays of light. This effect is produced by the peculiar association of the molecules of the mineral, and the various degrees of its transparency. Accidental causes, however, produce a similar effect, such as flight rifts, cracks, &c.\n\nThe play of colour is remarkable in the diamond and in the opal, and sometimes in rock crystal.\n\nV. The Mutable Reflection of Colour.\n\nThis is distinguished from the play of colour by the mineral exhibiting in the same spot a change of colour according to the position of its surface being varied, producing a different angle with the incident rays of light. This change takes place, 1. On the surface; 2. Internally.\n\n1. The superficial mutable reflection is finely exemplified in Labrador stone, and in a variety of marble which contains petrified shells.\n\n2. The internal mutable reflection of colour appears in cat's eye, precious opal, and moonstone.\n\nVI. The Mutation of Colour.\n\nThis is distinguished from the tarnish; in which latter the surface only undergoes a change of colour, but in the mutation of colour, the effect penetrates the mineral, and sometimes pervades the whole. This affords two varieties.\n\n1. The fading of colour.—By this is meant that the colour of a mineral becomes paler when it is exposed to the light, heat, or is undergoing decomposition. Examples of these changes may be observed in striated red cobalt ore, which exposed to the air becomes pale brownish; blue fluor spar becomes green; chrysoprase becomes light green; pearl gray silver ore becomes clear brown.\n\n2. The perfect change of colour is often the consequence of fading, when one colour is lost, and a new one:\nVII. Delineations of Colours.\n\nThe delineations of colours are observed on simple minerals, the same specimen containing several colours, which pass through its interior, according to certain delineations. Of these delineations the following nine varieties are described.\n\n1. Dotted, when fine points of another colour are dispersed over the surface, as in serpentine, and some varieties of jasper.\n\n2. Spotted, when the points or spots are of the size of a lentil to that of a sixpence, or from one-fourth to one inch in diameter. The spots are round and regular, or irregular.\n\n   a. Regular, as in some varieties of serpentine, and in argillaceous schistus.\n\n   b. Irregular, as in a variety of marble from Bayreuth.\n\n3. Nebulous or cloudy, when the spots are large and irregular, forming with the ground colour the appearance of clouds, as in calcedony and jasper.\n\n4. Flamy, when the spots are large, and drawn in one direction to a sharp point, as in striped jasper and some marbles.\n\n5. Striped, when large spots are drawn in the same direction, and run parallel through the whole specimen. There are two varieties.\n\n   a. Straight or curved striped, as in straight striped jasper.\n\n   b. Broad or linear, as in linear striped agate, calcedony, &c.\n\n6. Annular, when the stripes form concentric circles, as in jasper, carnelian, and flints.\n\n7. Dendritic, when the delineation resembles the trunk of a tree separating into ramifications, as in steatites, some limestones, Egyptian marble, and calcedony.\n\n8. Ruinous, when the delineation presents the appearance of ruins, as in Florentine or landscape marble.\n\n9. Veined, when the delineation consists of variously coloured narrow stripes, crossing each other in different directions, forming sometimes the appearance of a net, as in marble, serpentine, and jasper.\n\nII. THE COHESION OF THE PARTICLES.\n\nThe cohesion of the particles in minerals is the second common generic character, which is observed by the sight, and also by the touch. According to this property, minerals are divided into solid, friable, and fluid; but these properties also belong to the particular generic characters of minerals, to be afterwards described.\n\nParticular Generic External Characters of Solid Minerals.\n\nI. The External Appearance.\n\nIn the external appearance of a mineral, three things are to be observed, the external form, the external surface, and the external lustre.\n\n1. The external form of a mineral is that figure or shape of the natural surface, which its primitive individuals are found to possess. The external forms of solid minerals are distinguished into common, particular, regular or crystallized, and extraneous.\n\n1. Common External Shape.\n\nWhen a mineral exhibits no resemblance to any known substances in common life, it is said to be of a common form. Of common forms there are six kinds.\n\nA. Massive, when a mineral is of an indeterminate form, or amorphous, and of nearly equal dimensions, from the size of a hazel nut to the greatest magnitude, and when it is incorporated with another solid mineral, it is said to be massive. Solid minerals are most frequently found of this external form, and some are never found otherwise, as in steatites, common pit-coal, galena, and copper pyrites.\n\nB. Disseminated, or interspersed, when a mineral, without any particular form, is in small pieces not exceeding the size of a hazel nut, incorporated with another solid mineral. This affords three varieties.\n\n   a. Coarsely interspersed, in size of a hazel nut to that of a pea, as in copper pyrites.\n\n   b. Finely interspersed, from the size of a pea to that of a grain of millet, as in tintstone, in granular quartz.\n\n   c. Minutely interspersed, from the size of a grain of millet till it is scarcely perceptible to the eye, as in interspersed native gold.\n\nC. In angular pieces, of which there are two varieties.\n\n   a. Sharp-cornered, as in calcedony and in quartz.\n\n   b. Blunt-cornered, as in common opal.\n\nD. In grains. Detached minerals, from the size of a hazel nut to that which may be distinguished by the eye, are said to be in grains. These are distinguished,\n\na. According to size, into\n\n   a. In grofs grains from the size of a hazel nut to that of a pea, as in lowland argillaceous iron ore.\n\n   b. Large grains, from the size of a pea to that of a hemp seed, as in precious garnet, magnetic iron sand.\n\n   c. Small grains, from the size of hemp seed to that of millet, as in the above minerals.\n\nb. In minute or fine grains, such as are smaller than millet seeds, as platina, native gold, tintstone.\n\n   a. According to the form, which is in\n\n      a. Angular grains, as in magnetic iron sand.\n\n      b. Rounded grains, as in platina and native gold.\n\n   c. According as they inhore in other minerals. In this respect they are, a. Loose, b. Partially, or y. Wholly.\n\nE. In plates, distinguished into\n\n   a. Thick plates, as in red silver ore.\n\n   b. Thin plates, as in vitreous silver ore.\n\nF. In membranes or flakes, when the thickness does not much exceed that of paper, divided into,\n\n   a. Thick, as in native silver.\n\n   b. Thin, as in iron pyrites.\n\n   c. Very thin, as in vitreous silver ore.\n\n2. Particular External Forms.\n\nThe forms which come under this denomination exhibit a greater or less resemblance, both to natural and artificial objects. They are called particular, because, like the former, they are not usual or common.\nThere are five kinds of particular external forms, viz., elongated, rounded, flattened, imprelled, and confused.\n\nA. Elongated. Of this there are 11 varieties.\n   a. Deniform, as in native silver, and dendiform vitreous silver ore.\n   b. Filiform, as in native silver, and vitreous silver ore.\n   c. Capillary, resembling hairs, as in native gold and native silver.\n   d. Reticulated, as in native silver, native copper, and a variety of galena.\n   e. Dendritic, which is either regular or irregular, as in native silver and native copper.\n   f. Coralliform, as in calcareous stalactites, commonly known by the name of flor ferri, and brown haematites.\n   g. Stalactiform, as in calcareous sinter, brown iron stone, and calcedony.\n   h. Tubuliform, as in compact brown iron stone, and galena.\n   i. Fissuliform, as in martial pyrites.\n   k. Frutelecent, or arbustiform, as in black iron stone, and compact gray ore of manganese.\n   l. Matrafiform, having the figure of a chemical matrix, as in black haematites, and gray ore of manganese.\n\nB. Rounded, of which there are five varieties.\n   a. Botryiform, resembling a bunch of grapes, as in black cobalt ore, malachite, and copper pyrites.\n   b. Globular, of which there are five varieties.\n      a. Perfectly globular, as in pisolite, and white cobalt ore.\n      b. Elliptical, as in quartz and flint.\n      c. Amygdaloid, as in zeolite and green earth.\n      d. Spheroidal, as in Egyptian jasper and calcedony.\n      e. Imperfectly globular, as in carnelian and calcedony.\n      f. Kidneyform, as in red haematites, native arsenic, and malachite.\n      g. Bulbous or nodular, as in nodular flint and martial pyrites.\n      h. Liquiform, as in a singular variety of galena, from Freyberg.\n\nC. Flattened. Of the particular forms of this denomination there are three kinds.\n   a. Specular, as in compact galena, and compact red ironstone.\n   b. In laminae or leaves, which form is peculiar to metals, as in native gold and silver.\n   c. Pectinated, as in quartz from Schemnitz.\n\nD. Impressed. Particular forms of these afford six varieties.\n   a. Cellular, of which there are several kinds, as,\n      a. Straight cellular, which presents two varieties.\n         1. Hexahedral, as in quartz; 2. Polyhedral, as in cellular quartz and calcareous spar.\n      b. Round cellular, as,\n         1. Parallel round, as in quartz; 2. Spongiiform, as also in quartz; 3. Indeterminate, as in brown iron stone; 4. Double, as in quartz and hepatic pyrites; 5. Veiny, as in white cobalt ore.\n   b. With impressions, which are,\n      a. Cubical, as in quartz and fluor spar.\n      b. Pyramidal, as in quartz, fluor spar, and vitreous silver ore.\n   c. Conical, as in native arsenic and quartz.\n   d. Tabular or prismatic, as in quartz.\n   e. Globular, as in vitreous silver ore.\n\nc. Perforated, as in lowland argillaceous iron ore.\nd. Corroded, as in quartz, galena, and vitreous silver ore.\ne. Heteromorphous, as in native iron, swampy iron ore, and native arsenic.\nf. Vesicular, as in lavas, pumice stones, basalt and wacken.\n\nE. Confused, of which there is only one variety.\n   a. Ramose, as in native iron, sometimes native copper, and vitreous silver ore.\n\n3. Regular External Forms or Crystallizations.\n\nIn describing crystallizations or regular forms of minerals, four things are to be considered; the essential quality of the crystals; the form, aggregation, and magnitude.\n\nA. The Essential Quality of Crystals, which is either genuine or spurious.\n   a. Genuine or true crystals, which are the most common, as in calcareous and fluor spar.\n   b. Spurious or after crystals, which are distinguished from true crystals by being hollow, having a rough or drusy surface, and the solid angles or edges never sharp or well defined. Examples are found in quartz of the spurious crystals of the cube, and of the octahedron of fluor spar.\n\nB. Form of Crystals. This is the most conspicuous property of crystals, and commonly serves as a distinctive character of those minerals which have regular forms. The form of crystals is composed of planes; of edges formed by the junction of two planes; of determinate angles, and of solid angles formed by the union of three or more planes in one point.\n\na. In the form of crystals, the primary or fundamental forms are first to be considered, and then the variations or modifications of these forms.\n\nI. The Parts of the Primary Form are,\n   1. Planes, which are either\n      a. Lateral planes, forming the confines of the body towards its smallest extent; or, b. Extreme or terminal planes, which form the confines of the body towards its greatest extent.\n   2. Edges, which are,\n      a. Lateral edges, or, b. Extreme edges.\n   3. Solid angles, which have been described above.\n\nII. Kinds of Primary Forms, which are the seven following,\n\n1. The Icosahedron, which is composed of 20 equilateral triangular planes, united under equal angles, as in iron pyrites.\n2. The Dodecahedron, which is composed of twelve regular pentangular planes, united under equal obtuse angles, as in iron pyrites, and white cobalt ore.\n3. The Hexahedron, including the cube and the rhomb, is composed of six quadrilateral planes, as in calcareous spar, fluor spar, iron pyrites, galena, &c.\n4. The Prism, which is one of the most common crystallizations among minerals, is composed of an indeterminate number of quadrangular lateral planes, having the same direction, and all terminating in two extreme planes, each of which has as many sides as the crystallization possesses lateral planes; as in various lead ores, rock crystal, topaz, and fluor.\n5. The Pyramid is composed of an indeterminate number of triangular, lateral planes, converging to a point,\npoint, and of a base having as many sides as the crystallization has lateral planes; as in quartz, calcareous spar, and amethyst.\n\n6. The Table, which is composed of two parallel lateral planes, much larger in comparison than the other planes; the extreme planes being indeterminate in number, small, and narrow; as in tabular crystallized specular iron ore, calcareous spar, and heavy spar.\n\n7. The Lens, consists of two lateral planes only, differing according as the lateral planes are differently curved. Of this there are two kinds: 1. The common lens, composed of two convex lateral planes; and 2. The spheriform, consisting of one convex and one lateral plane, somewhat resembling a saddle. Crystals of both kinds are observed in sparry iron ore and calcareous spar.\n\nIII. Differences in each kind of primary forms.\n\nThese primary forms differ from each other according to simplicity, position, number of planes, size of the planes, angles under which they meet, direction of the planes, and fulness of the crystal.\n\n1. Simplicity. This distinction is confined to the pyramid, which is either,\n\nA. Simple, as in light red silver ore, gray copper ore, quartz, amethyst; and\n\nB. Double, in which those of the one pyramid are either,\n\na. Set on the lateral planes of the other, and this a. directly, or b. obliquely; or b. on the lateral edges of the other. Examples of this are observed in double pyramidal vitreous silver ore, galena, rock crystal, ruby, and diamond.\n\n2. Position, which is either\n\nA. Erect, which is very common; or B. Inverted, which has only been observed in simple hexahedral pyramidal crystals of calcareous spar.\n\n3. Number of planes, in the primary form, is in some determinate, and in the others variable. Here are to be considered,\n\nA. The kind of planes, as\n\na. In the prism and pyramid, in which the lateral planes vary; and, b. In the table, in which the extreme planes vary.\n\nB. The number of planes, which in the prism and pyramid are found,\n\na. Trihedral, having three planes, as in the trihedral prism of flint, and the trihedral pyramid of gray copper ore.\n\nb. Tetrahedral, having four planes, as in the tetrahedral prism of arsenical pyrites, and in the double tetrahedral pyramid of ruby and galena.\n\nc. Hexahedral, as in the hexahedral prism and pyramid of calcareous spar.\n\nd. Octahedral, as in the octahedral prism of topaz; and in the double octahedral pyramid of garnet and zeolite.\n\nThe table occurs,\n\na. Quadrangular, having four extreme planes, as in heavy spar, yellow lead ore, and calamine.\n\nb. Hexagonal, having six extreme planes, as in mica and heavy spar.\n\nc. Octagonal, or with eight extreme planes, as in yellow lead ore and heavy spar.\n\n4. The size of the planes in relation to each other, which are said to be\n\nA. Equal, or\n\nB. Unequal; and this latter is either indeterminate, or determinate.\n\na. Indeterminate, which is observed in the lateral planes of the hexahedral prism of rock crystal.\n\nb. Determinately unequal, as in prismatic white lead ore, and hexahedral prismatic calcareous spar. In this latter the following varieties are observed.\n\nα. Alternately broad and narrow. β. The two opposite broader; and, γ. The two opposite narrower.\n\n5. Angles under which the planes are associated. These are angles of the lateral edges, of the extreme edges, and of the summit.\n\nA. Angles of the lateral edges. These are,\n\na. Equiangular, as in the icohedral crystals of iron pyrites.\n\nb. Rectangular, as in cubical fluor spar.\n\nc. Oblique angular, as in rhombohedral calcareous spar.\n\nd. Unequiangular, as in the hexahedral prism of rock crystal, and in the octahedral prism of topaz.\n\nB. Angles of the extreme edges are,\n\na. Equiangular, as in the hexagonal table of mica.\n\nb. Rectangular, as in the quadrangular table of heavy spar.\n\nc. Oblique angular, which is either, α. Parallel, as in the tetrahedral prism of feldspar; or, β. Alternate oblique angular, as in copper pyrites.\n\nd. Unequiangular, as in the hexagonal table of prehnite.\n\nC. Angles of the summit, which are confined to the pyramid, and present the following varieties.\n\na. Very obtuse, when the angle is from 150° to 130°, as in tourmaline.\n\nb. Obtuse, when the angle is from 130° to 110°, as in calcareous spar.\n\nc. Rather obtuse, from 110° to 90°, as in honey stone.\n\nd. Rectangular, as in zircon.\n\ne. Rather acute, from 90° to 70°, as in quartz.\n\nf. Acute, from 70° to 50°, as in calcareous spar.\n\ng. Very acute, from 50° to 30°, as in sapphire.\n\n6. The direction of the lateral planes. These are either straight or curved.\n\nA. Straight planes are even surfaces, and are the most common.\n\nB. Curved planes are distinguished according to position and form.\n\na. Position, which is, α. Inwardly curved or concave; or, β. Outwardly curved or convex; and, γ. Inwardly and outwardly curved, or concave and convex. The first is observed in fluor spar, the second in diamond, and the third in sparry iron stone.\n\nb. The form is either, α. Spherical, as in brown spar; β. Cylindrical, in which the curvature runs,\n\n1. Parallel to the sides, as in iron pyrites, or, 2. Parallel to the diagonal, as in fluor spar; and, γ. Conical, as in gypsum.\n\n7. The fulness of the crystal. Crystals are either full and perfect, or hollowed at the extremity, or throughout.\n\nA. Full or perfect crystals, which is most commonly the case.\n\nB. Hollowed.\nPart I.\n\nB. Hollowed at the extremity, as in calcareous spar, green lead ore, &c.\n\nC. Hollow through the whole crystal, as in prismatic beryl.\n\n§ Modifications of the primary form.\n\nThe changes or alterations which take place on the principal or fundamental form, are three; truncation, bevelling, and acumination.\n\nI. Truncation. In the truncation are to be considered the parts and the determination.\n\n1. The parts of the truncation are the planes, the edges, and the angles.\n\n2. The determination of the truncation relates to,\n\na. Its situation as it occurs at the angles or edges of the primary form.\n\nb. Its magnitude, which, in relation to the planes of the primary form, is small or large; in the one case the angles or edges are said to be slightly, in the other deeply truncated.\n\nc. The application of the truncation, which is either direct or oblique. The edges of cubical iron pyrites afford an example of oblique truncation.\n\nd. The direction of the truncation, which presents either an even or a curved surface.\n\nII. Bevelling, in which the parts and determination are also to be considered.\n\n1. The parts of the bevelling are, the planes, the edges, and the angles. The bevelling edges are distinguished into the proper bevelling edge, which is formed by the conjunction of the bevelling planes, and the bevelling edges formed by the junction of the bevelling planes with the lateral planes of the primary form.\n\n2. The determination of the bevelling, in which is to be observed,\n\nA. Its situation as it takes place, a. At the extreme planes, which is confined to the prism and table; b. At the edges, which is met with in the hexahedron, prism, pyramid, and table; and, c. At the angles, which is a very rare occurrence.\n\nB. Its magnitude, which is said to be slight or deep.\n\nC. The angle under which the bevelling planes conjoin, which is said to be, a. Acutely, b. Rectangularly, or, c. Obtusely bevelled.\n\nD. The continuation of the bevelling, which is either uninterrupted, or interrupted. Of the latter case there are two varieties, when it is once or twice interrupted. The lateral edges of double trihedral pyramidal calcareous spar are once interruptedly bevelled; and the obtuse extreme edges of quadrangular tabular heavy spar, are twice interruptedly bevelled.\n\nE. The application, a. Of the bevelling itself, which is either direct or oblique (the former is the most common, and the latter occurs in prismatic basaltic hornblende); and, b. Of the bevelling plates, which are set, either on the lateral planes, or on the lateral edges.\n\nIII. The acumination, in which are also to be considered the parts of the acumination and the determination.\n\n1. The parts of the acumination consist of,\n\nA. The acuminating planes. B. The acuminating edges: which are distinguished into, a. Proper edges of acumination, formed by the junction of the acuminating planes; b. The extreme edges of acumination; c. The edges between the acuminating and lateral planes. C. The angles of acumination.\n\n2. The determination of the acumination relating to,\n\nA. Its situation, as it occurs at, a. The solid angles; or, b. At the extreme planes of the primary form. The acumination of the prism is always at the extreme planes; of the cube usually at the angles, and of the pyramid generally at the summit.\n\nB. The planes themselves, in which are to be observed,\n\na. Their number, which is either equal to, or fewer than those of the primary form. In the hexahedral prism of calcareous spar and garnet, and in the trihedral prism of tourmaline, the acumination is by three planes; in the tetrahedral prism of jargon and hyacinth, by four planes; in the hexahedral prism of calcareous spar and rock crystal, by six planes; and in tetrahedral prismatic topaz, by eight planes.\n\nb. Their relative size, which is either equal or unequal. In quartz and rock crystal, the planes of acumination are generally indeterminately unequal; and in heavy spar they are determinately equal.\n\nc. Their form, which is determinate, as in hyacinth and calcareous spar; or indeterminate, as in jargon and wolfram.\n\nd. Their application, which is either on the lateral planes of the primary form, as in jargon and hyacinth, or on the lateral edges, as in calcareous spar and garnet.\n\nC. The summit of the acumination, which is, a. Obtuse, as in hexahedral prismatic garnet; b. Rectangular, as in tetrahedral prismatic jargon; or, c. Acute, as in hexahedral prismatic calcareous spar.\n\nD. The magnitude of the acumination, which is said to be, a. Slightly acuminated, as in gray copper ore and copper pyrites; or, b. Deeply, as in fluor spar, with the angles acuminated by 6 planes.\n\nE. Determination of the acumination; which is either a point or a line. The first is the most common; and the last is met with in prismatic white lead ore and heavy spar.\n\nγ. Manifold modifications of the primary form.\n\nIn these modifications crystals are either, 1. Situated beside each other; or, 2. Placed the one above the other.\n\nBut in describing a crystallization, the number of its planes in general, and of each kind in particular, and their figure, if determinate, may be noticed, to render the description more accurate. As, for instance, cubic galena, with truncated angles, consists of 6 octagonal and 4 triangular planes.\n\nAnd still further, in explaining the form of crystallizations, by way of addition may be mentioned,\n\n1. The different modes of determination of which they are capable. Two different modes may in some cases be adopted.\n\na. The representative, by which is understood the description of a crystallization according to its apparent form; or,\n\nb. The derivative, which is founded on the consideration of its derivation, and its relation to the other crystals of the same mineral. The prismatic crystallization of the tourmaline is representatively an enneahedral\nBut, in general, the chief or essential form of a crystallization is determined by, a. The largest planes; b. The greatest regularity; c. The most frequent occurrence of the crystallization; d. The affinity to the other primary forms; e. The suitability and peculiarity of its modifications; and, f. The greatest simplicity in the mode of determination.\n\n2. The transitions from one primary form into another. These arise,\n\na. From the gradually increased extent of the modifying planes, and the decreased extent of the primary planes; or,\n\nb. From a change in the relative size of the planes; or,\n\nc. From a change in the angles under which the planes are associated; or,\n\nd. From the convexity of the planes; or,\n\ne. From the aggregation of crystals.\n\n3. The difficulties which are opposed to the exact determination of crystals. These proceed, a. From their compression, some planes being uncommonly large or small; b. From their penetrating each other, as in tin-stone crystals; or, c. From their partial concealment, as in feldspar, hornblende, and garnet; or,\n\nd. From their being broken, as often happens in the crystallization of precious stones; or, e. From their extreme minuteness.\n\nC. The aggregation of crystals. According to this, crystals are either,\n\na. Single, in which case they are, a. Loose or detached, as in precious stones, cubical iron pyrites, &c.; b. Inhering or inlaying in another mineral, as feldspar in porphyry; or, y. Adhering, as in quartz crystals; or,\n\nb. Aggregated, which are either regular or irregular.\n\na. Regular or determinate; such are, 1. Twin crystals, as in staurolite or cross stone; and, 2. Triple crystals, as in calcareous spar and ruby: but this is very rare.\n\nb. Many singly aggregated crystals, as such crystals as are, 1. Heaped upon one another, as in calcareous and fluor spar; 2. Adhering laterally, as in amethyst crystals; and, 3. Implicated one in the other, as in gray antimonial ore, and in the hexahedral prisms of calcareous spar.\n\ny. Many doubly aggregated crystals are distributed according to the form they assume; such as the following, are enumerated.\n\n1. Scopiform, when aggregated, needle-like, and capilliform crystals diverge from a common centre, as in zeolite, striated red cobalt ore, and capilliform pyrites.\n\n2. Fasciform, which is composed of double scopiform, with a common centre, as in calcareous spar, zeolite, and prehnite.\n\n3. Acicular or columnar. Elongated, equally thick prisms adhering laterally together, are of this description, as in acicular heavy spar, and a variety of white lead ore.\n\n4. In a row, like a string of pearls, as in pyramidal crystals of quartz.\n\n5. Bud-like, in simple pyramids whose bases are connected, and whose joints are directed towards each other, as in bud-like druses of quartz.\n\n6.

Amygdaloid, when the tables are externally accumulated, smaller upon smaller, as in heavy spar.\n\n8. Pyramidal, which takes place chiefly in prisms nearly parallel, the summits inclining to each other; the central prism being the highest, as in calcareous spar.\n\n9. Rose-like, composed of thin tables, on whose lateral planes others are assembled, and arranged in a rose-like appearance.\n\nD. The magnitude of crystals, which is determined,\n\na. According to the greatest dimension, as a. Of an uncommon size, in crystals which exceed two feet, as in quartz and rock crystal; b. Very large, from two feet to six inches, as in rock crystal and calcareous spar; y. Large, from six to two inches, as in iron pyrites, fluor spar, and garnet; d. Of a middling size, from two inches to half an inch, which are very common; s. Small, from half an inch to one-eighth of an inch, also very common; q. Very small, from one-eighth of an inch to such as may be distinguished by the naked eye, as in corneous silver ore, and very small tin stone crystals; n. Minute, whose form cannot be distinguished by the naked eye, as in native gold and green lead ore.\n\nb. According to relative dimensions, when compared with others; and this is distinguished into a. Short or low, and long or high; b. Broad and narrow, or longed; y. Thick and thin, or slender; d. Needle-like and capilliform; s. Spicular, and q. Globular or tessular.\n\n4. Extraneous external forms, or petrifications, which are divided into petrifications of animals, and petrifications of vegetables.\n\nA. Petrifications of animals, or zoolithes, as\n\na. Of the class mammalia, the parts of which commonly found are the bones, the teeth, horns, and skeletons. Such are the bones of the elephant and the rhinoceros, which are found in Siberia, and the bones of the mammoth from North America.\n\nb. Of birds, petrifications of which are very rare. Some skeletons of aquatic birds have been met with in limestone near Oening.\n\nc. Of amphibious animals, such as those of the tortoise, found in the same vicinity as the bones of the elephant; of frogs and toads, in the lime stone of Oening; and of an animal resembling a crocodile in aluminous shale near Whitby in Yorkshire.\n\nd. Of fishes, of which whole fishes, skeletons, and impressions, have been found in different places.\n\ne. Of insects, petrifications of which are not very common, excepting insects, such as crabs, which have been frequently observed.\n\nf. Of vermes, of which numerous petrifications are found belonging to the orders teflacea, crustacea, and coralina or corals.\n\nB. Petrifications of vegetables, which are less numerous in the mineral kingdom than those of animals. These are distinguished into\n\na. Petrified wood, the most usual of which are petrifications of the trunk, branches, or roots of trees, and, commonly\ncommonly consisting of siliceous substances, as woodstone, jasper, horn stone.\n\nb. Impressions of leaves and plants, which are not uncommon in the strata of coal countries, particularly in the thale, sandstone, the argillaceous iron stone, and the coal itself.\n\nII.

Rather cold, as serpentine, gypsum.\n\n3. Slightly cold, as amber, pitcoal, and chalk.\n\nBy this character cut and polished stones may be distinguished, where some of the other characters are lost; and by it also natural gems may be distinguished from those which are artificial.\n\nV. The weight.—This character is most accurately discovered by taking the specific gravity of a mineral by means of a hydrostatic balance. See Hydrodynamics. But when this cannot be had recourse to, a mineral is examined by lifting it in the hand and comparing its weight, thus estimated by the feeling, with its volume, by which means an approximation may be made to its specific gravity. Five degrees of this mode of estimating the weight of minerals have been assumed.\n\n1. Supernatant, such minerals as swim in water, as naphtha, mountain cork.\n\n2. Light, such minerals as have a specific gravity between 1,000 and 2,000, (taking water at 1,000) as amber, mineral pitch, and pitcoal.\n\n3. Rather heavy, are such minerals as have a specific gravity between 2,000 and 4,000, which is the case with most kinds of stones, as amianthus, rock crystal, mica, fluor spar, diamond.\n\n4. Heavy, when the specific gravity is from 4,000 to 6,000, as in most metallic ores, such as gray copper ore, red haematites, white lead ore, and in some others as heavy spar.\n\n5. Extremely heavy, when the specific gravity exceeds 6,000, which includes the native metals, as native gold, native copper, and native silver, and some others, as galena, tintstone crystals, fulphurated bismuth, and vitreous silver ore.\n\nVI. The smell is characteristic of only a small number of minerals. It is observed either,\n\n1. Of itself without addition, and is,\n\nA. Bituminous, as mineral pitch and naphtha.\n\nB. Slightly sulphureous, as in native sulphur and gray antimonial ore.\n\nC. Bitterish, as in ochre kept close shut up for some time.\n\nD. Clayey, as in yellow chalk.\n\n2. After breathing on a mineral, which should be cold and breathed upon strongly and quickly, when the smell perceived is,\n\nA. Clayey bitter, as in hornblende and some feldspates.\n\n3. After rubbing or striking, when the smell emitted is,\n\nA. Urinous, as in flintstone after rubbing.\n\nB. Sulphureous, as in pyrites.\n\nC. Garlic, as in arfical pyrites and white cobalt ore.\n\nD. Empyreumatic, as in quartz and pitcoal.\n\nVII. The taste, which is characteristic of one class of minerals, only, viz. the salts; and it is either,\n\n1. Sweetish saline, as rock salt.\n\n2. Sweetish astringent, as native alum.\n\n3. Sourish astringent, as native vitriol.\n\n4. Bitter saline, as native epsom salt.\n\n5. Cooling saline, as native nitre.\n\n6. Lixivious, as native alkali.\n\n7. Urinous, as native sal ammoniac.\n\nBeside the characters which we have now illustrated, some others are occasionally and successfully employed in the description of minerals. These have been brought under\nunder the denomination of physical, chemical, and empirical characters.\n\n1. Physical. The most common of the physical characters is the property which some minerals possess of exhibiting signs of electricity and magnetism. Some minerals become electric by being heated, and others by friction; and the electricity thus excited is in some vitreous or positive, and in others resinous or negative. Some minerals, too, and particularly some varieties of iron ore, are distinguished by being attracted by the magnet. Such are magnetic pyrites, and magnetic iron sand. By filing a mineral so fine that the particles shall swim on water, and then applying a magnet, the slightest degree of magnetic effect may be observed.\n\nAmong the physical properties of minerals also, may be reckoned the phosphorescence, which is produced by friction, as in some varieties of blende; or by exposure to heat, as fluor spar, and some calcareous spars. To these characters also belongs the peculiar property of Lemnian earth and some other bodies, which being thrown into water split into pieces with a crackling noise; and the property of some opals and other stones, of acquiring a higher degree of transparency when they are immersed in water, hence called hydrophanes.\n\n2. Chemical characters.—By some simple experiments, the nature of many mineral substances may be easily and quickly ascertained, and particularly by means of acids. Thus, the nitrous acid is employed to discover whether a mineral effervesces, from which character the nature of the mineral can be more certainly known than by any other. Ammonia, or the volatile alkali, dissolves copper, and assumes a blue colour. Acetic acid is successfully employed as a test of lead, which communicates to the acid a sweetish taste. By means of heat, and particularly by the use of the blowpipe, much knowledge may be obtained of the nature of minerals. Some are volatilized; in others the colour is changed; and while some are nearly fused at different temperatures, others burn with a flame of peculiar colours.\n\n3. Empirical characters.—Among these characters, the most common is the peculiar efflorescence which takes place in some ores. In copper ores the efflorescence is green or blue; in iron ores, brown, yellow, or red; in cobalt, peach blossom red; and in arsenic, white.\n\nCharacters for the distinction of minerals may be obtained from the circumstance of certain minerals being found generally accompanying others; as native arsenic with orpiment; gray copper ore with copper pyrites, and gray silver ore; red copper ore with native copper; white cobalt ore is rarely found without nickel; and by attending to this circumstance, it will not be mistaken for artificial pyrites.\n\nFor the sake of brevity, Mr Kirwan, and others after him, have adopted a method of expressing some of the characters by means of numbers. The following table exhibits some of these characters and corresponding numbers.\n\nReplendent, denoted by the number 4.\nShining 3.\nWeakly shining 2.\nGlimmering 1.\nDull 0.\n\nFragments, when the form is indeterminate.\nVery sharp-edged 4.\nSharp-edged 3.\nRather sharp-edged 2.\nRather blunt 1.\nPerfectly blunt 0.\n\nTransparency.\nTransparent 4.\nSemitransparent 3.\nTranlucent 2.\nTranlucent at the edges 1.\nOpaque 0.\n\nHardness.\nOf chalk, denoted by 3.\nYielding to the nail 4.\nMay be scraped with a knife 5.\nYields more difficulty to the knife 6.\nScarcely yields to the knife 7.\nDoes not give fire with steel 8.\nGives feeble sparks with steel 9.\nGives lively sparks 10.\n\nBut it is obvious that this abridged mode of expressing these characters, by means of numbers, can only be advantageously employed by those who have made themselves quite familiar with the different numbers corresponding to the different shades of character, and who can thus recollect them with facility and precision. To others this method of description, by requiring constant reference to the explanation, may prove rather embarrassing, so that what is gained in brevity may be lost in perspicuity. We propose therefore, still to retain the verbal mode of expression in preference to the numerical.\n\nTable of Minerals arranged in the order of their Genera and Species, each Genus being divided into Families or Groups, the characters of which latter are derived from their external properties according to the method of Werner.\n\nFirst Class.\n\nEARTHS & STONES.\n\nI.

Haüy, III. 287.\n\nEssential character.—Scratches all other minerals.\n\nExternal characters.—Its most common colours are grayish white and yellowish white; smoke gray and yellowish gray; clove brown; sometimes asparagus green, palting to pistachio green and apple green; sometimes a wine yellow and citron yellow, and also blue and rose red.\n\nWhen the diamond is cut, it presents a splendid and varied play of colours, which is one of its most striking characters.\n\nIt is found sometimes in rounded grains, which are supposed to have been crystals with the edges worn; but it is most frequently met with crystalized.\n\nThe primitive form is a regular octahedron, the integrant molecule a regular tetrahedron; but the form which it commonly assumes is the spheroidal, with 48 curvilinear faces, six of which correspond to the same face of the primitive octahedron. Besides this form there are various others, as the double three-sided pyramid, the dodecahedron, &c. All the modifications of the crystals of the diamond, Haüy observes, seem to be the effects of its tendency to crystallize in a regular figure of 48 plane faces, which, if it ever has existed, has not yet been discovered; and it is easy to conceive that this form would be produced by intermediate decrements on all the angles of the nucleus; but the deviations from this form seem to have been occasioned by its precipitate formation.\n\nThe external lustre is from four to one; internal four. The fracture is straight foliated, with a fourfold cleavage, parallel to the faces of the octahedron; transparency four to three; hardness ten; brittle; specific gravity 3.518 to 3.600. Becomes positively electric by friction, even before it is polished.\n\nChemical character.—When exposed to a sufficient temperature, it is entirely consumed. This has been fully ascertained by the experiments of modern chemists, from which it is concluded, that the diamond is entirely composed of pure carbure. See Chemistry.\n\nMr Boyle was the first, according to Henckel, who subjected the diamond to the action of heat, and in his experiments he found that it exhaled very copious and acrid vapours. This was about the year 1673; but in the year 1694 the experiment was repeated by the order of Cosmo III., grand duke of Tuscany. Diamonds were exposed to the heat of the powerful burning glass of Tschirnhausen, the action of which was even aided by means of another burning glass; and about the end of 30 seconds a diamond of 20 grains lost its transparency, separated into small pieces, and was at last entirely dissipated. The same experiment was repeated on other diamonds, always with the same result, and without exhibiting the least sign of fusion. Newton, in his treatise on Optics, has placed the diamond among combustibles, supposing that it is a consolidated unctuous substance. He had been led to this by observing its extraordinary refractive power, which in combustible bodies he found to be in a ratio considerably higher than their density. According to this general law he concluded, that the diamond as well as water contained an inflammable principle, both of which have since been verified. Newton's treatise was not published till 1704; but it appears that part of it was composed and read to the Royal Society in the year 1675, nearly 20 years before the Florentine experiments were made.\n\nBut nearly 70 years before this latter period, Boetius de Boedt, in his History of Stones, appears to have been perfectly satisfied, from an experiment which he describes, that the diamond was of an inflammable nature. This document, which we presume will gratify the curiosity of many of our readers, is tooingular to be omitted. \"Maltix deinde calefieri parum, quemadmodum et adamas debet, idque, ut impotitus ac supra positus malfici statim illi unioni vera unitur, ac vivos undique radios a se jaceat. Hane unionem respuit aliae omnes gemmae diaphanae—cur vero legitimus adamas solus tincturam illam recipit, aliae gemme non, difficilis est scire. Exiftimo mutuum illum et amicum amplenum propter similitudinem aliquam quam habent in materia et qualitatibus; hoc est, tota utriuque natura fieri, quod itaque maltix qua igneae nature est adamantis facile jungi poshit, lignum eft; id propter materie similitudinem fieri, ac adamantis materiam igneae, et sulphuream eft, atque ipsius humidum intrinsecum et primumgenium cujus beneficio coagulatus eft; plane juftae oleofum et igneum, aliarum vero gemmarum aquae. Non mirum itaque fi pinguis, oleofa, et ignea malfici subfiantia illi abique vifus termino adpingi et applicari, aliis vero gemmis non poftit.\" Boetius de Boedt, Gem. et Lapid. Hist. Hanoviae, 1609, 4to, lib. ii. cap. i.\n\nFor the sake of the English reader we shall translate this curious document. \"If malfic and the diamond be exposed to heat, and brought into contact, they enter into perfect union, and emit a very lively flame, which does not take place in any other gem. But what is the reason that the diamond alone possesses this property? I am of opinion that this mutual combination arises from a certain resemblance which each of the substances possesses in its nature and properties: on this account, therefore, the malfic, which is of a combustible nature, may be united to the diamond from a similarity in their nature, which shows that the diamond is composed of combustible and fulphurous matter; and that the humid and original particles of its composition, by means of which it was coagulated, or assumed a fluid form, have been decidedly of an oily and inflammable nature, while those of other gems have been of an aqueous nature. It is not, therefore, surprising that the fat, oily, and combustible substance of malfic may enter into intimate union with the diamond, but cannot be combined with other gems.\"\n\nLocalities, &c.—The diamond is found in various places of the East Indies, as in the provinces of Golconda and Vilapour, in the peninsula of Hither India; and in the kingdoms of Pegu and Siam, in the peninsula of Farther India, and nearly, it is observed, in the same degree of latitude. In 1728 the diamond was discovered in Brazil, in the district of Serro-do-Frio, which is situated in the same southern latitude as the countries which produce the diamond on the north side of the equator. The native repository of the diamond, so far as is known, is a ferruginous soil, but whether it be\nThe diamond mines are found only in the kingdoms of Golconda, Vizapour, Bengal, the island of Borneo, and Brazil. There are four or five mines, or rather three mines and two rivers, whence diamonds are obtained. The mines are, 1. That of Raolconda, in the province of Carnatic, five days journey from Golconda, and eight from Vizapour. It has been discovered about 200 years. 2. That of Gani, or Coulour, seven days journey from Golconda eastward. It was discovered 150 years ago by a peasant, who digging in the ground found a natural fragment of 25 carats. 3. That of Soumelpour, a large town in the kingdom of Bengal, near the Diamond-mine. This is the most ancient of all; it should rather be called that of Goual, which is the name of the river, in the sand whereof these stones are found. 4. The fourth mine, or rather the second river, is that of Succudan, in the island of Borneo; and 5. That of Serro do Frio in Brazil.\n\nDiamond-mine of Raolconda.—In the neighbourhood of this mine the earth is sandy, and full of rocks and copse-wood. In these rocks are found several little veins of half and sometimes a whole inch broad, out of which the miners, with a kind of hooked irons, draw the sand or earth wherein the diamonds are; breaking the rocks when the vein terminates, that the track may be found again, and continued. When a sufficient quantity of earth or sand is drawn forth, they wash it two or three times, to separate the stones. The miners work quite naked, except a thin linen cloth before them; and besides this precaution, have likewise inspectors, to prevent their concealing diamonds, which, however, they frequently find means to do, by watching opportunities when they are not observed, and swallowing them.\n\nDiamond-mine of Gani or Coulour.—In this mine are found a great number of diamonds from 10 to 40 carats, and even more. It was here that the famous diamond of the Great Mogul, which before it was cut weighed 793 carats, was found. The diamonds of this mine are not very clear: their water is usually tinged with the quality of the foil; being black where that is marbled, red where it partakes of red, sometimes green and yellow, if the ground happen to be of those colours. Another defect of some consequence is a kind of greasiness appearing on the diamond, when cut, which takes off part of its lustre.—There are usually no less than 60,000 persons employed in this mine.\n\nWhen the miners have found a place where they intend to dig, they level another somewhat bigger in the neighbourhood thereof, and inclose it with walls about two feet high, only leaving apertures from space to space, to give passage to the water. After a few superstitious ceremonies, and a kind of feast which the master of the mine makes for the workmen, to encourage them, every one goes to his own mines, the men digging the earth in the place first discovered, and the women and children carrying it off into the other walled round. They dig a few feet deep, and till such time as they find water. Then they cease digging; and the water thus found serves to wash the earth two or three times, after which it is let out at an aperture reserved for that end. This earth being well washed, and well dried, they fit it in a kind of open sieve, and lastly, search it well with the hands to find the diamonds. This mine is in a plain of about one league and a half in extent, bounded on one side by a river, and on the other by a range of lofty mountains, which form a semicircle. It is said that the nearer the digging is carried to the mountains, the diamonds are the larger.\n\nDiamond-mine of Soumelpour, or river Goual.—Soumelpour is a considerable town near the river Goual, which runs into the Ganges. It is from this river that all our fine diamond points, or sparks, called natural sparks, are brought. They never begin to seek for diamonds in this river till after the great rains are over, that is, after the month of December; and they usually even wait till the water is grown clear, which is not before January. The season at hand, eight or ten thousand persons, of all ages and sexes, come out of Soumelpour and the neighbouring villages. The most experienced among them search and examine the sand of the river, and particularly where it is mixed with pyrites, going from Soumelpour to the very mountain whence it springs. When all the sand of the river, which at that time is very low, has been well examined, they proceed to take up that wherein they judge diamonds likely to be found; which is done after the following manner: They dam the place round with stones, earth, and fascines, and throwing out the water, dig about two feet deep: the sand thus got is carried into a place walled round on the bank of the river. The rest is performed after the same manner as at other mines.\n\nDiamond mine in the island of Borneo, or river of Succudan.—We are but little acquainted with this mine; strangers being prohibited from having access to it: though very fine diamonds have been brought to Batavia by stealth. They were formerly imagined to be softer than those of the other mines; but experience shows they are in no respect inferior.\n\nDiamond mine of Serro-do-Frio.—A description of this mine was given by D'Andrada in 1792, to the Natural History Society of Paris. The mine is situated to the north of Villa Rica, in the 18th degree of south latitude. The whole country in which the diamonds are found abounds with ores of iron; and the stratum of soil, immediately under the vegetable soil, contains diamonds disseminated in it, and attached to a gauze or matrix which is more or less ferruginous; but they are never found in veins.\n\nWhen this mine was first discovered, the searching for diamonds was so successful, that the Portuguese fleet which arrived from Rio de Janeiro in 1730 brought no less than 1146 ounces of diamonds. This unusual quantity introduced into the market immediately reduced the price; and to prevent this circumstance recurring, the Portuguese government determined to limit the number of men employed in the mines.\n\nAs the diamond is the hardest of all substances, it can only be cut and polished by itself. To bring it to that perfection which augments its price to considerably, the lapidaries begin by rubbing several againstmonds, each other, while rough; after having first glued them to the ends of two wooden blocks, thick enough to be held.\nDiamonds are cut and polished by means of a mill, which turns a wheel of soft iron sprinkled over with diamond-dust mixed with oil of olives. The same dust, well ground, and diluted with water and vinegar, is used in the sawing of diamonds; which is performed with an iron or brass wire, as fine as a hair. Sometimes, in lieu of sawing the diamonds, they cleave them, especially if there be any large flivers in them.\n\nThe method of cutting and polishing the diamond was not discovered till the 17th century. The diamonds which were employed as ornaments before that period, were in their rough and natural state. The invention is ascribed to Louis Berguen, a native of Bruges, who in the year 1476, cut the fine diamond of Charles the Bald, duke of Burgundy, which he lost the same year at the battle of Morat. This diamond was then sold for a crown, but afterwards came into the possession of the duke of Florence.\n\nThe first water in diamonds means the greatest purity and perfection of their complexion, which ought to be that of the purest water. When diamonds fall short of this perfection, they are said to be of the second or third water, &c. till the stone may be properly called a coloured one.\n\nThe value of diamonds is estimated by Mr Jefferies by the following rule. He supposes the value of a rough diamond to be settled at £1 per carat, at a medium; then to find the value of diamonds of greater weights, multiply the square of their weight by 2, and the product is the value required. E.g., to find the value of a rough diamond of two carats: $2 \\times 2 = 4$, the square of the weight; which, multiplied by two, gives £8. The true value of a rough diamond of two carats. For finding the value of manufactured diamonds, he supposes half their weight to be lost in manufacturing them; and therefore, to find their value, we must multiply the square of double their weight by 2, which will give their true value in pounds. Thus, to find the value of a wrought diamond weighing two carats; we first find the square of double the weight, viz. $4 \\times 4 = 16$; then $16 \\times 2 = 32$. So that the true value of a wrought diamond of two carats is £32. On these principles Mr Jefferies has constructed tables of the price of diamonds from 1 to 100 carats.\n\nThe greatest diamond ever known in the world is one belonging to the king of Portugal, which was found in Brazil. It is still uncut: and Mr Magellan informs us, that it was of a larger size; but a piece was cleaved or broken off by the ignorant countryman, who chanced to find this great gem, and tried its hardness by the stroke of a large hammer upon the anvil.\n\nThis prodigious diamond weighs 1680 carats; and although it is uncut, Mr Romé de l'Isle says, that it is valued at 224 millions sterling; which gives the estimation of £9,36 or about £80 pounds sterling for each carat: viz. for the multiplicand of the square of its whole weight. But even in case of any error of the press in this valuation, if we employ the general rule above mentioned, this great gem must be worth at least £5,644,800 pounds sterling, which are the product of 1680 by two pounds, viz. much above five millions and a half sterling. But this gem is supposed by some to be a white topaz.\n\nThe famous diamond which adorns the sceptre of the empress of Russia under the eagle at the top of it weighs 779 carats, and is worth at least £4,854,728 pounds sterling, although it hardly cost £35,417 guineas. This diamond was one of the eyes of a Malabarian idol, named Seharingham. A French grenadier, who had deserted from the Indian service, contrived so well as to become one of the priests of that idol, from which he had the opportunity to steal its eye: he run away to the English at Trichinopoly, and thence to Madras. A ship-captain bought it for twenty thousand rupees: afterwards a Jew gave seventeen or eighteen thousand pounds sterling for it: at last a Greek merchant named Gregory Sagrair, offered it to sale at Amsterdam in the year 1766: and Prince Orloff made this acquisition for his sovereign the empress of Russia. This diamond is of a flattened oval form and of the size of a pigeon's egg.\n\nThe diamond of the great Mogul is cut in rose; weighs 279½ carats, and it is worth £380,000 guineas. This diamond has a small flaw underneath near the bottom: and Tavernier, page 389, who examined it, valued the carat at 150 French livres. Before this diamond was cut, it weighed 793½ carats, according to Rome de l'Isle: but Tavernier, page 339, of his second volume, says, that it weighed 900 carats before it was cut. If this be the very same diamond, its loss by being cut was very extraordinary.\n\nAnother diamond of the king of Portugal, which weighs 215 carats, is extremely fine, and is worth at least £369,800 guineas.\n\nThe diamond of the grand duke of Tuscany, now of the emperor of Germany, weighs 139½ carats; and is worth at least £109,520 guineas. Tavernier says, that this diamond has a little hue of a citron colour; and he valued it at 135 livres tournois the carat. Robert de Berquen says, that this diamond was cut into two: that the grand Turk had another of the same size: and that there were at Bismarck two large diamonds, one of 250 and another of 140 carats.\n\nThe diamond of the late king of France, called the Pitt or Regent, weighs 130½ carats: this gem is worth at least £208,333 guineas, although it did not cost above the half of this sum. Patrin says, that it is believed to be at Berlin, (I. 226.) and we may add, that it has probably been carried back to France among other spoils.\n\nThe other diamond of the same monarch, called the Sancy, weighs 55 carats; it cost £25,000 guineas: and Mr Dutens says, that it is worth much above that price.\n\nBrilliant Diamond, is that cut in faces both at top and bottom; and whose table, or principal face at top, is flat. To make a complete square brilliant, if the rough diamond be not found of a square figure, it must be made so; and if the work is perfectly executed, the length of the axis will be equal to the side of the square base of the pyramid.—Jewellers then form the table and collet by dividing the block, or length of the axis, into 18 parts. They take $\\frac{1}{18}$ from the upper part, and $\\frac{7}{18}$ from the lower. This gives a plane at $\\frac{4}{18}$ distance from the girdle for the table; and a smaller plane at $\\frac{5}{18}$ distance for the collet; the breadth of which will\nII. Genus. Zircon.\n\n1.

Char.—Its specific gravity about 4.4; the joints natural, some of which are parallel, and others are oblique to the axis of the crystals.\n\nExter. Char.—Colours reddish and yellowish, greenish, greenish yellow, and whitish. The colour in general varies from green to gray, and is most commonly pale; and the polished stone exhibits in some degree the play of colours of the diamond.\n\nIt is found in rounded, angular, or flattened grains, or in small angular fragments with notched edges, and also crystalized. The primitive form is an octahedron with isosceles triangles, and the integrant molecule is an irregular tetrahedron. The following are the most common forms of its crystals:\n\n1. A prism with four rectangular faces, each base of which has a pyramid with four faces placed on the four lateral faces, which terminates sometimes in a line, but most frequently in a point.\n\n2. The preceding crystal, in which the opposite lateral edges of the prism are truncated.\n\n3. The crystal (1.) in which the edges of the faces of the pyramid are bevelled.\n\n4. The crystal (1.) having the lateral edges of the prism, and the summit of the pyramid truncated.\n\n5. The crystal (1.) in which the angles between the prism and the pyramid are bevelled.\n\n6. A prism with four faces, having the two opposite narrow, and the two others broad.\n\n7. A double pyramid with four faces, with the edges of the common base truncated.\n\n8. The perfect octahedron with obtuse angles.\n\nThe crystals are commonly small; the surface smooth, but that of the angular fragments is rough. Lustre, 3 and 4; internal lustre, 4 and 3; somewhat vitreous, or approaching to that of the diamond. Fracture imperfect or flat conchoidal; fragments, 3. Transparency, 4. Caules double refraction. Hardness, 9; brittle. Spec. grav. 4.416 to 4.4700.\n\nChem. Char.—Infusible by the blow-pipe without addition, but with borax it forms a transparent colourless glass. The following are its constituent parts.\n\n| Constituent Parts |\n|------------------|\n| From Ceylon     | From Expaille |\n| Zirconia         | 70            | 64.5       |\n| Silica           | 25            | 32         |\n| Oxide of iron    | 0.5           | 2          |\n| Lofs             | 4.5           | 1.5        |\n\nLocalities.—The zircon was first found in Ceylon, accompanied with crystals of spinelle and tourmaline, in a river near the middle of the island; and more lately it has been found in Norway, in a rock composed of feldspar and hornblende.\n\nUse.—The zircon is employed as a precious stone, and particularly as an ornament in mourning.\n\n2. Species. Hyacinth.\n\nId. Kirw. I. 257. Zircon, Haüy, II. 467. L'Hyacinthe, Brochant, I. 163.\n\nEffem. Char.—The same as the first species.\n\nExter. Char.—The most common colour is what is called hyacinth red, blood red, and yellowish brown.\n\nIt is found in rounded grains, and frequently in crystals, the primitive form of which is the same as the first species. The crystals are,\n\n1. A prism with four faces.\n2. The same slightly truncated on its edges.\n3. The double pyramid with four faces, or a very obtuse octahedron, which is a rare variety.\n4. A prism with six faces, each base of which is terminated by an accumulation with three faces, placed alternately on the three lateral edges, forming the rhombohedral dodecahedron.\n\nThe crystals are commonly small, the surface smooth; external lustre, 3, 4; internal, 4; greasy; fracture straight foliated; cleavage double, rectangular; fragments, 3; transparency, 4, 2; caules double refraction; hard and brittle; unctuous to the touch when cut; spec. grav. 4.385 to 4.620.\n\nChem. Char.—By the action of the blow-pipe the hyacinth loses its colour, but retains its transparency. It is infusible without borax, which converts it into a transparent colourless glass.\n\nLocalities.—It is found in Ceylon in similar situations with the former; in Brazil, Bohemia, and in the rivulet Expaille, in Velay in France; and also in the neighbourhood of Pisa in Italy.\n\nUse.—As it is susceptible of a fine polish, the hyacinth has been ranked among precious stones.\n\nRemarks.—The analogy between the crystalline forms of the zircon and hyacinth; their double refraction; the similarity of their other characters, and particularly the results of chemical analysis, have led Haüy to form them into one species.\n\nA variety, under the name of cinnamon stone, has been considered as a distinct species; but the differences are so very slight, that it may be included in the description of the preceding.\n\nIII. Genus. Siliceous.\n\n1. Species. Chrysoberyl.\n\nId. Emm. Wid. Lenz, Kirw., Chrysopele, Lam. Cyphomane, Haüy.\n\nExter. Char.—The colour is an asparagus green; passing\npassing sometimes to a greenish white, and sometimes to an olive green; sometimes bright brown and yellow with brown, paling to yellowish gray; affords a feeble change of colour from bluish to milky white.\n\nIt is found in angular or rounded grains, which appear to have been water worn; and in crystals, exhibiting:\n\n1. A table with six faces, elongated, of various thicknesses, truncated on the terminal edges.\n2. A prism with four rectangular faces.\n3. A prism with six faces, of which four are broader and two are narrower opposite to each other.\n\nThe grains are slightly rough, and have a considerable external lustre. The crystals are striated lengthwise on their lateral faces; the other faces are smooth; lustre external very shining—internal the same, intermediate between that of the diamond and the vitreous lustre.\n\nThe fracture is in all directions perfectly conchoidal; the fragments are indeterminate with sharp edges. It has little transparency, but a considerable degree of hardness. Spec. grav. 3.698 to 3.719 Wern. 3.710 Klap. 3.796 Haüy.\n\nChem. Char.—It is infusible without addition by the action of the blow-pipe. By Klaproth's analysis, the following are its constituent parts.\n\n| Constituent parts | Crystallized | Cut | Crystallized |\n|-------------------|--------------|-----|--------------|\n| Silica            | 38           | 39  | 38           |\n| Magnesia          | 39.5         | 43.5| 50.5         |\n| Oxide of iron     | 19           | 19  | 9.5          |\n| Lows              | 3.5          |     | 2.0          |\n\nLocality.—Brazil, Ceylon, Siberia.\n\nUses.—The hardness of the chrysoberyl, and change of colour which it exhibits, have procured it a place among precious stones of inferior value. It is known in commerce under the name of changeable opal or oriental chrysolite.\n\n2. Species. CHRYSOLITE.\n\nId. Emm. Wid. Lenz. Mufl. Lesk. Kirw. Peridot, Daub. Haüy.\n\nExter. Char.—The most common colour is a bright pistachio green, passing to an olive green; sometimes of a bright asparagus or clear meadow green; rarely the green approaches to brown and almost to a cherry red.\n\nIt is found in angular fragments with the edges a little notched, or in rounded grains, or in crystals having the angles and edges a little notched. The forms of its crystals are:\n\n1. A large rectangular prism having its lateral edges truncated and sometimes bevelled, and terminated by a six-sided prism, of which two opposite sides are placed on the small lateral faces of the prism. The four others on the lateral truncated faces, the latter forming a more acute angle than the two former.\n2. The next form varies from the preceding, in having two additional terminating faces, placed on the broad faces of the prism, each of which is consequently situated between two of the planes corresponding to the truncated planes.\n\nIn another variety the summit of the pyramid is truncated by a convex cylindrical plane, the convexity of which passes from one of the small opposite lateral planes towards the other.\n\n4. In some instances the crystals are so small, that the small lateral faces almost entirely disappear, while the two larger assume a curved form, giving such crystals a tabular appearance.\n\nThe external surface of the angular fragments and of the rounded crystals is fealy, which affords an essential character to this mineral. The small lateral planes are smooth, the broad ones are distinctly striated lengthwise. Externally the surface is shining; internally shining and vitreous.\n\nThe fracture in all directions is perfectly conchoidal; the form of the fragments is indeterminate, with very sharp edges. It is almost always transparent, and refracts double; it is not so hard as quartz. Brittle. Spec. grav. 3.340 to 3.420 Wern. 3.428 Haüy.\n\nChem. Char.—By the action of the blow-pipe it is fused with borax without effervescence, and affords a greenish transparent glass.\n\nLocality, &c.—This mineral is brought from the Levant, but it is not known whether it is found in Asia or Africa. It has been discovered in Bohemia; and crystallized specimens included in a kind of lava, have been brought from the island of Bourbon. As it is usually found in rounded fragments, in the midst of earthy substances, its relative situation is scarcely known.\n\nUses.—The chrysolite has been often employed for various purposes as a precious stone, but as it possesses no great degree of hardness, it is not much esteemed.\n\nSubstances of a very different nature have been, at different times, described under the name of Chrysolite. It appears that the yellow chrysolite of the ancients is the same with our topaz, and that their green topaz is our chrysolite. Plin. lib. xxxvii. cap. 8.\n\n3. Species. OLIVINE.\n\nId. Emm. Wid.

Char.—The most common colour is a bright olive green, sometimes of an apple green, pistachio, or mountain green; a wine, honey, or orange yellow, and sometimes also a reddish brown, and brownish black; but these latter varieties are rare. It is found in rounded pieces, from the size of the head to that of a grain of millet, most commonly included, and disseminated in basalt. It has been found crystalized.\n\nInternally,\nPart I.\n\nMINERALOGY.\n\nInternally, this mineral varies in its lustre between shining and weakly shining; in the yellow varieties the lustre is between vitreous and resinous.\n\nThe fracture is more or less conchoidal; sometimes uneven, the shape of the fragments is indeterminate, with sharp edges. The rounded pieces of a certain size are composed of distinct granular concretions, with small grains.\n\nIt is sometimes transparent, and varies to semitransparent and translucent. It is brittle and not so hard as quartz. Spec. grav. 3.225 to 3.265.\n\nChem. Char.—Olivine is infusible by the action of the blow-pipe; in nitric acid it loses its colour, giving to the liquid a pale yellow colour.\n\nConstituent parts.

Brochant says that it has not been discovered in the basalts of Ireland, England, Sweden, Norway, and Italy. We have, however, collected specimens of olivine among the basaltic rocks of the Giant’s Causeway in Ireland.\n\nOlivine and chrysolite are considered by Haüy as one species, and described under the name peridotite.\n\n4.

It is found in masses which are composed of separate pieces, granular, in small grains, which may be easily separated; these grains are angular, and discover some appearance of tendency to crystallization.\n\nLustre, resplendent, vitreous; fracture foliated; cleavage double, as examined by Haüy, but single according to D’Andrada: it is hard, scratches glass; the grains are often translucent. Spec. grav. 3.316 to 3.373.\n\nChem. Char.—Coccolite is infusible without addition before the blow-pipe. With borax it melts into a pale yellow transparent glass, and with carbonate of potash into an olive green vesicular glass.\n\nConstituent parts.\n\n| Silica | 50.0 |\n| Lime | 24.0 |\n| Magnesia | 10.0 |\n| Oxide of iron | 7.0 |\n| Oxide of manganese | 3.0 |\n| Alumina | 1.5 |\n| Loos | 4.5 |\n\n100\n\nLocalities.—It is found in the iron mines of Hellesta and Assebo in Sudermania, at Nerica in Sweden, and near Arendal in Norway.\n\n5.

Char.—Colour, olive green, black, white, and gray. It is found sometimes in rounded pieces, and in grains, but most frequently crystallized. The primitive form is an oblique-angled prism, the bases of which are rhombs; the integrant molecule is an oblique triangular prism. The form of the crystals is generally a six and eight sided prism, which is terminated by a two sided summit. The crystals are commonly small, smooth, and brilliant, sometimes a little thinning. Internal lustre thinning, and almost resplendent, resinous.

Char.—Colour brown, orange, dark green, and yellowish green.\n\nThis mineral is found massive, disseminated, or crystallized. Primitive form, a rectangular prism, little different from a cube; integrant molecule a triangular prism. The forms of its crystals are, a rectangular prism, with four sides, truncated on all its edges, or truncated on its lateral edges; or a six-sided prism truncated on all its edges. The crystals are usually small, single sometimes, and sometimes in groups. Lateral planes longitudinally streaked.

Char.—Colour grayish or yellow white.\n\nIt is rarely found massive or in grains, but most frequently crystallized. The primitive form of its crystals is the cube; the integrant molecule an irregular tetrahedron; the most common form of the crystals is a short double pyramid with eight faces opposed base to base, each summit of which is surmounted by an obtuse accumulation with four faces, corresponding alternately to the four lateral edges of the pyramid, and thus producing a figure of twenty-four trapezoidal faces; the crystals are commonly small, the surface rough and dull, or at most feebly shining.

Magnesia indeed has been detected in the latter as one of its constituents, no trace of which has been yet discovered in the former.\n\n10. Species. Grenatite.\n\nGrenatite, Brochant, ii. 496. Id. Sauvire, § 1900. Staurolite, Haüy, iii. 93. Pierre de Croix, De Lille, ii. 434.\n\nEffem.

Char.—Grenatite is always found crystallized. The primitive form is a rectangular prism with rhomboidal bases, having the angles inclined, as mentioned in the effemal character. The integrant molecule is a triangular prism. It is frequently met with in double crystals, crossing each other in the form of a cross, from which the name is derived, sometimes at right angles, and sometimes obliquely; sometimes also there are oblique triple crossings. The surface is smooth and thinning, or uneven and dull.\n\nThe colour is reddish or blackish brown; internal lustre shining, between vitreous and resinous. Fracture imperfectly\nSiliceous imperfectly foliated, in the direction of the axis; in other directions uneven, small grained, or sometimes a little conchohoid; often opaque, sometimes translucent.

The edges of the octahedron are sometimes truncated, and form a regular rhombohedron. The crystals are small; the fracture is conchohedral; the lustre shining and vitreous.\n\nThe colour is sometimes perfectly black, brown, bright blue, purplish red, or dark green.

It is found also in Pegu.\n\nUses.—Spinelle is ranked among precious stones, and is greatly esteemed when it is of a certain size. It is said that a fine spinelle ruby, whose weight exceeds four carats, is worth half the price of a diamond of the same weight.\n\n13. Species.

Char.—Specific gravity about 4; natural joints very distinct, and perpendicular to the axis of the crystals.\n\nExter. Char.—Sapphire is found in fragments, in rounded pieces, and also crystallized. The primitive form of the crystal, according to Haüy, is a regular six-sided prism, and the integrant molecule is a triangular, equilateral prism; but, according to Bourne, the primitive form is a rhombohedron, whose angles are 96° and 84°. The usual forms of the crystals are, 1. A small six-sided prism. 2. A pyramid with six faces, very sharp, double, the two pyramids applied base to base. 3. The same crystal with the summit truncated. 4. A pyramid with six faces, double; the two pyramids applied base to base, but less sharp than the second form. The surface of the crystals is smooth, and often streaked transversely.\nThe principal colour is blue, varying between Prussian and indigo blue; other varieties are of a deep violet blue. Sapphires are also found red, yellowish, and greenish. Two or three colours appear in the same crystal, sometimes in bands and sometimes in concentric circles. Externally, the lustre of the sapphire is thinning; internally, resplendent and vitreous. Fracture perfectly conchoidal. Fragments sharp edged; transparent or semitransparent, sometimes only translucent. Scratches all other earthy substances. Brittle. Spec. grav. 3.991 to 4.283.\n\nChem.

The sapphire is also found in Bohemia, accompanied with zircon, Bohemian garnet, and magnetic iron; and in the river Expailly in France.\n\nUses.—The sapphire, next to the diamond, is the most highly valued of precious stones.\n\n14.

Char.—This mineral is found massive, disseminated, and crystallized; 1. In six-sided prisms, having the extremities broken, and the faces sometimes unequal. 2. A six-sided prism, terminated by a six-sided pyramid. 3. A pyramid with six short faces, whose summit is strongly truncated; and, 4. The preceding crystal terminated by a three-sided pyramid. From the investigations of Count de Bourbon and Mr Greville, it appears that the crystallization of corundum is similar to that of the sapphire*. Lustre, which is intermediate between resinous and vitreous, thinning or weakly shining; crols fracture uneven, or splintery, sometimes foliated; fragments rhomboideal, sometimes sharp-edged.\n\nThe colour is greenish white, greenish gray, and asparagus green, translucent at the edges; refraction double.

Emery is by some mineralogists arranged among the ores of iron.\n\n17. Species. TOPAZ.\n\nOccidental Topaz, Kirw. i. 254. La Topaze, Broch. i. 212. Topaze, Haüy, ii. 504.\n\nEffem Char.—Refraction double; joints very distinct; perpendicular only to the axis of the crystals.\n\nExter. Char.—The topaz is sometimes found massive, sometimes disseminated, and sometimes in rounded fragments; but it is most commonly crystallized. The primitive form of its crystals is a right angled prism, whose bases are rhombs, and having the large angle $124^\\circ 22'$; the integrant molecule is the same. The most common forms of the topaz are,\n\n1. A prism with eight sides, terminated at the one end by a four-sided summit, and at the other (which but rarely happens), by one of a different form. In a variety of the Brazilian topaz, the one summit presents six sides, and the other ten; and the electricity exhibited by the latter by means of heat, is negative, while that of the former is positive. This difference in the two opposite summits of a crystal, as has been observed by Haüy, is a peculiarity in all crystals which acquire by means of heat two kinds of electricity.\n\n2. The next common form of the topaz is an eight-sided prism, whose base is horizontal, and bordered with a row of six oblique faces. This variety, which is found in the mines of Saxony, becomes readily electric by friction, but not by heat.\n\nThe prevailing colour of the topaz is yellow of various shades. The crystals are of middling size; their lateral faces are sometimes convex and cylindrical; the surface of the same faces is longitudinally striated, while that of the other faces is smooth. Lustre vitreous; cros fracture perfectly foliated; longitudinal fracture conchoidal; fragments indeterminate; transparent; sometimes semitransparent or translucent; refraction double; scratches rock-crystal. Spec. grav. 3.464 to 3.564.\n\nChem. Char.—Infusible before the blow-pipe, but melts with borax without intumescence. The Brazilian topaz heated in a crucible assumes a rose red colour, when it is called by the jewellers ruby of Brazil. The Saxon topaz becomes white when exposed to heat; and thus deprived of colour, is sold for the diamond. According to Vauquelin, all the varieties of topaz reduced to powder, and added to syrup of violets, at the end of two or three hours communicate a green colour.\n\nAccording to Klaproth and Vauquelin.\n\n| Constituent | Tennant |\n|-------------|---------|\n| Alumina     | 47 to 50 |\n| Silica      | 28 to 30 |\n| Fluoric acid| 17 to 20 |\n| Iron        | 0 to 4   |\n\nLocalities, &c.—The topaz is found in different parts of Saxony, particularly in the mountain Schneekenstein, which is denominated topaz rock, and is arranged with the primitive mountains. In this rock the topaz is mixed with quartz, felspar, mica, and lithomarga. Near Zinnwald it is found in granite. It is also found mixed with ores of tin. In Siberia the topaz is found in graphic granite, accompanied with beryl, quartz, and garnet. Topaz is also met with in Brazil and Asia Minor.\n\nUses.—The topaz is employed for the purposes of jewellery as a precious stone, but it is not considered of very great value.\n\n18. Species. PYROPHYSALITE.\n\nThis mineral which was described and analysed by Hisinger and Berzelius, is of a greenish white colour. When thrown on hot coals it becomes phosphorescent, and gives out a greenish flame. When it is strongly heated by the action of the blow-pipe, the surface is covered with small vesicles which explode. These phenomena are ascribed to the fluate of lime which forms one of its constituent parts, and which sometimes appears surrounding it with a crust.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Gahn found this stone at Finbo near Falun in Sweden, in nodules imbedded in a granite, composed of white quartz, feldspar, and silvery mica. The nodules are separated from the rock by a greenish yellow talc.\n\n19. Species. EUCLASE.\n\nId. Haüy, ii. 531. Id. Brochant, ii. 508.\n\nEffem Char.—Divisible by two longitudinal lines perpendicular to each other.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral has only been found crystallized. The primitive form of the crystals is a rectangular prism with square bases, and that of the integrant molecule is the same. The most common form under which it appears is an oblique four-sided prism with the edges truncated in various ways. The crystals are streaked longitudinally. The lustre is replenished and vitreous. Longitudinal fracture foliated; cros fracture conchoidal.\n\nColour, bright sea green. Transparent, and refracts double. Scratches quartz. Very frangible, hence its name signifying easily broken.

Emeraude, Hauy, ii. 516.\n\nEffem. Char.—Scratches glass easily; divisible, parallel to the faces, and to the bases of a regular hexahedral prism.\n\nExter. Char.—The emerald is only found crystallized, and the primitive form of its crystals is a regular six-sided prism; the integrant molecule is a triangular prism, the sides square, and the bases equilateral triangles. The usual forms are, 1. A perfect six-sided prism; 2. Truncated on its lateral edges; 3. Truncated on its terminal edges; 4. Truncated on its terminal angles; and, 5. Having the terminal edges bevelled. The crystals are seldom large. Their surface is smooth and shining; internal lustre shining and resplendent; vitreous; fracture conchoidal or unequal, sometimes transversely foliated; fragments indeterminate, sharp edged.\n\nColour emerald green of all shades; most commonly transparent, sometimes only translucent; refraction double; with difficulty scratches quartz.

They are also found in Upper Egypt, Ethiopia, and in the island of Ceylon. The emerald is accompanied by calcareous substances, as carbonate of lime and gypsum.\n\nUses.—The rich green of the emerald has obtained for it a high rank among precious stones, and it is employed for similar purposes.\n\n21.

Emeraude Limpide, vert-bleuâtre, jaune-verdatre, &c. Hauy, ii. 521.\n\nEffem. Char.—The same as the emerald.\n\nExter. Char.—The beryl is sometimes found in rounded fragments, but most commonly crystallized, and the forms of its crystals are the same as the emerald. The lateral faces of the crystals are deeply striated.\n\nThe colours of the beryl are usually a pale or yellowish green; external lustre shining; internal resplendent, vitreous; longitudinal fracture conchoidal, or foliated. Cleavage fourfold. Fragments indeterminate and sharp-edged; often transparent, sometimes semi-transparent, and translucent. The latter variety is distinguished by transverse rents. Refraction in a slight degree double; nearly as hard as topaz; brittle; spec. grav. 2.65 to 2.75. Becomes electric by friction.\n\nChem.

The beryl is also found in Siberia, where it is usually accompanied with quartz, feldspar, garnets, tourmaline, mica, and fluor spar, in the veins of primitive mountains. The beryls from Siberia are almost all found in graphic granite. Beryl is also found in Saxony, and lately in France, in a large vein of quartz traversing graphic granite. Dolomieu found the beryl perfectly transparent and colourless, in the granite of the island of Eloa.\n\nUses.—The beryl is employed as a precious stone, but is not greatly esteemed.\n\nRemarks.—The emerald and the precious beryl approach so nearly to each other, not only in the forms of their crystals, which are almost the same, and in their constituent parts, which afford but slight variations, but also in their other characters, that they ought to be considered, as has been done by Hauy, as varieties of the same species. The only differences which exist between them seem to be accidental. These are chiefly in the colour, and in the crystallization; the former of which is a finer green, and the latter is more perfect in the emerald than in the beryl. The colouring matter of the emerald is oxide of chromium, while that of the beryl is...\nryl is oxide of iron. In all the other characters they are nearly the same.\n\n22. Species. SCHORLITE, or Schorlous Beryl.\n\nSchorlite, Kirw. i. 286. Le Beril Schorliforme, Brochant, i. 224. Leucolite and Pycnite, Haüy, iii. 236.\n\nEffem. Char.—Insoluble. Original form of the crystals a regular hexahedral prism.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is usually found crystallized, in length masses, mixed with other substances, and generally imbedded in granite; the form of the crystals when they are regular, is a six-sided prism, which is sometimes truncated on its terminal edges, and sometimes the form disappears from its being deeply and longitudinally striated. The crystals are generally large.\n\nColour white, straw yellow, or reddish. Translucent or nearly opaque. External lustre shining, between vitreous and resinous.

It enters into the composition of a rock formed of quartz and gray mica at Altenberg in Saxony. A red variety of this mineral was formerly considered by mineralogists as a crystallized lepidolite. Schorlous beryl has been arranged as a subspecies of beryl; but its specific gravity, different degree of hardness, and especially its composition, are characters sufficiently distinct to constitute a separate species.\n\n23.

Le Schorl Noir, Brochant, i. 226. Tourmaline, Haüy, iii. 31.\n\nEffem. Char.—Electric by heat in the two opposite extremities; forms of the crystals derived from a rhomboid.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found in masses, and disseminated, but most frequently crystallized. The primitive form of its crystals is an obtuse rhomboid; the integrant molecule is a tetrahedron. Its usual forms are:\n\n1. A three-sided prism, with the lateral edges either truncated or bevelled;\n2. The same prism having a three-sided obtuse summit, the sides corresponding to the lateral edges. The truncations, and bevelments of the lateral edges vary in the size of the faces, thus producing prisms of six and nine sides. The lateral faces of the three-sided prism are often convex. The lateral surfaces are longitudinally and deeply striated. The lustre, both external and internal, which is vitreous, varies between shining and weakly shining. The fracture is imperfectly conchoidal or uneven; cross fracture is sometimes convex on the one side and concave on the other. When black schorl is malleable, it is found in separate pieces, thin, and apparently fibrous, parallel, or interwoven and divergent. The faces of these separate pieces are striated lengthwise. The fragments are indeterminate.\n\nColour velvet black of various shades. Commonly opaque, rarely translucent, except in small crystals. Streak gray. Inferior to quartz in hardness. Specific gravity 3.092 to 3.212.\n\nChem. Char.—Under the blow pipe it froths up, and melts into a grayish white enamel.\n\nConstituent Parts.

It is also met with in Switzerland, Spain, Hungary, and Britain.\n\nSubspecies 2. TOURMALINE.\n\nId. Kirw. i. 271. Le Schorl Electrique, Brochant, i. 229. Tourmaline Verte, Haüy, iii. 41.\n\nEffem.

The form of its crystals is a regular three-sided prism, with the edges, 1. Either truncated or bevelled. 2. A regular three-sided prism with the lateral faces convex, and terminating in an obtuse, three-sided prism, the sides of which correspond to the lateral faces at one extremity, and to the lateral edges at the other. 3. An obtuse, double, three-sided pyramid, the faces of the one corresponding to the edges of the other. 4. A six-sided prism with equal angles. 5. A six-sided prism, the sides meeting two and two alternately under three obtuse angles. 6. A nine-sided prism, having three lateral angles acute, and fix obtuse alternately. 7. The same crystal having the three acute lateral edges truncated, and thus forming a twelve-sided prism. The surface of the crystals is sometimes smooth, but most\nPart I.\n\nMINERALOGY.\n\nClassification.\n\nMost frequently striated longitudinally. Lustre thinning and vitreous. Longitudinal fracture conchoidal; cross-fracture foliated. The direction of the plates is inclined to the axis of the prism. Fragments indeterminate; the crystals are usually opaque, when seen laterally.\n\nThe colour of the tourmaline is greenish, of various shades, yellowish brown, and very rarely indigo blue. The colours are usually very deep, and at first sight appear black. It is usually transparent, and sometimes approaching to transparent, particularly when it is seen in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the prism; but it appears opaque when it is seen in a direction perpendicular to the basis of the prism, even when the height of the prism is less than its thickness. It is harder than quartz. Brittle. Spec. grav. 3.086 to 3.363.\n\nChem.

Vauquelin's is that of the green tourmaline of Brazil.\n\nPhyscal Char.—The property of the tourmaline, of becoming electric by heat, has been already noticed as one of its distinctive characters. This physical property has occupied the attention of philosophers for a long time. It was observed by Lemery in 1719, and examined by Epinus in 1770. Pliny indeed mentions a reddish or purple coloured stone, which being heated or rubbed, attracts light bodies. This is supposed to have been the tourmaline. This property is susceptible of various modifications. The electricity of the tourmaline may be conveniently exhibited by heating two crystals, suspending the one by a thread, and presenting successively to its extremities the extremities of the other crystal. The extremities which possess the same kind of electricity will be repelled, while those which possess a different kind will be attracted. If a crystal of tourmaline be broken while it is electrified, the fragments immediately present electrical poles, situated in the same direction as those of the entire crystal.\n\nThe extremity of the crystals of tourmaline which has the greatest number of faces, exhibits positive electricity, while the extremity having the smaller number of faces exhibits negative electricity. The proper degree of heat for exciting the electricity of tourmaline is from 100° to the boiling point of Fahrenheit. When heated beyond this point, it is deprived of its electricity, and recovers it only in cooling; but if the temperature be increased still more, the crystal becomes again electric, but the poles are reversed. The electric poles may be also reversed, by heating a crystal of tourmaline unequally, by means of a burning glass.\n\nLocalities, &c.—The tourmaline is found in almost all primitive mountains; the finest crystals are brought from Ceylon, Madagascar, Saxony, the Tyrol, Spain, and Brazil. The tourmaline of the Tyrol is found in a talcgy rock mixed with chlorite, mica, and hornblende. Those of Saxony and Spain are found imbedded in gneiss, but those of Brazil and Ceylon are in separate crystals. In Bohemia they are found in mines. The tourmaline is also a native of France, Sweden, Norway, and Britain.\n\n24. Species. PISTAZITE.\n\nGlassy actynolite, Kirwan i. 168. Delphinite, Sauflaire Voyages, No. 1918.

Char.—Divisible parallel to the faces of a rhomboidal prism of 114°, and 65°.\n\nExtern. Char.—Pistazite is found massive or crystallized in flattened four-sided prisms, terminated by four-sided pyramids, and also sometimes in regular six-sided prisms; the summit of the pyramid almost always truncated, as well as the lateral edges. The crystals are sometimes acicular and streaked longitudinally. Internal lustre thinning. Fracture foliated or radiated. Fragments wedge-shaped and splintery.\n\nColour deep green, olive green, or greenish yellow. Transparent, sometimes transparent. Hard, easily scratches glass, and is brittle. Spec. gr. 3.45.

Species. ZOYSITE.\n\nThis mineral which was discovered by Baron de Zoys, and therefore bears his name, is considered by Haüy as a variety of Epidote.\n\nIt appears in prisms which are deeply furrowed or rhomboidal, and very much flattened. They are of a gray colour, or grayish yellow, with a pearly lustre.\n\nLocalities.—Zoysite is found particularly in Carinthia, and also in the Tyrol and in the Valais*.\n\n26. Species. AXINITE, or THUMERSTONE.\n\nId. Kitw. i. 273. La Pierre de Thum, Brochant, i. 236. Axinite, Haüy, iii. 22.\n\nEffem. Char.—Divisible parallel to the faces of a rhomboidal prism of 101°, and 78°.\n\nX\n\nExter.\nExter. Char.—Thumerstone is found in masses, disseminated and crystallized. The primitive form of its crystals is a right-angled prism, whose bases are oblique angled parallelograms, having their angles of 101° 32', and 78° 28'. The integrant molecule is an oblique triangular prism. The most common form of its crystals is a quadrangular prism, so oblique and flattened, that its angles become as sharp as the cutting part of a hatchet. The faces of the crystals are longitudinally striated, but the truncated faces are smooth. External lustre splendid; internal shining and vitreous. Fracture vitreous, sometimes rough and splintery. Fragments indeterminate, sharp edged. Massive thumerstone is composed of separate tectaceous, thin, and slightly curved concretions, with a smooth surface, which is somewhat irregularly striated.\n\nThe colour is clove brown, varying to violet blue, yellowish, and greenish gray. Massive thumerstone is only translucent. The crystals are semitransparent, and sometimes transparent. It is harder than feldspar, but less so than quartz; gives fire with steel, and diffuses an odour similar to what is produced by flint. Brittle. Spec. grav. 3.213 to 3.300.\n\nChem. Char.—Thumerstone froths up under the blow-pipe, and is converted into a grayish enamel, and with borax into a fine olive green enamel.\n\nConstituent Parts.\n\n| Klaproth. | Vauquelin. |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Silica,   | 52.70      | 44        |\n| Alumina,  | 25.79      | 18        |\n| Lime,     | 9.39       | 19        |\n| Oxide of iron, | 8.63    | 14        |\n| Manganese | 1          | 4         |\n| Lofs      | 2.49       |           |\n\nLocalities, &c. Thumerstone, which is hitherto a rare mineral, has been only found in veins and fissures of primitive rocks, and chiefly in rocks with a base of serpentine. It is usually accompanied with asbestos, rock crystal, and sometimes calcareous spar. It was first discovered at Thum in Saxony, from which it derives its name; but has been since found in the Pyrenees, in France, at Mount Atlas in Africa, and in Norway.\n\n27. Species. Quartz.\n\nEffen. Char.—Divisible into a rhomboid, which is slightly obtuse.\n\nQuartz, which is found, either massive, crystallized, or in rounded pieces, is one of the most abundant mineral substances. The primitive form of its crystals is a slightly obtuse rhomboid, of 91° 4', and 85° 56'. The integrant molecule is a regular tetrahedron.\n\nOn account of the variety of forms and appearances, quartz has been divided into subspecies; into five by Werner; by others only into two, viz. rock-crystal and common quartz. We shall nearly follow the former subdivisions, which are, amethyst, rock-crystal, milk-quartz, common quartz, and prase, including also ferruginous quartz.\n\nSubspecies 1. Amethyst.\n\nId. Kirw. i. 264, L'Amethyste, Quartz-hyalin Violet, Hauy, ii. 417.\n\nExter. Char.—The amethyst is found frequently crystallized, but it is also found massive and in rounded pieces. 1. The form of its crystals is a regular six-sided prism, terminated by a six-sided pyramid, the sides of which correspond to those of the prism. 2. A double six-sided pyramid. Fracture conchoidal, rarely splintery, or fibrous. Fragments indeterminate, sometimes wedge-shaped. Massive amethyst is composed of separate pieces, which are sometimes granulated, sometimes scoriiform when the crystals are combined together.\n\nThe colour is commonly violet blue of various shades, blackish brown and greenish white. External lustre resplendent; internal resplendent and shining, vitreous. It varies between transparent and translucent. Scratches glass. Brittle. Spec. grav. 2.653 to 2.750.\n\nChem. Char.—Entirely insoluble under the action of the blow-pipe.\n\nConstituent Parts. Rose.\n\n| Silica, | 97.50 |\n|--------|-------|\n| Alumina, | .25 |\n| Oxide of iron and manganese, | .50 |\n\nLocalities, &c.—Amethyst is found in Bohemia, Saxony, Siberia, very abundant in the Uralian mountains, Hungary, and Auvergne in France. It is usually met with in the veins of metalliferous mountains, very rarely in granitic mountains. It is frequently met with crystallized, lining the cavities of balls of agate; in amygdaloid and porphyry rocks.\n\nUses. When the amethyst is cut and polished, it assumes an agreeable colour and lustre, so that it is employed in jewellery.\n\nWerner has divided the amethyst into two varieties, the common and fibrous; the latter being chiefly characterized by its fibrous fracture and resinous lustre. This latter variety too, is only found massive.\n\nSubspecies 2. Rock Crystal.\n\nMountain Crystal, Kirw. i. 241. Le Cristal de roche, Brochant, i. 243. Quartz-hyalin Limpide, Hauy, ii. 417.\n\nExter. Char.—Rock crystal is usually found crystallized, sometimes in rounded pieces, but rarely massive. The form of its crystals is, 1. A six-sided prism, having one of its bases or both surmounted by a sharp pointed pyramid; the sides of the pyramid and prism corresponding. This is its most usual form; but it exhibits many apparent varieties, arising from modifications in the magnitude of one or several of the faces at the expense of the others. 2. A double six-sided pyramid, which is sometimes perfect, and sometimes truncated on the edges of the common base; and sometimes too, three alternating faces on each pyramid are larger than the others, giving to the crystal the appearance of a cube. 3. A simple, very acute pyramid with six sides, having its summit, and often also its base, acuminate with six faces; but this is rather an irregularity in the crystallization than a new form.\n\nThe crystals of this mineral are sometimes very large, and they are also found very small. In the rounded pieces the external surface is rough, but in the perfect crystals\ncrystals the faces of the prism are striated transversely; but those of the pyramids and acuminations are smooth.\n\nThe lustre is refulgent and vitreous; fracture perfectly conchoidal, sometimes, however, foliated; fragments indeterminate, very sharp edged.\n\nColours of rock-crystals are grayish white, yellowish white, pearl gray, yellowish and blackish brown. Internally it is sometimes iridescent. It is transparent, sometimes semitransparent. By looking across one of the faces of the pyramid, and the opposite face of the prism, double refraction is produced. Scratches glass, and gives sparks with steel. Somewhat fragile; spec. grav. 2.650 to 2.838.\n\nChem. Char.—Entirely infusible before the blowpipe.\n\n| Constituent Parts | Bergman |\n|-------------------|---------|\n| Silica            | 93      |\n| Alumina           | 6       |\n| Lime              | 1       |\n\nPhysical Char.—It is sometimes phosphorescent; two crystals, by being rubbed together, exhibit a little light in the dark, and give out a peculiar odour, which is somewhat empyreumatic.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Rock-crystal is most commonly found in veins of primitive rocks, and particularly in granite; in druses lining the cavities of these rocks. The finest crystals are now brought from Madagascar, but it is a very frequent mineral in most countries, as in the mountains of Switzerland, where it was formerly dug out of the faces of lofty precipices by the inhabitants. It is also found in Bohemia, Saxony, Hungary, and in Cornwall in England, and different parts of Scotland, as in the island of Arran, in the cavities of the granite mountains, and in Cairngorm in Aberdeenshire, the two latter, which are well known by the name of Arthonites and Cairngorms, are usually of a smoky colour, owing, it is supposed, to iron or manganese; probably to the latter, for from some experiments which we have made, the colour entirely disappears by exposing the crystal to a strong heat, and from other observations it appears that the colouring matter is also destroyed by the action of light.\n\nRock crystal sometimes contains schorl, amianthus, actinolite, mica, and titanium. Crystals are also sometimes met with in cavities containing a drop of water, and a small quantity of air.\n\nUses.—Rock crystal, on account of its lustre and transparency, is employed in jewellery, and particularly when it is coloured, as those from Cairngorm in the north of Scotland, many of which are held in high estimation.\n\nSubspecies 3. Rosy Red or Milky Quartz.\n\nRosy Red Quartz, Kirw. i. 245. Quartz laiteux, Brochant, i. 246. Quartz hyalin laiteux, Haüy, ii. 425.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is always found massive. It is indeed said by Emmerling, that it has been found crystallized, in small six-sided prisms, terminated by a six-sided pyramid, at Rabenstein in Bavaria. Internally, its lustre is shining, rarely refulgent; resinous; fracture perfectly conchoidal, and fragments indeterminate. It varies between semitransparent and translucent.\n\nThe colour is sometimes milk white; but its principal colour, it is said, is pale rose red. In its other characters it agrees with rock crystal.\n\nIt is suspected that this mineral is composed of silica and oxide of manganese, to the latter of which the colour is owing.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Milk quartz forms beds in primitive mountains; at Rabenstein in Bavaria it is met with in a large grained granite. It is also found in Finland, Greenland, Saxony, Siberia, and the western part of Invernessshire in Scotland.\n\nUses.—The semitransparency, the fine colour, and the polish of which it is susceptible, have introduced this mineral to be employed in jewellery.\n\nSubspecies 4. Common Quartz.\n\nQuartz, Kirw. i. 242. Le Quartz commune, Brochant, i. 248. Quartz hyalin amorphe, Haüy, ii. 425.\n\nExter. Char.—Common quartz is found in various forms, malleive, disseminated, in grains, and rounded pieces. It is sometimes stalactitical, globular, kidney-form, tuberculated, cellular, perforated, and corroded; sometimes also it is crystallized, and the crystals are either true, or pseudomorphous. The true crystals are grouped together in reniform, rounded, or radiated masses; the form is the same as that of rock crystal. The pseudo crystals derive their figure from the substances on which they are formed, as the cube from fluor spar, the octahedron from the same, the six-sided table from barytes, the acute six-sided pyramid from calcareous spar. The surface of the true crystals is similar to that of rock crystal, but that of the pseudo crystals is rough, and the lustre is dull. Fracture of common quartz is small, conchoidal; sometimes large, splintery, and sometimes imperfectly foliated, or fibrous, with large parallel fibres. Fragments indeterminate, with sharp edges, very rarely rhombohedral. It is commonly translucent, rarely semitransparent. The colour is milk white, snow white, reddish white, and blood and flesh red, with many shades of these colours. Scratches glass. Spec. grav 2.640 to 2.654.\n\nChem. Char.—Infusible before the blowpipe. Silica forms the principal constituent part; but among the numerous varieties of common quartz, there are no doubt slight differences in the nature and quantity of the materials which enter into its composition. The different shades of colour are owing to different portions and different states of metallic substances.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Common quartz is one of the substances of most frequent occurrence in all kinds of rocks, forming one of the chief component parts of primitive mountains, sometimes in entire beds, or whole mountains, as in the islands of Isla and Jura in Scotland. It is also frequent in veins, very common in stratiform rocks, where it constitutes the base of sandstone; in alluvial rocks it is met with in rounded pieces, or in the form of sand.\n\nUses.—Common quartz is employed in the manufacture of glass instead of sand; in the fabrication of flint, and as a flux for calcareous ores of iron.\n\nA variety of this, called aventurine, is sometimes held in considerable estimation. It is the quartz hyalin aventurine.\nSiliceous aventurine of Haüy, and the natural aventurine of De Lille. It is of a deep red, gray, green, or blackish colour, marked with spots sometimes of a yellowish, and sometimes of a silvery appearance, which proceed from very thin pieces of pure quartz disseminated in the mass. It ought not to be confounded with quartz mixed with mica, or micaceous quartz, which is a compound rock. On the contrary, the diversity of colours seems to be owing to numerous fissures which are arranged nearly in the same direction.\n\nAventurine is found near Vaffles, in the department of Deux Sevres in France, in the form of rounded stones, which are reddish; at Cape de Gataes in Spain, of a whitish colour, with silvery spots; in Arragon, which affords several varieties; near Madrid, among rounded fragments of granite; at Facebay in Transylvania, where it is of a black colour, with very small golden spots; and in the neighbourhood of Catharineburg in Siberia.\n\nThe name aventurine is derived from the following circumstance. A workman having dropped by chance par avantage, some brass filings into a vitreous matter in the state of fusion, gave the mixture this name, of which was afterwards made vases and other ornamental objects. Mineralogists gave the same name to natural substances which have a striking resemblance to this artificial production. Haüy, ii. 422.\n\nSubspecies 5. PRASE.\n\nPraseum, Kirw. i. 249. La Prase, Brochant, i. 252.\nQuartz Hyalin Vert obscure, ii. 419. Quartz Prase, Brongniart, i. 280.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral possesses all the characters of quartz in general. It is most commonly found massive, and very rarely crystallized. The crystals, which are usually small, have the form of rock crystal.\n\nThe colour is usually leek green; the external surface is rough and glistering; the internal shining and vitreous; it is translucent; the fracture imperfectly conchoidal, and sometimes coarse splintery; fragments sharp edged. When it is massive, it is composed of distinct concretions, which are granulated prismatic, or uniform, the surface of which is rough and tranversely striated.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Prase is found at Brietenbrunn near Schwartzenberg in Saxony, in a metallic vein, accompanied with magnetic pyrites, galena, blende, calcareous spar, and actinolite. It is also found in Bohemia, in Finland, near lake Onega, and in Siberia.\n\nUses.—As it is susceptible of a fine polish, prase is employed in jewellery.\n\nThis mineral ought not to be confounded with quartz coloured by means of chlorite, which latter is of a brighter green, but opaque.\n\nSubspecies 6. FERRUGINOUS QUARTZ, or IRON FLINT.\n\nLe Caillou Ferrugineux, Brochant, i. 248. Quartz Rubigineux, Brongniart, i. 281. Quartz Hyalin hématoïde, Haüy, ii. 420. Eilenkiefel of the Germans.\n\nExter. Char.—The peculiar character of this mineral seems to be owing to a large proportion of oxide of iron, which renders it opaque. It is usually found massive, but it sometimes also assumes a crystalline form, which is a prism with six equal sides, acuminate at each extremity with three planes. The colour is of a yellowish brown, sometimes of a brownish red, and of a bright blood red. It is usually opaque, or only transparent at the edges. External lustre refulgent; internal shining and vitreous. Fracture imperfectly conchoidal; fragments angular, but not very sharp-edged. Concretions small-grained and distinct. It is harder than common jasper. Not very brittle.\n\nLocalities.—This mineral is found in veins of ironstone in Saxony, and in England, where it is accompanied with sulphate of barytes.\n\nFerruginous quartz is distinguished from jasper, to the red variety of which it has a striking resemblance, by its shining fracture, which is also vitreous and conchoidal; its property of crystallizing; and according to Brongniart, by having no alumina in its composition, which he properly considers as an essential characteristic.\n\n28. Species. HORNSTONE.\n\nHornstone, Kirw. i. 303. La Pierre de Corne, Brochant, i. 254. Petrosilex, Haüy, iv. 385.\n\nThis mineral is met with in masses and also in rounded balls. The colour is usually gray; it is translucent at the edges, the fracture splintery or conchoidal; it has little lustre; is so hard as to scratch glass, and give fire with steel; and its spec. grav. is from 2.699 to 2.708.\n\nThe diversity of fracture which has been observed in hornstone, has led to the subdivision of this species into three subspecies, viz. splintery hornstone, conchoidal hornstone, and woodstone.\n\nSubspecies 1. SPLINTERY HORNSTONE.\n\nHornstone Écailléux, Brochant, i. 255. Petrosilex Squamosus, Wallerius, i. 280.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found massive, or in rounded pieces. It has scarcely any lustre; the fracture is fine, splintery; fragments sharp-edged; translucent at the edges. It is scarcely so hard as quartz; it is brittle.\n\nThe colour is bluish grey, smoke and pearl grey, sometimes greenish and yellowish grey, more rarely olive and mountain green. Sometimes there is a mixture of these colours, arranged in spots and stripes. Spec. grav. 2.65-4. Kirw.\n\nChem. Char.—According to some mineralogists, this variety of hornstone is fusible before the blow-pipe, but according to others it is infusible without the addition of borax.\n\nThe following are the constituent parts of a hornstone analyzed by Kirwan.\n\n| Component       | Percentage |\n|-----------------|------------|\n| Silica          | 72         |\n| Alumina         | 22         |\n| Carbonate of Lime| 6          |\n| Total           | 100        |\n\nLocalities, &c.—This variety of hornstone is chiefly found in veins in primitive mountains. It is also found in rounded pieces in alluvial rocks, and it constitutes the chief basis of hornstone porphyry, as at Dannemora and Garpenberg in Sweden. It is met with in veins at Freyberg, Schneeberg, Johann-Georgenstadt, and Gerzdorf in Saxony.\nSubspecies 2. CONCHOIDAL HORNSTONE.\n\nPetroflex Equabilis, Wallerius i. 231. Le Hornstein Conchoide, Brochant, i. 258.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is always found massive, and seems to approach in its characters very nearly to the preceding variety or subspecies, excepting in the fracture, which is perfectly conchoidal.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This subspecies is found in beds and veins, when it is sometimes accompanied with agate. It has been found accompanying gneis at Goldberg in Saxony, and fine specimens of both subspecies are met with in the island of Rona near Sky in Scotland, where it seems to form a considerable vein, traversing a gneis rock.\n\nSubspecies 3. WOODSTONE, or Petrified Wood.\n\nWoodstone, Kirw. i. 215. Le Holzstein, Brochant i. 259. Quartz Agathe Hyloide, Hauy, ii. 439.\n\nThis subspecies possesses more distinctive characters than the former; and as it seems to be wood, retaining its original texture, converted into hornstone by some petrifying process, it is usually found in inflated masses, or in rounded pieces. It has the external appearance of wood, for the surface is rough and uneven, or longitudinally striated; internally it is glistering, but sometimes dull, having a vitreous lustre. The fracture most frequently exhibits the fibrous texture of the wood. The cross fracture is sometimes splintery or imperfectly conchoidal. The fragments are indeterminate, and slightly sharp-edged. The most common colour is dark gray, ash gray, grayish white, and sometimes cochineal and blood red. Different colours appear in the same mineral, forming spots, clouds, or stripes. It is commonly translucent at the edges, sometimes entirely translucent, and sometimes opaque. It is hard and brittle.\n\nLocalities.—Woodstone is met with in Bohemia, Saxony, Siberia, and on the banks of Loch Neagh in the north of Ireland, particularly, as we have been informed, near places where some of the rivers discharge their waters into the lake.\n\nUses.—This mineral is generally susceptible of a fine polish, and is therefore employed in jewellery.\n\n29. Species. FLINTY SLATE, or Siliceous Schistus.\n\nThis species is divided into two subspecies or varieties, viz. common siliceous schistus, and Lydian stone.\n\nSubspecies 1. COMMON SILICEOUS SCHISTUS.\n\nSiliceous schistus, Kirw. i. 306. Schiste silicieux commun, Brochant, i. 283.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found in masses or rounded pieces, and it is frequently traversed by veins of quartz of a grayish white, or coloured red by means of iron. This, it is said, is a distinguishing characteristic of siliceous schistus which it rarely wants (Brochant). Internally it is dull, very rarely a little glimmering. The fracture in the small is compact, sometimes splintery, and sometimes imperfectly conchoidal; but in the great or large masses it is flaky, a character which almost always disappears in the small fragments. The fragments are sharp edged. The colour is blackish, greenish, or smoke gray. It is commonly opaque, rarely translucent at the edges. It is hard and brittle.\n\nChem. Char.—Before the blow-pipe, gray siliceous schistus becomes white and friable; the black affirms a darker colour, and is a little vitrified at the edges.\n\nConstituent Parts. Wieglob.\n\n| Silica | 75 |\n|--------|----|\n| Magnesia | 4.58 |\n| Lime | 10. |\n| Iron | 3.54 |\n| Inflammable matters | 5.02 |\n| Loss | 1.86 |\n\n100.00\n\nLocalities, &c.—Siliceous schistus is met with in Bohemia, Saxony, Switzerland, and Siberia; at Leadhills in Scotland, and also at Carlpos, near the termination of the great coal field to the south of Edinburgh.\n\nThe geological position of this stone is not precisely determined. In Scotland it is connected with those rocks which come under the denomination of transition rocks; but according to different descriptions it seems to have been confounded with argillaceous schistus, with which indeed it possesses some common properties; and some mineralogists regard it as an argillaceous schistus, having a larger proportion of siliceous earth. In support of this opinion, siliceous schistus has been found in situations where it is subordinate to argillaceous schistus.\n\nSubspecies 2. LYDIAN STONE.\n\nBofanite, Kirw. i. 307. La Pierre de Lydie, Brochant, i. 286. Roche Corneenne, Hauy, iv. 434.\n\nThis stone, which is of a grayish, bluish, or velvet black, is found in masses, and in rounded pieces of a trapezoidal form, which are also traversed with veins of whitish quartz. The external surface is smooth and weakly shining; the internal is glimmering. The fracture is even, sometimes slightly conchoidal or uneven, rarely splintery; in large masses it is flaky. The fragments are sharp-edged, and sometimes assume a cubical form. It is commonly opaque, and rarely translucent at the edges. It is scratched by quartz; brittle. Spec. grav. 2.415 to 2.880.\n\nLocalities.—Lydian stone is found in similar places with the former variety.\n\nUses.—This stone has been long known under the name of touchstone, because it is employed to ascertain the purity of gold. From this use it obtained the name of Barinos or the trier, and it was called Lydian stone, because it was found in Lydia. When it is employed as a touchstone, the gold to be tried is rubbed on its polished surface; on the metallic trace which remains nitric acid is poured, and the quantity of alloy is judged of by the degree of change which takes place, this being compared with traces made and treated in the same way with needles differently alloyed and prepared for the purpose. This test, it is to be observed, is not perfectly accurate, but is sufficiently so for those who are much employed in the use of it. The property which renders this mineral fit for the above purpose depends on its degree of hardness, while it presents at the same time a smooth and even fracture without being perfectly smooth. Other stones possessing similar properties,\nties, such as several varieties of basalt, are conveniently employed for the same purpose.\n\n30. Species. Flint.\n\nFlint, Kirw. i. 351. Pierre à fusil, Brochant, i. 263. Quartz-Agathe Pyromaque, Hauy, ii. 427.\n\nExter. Char.—Flint is found massive, disseminated, in angular fragments, in globular masses, tuberculated, and perforated. The surface is sometimes rough, sometimes uneven, and sometimes smooth. The white crust with which it is often covered, is considered by some mineralogists as an incipient decomposition. The external lustre is dull or a little glimmering; the internal is weakly shining; the fracture is perfectly conchoidal, the fragments sharp edged. The colour is usually gray, smoke gray, sometimes perfectly black. Various colours appear in the same mineral, presenting spots, stripes, and clouds.

It is met with in Saxony, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and Spain, and is very abundant in chalk beds in the north of France, and also in different parts of England. It is also met with distributed in layers in the white limestone rocks, on the north coast of Ireland. In the department of Jura in France, globular masses of flint have been found with cavities containing sulphur.\n\nThe singular geological relations of this mineral have greatly puzzled naturalists, who are fond of such speculations, and are never satisfied till they have accounted for everything, however scanty and defective the data may be on which their hypotheses are formed. It is on this account that the theories which have been proposed, to explain the formation of flint, offer nothing more than the silliest and most groundless conjectures; and indeed the same remark is equally applicable to theories of the earth in general. It has been already observed that flint is regularly disposed in layers, in the beds of chalk or limestone in which it is found. In an insulated mass of white limestone near Port Rush on the north coast of Ireland, which we had an opportunity of examining, the balls of flint were disposed in this way with great regularity. When the bed of limestone is of no great thickness, it contains only one layer of flints, but in thicker beds there are two layers of flints, the one near the top, and the other near the bottom of the bed. Those layers of flint, too, it is to be observed, have exactly the same inclination as the strata of limestone. According to one set of theorists, the fire, flint being in a state of fusion, was ejected from the bowels of the earth, and deposited in the places where it is now found. This opinion carries along with it its own absurdity; for admitting that the flinty matter has been in a state of fusion, it is impossible to suppose that it could be deposited with so much uniformity and regularity, by being projected according to the conjecture of the philosophers who maintain this opinion. Had this been the mode of its formation, masses of flint would have been found throughout every part of the chalk or limestone beds, and not in regular layers, as is really the case.\n\nAccording to another opinion, by which the formation of flint is supposed to be accounted for, cavities were produced, while the chalk and limestone were yet in a soft state, in consequence of the air extricated during the evaporation of the water; and the flinty matter in solution was introduced into these cavities by infiltration from above. But the same argument is equally forcible against this opinion. It is impossible to conceive that the cavities could be so regularly and uniformly produced by the extrication of the air. They would have been found through every part of the beds of chalk and limestone where flint is met with. And besides, even allowing that this flinty matter was held in solution by water, it might naturally be asked, why the greatest proportion of it was not deposited near the surface, when it first came in contact with the chalk or limestone, rather than to have continued to pass through the different beds, and form masses of solid flints at the greatest depths, in as great quantity as near the surface.\n\nA third opinion, which some imagine to be less improbable than either of the former, supposes that flints have been entirely produced by marine animals deposited during the formation of the strata in which they are contained. This opinion seems to derive some support from the remains of marine animals, which are not unfrequently found included in nodules of flint. It is no rare occurrence to meet with shells thus attached to these nodules, and converted into flinty matter, but at the same time retaining their original form and appearance in the most perfect manner.\n\nUses.—The extensive use of this mineral, in consequence of its property of striking fire with steel, as gun flints, is well known. Flints are employed also as a substitute for quartz in the manufacture of glass and porcelain, and in the fabrication of flint. The coarser kinds, or such as are perforated and curious, are applied to the purposes of building and milestones. Sometimes the colours and the polish of flint are so fine as to have brought it into use in jewellery.\n\nAs flints are found in greatest abundance in France and England, the principal manufactures of gun flints are carried on in these countries. A particular account of this manufacture in France has been given by Delomieu and Salivet, \"Journal des Mines,\" No. 33, pp. 693 and 713. The whole process, which according to the description of Delomieu is divided into four stages, is very simple.\n\n1. After having fixed upon a mass of stone fit for\nfor the purpose, the first part of the operation is to break the stone into pieces of convenient size. With this view the workman, seated on the ground, places the stone on his left thigh, and strikes it with small strokes, to divide it into pieces of a pound or a pound and a half weight, having large surfaces and smooth fractures; and at the same time he avoids splitting or flaking the stone by too feeble or too violent strokes.\n\n2. In the next part of the operation the nicest management and dexterity of hand are required; for by repeated strokes splinters of the proper size to form gun flints are detached; one is separated at every stroke. During this operation he holds the mass of stone in his left hand. The splinters are about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch broad, \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) long, and two lines thick in the middle. They are slightly convex above, and concave below; thick at one edge, and thin at the opposite edge.\n\n3. The flint is brought to a regular shape during this part of the operation; and,\n\n4. The edge of the gun flint which strikes fire, is brought to a straight line by placing it on a sharp iron instrument, and giving it five or six small flukes with a circular hammer (roulette). This finishes the operation, and the whole time of making a flint is not equal to a minute. With masses of stone that work easily, an expert workman will prepare 1000 good splinters in a day. It requires another day to bring to the proper shape 500; so that in three days he can split off from the mass and completely finish 1000 gun flints.\n\n31. Species. CALCEDONY.\n\nThis species has been divided into two subspecies or varieties; common calcedony and carnelian.\n\nSubspecies 1. Common CALCEDONY.\n\nId. Kirw. i. 298. La Calcedoine Commune, Brochant, i. 268. Quartz Agathe Calcedoine, Haity, ii. 425.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found massive, in rounded pieces, which are globular, reniform, botryoidal, stalactitical, cellular; and sometimes also it is crystallized in the form of a cube, rhomboid, a simple pyramid with three and six faces; but these are supposed to be pseudo crystals, or merely a crust of calcedony on the crystals of other substances. The external surface is most commonly uneven, sometimes rough, and rarely smooth. External lustre is accidental; internal glimmering, rarely a little shining; fracture even, sometimes imperfectly conchoidal or splintery; fragments sharp-edged.\n\nColour white, grayish or bluish white, yellowish or blackish; various colours appear in spots, clouds, stripes, and veins. Sometimes when it is cut it is iridescent; commonly translucent, rarely semitransparent. Harder than flint. Brittle. Spec. grav. 2.600 to 2.700.\n\nChem. Char.—Before the blow pipe it is infusible.\n\nConstituent Parts.\n\n| Silica | 84 |\n|--------|----|\n| Alumina| 16 |\n| A trace of iron | — |\n\nLocallities, &c.—Calcedony is most usually met with in globular masses in amygdaloid, as at Oberstein, in the duchy of Deux Ponts. It is found also in Saxony, Silefia, and Siberia, in Iceland and the Faro islands; in the north of Ireland; and in several of the western islands of Scotland. The cavities of the balls of calcedony are often lined with crystals of quartz and amethyst.\n\nUses.—Calcedony takes a fine polish, and is therefore employed in jewellery.\n\n2. Subspecies. CARNELIAN.\n\nId. Kirw. i. 300. La Cornaline, Brochant, i. 272. Quartz-Agathe Cornaline, Haity, ii. 425.\n\nThis mineral is found in masses, or disseminated, but most frequently in rounded pieces of a globular, kidney form, or stalactitical shape. External surface rough and uneven; internal lustre glimmering, or slightly shining; fracture perfectly conchoidal; fragments very sharp-edged; most common colour blood red of various shades, and sometimes reddish brown or wax and honey yellow; semitransparent, hard, and brittle. Spec. grav. 2.59 to 2.73.\n\nChem. Char.—Carnelian is infusible before the blowpipe, but loses its colour, and becomes white.\n\nLocallities, &c.—Carnelian is found in similar circumstances, and in similar places with common calcedony, but is of less frequent occurrence. The finest carnelians are brought from the east, and thence they are denominated oriental.\n\nUses.—The carnelian is employed for the same purposes as common calcedony.\n\nObservations on Agate.—As common calcedony and carnelian, along with jasper, constitute the base of the greater number of agates, it may be here proper to introduce a few remarks on the mineral substances which are included under this name, and on the theories of their formation.\n\nThe term agate is of very general application, comprehending numerous varieties, which are chiefly distinguished by the arrangement and disposition of the colours with which they are marked, and from which they have derived particular names. The following are some of the principal varieties of agate.\n\n1. Fortification agate, in which the different coloured stripes are arranged in a zigzag manner, presenting something of the appearance of a fortified town.\n\n2. Landscape agate, in which the colours and shades are so arranged as to exhibit the appearance of a landscape.\n\n3. Band or ribbon agate, in which the various colours are disposed in stripes or zones, which are usually in straight lines, but sometimes concentric. To this variety of agate, when the zones or stripes are arranged parallel to each other, and distinctly marked, the name of onyx was given by the ancients. The name onyx, which signifies the nail of the finger, is derived from the whitish colour resembling that part of the body. They also gave the name of jasper to a variety of the same stone, of a flesh colour, and afterwards the compound name sardonyx was given to another variety, in which a whitish layer of the onyx, having some degree of transparency, covered another layer of a flesh red, the colour of which latter appeared through the former in the same manner as the colour of the flesh appears through the nail. But\nin the end, the name of onyx seems to have been applied to all stones formed of layers of different colours.\n\n4. Mocha agate. In some varieties of agate filaments of a greenish or other colour, having the appearance of some species of conserver or mulch, are observed, and these have been denominated mocha agates. Some have supposed that these filaments have been real molles or conserves, enveloped by the siliceous matter. In some also delineations of a brown or black colour, exhibit the appearance of trees or shrubs. This dendritical appearance is ascribed by some to the infiltration of iron or manganese into the natural fissures of the stone. The finest agates of this variety, it is said, are brought from Arabia, by the way of Mocha, on the coast of the Red sea; and hence they are known by the name of Mocha stones. Beside these varieties, there are several others, as tubular agate, when it is composed of calcedony, which seems to have been in the form of stalactites, and afterwards filled up with a different mineral substance, or at least of a different colour; clouded agate, presenting the appearance of clouds; radiated or flatted, when the different colours are arranged in rays; breccia agate, composed of fragments of different kinds of agate, and cemented together by siliceous matter, and constituting a real breccia; spotted agate, when the colours are disposed in points or spots; petrified agate, which seems to have been wood penetrated with the matter of agate; coral agate, having the appearance of coralloid; jasper agate, in which the predominant part of its composition is jasper.\n\nThe formation of agate has been the subject of much controversy among contending theorists; for while one party conceives that it affords the strongest proofs of being produced by means of heat, or from a state of fusion, another party seems to be equally convinced that it supplies them with the most certain evidence of having been formed from an aqueous solution.\n\nBeside other strong objections that might be urged against the opinion of agate being formed from a state of fusion, the uniformity and regularity in the arrangement of the different kinds of matter of which it is composed, seem quite hostile to it, and, excepting to those who are previously prepossessed with such an opinion, will, we presume, appear altogether insurmountable; for it is inconceivable, that in a mass of melted matter, whether it have been in a state of fusion in the place where it is now found, or projected from the bowels of the earth into the strata which are now its repository, while in a soft state, could arrange itself into layers, some of them often extremely thin, and disposed in stripes, concentric circles, spots, while these various kinds of matter exhibit very slight shades of difference in their constituent parts. It cannot even be imagined that all this could have been effected, even by the slowest and most gradual process of cooling.\n\nIn accounting for the formation of agate by solution in water, it is said that the cavities in the rocks which contain agate, were formed in consequence of the evolution and extrication of air, while those rocks were in a state of softness; and that the matter of which agate is composed, was introduced in the state of an aqueous solution by means of infiltration. But objections, equally insurmountable, might easily be adduced against this theory; and one of the first that presents itself is derived from the diversity of matter deposited in masses of agate. This objection, indeed, is attempted to be obviated by supposing that the agate composed of different kinds of matter was derived from different kinds of successive solutions; but this is only removing the difficulty a step farther; for, can it easily be conceived, that a very thin layer of one kind of matter being deposited, and this, let it be supposed, of a white colour, the solution was changed, from which proceeded another thin layer; that the solution was again changed, and deposited a third kind of matter; and after another change, a fourth kind, or perhaps that the deposition of the first kind of matter again commenced. But if infiltration from an aqueous solution have really been the mode of formation of this mineral, how comes it, it may be fairly asked, that the depositions from the different kinds of solution have not been arranged, at least in the larger cavities, in strata or zones parallel to the horizon; because it seems natural to suppose that the deposition of flinty matter, from a state of solution in water, would be influenced by gravitation, and thus be horizontally arranged? We are aware, indeed, of an objection which may be made to this observation. It will be said, that the influence of gravity has in this case been counteracted by the action of affinity between the flinty matter in solution, and the sides of the cavity in which the agate is formed; but whatever effect this might have in the smaller cavities, its influence would be diminished in those of larger capacity.\n\nTo what we have now said on this subject, which, it must be acknowledged, is more curious than useful, we shall only add a circumstance which, so far as we know, has not been noticed by geologists; but it seems to be of considerable importance in the establishment or subversion of the theory of the formation of agate by means of infiltration in the state of aqueous solution. It will be allowed, we presume, that all agates found in the same horizontal position, or at the same depth from the surface, from which the aqueous solution is understood to have proceeded, were formed from the same solutions; at least those agates which are contiguous to each other, that is, within the space of a few yards, or even of a single yard. Now, if this be admitted, all the agates which have derived their materials from the same solutions, ought to be exactly of the same kind, because their origin is contemporaneous, and it is derived from the same solutions. To ascertain this point with precision, it will be necessary to examine agates in their native repositories; and although we shall not pretend confidently to decide the question, because our observations with this view have not been sufficiently varied and extensive, yet we strongly suspect, that it will appear, from future investigations, that agates, and even such as are almost contiguous to each other, have been formed of very different materials, or of similar materials arranged in a very different manner. To those who are fond of such speculations we recommend this as a subject of investigation.\n\nLocalities.—Agates are found in great abundance in different parts of the world. They are sometimes distributed indiscriminately with the rocks which contain them, sometimes in beds or layers, in interrupted masses, and sometimes in thin beds, where there is scarcely any interruption of continuity. This last mode of arrangement, however, is rare. Agates are sometimes found in metallic veins, or are mixed with metallic substances,\nas the sulphurites of lead and silver. It would appear, too, that agates also exist in primitive rocks. Saufure has observed them in granite, containing nodules of the same granite, and penetrated with iron pyrites. He has observed also at the same place, near Vienne, in the department of Isere, thin layers of calcedony alternating with gneiss; but porphyries and similar rocks are the usual repositories of agate. These stones are found in great variety and abundance at Oberstein, in the department of Mont-Tonnerre, in France, in a rock of amygdaloid of a peculiar nature, and full of cavities of all sizes. This rock is considered by Dolomieu as a volcanic tufa; but according to other mineralogists, and particularly Faujas de St Fond, who has given a minute description of it*, it is considered as a porphyry or amygdaloid, with a basis of trap, which is very subject to decomposition. The globular masses of agate are disposed in this rock without any order, and are usually enveloped with a peculiar greenish earth, but which contains no copper. In the geodes of agate found at Oberstein, jasper, amethyst, carbonate of lime in crystals, chabasite, a species of zeolite, and some portion of titanium, have been observed; but not the least trace of any organized body. Digging, polishing, and forming into a great variety of ornamental objects, constitute the chief employment of the inhabitants of Oberstein.\n\nAgates are found in abundance in different parts of Scotland; but the largest and finest are met with in the neighbourhood of Montrose and Stonehaven; in the rocks near Dunbar on the east coast, and in the rocks about Dunure, on the shore of Carrick in Ayrshire.\n\n32.

It has much the appearance of gum, and is usually cracked.

The finest opals are found at Czerwenitza not far from Caichau in Upper Hungary, in an argillaceous decomposed porphyry, which according to some mineralogists is a gray stone (graustein of the Germans), and are disposed in veins, nests, and grains. When the opal adheres in small particles closely together in the stone, it forms what is called mother of opal. It is found in the same manner in a kind of breccia of this decomposed porphyry. (Townson's Travels in Hungary, p. 327.) It is found also at Eeibenstock, Johann-Georgenstadt, and Freyberg in Saxony. At this latter place the repository of the opal is porphyry. The opal also is met with in Iceland.\n\nThe opal mines described by Dr Townson are situated in a hill of some miles in extent not far from the village of Czerwenitza. This hill has been opened in several places, but in three with the greatest success. Guards are placed upon it to prevent any person from digging this precious stone; for as it is situated in part of the royal domain, the peasants who were formerly permitted to search for it on their own account are now prohibited by the emperor. But even at the time Dr Townson visited the mines the work had been discontinued for three or four years as unprofitable. The usual mode of conducting the operations in searching for the opal is by quarrying to the depth of three or four yards, rarely deeper. The rock is thus thrown out, broken to pieces, and afterwards examined. In one place the search had been made by mining; but the gallery was only a few yards in length. From this account it appears that the rock containing the opal lies near the surface, and seldom, it is said, extends deeper than a few fathoms. The opals denominated oriental by the lapidaries, a term expressive of their value rather than of their origin, are supposed to be from these mines, in which, according to records still in existence, 300 men were employed not less than 400 years ago.\n\nUses. On account of the fine play of colours, the opal is held in great estimation for the purposes of jewellery, and the opals which reflect green colours in most abundance are most highly valued. The finest opals are called oriental; but this epithet is given by the lapidaries to the more perfect precious stones, and is not to be understood as denoting that they have been brought from eastern countries.\nThe ancients, it would appear from the account of Pliny, attached an immense value to this stone; for he informs us that a senator called Nonius rather submitted to banishment than give up an opal which he had in his possession to Mark Anthony. This opal was estimated at 20,000 sesterces. Lib. xxxvii. cap. 6.\n\nSubspecies 2. Common Opal.\n\nSemi-opal, Kirwan i. 290. L'Opale Commune, Brochant i. 344.

The common opal is found in veins, chiefly in amygdaloid rocks, and sometimes also, it is said, in granites and porphyries. It is of most frequent occurrence in Bohemia; in Saxony, as at Freyberg, Eibenstock, &c.; in Hungary, in Poland, in Scotland, and the Faroe islands. The amygdaloid rocks in the vicinity of the Giants Causeway in the north of Ireland also afford a repository for this mineral.\n\nUses.—It is employed as well as the former for the purposes of jewellery, but is esteemed of inferior value.\n\nIt has been observed of some varieties of common opal that they are hydrophanous, that is, they possess the property of becoming transparent when immersed in water, a property which it supposed depends on the absorption of the water in the pores of the opal. When similar varieties of opal are dipped in melted wax, they are impregnated with it, and become in like manner transparent, but on cooling resume their opacity. To such varieties De Born has given the name of Pyrophane.\n\nSubspecies 3. Semi-opal.\n\nId. Kirwan i. 290. La Demi-opale, Brochant i. 347.

It is usually found in veins, especially such as contain ores of iron. It is often traversed with veins of quartz, or mixed with pyrites, lithomarga, fennopil, brown spar, native and vitreous silver. It has been taken for the basis of some porphyries, but these turn out to be indurated clay, pitch stone, and horn stone.\n\nSubspecies 5. Jasper Agate.\n\nExter.

It is found massive, and possesses no lustre. Fracture conchoidal, generally opaque, pretty hard, and sometimes adheres to the tongue. The colours are yellowish or reddish white, which are disposed in stripes and circles.\n\nLocalities, &c.—It is met with in many places in agate balls, in amygdaloid rocks.\n\nSubspecies 6. Opal Jasper.\n\nExter. Char.—This variety of jasper seems to possess many common characters with some varieties of opal. It is found massive.

Brittle, and easily frangible.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This mineral is found in Hungary, in Siberia, and other places, and is usually in nests in porphyry.\n\nBesides the localities of the different varieties of jasper already mentioned, we may notice that it is met with in Siberia of a white and bluish colour. The hill on which the fortress of Orskai stands on the left bank of the river Jaik, in the government of Orenbourg, is entirely composed of a pale green and deep red jasper, disposed in inclined beds; and on the most elevated parts of the Altaian mountains, near the source of the river Korgou, a jasper has been discovered of an ivory white colour, which is remarkable for being penetrated with black dendrites.\n\nUses of Jasper.—It is valued according to its hardness, the degree of polish of which it is susceptible, and the beauty and variety of its colours; and it is employed in forming vases, handles for swords and knives, and other smaller ornamental purposes.\n\n36. Species. Heliotrope, or Bloodstone.\n\nHeliotropium, Kirw. i. 314. L'Heliotrope, Broch. i. 276. Quartz-jaspe Sanguin, Haüy, ii. 436.\n\nExter. Char.—Heliotrope is found massive or in angular pieces; external lustre glimmering or thinning, and resinous; fracture conchoidal, sometimes uneven. Fragments very sharp-edged.\n\nColour chiefly deep green, but of various shades, with spots of olive and yellow, but most frequently scarlet or blood red; translucent at the edges; hard, easily frangible. Spec. grav. 2.62 to 2.7.\n\nChem. Char.—Entirely infusible before the blow pipe.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This mineral was originally brought from the east, but it has since been found in Siberia, in Bohemia, where it is met with in a vein, and in Iceland.\n\nUses.—It is employed for similar purposes with jasper or agate.\n\nBy many mineralogists this mineral is considered as a variety of jasper; hence it has been called oriental jasper; and it is supposed by some to be a calcedony penetrated with green earth.\n\n37. Species. Chrysoprase.\n\nChrysopraeum, Kirw. i. 284. La Chrysoprase, Broch. i. 280. Quartz-Agathe Prase, Haüy ii. 426.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found massive, or in angular fragments; internal lustre rarely glimmering; fracture even, sometimes splintery; fragments sharp-edged.\n\nColour apple-green, greenish gray, or leek-green; translucent, sometimes semitransparent; less hard than calcedony and flint. Spec. grav. 2.25.\n\nChem. Char.—Infusible before the blow-pipe, but loses its transparency, and becomes white.\n\nConstituent Parts. Klaproth.\n\n| Silica | 96.16 |\n|--------|-------|\n| Alumina | .08 |\n| Lime | .82 |\n| Oxide of iron | .08 |\n| Oxide of nickel | 1.00 |\n| Lofs | 1.86 |\n\n100.00\n\nLocalities, &c.—Chrysoprase is found at Kofsmutz, in Upper Silesia, in a mountain composed of serpentine, asbestos, indurated talc, and lithomarga.\n\nUses.—It is employed for similar purposes as jasper, and it is greatly esteemed when it is of a fine apple-green colour. It is said that some varieties of this mineral lose their colour by being exposed to moisture, so that the jewellers, before using them, put them to the test, by keeping them for some time in a moist place.\n\n38. Species. Plasma.\n\nId. Broch. i. 278. Silex Plaume, Brongniart, ii. 398.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found disseminated, in rounded pieces, and also in angular pieces. Internal lustre glimmering or weakly thinning; resinous. Fracture conchoidal, even, and sometimes splintery. Translucent, and sometimes even transparent in thin pieces.\n\nColour, various shades of green; and sometimes different colours are disposed in spots, stripes, and points. Nearly\nPart I.\n\nMINERALOGY.\n\nNearly equally hard with calcedony. Brittle, and easily frangible.\n\nChem. Char.—It is infusible before the blow-pipe, but becomes white.\n\nLocalities, &c.—It is said by some, that this mineral has only been found among the ruins of Rome, but according to Bronnart and others, it has been found in the Levant, in Upper Hungary, and in Moravia, in a mountain of serpentine, where it is accompanied with flint.\n\nUtes.—It appears that this mineral was much employed by the ancients for ornamental purposes.\n\n39. Species. CAT'S EYE.\n\nId. Kirw. i. 301. L'Oeil de Chat, Brochant, i. 292; Quartz-Agathe Chatoyant, Haüy, ii. 427.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral, as it is brought from its native country, is usually cut and polished, so that its natural form is unknown; but it is supposed that it is met with in grains or rounded pieces. A mass described by Klaproth, which seemed to be, in its natural state, had a quadrangular form, a rough surface, and considerable brilliancy. The lustre is resplendent and refrinous. The cross fracture is uneven, the longitudinal fracture imperfectly foliated. Fragments more or less sharp-edged.\n\nThe colour is greenish yellowish and smoke gray, of various shades, and sometimes, but rarely, grayish or silvery white. It is translucent, rarely semitransparent. When it is cut, it reflects different rays of light by changing its position, a character, by which it is easily known. This is ascribed to small parallel fibres which appear in the interior of the stone. It is hard, easily frangible. Spec. grav. 2.625 to 2.665.\n\nChem. Char.—It melts with great difficulty by the action of the blow-pipe. Klaproth subjected it to the heat of a porcelain furnace, but it was not melted; it only lost its hardness, lustre, and transparency, and the colour became of a pale gray.\n\nConstituent Parts. Klaproth.\n\n| Silica | 95.00 | 94.50 |\n|--------|-------|-------|\n| Alumina| 1.75  | 2.00  |\n| Lime   | 1.50  | 1.50  |\n| Oxide of iron | 0.25 | 0.25 |\n| Loes   | 1.50  | 1.75  |\n\n100.00 100.00\n\nLocalities.—Cat's eye is brought from Ceylon and the Malabar coast, and also, it is said, from Egypt and Arabia; but always in the polished state. The only one known in its natural state was that above mentioned, which was presented to Klaproth by Mr Greville of London.\n\nUtes.—This mineral is in great estimation as a precious stone, and it is usually cut for ring-stones.\n\nThe name is derived from its possessing the property of reflecting the light similar to the eye of the cat, and hence the term chatoyant among jewellers, which is expressive of this effect.\n\n49. Species. OBSIDIAN.\n\nId. Kirwan, i. 265. Iceland agate vulgo. L'Obsidienne, Brochant, i. 288. Lave vireuse Obsidienne, Haüy, iv. 594.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found in masses, and sometimes in rounded pieces. Lustre resplendent, vitreous; fracture perfectly conchoidal; fragments very sharp-edged.\n\nThe most common colour of obsidian is perfectly black, sometimes greenish and grayish, black, blueish, greenish and smoke gray, and yellow and red, according to Humboldt; most commonly opaque, but sometimes translucent on the edges. It is hard and easily frangible. Spec. grav. 2.348.\n\nChem.

Humboldt discovered a variety of obsidian in New Spain, which was chatoyant in a considerable degree. The obsidian from Hungary is found in inflated pieces among detached masses of granite, gneiss and decomposed porphyry. Obsidian was long supposed to have a volcanic origin; but it appears from the accounts of those who have visited Iceland, that it is not only found in the vicinity of Hecla, but everywhere, distributed like quartz and flint; and besides it is not unfrequent in countries where volcanoes were never known to exist.\n\nUtes.—The fine colour and hardness of this stone have brought it into use for ornamental purposes. Among the ancient Mexicans and Peruvians it was employed as mirrors, some of which, it is said, are sometimes still found in the tombs of their ancient sovereigns (Faylas Miner. des Volcans, p. 308); and also for cutting instruments as knives and even razors. Hernandez saw the Mexican cutlers make a hundred knives of obsidian in the course of an hour. Obsidian, it is said, has also been used as mirrors for telescopes.\n\n41. Species. PITCHSTONE.\n\nId. Kirwan, i. 292. La pierre de poix, Brochant, i. 353. Petroflex resiniforme, Haüy, iv. 386.\n\nExter Char.—Pitchstone, which has received its name\nname from its resemblance to pitch, is found massive; sometimes in extensive beds and veins, and also forming entire mountains. Internal lustre shining and resinous. Fragments sharp-edged. In coarse and frequently small granular distinct concretions which have a smooth surface.\n\nThe colours are various shades of black, green, brown, red, and gray. Translucent, but commonly at the edges only. Brittle, and rather easily frangible. Spec. grav. of pitchstone from Saxony, 2.314; of black pitchstone from Arran 2.338; of pitchstone from Meissen, 1.645, Klaproth.\n\nChem.

It abounds also in Scotland, particularly in the island of Arran, where it is met with in beds, but chiefly in veins traversing the strata in the less elevated parts of the island. Pitchstone also forms the basis of a porphyry.\n\n42. Species, PEARLSTONE.\n\nObsidienne Perle, Brongniart, ii. 340. Lave Vitreuse Perle, Haüy, iv. 495. Volcanic Zeolite, Fichtel. Zeolitic Pitchstone of others. See Klaproth, Transl. ii. 263.\n\nExter. Char.—Pearlstone almost always forms the ground or basis of a species of porphyry which contains roundish or longish vesicular cavities. Lustre pearly. Fracture seems imperfectly conchoidal; but is not very perceptible. Fragments blunt-edged.\n\nColour bluish, ash, greenish gray. Translucent at the edges. When breathed upon gives out the argillaceous odour. Not brittle, but easily frangible. Soft. Spec. grav. 2.340 to 2.548.\n\nChem.

It is also found in Iceland and Teneriffe; in Hungary; and on the banks of the Rhine between Andernach and Coblenz.\n\nUses.—Pumice is very much employed in polishing stones, metals, glass, ivory, and in the preparation of parchment.\n\nA rare variety of pumice is described by Brongniart in the form of vitreous filaments as fine as hair; the colour is a deep bottle green, and it melts by heat into a white enamel. This pumice is supposed to be projected from the volcano in the Isle of Bourbon.\n\n44. Species, PREHNITE.\n\nId. Kirwan, i. 274. La Prehnite, Brochant, i. 295. Prehnite, Haüy, iii. 67.\n\nEffem. Char.—Divisible by one distinct line only, and pretty clean; electric by heat.\n\nExter. Char.—Prehnite is found either massive or crystallized. The principal form of its crystals is a four-sided rhomboidai table, which is either perfect or truncated on all its edges, or a table with six faces, and an equal angle, or a large rectangular prism terminated by a bevelment which is somewhat obtuse. The crystals are usually grouped together, and united by their lateral faces; face of the crystals smooth; external lustre shining; internal weakly shining and pearly; principal fracture foliated, cross fracture fine-grained uneven; fragments but little sharp-edged.\nColour green, olive green, mountain green, and greenish white; semiflattened, and sometimes transparent.

It is also found in France, as in Dauphiny, where it exists in veins. It is not unfrequent in different parts of Scotland, as among the porphyry rocks six miles to the south of Paisley; in the neighbourhood of Dunbarton; and in the rocks round Edinburgh.\n\n45. Species. ZEOLITE.\n\nThis species has been divided into four subspecies.\n\nSubspecies 1. MEALY ZEOLITE.\n\nZeolite, Kirwan, i. 278. La Zeolite Farineuse, Brochant, i. 298. Mefotype, Hauy, iii. 151.\n\nExter. Char.—This variety is found massive or disseminated, and sometimes it is branched or coralloid, and sometimes also it envelopes other zeolites with a thin crust. It is dull; fracture earthy; fragments blunt-edged.\n\nColour usually reddish or yellowish white, or flesh red, opaque, very brittle; does not adhere to the tongue. When scratched with the finger nail it gives out a dull sound.\n\nConstituent Parts.

It is frequent in different parts of Scotland, as at Dunbar, and several of the Western islands.\n\nSubspecies 2. FIBROUS ZEOLITE.\n\nZeolithe Fibreuse, Brochant, i. 299. Mefotype, Hauy, i. 151.\n\nExter. Char.—This variety is found massive, and sometimes in rounded pieces, composed of capillary crystals, divergent and radiating; internal lustre glimmering, or weakly shining, pearly or silky; fracture fibrous; fibres divergent; fragments wedge-shaped.\n\nColour yellowish white, yellowish brown, snow white, and sometimes honey yellow, translucent; semiflattened, brittle, and easily frangible.

RADIATED ZEOLITE.\n\nZeolithe Rayonnée, Brochant, i. 301. Mefotype, Hauy, iii. 151.\n\nExter. Char.—Divisible parallel to the faces of a rectangular prism; electric by heat in two opposite points.\n\nExter. Char.—This variety is found massive, but most frequently crystallized: the primitive form is a rectangular prism with square bases; its common forms are a rectangular prism, truncated at each extremity by a four-sided pyramid, corresponding to the lateral faces; a four-sided rectangular prism with two broad and two narrow sides, and also terminated by four-sided pyramids, or a four-sided prism, nearly rhomboidal, the two sharp lateral edges of which, as well as the two obtuse terminal angles, are truncated. The crystals are united together in bundles; so that the acuminations only can be seen; the crystals are commonly smooth and shining; the internal lustre is weakly shining and pearly; fracture radiated; the rays broad or narrow; fragments wedge-shaped.\n\nColour yellowish, grayish, reddish, and snow-white; translucent, sometimes transparent; semiflattened; scratches calcareous spar; brittle, and easily frangible. Spec. grav. 2.0833.\n\nChem. Char.—Before the blow-pipe it froths up, gives out a phosphorescent light, and is converted into a porous enamel. With acids it forms a gelatinous substance.\n\nConstituent Parts. Vauquelin.\n\n| Constituent Parts | Silica | Alumina | Lime | Water | Lofs |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|------|-------|-----|\n|                   | 50.24 | 29.30   | 9.46 | 10    | 1   |\n\n100.00\n\nSubspecies 4. FOLIATED ZEOLITE.\n\nZeolithe Lamelleuse, Brochant, i. 302. Stilbite, Hauy, iii. 161.\n\nExter. Char.—Fusible into a spongy enamel, but not electric by heat.\n\nExter. Char.—This variety of zeolite is usually found in amygdaloidal or globular pieces, and also crystallized; primitive form of its crystals is a rectangular prism with rectangular bases; the usual forms of its crystals are,\nare, a short equiangular six-sided prism with two broad, two narrower, and two very narrow faces; a table with six equal faces, and a rhomboidal prism. Surface of the crystals smooth and shining; internal lustre shining and pearly; fracture foliated; the plates most frequently curved with a simple cleavage.\n\nColour similar to the former; it is translucent or semitransparent; semi-hard, and easily frangible. Spec. grav. 2.5.\n\nChem. Char.—Froths up and phosphoresces, under the blow-pipe; placed on hot coals, it becomes white and is easily reduced to powder. It is not converted into a jelly by acids.\n\n**Constituent Parts.** Vauquelin.\n\n| Silica | 52 |\n|--------|----|\n| Alumina| 17.5 |\n| Lime   | 9 |\n| Water  | 18.5 |\n| Loes   | 3 |\n\nLocalities, &c.—The different varieties of zeolite are usually found in amygdaloid rocks, basalts, porphyry, flate, wacken, and green stone. They often line the sides of fissures passing through these rocks, and are accompanied with calcareous spar, calcedony, sometimes with native copper and native silver, as in Iceland. The finest zeolites are brought from the islands of Faroe, Iceland, Ædelfors in Sweden. The different varieties are not unfrequent in Scotland. The fibrous and radiated kinds are met with extremely beautiful in the islands of Cannay and Skye; the foliated or stilbite in the island of Staffa, in Skye, and in the lead veins at Strontian.\n\n46. Species. CUBIZITE.\n\nLa Zeolithe Cubique, Brochant, i. 304. Analcime, Chabasite, Hauy, iii. 180.\n\nEffon. Char.—Original forms of the cube, fusible into a glass.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found massive or crystallized; the form of the crystals is a perfect cube, which is its primitive form. This is sometimes truncated on all its angles by three small triangular faces, or with twenty-four equal and similar trapezoids like the garnet. The external lustre is resplendent, vitreous, or pearly. Internal shining or weakly shining. Fracture imperfectly foliated, almost uneven. Fragments imperfect cubes.\n\nColour white, yellowish, grayish, or reddish white. It is translucent or opaque. Semi-hard. Spec. grav. about 2 (Hauy). Difficult to produce any signs of electricity; hence the name analcime, signifying want of power, given to it by Hauy.\n\nChem. Char.—Froths up before the blow-pipe, and melts into a porous glass.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Cubizite is found in Skye, in Staffa, and in the Salisbury rocks near Edinburgh. Fine specimens of cubizite are abundant at the Giants causeway in the north of Ireland. Chabasite is found also at Oberstein in Germany.\n\nBy many mineralogists chabasite and analcime are considered as one species; but more nearly investigated, as has been done by Hauy and others, they must appear very different. The preceding description refers chiefly to analcime. We shall shortly state the principal characters of chabasite from Hauy, iii. 176.\n\nEffon. Char.—Divisible into a rhomboid slightly obtuse, and easily fusible by heat.\n\nExter. Char.—Chabasite is commonly crystallized. Primitive form of the crystals is a slightly obtuse rhomboid, whose plane angle at the summit is about 93°, so that it approaches nearly to the cube; integrant molecule the same. Six of the edges are truncated, the truncations uniting three and three at the two opposite angles, and the remaining six angles are also truncated. It appears also in the form of double six-sided pyramids applied base to base, having the six angles at the base, and the three acute edges of each pyramid truncated.\n\nColour whitish, sometimes reddish, but this seems to be owing to a superficial crust. Lustre thinning or resplendent and vitreous. Transparent or translucent.\n\nChem. Char.—Is easily fusible before the blow-pipe, and melts into a whitish spongy mass.\n\n47. Species. CROSS STONE.\n\nStaurolite, Kirwan, i. 282. Pierre Cruciforme, Brochant i. 311. Harmotome, Hauy iii. 191.\n\nEffon. Char.—Divisible into a rectangular octahedron, which may be subdivided on the angles contiguous to the summits.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is always crystallized. Its usual forms are, a double crystal composed of two broad prisms, with four rectangular faces, and terminated at each extremity by a four-sided obtuse pyramid placed on the lateral edges. These two prisms cross each other by their broader faces, so that the faces of the acumination meet together, and the double crystal thus formed having four right-angled re-entering angles, resembles a cross. The crystals are obliquely streaked. External lustre shining and resplendent, vitreous. Internal weakly shining. Fracture foliated.\n\nColour grayish or milky white, translucent, sometimes semi-transparent. Semi-hard, scratches glass slightly. Spec. grav. 2.333 to 3.61.\n\nChem. Char.—Before the blow-pipe it is fusible, and froths up. The powder thrown on hot coals is phosphorescent, giving out a greenish yellow light.\n\n**Constituent Parts.**\n\n| Silica | Klaproth. | Taflaert. |\n|--------|----------|----------|\n| Barytes| 18       | 16       |\n| Alumina| 16       | 19.5     |\n| Water  | 15       | 13.5     |\n| Loes   | 2        | 3.5      |\n\nLocalities. This mineral has been found in veins at Andreasberg in the Hartz, accompanied by carbonate of lime, from which it is sometimes called andreolite. It is also found in the lead veins at Strontian in Scotland, and in balls of agate at Oberstein. In the latter place, crystals are single.\n\n48. Species.\n48. Species. LAUMONITE.\n\nZeolithe Efflorescente, Hauy, iv. 410. Id. Brochant, ii. 539.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found in masses which are composed of irregular groups of crystals crossing each other in all directions. Form of the crystals is a four-sided prism, nearly rectangular, and terminated by a base inclined to one of the lateral edges under an angle of 133°; frequently the acute angle is truncated, and thus terminating in a bevelment placed on the acute lateral edges. The lateral faces are longitudinally streaked, and the lustre is shining. The faces of the summit are also thinning, but smooth. Fracture foliated, and parallel to the lateral faces.\n\nColour grayish white, somewhat pearly. Is translucent, rather soft; flexible, and easily frangible.\n\nBut all these characters are considerably different by the action of the air. The whole mass is gradually separated, and the crystals become opaque, falling into friable folia, which are in a short time reduced to a snow-white powder, from which it derives the name given to it by Hauy.\n\nChem. Char.—Fusible before the blow-pipe, without frothing up, into a white enamel, and forms a jelly with acids.\n\nLocalities.—This mineral was found in 1788 by Gillet Laumont, in the lead mines of Huelgoët in Brittany in France, and from him it derives its name. It forms a small vein contiguous to the vein of galena. We have collected specimens of a mineral, whose characters in general correspond with laumonite, in a vein traversing a basaltic rock in the island of Skye. It seems, however, to be less liable to disintegration by exposure to the air.\n\n49. Species. DIPYRE.\n\nId. Brochant, ii. 508. Id. Hauy, iii. 242.\n\nEfflen. Char.—Divisible parallel to the faces of a regular 6-sided prism. Fusible with intumescence.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found in small fascicular masses or crystals. Lustre shining, vitreous. Longitudinal fracture foliated.\n\nColour grayish or reddish white, and sometimes pale rose red. Semi-hard; scratches glass, and is easily frangible. Spec. grav. 2.630.\n\nChem. Char.—Fusible.

External surface somewhat rough; internal lustre glimmering; fracture fibrous and radiated.\n\nColour brownish yellow, inclining to olive, and different colours appear in parallel and waved zones; is transparent at the edges; scarcely scratches glass; is easily frangible. Sp. grav. 2.16.\n\nChem. Char.—Is reduced by the blow-pipe to a white glass. Nitric acid produces no effervescence, but converts it in a few hours to a thick jelly.\n\nConstituent Parts.

The name is derived from natron or soda, of which it contains so large a proportion.\n\n51. Species. AZURITE.\n\nLazulite, Klaproth, Analyt. Essays, i. 170. Le Lazulithe, Broch. i. 315.\n\nExter Char.—This mineral has been found disseminated, massive, and crystallized in rectangular four-sided prisms. Lustre glimmering and shining. Fracture imperfectly conchoidal.\n\nColour indigo, Prussian, or deep smalt blue; streak lighter blue; nearly opaque, or transparent at the edges; hardness, nearly that of quartz. Brittle and easily frangible.\n\nChem. Char.—Insoluble before the blow-pipe, but loses its colour, becomes earthy, and of a clear gray. With borax it produces a bright yellow glass. Acids have a very feeble action upon it. Klaproth ascertained that it is composed of silica, alumina, and oxide of iron; but the quantity which he operated on was too small to ascertain the proportions.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This mineral has been found at Vorau in Styria, in a rock of micaceous schistus, where it forms, along with grayish quartz and silvery white mica, a vein of about half an inch thick.\n\n52. Species. LAZULITE.\n\nLapis Lazuli, Kirw. i. 283. La Pierre d'Azur, Broch. i. 313. Lazulithe, Hauy, iii. 145.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found massive, disseminated, and in rounded fragments; internally dull, and rarely glimmering. Fracture earthy, or fine-grained uneven; fragments sharp-edged.\nColour azure blue; opaque, or translucent on the edges; hard, or semifluid; brittle and easily frangible.\n\nSpec. grav. 2.76 to 2.94.\n\nChem. Char.—It retains its colour at the temperature of 100° Wedgwood; but with a stronger heat froths up into a yellowish hard coloured mass. By increasing the heat, it changes to a white enamel; with acids after calcination, forms a jelly.\n\nConstituent Parts.\n\n| Silica | Alumina |\n|-------|---------|\n| 46    | 14.5    |\n\nCarbonate of lime 28\n\nSulphate of lime 6.5\n\nOxide of iron 3\n\nWater 2\n\n100.0\n\nLocalities, &c.—This mineral is found in Persia, Natolia, and China, and it is supposed that its repository is among granite. It has been found also in Siberia, near the lake Baikal, where it forms a vein along with garnets, feldspar, and pyrites. It is frequently mixed with pyrites, and a grayish white feldspar.\n\nUses.—This stone, when it is of a fine blue colour, and free from white spots, is held in great estimation for various ornamental purposes; but it derives its greatest value from its use in painting. The colour which it furnishes is called ultramarine. To prepare it, the stone is first calcined, and then reduced to an impalpable powder, which is mixed with a paste composed of resinous matters, of wax and linseed oil. From this mixture a powder is obtained by washing, which being dried affords the colouring matter. This colour, when used in painting, is not susceptible of change.\n\n53. Species. HYDRARGILLITE.\n\nWavelite of Dr Babington and others.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found crystallized. The crystals are very minute, and are attached to quartz, in tufts or bundles, which diverge from a common centre. It is also found closely compacted together, in the form of mammillary protuberances of the size of small peas, and adhering to each other. The crystals, when magnified, appear to be four-sided, and, when broken, the section seems to be rhomboidal. The crystals have sometimes the appearance of fine down, and sometimes are of the size of a hair. Lustre silky.\n\nThe colour is white, with a shade of gray or green; usually opaque, and sometimes semitransparent. The texture is loose; but the small fragments are so hard as to scratch agate. Spec. grav. 2.25 to 2.70.\n\nChem. Char.—Infusible before the blow-pipe; but the crystals, exposed suddenly to strong heat, decrepitate.\n\nConstituent Parts.\n\n| Davy, Nich.

Spec. grav. 3.165.\n\nChem. Char.—Infusible before the blow-pipe.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This mineral was first discovered by Bournon in the granitic rocks of Forez, where it occupies a vein of common feldspar. It has been found also in Spain, where it enters into the composition of a granite, and frequently contains scales of mica. When first discovered, it was supposed to be a variety of adamantine spar or corundum; but its inferior spec. grav. and the difference in the structure of its crystals, afford sufficient characteristic differences.\n\n55.

It has been since found in Bohemia, and near the lake Baikal in Siberia. It is rarely found in its native repository, but it is supposed to belong to primitive rocks; for it is accompanied with schorl, mica, and hornblende.\n\nUse.—The brilliancy of its colours, and particularly its chatoyant property, have brought it into use in jewelry.\n\nSubspecies 3.

It does not exist, however, in large masses. It forms one of the component parts of granite, gneis, syenite, and porphyry.\n\nWhen exposed to the action of the air, it is very liable to decomposition, and then it is converted into a white earthy mass, which is employed in the manufacture of porcelain. This is the kaolin of the Chinese.\n\nSubspecies 4. Compact Feldspar.\n\nContinuous Feldspar, Kirw. i. 323. Le Feldspath Compaete, Broch. i. 367.

A black substance surrounded by another of a whitish colour.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral has been found only crystallized in four-sided, nearly rectangular prisms. The summit is always broken, by which the arrangement of the two substances is observed. The white part is the outermost; the black matter forms in the centre a small prism, whose sides correspond with those of the outer crystal. From the angles of the central prism proceed four narrow lines, which extend to each of the angles of the outer prism; and sometimes this black substance forms at the extremity of these lines, or in the angles of the large prism, a similar small prism of black matter. The black matter is an argillaceous schistus, similar to the repository of the crystals. The white part is sometimes weakly shining; internal lustre glimmering, resinous. The black part is nearly dull. Fracture foliated; the black part earthy.\n\nThe colour of the white part, yellowish, or grayish white; that of the black part, grayish, or bluish black. Opaque, or translucent. Semihard, scratches glass when foliated. Streak white. Brittle; not very flammable. Spec. grav. 2.944. Communicates to sealing wax, negative electricity by friction.\n\nChem.

Char.—A fragment of this stone heated for a little in the flame of a candle decrepitates and disperses in all directions; from this property it obtained its name, which signifies to disperse. Heated in a closo crucible to prevent the fragments from flying off, they were reduced to white shining particles, somewhat resembling boracic acid.\n\nConstituent parts.

It abounds in China and Japan, where it is known by the name of kaolin; in Bohemia, Saxony, Denmark, and particularly in many places of France, as at Limoges and Bayonne, and in Cornwall in England. In many cases it seems to be owing to the decomposition of granite.\n\nUse.—Porcelain earth, as its name imports, is employed either as it is found native, or mixed in certain proportions with other earths, in the manufacture of porcelain.

Kirwan examined a potters clay, in which he found 63 parts of silica.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Potters clay is found in great abundance in most countries, and in similar situations with the former. It often forms thick beds in alluvial land, alternating with beds of sand.\n\nSubspecies 4. Variegated Clay.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found massive. Has\nan earthy fracture, a shining streak, and is soft or friable.\n\nThe colour is white, red, or yellow, and these different colours are sometimes in stripes, veins and spots. Adheres a little to the tongue, and feels somewhat greasy. It is feebly light.\n\nAs this variety of clay forms with water a less tenacious mass than some of the other varieties, it probably contains a greater proportion of siliceous earth.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This mineral is found in Upper Lusatia.\n\nSubspecies 5. SLATY CLAY.\n\nSlate Clay, Shale, Kirwan, i. 182. L'Argile Schifflée, Brochant, i. 327. Argile Schifflée Impressionée, Hauy iv. 448.\n\nExter. Char.—This subspecies is found massive; internally dull, when free from mica; fracture flatly or earthy; fragments in tables.\n\nColour greyish, yellowish, or blackish, sometimes reddish or brownish; opaque; soft, feebly, and easily frangible. Adheres to the tongue; feels meagre. Spec. grav. 2.6 to 2.68.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Usually accompanies coal, so that it abounds in all coal countries. It is sometimes mixed with sand, mica, and iron pyrites. It is known in this country under the name of shale, and in Scotland particularly by that of till, or described under the more general denomination of one of the coal metals. Slaty clay is still further distinguished by impressions of ferns, reeds, or grasses. When it is of a black colour, it seems to be owing to a greater proportion of coaly matter.\n\n4. Species. CLAY STONE, or INDURATED CLAY.\n\nIndurated Clay, Kirwan, i. 181. L'Argile Endurcie, Brochant, i. 325.\n\nExter. Char.—Indurated clay is always found massive; it is dull; fracture compact, or fine earthy; but sometimes splintery or even, and also sometimes flatly. Fragments more or less sharp edged, and sometimes in tables.\n\nColour usually bluish, yellowish, or greenish grey, and sometimes pearl grey, greyish red, whitish, and brownish. These colours are often mixed, and are arranged in spots and stripes. Opaque, soft, rather brittle; easily frangible; adheres slightly to the tongue; feels greasy. Spec. grav. inconsiderable. Gradually falls to pieces in water, or crumbles into powder. Has but little ductility.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Indurated clay is very common. It is found in veins, and sometimes in very extensive beds. It constitutes the basis of many porphyries, especially in Saxony, where it is abundant. It is found in many parts of Scotland, as on the Pentland hills in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.\n\nStourbridge clay, according to Mr Kirwan, may be included under this variety. It is of a grey colour; does not adhere to the tongue; part is soon diffused in water, and another part falls into powder. Mr Kirwan found it to contain 12.5% of moisture, 12% of a coarse white sand, 30% of a fine brownish sand, and even the remaining or argillaceous part was not entirely freed from sand but by boiling in acids.\n\n5.

Char.—This mineral is found massive; is always internally dull; has a flatly or fine earthy fracture; fragments flatly or in tables.\n\nColour clear grey, whitish or reddish; opaque or slightly translucent at the edges; gives a shining streak; is feebly, soft, and very easily frangible; adheres strongly to the tongue; feels meagre. Specific gravity 2.08.\n\nChem. Char.—Immersed in water, adhesive slate absorbs it greedily, air bubbles being rapidly disengaged and with noise; but does not become tenacious. When reduced to powder and calcined, it loses about one-fifth of its weight. Exposed to strong heat, it is converted into a dark grey or yellowish and porous flake. (Brochant.)\n\nConstituent Parts.

Fracture flatly, but in some directions earthy. Fragments flatly or in tables.\n\nColour yellowish grey or white; and different colours appear disposed in stripes; is soft; adheres to the tongue; feels meagre, and is rather light.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This mineral has been found only, it is said, in Bohemia, near pseudo volcanoes, and it is supposed, that it is nothing more than indurated coal ashes. It approaches so near in the characters that are given of it to the following, that it might be included under the same species, or considered as a variety of it.\n\n7. Species. TRIFOLI.\n\nId. Kirw. ii. 202. Le Tripoli, Broch. i. 379. Quartz: Aluminifère Tripolien, Hauy, iv. 467.\n\nExter.

It melts with borax without frothing up. It does not form a paste with water.\n\n**Constituent Parts.**\n\n| Silica | 90 |\n|--------|----|\n| Alumina | 7 |\n| Oxide of iron | 3 |\n\n100\n\n**Localities, &c.**—This substance was formerly brought to Europe from Tripoli; hence the name; but it has since been found in many other places, as in Bavaria, Saxony, and Bohemia; in Russia and in England. It is found in the neighbourhood of basaltic strata, sometimes forming veins; at Potchappel it is disposed in beds among the strata of coal, and near those places where strata of coal have been on fire.\n\n**Uses.**—Tripoli is employed in polishing metals, precious stones, and glasses for optical instruments.\n\n8. Species. **Floatstone.**\n\n**Exter. Char.**—This mineral has been found in tuberculous porous masses; it is dull, has an earthy fracture, and blunt-edged fragments.\n\nThe colour is yellowish gray or grayish white. It is soft and brittle; rough to the feel, and gives out a creaking sound. It is very light, from which it has its name.\n\n**Localities, &c.**—Has been only found at St Omer near Paris.\n\n9. Species. **Alum Stone.**\n\n*La Pierre Alumineuse*, Broch. i. 381.\n\n**Exter. Char.**—This stone is found massive; is generally dull, rarely a little glimmering; fracture uneven, sometimes splintery; fragments not very sharp edged.\n\nColour grayish or yellowish white; it is soft, and sometimes ferruginous; stains a little, and adheres to the tongue.\n\n**Chem. Char.**—This mineral does not effervescence with acids; but after being heated and dissolved in water, it affords alum. According to Bergman it contains 43% of sulphur, 35% of alumina, and 22% of silica; but the following is the result of Vaquelin's analysis.\n\n**Constituent Parts.**\n\n| Alumina | 43.92 |\n|---------|-------|\n| Silica  | 24    |\n| Sulphurous acid | 25   |\n| Sulphate of potash | 3.08 |\n| Water   | 4     |\n\n100.00\n\n**Localities, &c.**—This mineral has been long known under the name of the stone of Tofa, from the name of the place where it is found near Rome, and where it forms a mountain which is traversed by veins of whitish gray quartz. It is from this stone that the Roman alum, so celebrated in commerce, is manufactured; and it has been supposed that the excellence of the alum may be owing to the mineral containing within itself all the ingredients necessary in the formation of that triple salt.\n\n10. Species. **Aluminous Schistus.**\n\nThis is divided into two varieties or subspecies; 1. common; and 2. shining.\n\n**Subspecies 1. Common Aluminous Schistus.**\n\n*Le Schiste Alumineux*, Broch. i. 386.\n\n**Exter. Char.**—This mineral is found in masses, which often contain pieces of a globular form. It is sometimes glimmering, and sometimes dull; fracture commonly flatly, and sometimes a little earthy; fragments in tables; streak the same as the colour of the mineral, a little thinning.\n\nColour grayish black or brownish; is soft; meagre to the feel, and easily frangible.\n\n**Chem. Char.**—When exposed to the air for some time it separates, and yields alum by lixiviation.\n\n**Localities, &c.**—Aluminous schistus is abundant in Saxony, Bohemia, France, England, and some parts of Scotland. It is disposed in beds among stratiform rocks, and in transition rocks, and it is often traversed by veins of quartz. Being mixed with pyrites, the decomposition is thus promoted when exposed to the air.\n\n**Uses.**—This mineral is dug out for the purpose of extracting alum, first by exposing it to the air or heat, and then by lixiviation.\n\n**Subspecies 2. Shining Aluminous Schistus.**\n\n*Le Schiste Alumineux Eclatant*, Broch. i. 388.\n\n**Exter. Char.**—This mineral approaches very nearly to the former in most of its characters, but in the direction of its principal fracture the external surface is smooth; lustre shining, or resplendent, refractive, and even somewhat metallic; in the opposite directions it is dull. Fracture commonly flatly, and somewhat curved; fragments in tables.\n\nColour intermediate between bluish and grayish black, and sometimes iron black. Colours in the rents iridescent.\n\nIn other characters and circumstances it resembles the former.\n\n11. Species. **Bituminous Schistus.**\n\n*Le Schiste Bitumineux*, Broch. i. 289. *Bituminous Shale*, Kirw. i. 183.\n\n**Exter. Char.**—This mineral is found massive; lustre glimmering; fracture most commonly thin, rarely thick; fragments in the form of tables, sometimes trapezoidal.\n\nColour brownish black, sometimes gray, or blackish brown; soft, and easily frangible; adheres slightly to the tongue; streak thinning; feels greasy.\n\n**Chem. Char.**—When placed on burning coals it gives out a pale flame with a sulphurous odour, becomes white, and loses a good deal of its weight.\n\n**Localities, &c.**—This mineral is peculiar to coal countries, which it always accompanies, and alternates with\nwith flaty clay and coal. It is not unfrequent in Bohemia, Poland, England, and Scotland.\n\n12. Species. DRAWING SLATE.\n\nBlack Chalk, Kirwan, i. 195. Le Schiste à Dessiner, Broch. i. 391. Argile Schifflse Graphique, Haüy, iv. 447.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found massive, usually dull; but in the direction of the principal fracture a little glimmering; fracture in certain directions curved flaty; in others fine grained earthy; fragments splintery or tabular.\n\nColour grayish or bluish black; opaque; stains black; soft; meagre to the feel.\n\nChem.

It forms along with it beds which are subordinate to clay slate. It is found in Italy, where it is an object of commerce. It is also found in Spain, France, and some parts of Scotland.\n\nUses.—As its name indicates, it is employed like black chalk in drawing.\n\n13. Species. WHET SLATE.\n\nNovaculite, Kirw. i. 238. Le Schiste à Aiguiser, Brochant, i. 393. Argile Schifflse Novaculaire, Haüy, iv. 448.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found massive; is scarcely glimmering; fracture in large masses flaty, in small pieces splintery; fragments tabular.\n\nColour commonly greenish gray, or smoke gray, sometimes mountain green; translucent at the edges; semihard, but varying between hard and soft; rather easily frangible; streak grayish white; feels greasy; does not adhere to the tongue. Specific gravity 2.722.\n\nChem. Char.—Does not effervesce with acids, and is infusible before the blow-pipe.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Whet slate is found in primitive mountains, where it forms beds which are subordinate to clay slate. It was originally brought from the Levant; but has since been discovered in Bohemia, Saxony, in Bayreuth, where it is wrought, and in Siberia. An efflorescence has been observed on the surface, which is found to be sulphate of magnesia; from which it is naturally supposed that the base of that salt forms one of its constituent parts.\n\nUses.—Whet slate, as its name imports, is cut and polished for the purpose of sharpening knives and other instruments; and, reduced to powder, is employed in polishing steel.\n\n14. Species. CLAY SLATE.\n\nArgillite, or Argillaceous Schifflse, or Slate, Kirwan, i. 234. Le Schiste Argilleux, Brochant, i. 395. Argile Schifflse Tegulaire, Haüy, iv. 447.\n\nExter. Char.—Clay slate is found massive, or disseminated, or in rounded pieces; internally it is a little shining or glimmering; rarely dull; the more the structure is foliated, the greater is its lustre. Lustre sometimes silky, pearly, or feminetallic. Fracture more or less flaty, sometimes curved and waved, sometimes earthy or splintery; fragments tabular, rarely splintery; sometimes cubic or rhomboidal.\n\nColour chiefly gray of various shades; but sometimes it is reddish, brownish, or yellowish, or reddish brown. Different colours are so disposed as to appear striped, waved, spotted, or dendritic. It is in general soft; sometimes semifirm, brittle, and easily frangible. Gives a grayish white streak; feels greasy. Spec. grav. 2.67 to 2.88.\n\nAccording to Kirwan, clay slate is composed of silica, alumina, lime, magnesia, and iron, with some bituminous particles.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Clay slate belongs equally to the primitive, transition, and stratiform rocks, and frequently forms entire mountains. Primitive clay slate is sometimes mixed with quartz, mica, hornblende, garnets, limestone, pyrites, cinnabar as at Idria; in general it abounds with metallic ores, either in veins or in beds.\n\nClay slate is very abundant in most countries; it is not unfrequent in many parts of Scotland; but the slate of Ealdale, and the contiguous islands on the west coast, has long maintained a decided superiority and preference to all others in this country.\n\nUses.—Clay slate is in extensive use for covering houses, and then it is known in this country by the single word slate. It is also employed in large plates for writing on, or tracing characters that are afterwards to be effaced.\n\n15. Species. LEPIDOLITE.\n\nId. Kirwan, i. 208. Id. Haüy, iv. 375. La Lepidolithe, Brochant, i. 399.\n\nExter. Char.—Lepidolite is found massive, and disseminated in small plates, which might be taken for mica. It is usually glimmering, rarely shining. Lustre feminetallic. Fracture fine grained uneven, rarely foliated. Fragments blunt edged.\n\nColour lilac blue, grayish and reddish brown; translucent. Semihard; sometimes soft; easily frangible; and feels meagre. Is easily scraped with the knife; but is with difficulty reduced to powder by trituration. The powder rubbed between the fingers has a greatly feel. Spec. grav. 2.816 to 2.854.\n\nChem. Char.—Froths up under the blow-pipe, and melts into a transparent colourless globule; but with the addition of a little nitre it becomes violet.\n**Mineralogy**\n\n**Localities, &c.—** Mica is one of the most common minerals, forming one of the constituent parts of granite, gneiss, micaceous schistus, and other primitive rocks, and in some of them sometimes forms particular small veins. Mica also enters into the composition of stratiform rocks, as green stone, basalt, wacken.\n\nCat gold and cat silver are varieties of mica of a gold or silver colour, which have a considerable lustre, but inferior to that of these metals. It may be easily distinguished by the streak, which in the mica affords a whitish powder without any lustre.\n\n**Uses—** When mica is obtained in large and thin plates, it is employed as a substitute for glass, and for this purpose it has been used for windows of men of war, as on account of its elasticity it is less subject to be broken from the concussion produced by the firing of cannon.\n\n**17. Species. Pinite.**\n\n*Micarelle*, Kirw. i. 212. *La Pinite*, Broch. i. 456.\n\n**Exter. Char.—** This mineral has been usually found crystallized in six-sided prisms, having all the lateral edges truncated, or only three alternating edges, or in four-sided rhomboidal prisms. The surfaces of the crystals smooth and a little glimmering; internally it is dull, sometimes a little shining in the cross fracture; the fracture is fine grained, uneven, or small conchoidal; fragments blunt-edged.\n\nColour reddish or blackish brown; opaque; the brown variety is slightly transparent; so soft as to be cut with a knife, when it becomes of a bluish black; powder bright gray; adheres a little to the tongue; feels greasy; sp. grav. 2.98.\n\n**Constituent Parts.** Klaproth.\n\n| Alumina | 63.75 |\n|---------|-------|\n| Silica  | 29.50 |\n| Oxide of iron | 6.75 |\n\n**Localities, &c.—** Pinite is found only near Schneeberg in Saxony, in the mine called *Pini*; hence its name.

It is found also in Sweden. Sometimes it is disseminated in quartz rock.\n\nThe name, from *σκείς*, \"a scale,\" is derived from its scaly structure. Lepidolite was at first taken for fluoate of lime or zeolite. A red coloured variety of schorlite was also supposed to be crystallized lepidolite.\n\n**16. Species. Mica.**\n\n*Id. Kirw. i. 21.* *Id. Broch. i. 402.* *Id. Hauy, iii. 208.*\n\n**Exter. Char.—** Mica is most commonly disseminated in thin tables, rarely massive or crystallized. The primitive form of its crystals is a rectangular prism, whose bases are rhombs with angles of 120° and 60°; the integrant molecule is the same. The usual forms of its crystals are, a six-sided table with equal angles, sometimes very thick, which produces a six-sided prism, and the want of two of the faces produces the table with four rhomboidal faces; but the most common form of mica is in thin plates or scales of no determinate figure. The lateral faces of the bases of the tables are smooth and resplendent; lustre metallic; fracture foliated, sometimes curved or waved, and sometimes radiated; fragments in the form of plates.\n\nColour usually gray, ash, yellowish, greenish, and blackish gray; in thin plates semitransparent, or even transparent; otherwise, only translucent on the edges; semifluid, very easily flangible; flexible and elastic. Sp. grav. 2.79 to 2.93.\n\n**Physic. Char.—** Mica rubbed on Spanish wax communicates to it negative electricity.\n\n**Chem.

It is also met with in wacken, and in the lava of Vesuvius. It is not uncommon in the basaltic rocks of Silelia, Saxony, and Bohemia, as well as in those of this country. As it is less liable to decomposition than the rocks which contain it, detached crystals are frequently found among decayed basalt.\n\nSubspecies 2. Basaltic Hornblende.\n\nBasaltine, Kirw. i. 219. Hornblende Basaltique, Roch. i. 424.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is most frequently found crystallized in equal six-sided prisms, variously modified or with equal sides; having two narrow and four broad; or four narrow and two broad; or three broad and three narrow alternately. The crystals are imbedded, insulated, or grouped. Surface smooth, shining; internal lustre resplendent, in the cross fracture weakly shining, vitreous; fracture foliated; cross fracture small grained, uneven, or conchohedral. Fragments nearly rhombohedral.\n\nColour velvet black, and sometimes with a shade of green; opaque; streak grayish white; semihard; earthy smell by expiration. Spec. grav. 3.22 to 3.33.\n\nChem.

It is found also in masses or entire beds, as in Saxony; and is very common in most countries, as in Norway, Hungary, and Britain.\n\nUses.—Sometimes employed as a flux for ores of iron.\n\nSubspecies 3. Labradore Hornblende.\n\nLa Hornblende du Labrador, Broch. i. 419.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found massive, disseminated, in rounded pieces, and very rarely crystallized in four-sided rectangular prisms. Internal lustre shining, somewhat metallic; fracture foliated, sometimes curved.\n\nColour blackish green, or greenish black; sometimes bronze yellow; scarcely translucent at the edges; semihard; not difficultly frangible; streak greenish. Spec. grav. 3.38.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This mineral is found in the island of St Paul on the Labrador coast, but nothing is known of the nature of its repository.\n\nSubspecies 4.

Char.—This variety is found massive; internal lustre weakly shining; fracture in masses flat; in small pieces radiated, sometimes fibrous; fragments in plates.\n\nColour greenish, or grayish black; opaque; semihard; streak greenish gray; rather difficultly frangible; breathed on, gives the earthy smell.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Schistose hornblende forms extensive beds in primitive mountains, to which it is subordinate. It seems to be common hornblende more or less mixed with quartz. It is found in Bohemia, Norway, Sweden, in the isle of Skye, and other places of Scotland.\n\n21. Species. Basalt.\n\nFigurate Trap, Trap, Whinstone, &c., Kirw. i. 225.—233. Le Bafalie, Broch. i. 430. La Litheide Prismaticque, Hauy, iv. 474.\nExter. Char.—Basalt forms entire mountains, in the neighbourhood of which it is found in rounded pieces, or in large globular masses; internally it is dull; sometimes glimmering from a mixture of hornblende; fracture uneven, sometimes fine splintery or conchoidal; fragments not very sharp-edged. It is most frequently in distinct concretions, which are prismatic or columnar, more or less regular; sometimes also in globular distinct concretions.\n\nColour grayish or bluish black, sometimes brownish on the surface; opaque; semihard; brittle, and very difficultly frangible; streak light ash gray; gives a ringing sound under the hammer. Spec. grav. 2.86 to 3.\n\nChem. Char.—Melts very easily before the blowpipe into an opaque black glass which acts on the magnet.\n\nPhysical Char.—Many basalts affect the magnetic needle, reverting the poles when it is brought near them. This is ascribed to the great proportion of iron which enters into their composition.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Basalt is not uncommon in every part of the globe, and in many places it is very abundant. It is found in regular columns in several of the Hebrides on the west coast of Scotland, as in Cannay, Eigg, the Schant Isles, but particularly beautiful in Staffordia. Pretty regular columns are observed also at Dunbar, and on the south-west side of Arthur's seat near Edinburgh; but the Giant's Causeway and the rocks about Fairhead on the north coast of Ireland, exhibit the finest and most extensive ranges of columnar basalt in the world.\n\nBasalt, besides being in the columnar form, is often disposed in beds and veins; both of which are very common in different places in Scotland, particularly on the western coast, and in the western islands. See Wilson's Mineral Kingdom.\n\nNo subject, in geological speculation, has produced more controversial discussion than the origin of basalt; one party asserting that it is the effect of fusion, while another contends that it must have been deposited from an aqueous solution. Our limits preclude us even from barely stating the arguments which have been proposed by naturalists in support of the theories which different parties have embraced. For an account of some of them, see Geology Index; and for the constituent parts of basalt, and some other facts connected with its natural history, see Basalt.\n\nUses.—Basalt is sometimes employed as a touchstone, as a flux for ores of iron, and in the manufacture of common bottles. It is also employed for millstones. The ancients employed it in sculpture, for it would appear that some of their vases and statues were formed of it.\n\n22. Species. Wacken.\n\nId. Kirw. i. 223.

Spec. Argillaceous genus. grav. 2.53 to 2.89.\n\nChem. Char.—Fusible like basalt.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Wacken belongs to the stratiform rocks. It contains sometimes petrified wood, and the bones of animals. It constitutes beds sometimes in the middle of basalt, but is often in the form of veins, and is the basis of amygdaloid, the cavities of which are filled with green earth, calcareous spar, &c. Wacken is met with in Saxony, Bohemia, Sweden, and many places of Scotland.\n\n23. Species. Phonolite, or Clinkstone.\n\nId. Daubuisson, Jour. de Phil. ix. 74. La Pierre Sonnante, Broch. i. 437.

The other by Klaproth, is from Bohemia. Excepting the small proportion of manganese detected in the latter, the coincidence of the two analyses is very striking.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Phonolite is not uncommon in many parts of the world. It is met with in Scotland, in the island of Lamlash near Arran; and it constitutes the greater part of Trapreene Law in East Lothian; in both places it is columnar.\n\n24. Species. Lava.\n\nId.

Char.—Infusible before the blow-pipe; falls to pieces in water without forming a paste. According to some analyses, it contains a large proportion of magnesia.\n\nPhysical Char.—Some varieties when rubbed with a feather in the dark, give a little light.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Lithomarga or stone marrow, derives its name from its being found in nodules in amygdaloid rocks; it occupies veins or small fissures in porphyry, gneis, and serpentine. It is found in Bohemia, Saxony, France, England, and at the Giant's causeway in Ireland. A variety of lithomarga, which exhibits many fine colours, particularly violet or lavender blue, is found in beds reposing on coal at Planitz, near Zwickau in Saxony.

It was originally brought from the Levant, East Indies, and China. It is found also in the Alps, in Switzerland, and in Piedmont. The water-worn pebbles which are collected on the banks of the lake of Geneva, often contain this mineral. It is found also in a similar form at a particular place on the shores of Iona, one of the Hebrides, in Scotland.\n\nUses.—Oriental nephrite, long known under the name of jade, is held in considerable estimation on account of its hardness and tenacity. It is employed by the Turks for the handles of knives and sabres, and frequently by others for various ornamental purposes.\n\nThe property of curing diseases of the kidneys is ascribed to this mineral by ancient authors, and hence the name nephritic stone, or nephrite.\n\nSubspecies 2.

Char.—This also is found massive or disseminated; internal lustre glimmering, rarely weakly shining, resinous; fracture conchoidal, even or splintery; fragments sharp edged.\n\nColour dark leek green of various shades; translucent; semi-hard; easily frangible; feels slightly greasy.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This subspecies is found in similar places with the preceding. It is distinguished from it by being always connected with limestone. The stones known in Italy by the name of verde di Prato, verde Antico, verde di Suza, which are very often accompanied by limestone, may be included under precious serpentine.\n\n9. Species.

It is found in Saxony, Bohemia, Italy, Spain, France, Sweden, and in the western parts of Scotland; but the finest specimens of amianthus are brought from the island of Corsica.\n\nUses.—On account of the flexibility of this substance it is spun into threads; for this purpose it is mixed with lint, to render the threads less brittle in working them into cloth, which is afterwards passed through the fire that the vegetable matter may be consumed, and the amianthus, which is infusible, remains; and thus an incombusible cloth is obtained. The ancients manufactured this cloth for the purpose of wrapping round their dead bodies, that their ashes might be preserved unmixed with the wood employed in burning them.\n\nSubspecies 3.

Char.—Found only massive; lustre shining, or strongly glimmering; between pearly and vitreous; fracture straight foliated; fragments rather blunt-edged; in granular, distinct concretions, small or fine grained.\n\nColour usually snow white, grayish, yellowish, greenish, and rarely reddish white, and sometimes it is spotted, veined, or striped; usually translucent; semihard; feels meagre; brittle, and easily frangible. Spec. grav. 2.7 to 2.8.\n\nChem.\nChern. Char.—Effervesces with acids, and is almost entirely dissolved. Some varieties, however, from an admixture of other substances, are very slowly acted on by acids.\n\nLocality, &c.—Granularly foliated limestone belongs almost exclusively to the primitive and transition mountains, resting on gneis, micaceous schistus, and clay slate, containing, beside other mineral substances, various metallic ores.\n\nIt is found in Italy, Saxony, Bohemia, Sweden, Norway, France, and Britain.\n\nUses.—This variety of limestone is applied to the same purposes as the former.\n\nOf Marbles.—In the language of the architect and statuary, all stones come under the name of marble which are harder than gypsum, are found in large masses, and are susceptible of a good polish.\n\nOn this principle many varieties of limestone, granite also and porphyry, serpentine, and even fine-grained basalts, are denominated marbles. But the word among mineralogists is taken in a more restricted sense, and confined to such varieties of dolomite, limestone, and compact and granularly foliated limestone, as are capable of receiving a good polish. The most valuable of the calcareous marbles, for hardness, durability and colour, are brought from Italy, the Greek islands, and from Syria. When the ancient Romans were at the height of their civilized luxury, they obtained some varieties of marble from Numidia and other countries, which were very much esteemed.\n\nThe sculptors of ancient Greece and modern Europe have always held the white granularly foliated limestone in the highest estimation, both on account of its pure colour, delicate translucence, and granular texture, which make it much easier to work than compact limestone. The species called dolomite is softer, and of a finer grain, so that it is even more manageable under the chisel, and therefore many of the smaller works of the Greek sculptors are of this stone; but Paros and Carrara furnish Europe with the greatest quantity of statuary marble. The Parian marble, which consists almost entirely of carbonate of lime, is the purest, softest, and has some degree of transparency; that of Carrara is often mixed with granular quartz in considerable proportion. The following are the architectural marbles which are held in greatest estimation:\n\n1. The marble called bardiglio, from Carrara, is of a deep blue colour, and seems to be the same with the white statuary marble of that place, with the addition of some colouring matter.\n\n2. That variety of marble called cipolin, is statuary marble traversed by veins of mica.\n\n3. Lunachella marble. This is a compact limestone of a brownish gray colour, containing shells which often retain the original pearly lustre. To this variety belongs the fine marble of Bleyberg in Carinthia, in which the imbedded shells are beautifully iridescent.\n\n4. Florentine marble. This is a grayish, compact, argillaceous limestone, exhibiting designs of a yellowish brown colour, and resembling the ruins of houses; hence it is called ruin marble.\n\n5. The marbles of Syria, Sienna, and Arragon, are of a yellow colour, and are in considerable estimation.\n\n6. Breccia marble. This is a breccia limestone, composed of fragments of a yellowish red and purple colour, which are cemented by semitransparent, white calcareous spar.\n\n7. The marbles known by the names of verde antiche, verde di Corfica, are composed of limestone, calcareous spar, serpentine, and alabaster.\n\n8. The British islands afford many fine marbles, of which that of Tiree is the finest and most beautiful. It has often a delicate flesh coloured ground, spotted with green; but its colours, it is said, are apt to fade. Marbles have also been found in the island of Skye, and in the counties of Ross and Sutherland. For a particular account of these, see William's Mineral Kingdom. Marble is not uncommon in different parts of England; and in particular Devonshire and Derbyshire afford varieties which are held in considerable estimation on account of their beauty.\n\nElastic marble. Some varieties of granular limestone, when cut into thin plates, possess a certain degree of elasticity. The marble in which this property was observed, was in the Bargello palace at Rome. It was got from an ancient building. Dolomieu supposed that marble acquired this property by being deprived of moisture, and Fleuriau de Bellevue confirmed this opinion, by subjecting certain marbles to heat. He found also a natural elastic marble in Mount St Gotthard.\n\nB. CALCAREOUS SPAR.\n\nCommon Spar, Kirw. i. 86. Le Spathe Calcaire, Broch. i. 536. Chaux Carbonatée, Haug, ii. 127.\n\nEffem. Char.—Divisible into a rhomboid of $101^\\circ$ and $78^\\circ$; foliable with effervescence in nitric acid.\n\nExter. Char.—Calcareous spar is found massive, or disseminated in various forms, as globular, kidneyform, cellular, and stalactitical; but it is most frequently crystallized. The primitive form of its crystals is an obtuse rhomboid, whose angles are $101^\\circ$, $32^\\circ$, $13^\\circ$, and $78^\\circ$, $27^\\circ$, $47^\\circ$; integrant molecule the same. The variety of forms of calcareous spar is very great. Werner reduces them to three principal or prevailing forms, and from these he deduces the variations and modifications which take place. His principal forms are, 1. The fixed pyramid; 2. The fixed prism; and 3. The three-sided pyramid. But according to others following the same method, the principal forms are the five following: 1. The fixed pyramid; 2. The fixed prism; 3. The fixed table; 4. The fixed pyramid, and 5. The hexahedron, including the rhomboid and cube.\n\nA. Simple. Simple pyramids are the summits of other pyramids, or of prisms, and they are variously modified in being equal sided, acute, or obtuse, having the angles at the base truncated, or having an obtuse-three-sided summit slightly convex.\n\nB. Double; in which two pyramids are obliquely united, and variously modified, by having the angles at the base truncated, or the faces of the summit a little convex.\n\n2. The fixed prism, is also variously modified, by having at each extremity a fixed acute summit, or a second obtuse summit of three sides, placed alternately on three edges of the first.\n\n3. A fixed table, which is either perfect with equal or unequal sides, or rounded, or lenticular.\n\n4. The...\n4. The three-sided pyramid, which is either simple or double, and is also variously modified.\n\n5. The hexahedron, which includes the rhomboid, and this is either perfect, or has convex faces, or has six obtuse edges truncated; and the cube, which is somewhat rhomboidal. But for a full account of all the varieties and modifications in the crystallization of calcareous spar, the reader is referred to the treatises of Hauy and Brochant.\n\nThe crystals of calcareous spar exhibit also a similarity of arrangement. The simple six-sided pyramids are frequently disposed in a globular, fascicular, or stellate form. The fixed-sided pyramids are disposed in rows; the fixed-sided prisms are often disposed like steps of stairs, or are fascicular, or kidney-form; some acute three-sided pyramids of calcareous spar have been found hollow, and in some prisms the centre has been observed of another colour. The surface of the crystals commonly smooth; lustre shining or refulgent; internal lustre refulgent or shining, vitreous, and sometimes pearly; fracture foliated; cleavage threefold; fragments always rhomboidal.\n\nColour usually white, grayish, reddish, greenish, or yellowish white, rarely violet blue, or yellowish brown. Various degrees of transparency; when perfectly transparent, refraction is double. It was in this substance that the property of double refraction was first observed, and hence it was called double spar. This singular property engaged the attention and mathematical skill of Newton, Huygens, Buffon, and more lately the celebrated Hauy. Calcareous spar is semihard, brittle, and easily frangible. Sp. grav. about 2.7.\n\nChem. Char.—Soluble with effervescence in nitric acid, and reduced by calcination to quicklime.\n\n| Constituent Parts | Bergman. | Phillips. |\n|------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Lime             | 53       | 55.5      |\n| Carbonic acid    | 33       | 44        |\n| Water            | 11       | .5        |\n|                  | 100      | 100.0     |\n\nPhysical Char.—Some varieties of calcareous spar, and particularly those from Derbyshire, give out when heated, a phosphorescent light.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Calcareous spar is very common in all kinds of rocks, in veins and cavities, and particularly in mineral veins, accompanied with quartz, fluor spar, heavy spar, and metallic ore. The finest specimens of rhomboidal spar are brought from Iceland, Derbyshire, the Hartz, as well as Saxony, France, and Spain.\n\nThe crystallized sandstones of Fontainebleau are real rhomboidal crystals of calcareous spar, which, during the process of crystallization, have been penetrated with particles of sand.\n\nSubspecies 3. Fibrous Limestone.\n\nId. Kirw. i. 88. La Pierre Calcaire Fibreuse, ou la Stalactite Calcaire, Broch. i. 549. Chaux Carbonatée Concretionnée, Hauy, ii. 168.\n\nOf this subspecies two varieties have been formed, common fibrous, and calcareous sinter.\n\nA. Common Fibrous Limestone.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive; lustre weakly shining and pearly; fracture fibrous, sometimes coarse and delicate, straight or parallel, and sometimes radiated; fragments splintery.\n\nColour usually grayish, reddish, and yellowish white; generally translucent; rarely semitransparent.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This variety is found in veins; and some of it is susceptible of a fine polish, and was known to the ancients under the name of calcareous alabaster, to distinguish it from gypseous alabaster.\n\nSatinit spar, a beautiful mineral, which is also susceptible of a fine polish, and has a silky lustre, from which it derives its name, belongs to this variety. It was first discovered in Cumberland, and has since been found in other places in Britain.\n\nB. Calcareous Sinter.\n\nThis variety is usually found stalactitical or tuberose, and also sometimes kidney-shaped, botryoidal, tubular, and coralloidal. Surface usually rough, or druly, rarely smooth; internal lustre glimmering, sometimes weakly shining, silky, or pearly; fracture fibrous, which is either straight, scoriiform, or stellar; fragments wedge-shaped and splintery.\n\nColour snow white, grayish green, or yellowish white, and these are sometimes arranged in stripes or veins; translucence, sometimes only at the edges; rarely semitransparent; between semifluid and soft; brittle and easily frangible. Sp. grav. 2.728.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This mineral seems to be a deposition of calcareous particles, formed by the gradual infiltration of water into the cavities and fissures of limestone mountains. They are either deposited in layers on the floor, or suspended from the roof of those grottoes, and in this latter case they assume a great variety of imitative forms. It is found therefore, in the celebrated grottoes of Auxelles, Arcy, and Antiparos, and in the cavities of mineral veins at Leadhills.\n\nThe singular mineral substance, known by the name of floe ferri, belongs to this variety. This is found in the cavities of veins of spathofe iron ore, from which it has derived its name. It is of a branched or coralloidal form.\n\nSubspecies 4. Pisolite or Peatstone.\n\nOviform Limestone, var. Kirw. i. 91. La Pierre de Pois, Broch. i. 555. Chaux Carbonatée Globuliforme, Hauy, ii. 171.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found massive, and in the cavities in which it is formed, the surface is kidney-shaped; internally dull; fracture difficult to determine but appears even; fragments rather sharp-edged.\n\nColour white, snow white, grayish, reddish or yellowish white; opaque; rarely translucent at the edges; soft, and brittle.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Pisolite is found at Carlsbad in Bohemia, where it has been long known, and where an entire bed was discovered in digging the foundations for a church. Each of the grains of pilolite contains for a nucleus a particle of sand. These have been incrusted with the carbonate of lime held in solution by water.\nPart I.\n\nMINERALOGY.\n\nClassification.\n\nWater, and particularly by the warm springs of Carlsbad. New concentric layers being deposited, they at last fall to the bottom, and are there united into larger masses by new depositions of the same calcareous matter. Pisolites are also found in Hungary and in Silesia.\n\n4. Species. CALCIAREOUS TUFa.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral has usually the form of the substance on which the calcareous matter has been deposited, as that of moss—which is most common, grass or leaves; internally dull, or weakly glimmering; fracture uneven or earthy; fragments blunt-edged.\n\nColour yellowish gray of various shades; opaque, or translucent at the edges; soft, flexible, and easily frangible; light; almost swims on water.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This substance is found in all limestone countries, through the strata of which water passes, thus forming springs impregnated with carbonate of lime, which is afterwards deposited on plants or other substances. This mineral, therefore, is found in alluvial land, and the process of its formation is constantly going on.\n\n5. Species. FOAM EARTH.\n\nSilvery Chalk, Kirw. i. 78. L'Ecume de Terre, Broch. i. 557.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found massive, disseminated, or in scaly particles, which are somewhat friable; internal lustre shining or semimetallic; the foliated varieties have a curved foliated fracture; fragments blunt-edged.\n\nColour yellowish or greenish white, sometimes silvery white; opaque; stains; very soft or friable; feels a little greasy or silky.\n\nChem.

Species. ARRAGONITE.\n\nArragon Spar, Kirw. i. 87. L'Arragonite, Broch. i. 576. Id. Haüy, iv. 337.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is always found crystalized in six-sided equiangular prisms, or with two opposite faces broader, to which correspond the two faces of an acute bevelment, which terminates the prism. The edges of the bevelment are also truncated. The crystals are variously grouped, and commonly in the form of a cross; crystals streaked longitudinally; lustre shining or refulgent, vitreous; fracture foliated.\n\nColour grayish or greenish white; translucent and semitransparent; refraction double; hard; scratches calcareous spar; brittle, and easily frangible. Specific gravity 2.946.\n\nChem. Char.—Effervesces with acids, and is entirely dissolved. The constituent parts, according to numerous and accurate analyses, are the same as those of calcareous spar; but its superior hardness, diversity of form, and other external characters, have long puzzled chemical philosophers; and it still remains undetermined to what that diversity is owing in this mineral.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Arragonite was first found imbedded in foliated and fibrous gypsum, in the province of Arragon in Spain, from which it derives its name. It has been also found in France, the Pyrenees, in Salzburg, sometimes in an argillaceous schistus, and sometimes in quartz, accompanied by calcareous spar and pyrites.\n\n8. Species.

It is found abundantly on St Gotthard and other primitive mountains. Dolomieu's attention was first attracted to it by its superior hardness and slow effervescence in acids, and analysis shows that it is different from limestone in its composition.\n\n10. Species.

It is frequently mixed with different ores of copper, so that it is sometimes wrought as a copper ore. In this bituminous schistus, petrified fishes and marine plants are frequently found, disposed in regular order, from which some have conjectured that they must have died a violent death; or, according to others, that they have been poisoned by the copper with which it abounds.\n\n14.

Earthy Gypsum.\n\nFarinaceous Gypsum, Kirw. i. 120. Le Gypse Terreux, Broch. i. 601. Chaux Sulphate Terreux, Hauy, ii. 278.\n\nExter. Char.—This is composed of particles which are more or less cohering; dull, in some places weakly glimmering; feels meagre and rough.\n\nColour white, gray, or yellowish.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This substance is rare; it is only found in the fissures and cavities of gypsum rocks, and is supposed to be a deposition of loose particles of gypsum, carried along by water. Found in Saxony, and Mont Martre near Paris.\nSubspecies 2. Compact Gypsum.\n\n*Id. Kirw. i. 121.* *Id. Broch. i. 602.* *Id. Hauy, ii. 278.*\n\n**Exter. Char.**—Found massive; lustre weakly glimmering, almost dull; fracture compact, even, or splintery; fragments blunt edged.\n\nColour yellowish and grayish white, sometimes reddish; and different colours exhibit stripes; translucent at the edges; soft, and easily frangible. Spec. grav. about 2.3.\n\n**Localities, &c.**—Found in Italy, Germany, France, Spain, and England.\n\nSubspecies 3. Foliated Gypsum.\n\n*Granularly Foliated Gypsum, Kirw. i. 123.* *Id. Broch. i. 606.*\n\n**Exter. Char.**—Found massive or disseminated, and sometimes, it is said, crystallized in fixed prisms, obliquely bevelled at each extremity; lustre glimmering or shining, between vitreous and pearly; fracture foliated, sometimes radiated; fragments blunt edged.\n\nColour usually snow white, grayish, yellowish, or reddish white; and several colours are arranged in spots, stripes, and veins. Translucent, rarely semi-transparent; refraction double; very soft; easily frangible. Spec. grav. 2.27 to 2.31.\n\nFoliated gypsum has some resemblance to granular limestone, but may be readily distinguished from it by its softness.\n\nSubspecies 4. Fibrous Gypsum.\n\n*Id. Kirw. i. 122.* *Id. Broch. i. 604.* *Id. Hauy, ii. 278.*\n\n**Exter. Char.**—This is found massive, but in thin layers; lustre shining, or weakly thinning, pearly; fracture fibrous; in some varieties the longitudinal fracture is foliated; cross fracture fibrous; fragments long, splintery.\n\nColour snow white, grayish, yellowish, or reddish white; translucent; very soft; easily frangible.\n\n**Chem. Char.**—The different varieties of gypsum possess nearly the same chemical characters. When pure, there is no effervescence with acids. Before the blowpipe gypsum immediately becomes white, is converted into a white enamel, which, at the end of 24 hours, falls into powder.\n\n**Localities, &c.**—Gypsum, in general, constitutes mountains or beds, which are subordinate to sandstone, or limestone. It is found in all kinds of rocks. Gypsum is found in great abundance in the neighbourhood of Paris, in several parts of England, but sparingly in Scotland.\n\n**Uses.**—Gypsum is employed along with lime as a cement. It is also very extensively employed under the name of plaster of Paris, for making casts and models. With this view it is exposed to a strong heat, to drive off the water of crystallization. It is then in the state of powder, which being again mixed with water, is put into the mould in the form of paste; and, from its strong affinity for water, it soon becomes solid.\n\n---\n\n19. Species. Selenite.\n\n*Broad Foliated Gypsum, Kirw. i. 123.* *La Selenite, Broch. i. 629.* *Chaux Sulfatee, Hauy, ii. 266.*\n\n**Exter. Char.**—Divisible into smooth plates, which break under angles of 115° and 67°.\n\n**Exter. Char.**—Selenite is found massive; and frequently also crystallized. The primitive form of its crystals is a four-sided prism, whose bases are oblique parallelograms; the integrant molecule is the same. The usual forms are, a six-sided prism, having two broad and two narrow faces, and terminated by an oblique bevelment, whose sides correspond to the broad sides of the prism; a similar prism terminated by a four-sided pyramid; double crystals composed of two of the former united by their smaller lateral faces, so that the summits united form on one side a salient angle, and on the other a re-entering angle; another form is a spheroidal or conic lens. These crystals are often grouped, divergent, fascicular, or stellated; and of the six sides of the prism, the two opposite are smooth, and the four others longitudinally streaked; lustre refulgent or thinning, between vitreous and pearly; fracture foliated, straight or curved; cleavage threefold; fragments rhomboidal, with two faces smooth and shining, and two others streaked.\n\nColour usually white, grayish, yellowish, or snow white, sometimes iridescent; transparent; sometimes only translucent; very soft; in thin plates, flexible, but not elastic; easily frangible.

It is also found in neits in clay. It is not uncommon in many places, as among the gypsum rocks near Paris, in different parts of England, and at Lord Glasgow's coal works in Scotland, where it is found among clay, and in the cavities or on the surface of the limestone which repose on the strata of coal.\n\n**Uses.**—Selenite also, after calcination, is employed in modelling; but it is said that it possesses less solidity than what is obtained from gypsum.\n\n20.

Char.—This mineral is found massive, and also crystallized, in four-sided prisms, which are nearly cubical; two of the opposite lateral faces are broader than the other two. The lateral edges are sometimes truncated, and hence arises an eight-sided prism; sometimes also the truncations are so great as to destroy the narrow lateral faces, and form again a six-sided prism. External lustre of the broad faces resplendent and pearly; of the narrow, shining. Internal lustre shining and pearly; fracture foliated; cleavage threefold; fragments cubical.\n\nColour milk-white, grayish, yellowish, and reddish white; sometimes pearl gray; translucent; semihard.

Species. DATHOLITE.\n\nChaux Datholite, Brongniart, ii. 397. Chaux Boratée Siliceuse, Hauy.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral has only been found crystallized; the primitive form is a rectangular prism, with rhomboidal bases, whose angles are 109° 18' and 72° 42'; lustre shining, vitreous; fragments conchoidal.\n\nColour grayish or greenish white; translucent; scratches fluor spar. Spec. grav. 2.98.\n\nChem. Char.—In the flame of a candle it becomes dull white, and is easily reduced to powder. Before the blow pipe it melts into a glass of a pale rose-red colour.\n\nConstituent Parts.

Char.—Forming a white precipitate in weak nitric acid before solution.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive, or differentiated, rarely crystallized; forms of its crystals are, a six-sided prism, with a six-sided pyramid set on the lateral faces; the same prism having all the angles truncated; a double six-sided pyramid. The crystals, which are small, are usually imbedded in the mineral itself; sometimes grouped in bundles, or crolling each other. Surface smooth; lustre of the principal fracture shining, or weakly shining, refrinous; fracture between radiated and foliated; cross fracture fine grained uneven; fragments wedge-shaped.\n\nColour yellowish gray, grayish, or yellowish white; translucent, or semitransparent; semihard, or soft; brittle; easily flangible. Spec. grav. 4.3 to 4.33.\n\nChem.

It has been long employed at Anglefark for the purpose of destroying rats. It has also been tried as a medicine in scrofula, but seemingly with little effect; and it ought to be had recourse to with extreme caution.\n\n2. Species. HEAVY SPAR, or Sulphate of Barytes.\n\nThis species has been divided in eight subspecies; earthy, compact, granular, foliated, common, columnar, prismatic, and bolognian.\n\nSubspecies 1.

It has been since found in Sicily, where it is accompanied with fibrous gypsum and native sulphur.\n\nSECOND CLASS. SALTS.\n\nI. Genus. SULPHATES.\n\n1. Species. NATIVE VITRIOL.\n\nMixed vitriol, or sulphate of iron, copper, and zinc. Kirwan, ii. 24. Vitriol Natif, Brochant, ii. 2.\n\nExter. Char.—This mineral is found massive or disseminated, and also in a stalactitical, cylindrical, and capillary form; internal lustre shining, or weakly thinning, between silky and vitreous; external surface rough and uneven; fracture usually fibrous, sometimes foliated.\n\nColour grayish, or yellowish white, sometimes different shades of grey blue; the colour varies by exposure to the air. Soft; semi-transparent or translucent; taste sour and astringent.\n\nChem. Char.—There are different, according to the proportions of the constituent parts. Before the blowpipe, sulphurated hydrogen gas is given out; the iron is detected by giving a black colour to the solution of nut galls; the copper, by immersing a plate of iron; and the zinc, by a white efflorescence, which appears when the native salt is exposed to the air.\n\nThis substance is a mixed salt, composed of the sulphates of iron, zinc, and copper, in variable proportions, so that its appearance and characters must also be variable.\n\nLocalties, &c.—Native vitriol is not uncommon in mountains of clay flake which contain metallic ores, and particularly those of copper and iron pyrites, and blends; by the decomposition of which it is formed. It is found in Bohemia, Saxony, and Hungary, as well as in the mines of Britain, where such metallic ores abound.\n\nThe native sulphate of iron is common in coal mines which contain iron pyrites, as in many of the coal mines of Britain. This substance is very abundant in the earl of Glasgow's coal mines near Paisley, where the manufacture of coppers, by purifying and crystallizing the native salt, has been long carried on.\n\nUses.—The mixed substance, native vitriol, can only be employed to any useful purpose, by obtaining the different salts in a separate form. The uses of these salts are well known in various arts, but particularly in dyeing, and some of them in medicine.\n\n2. Species. NATIVE ALUM.\n\nAlum, Kirwan ii. 13. L'Alun Natif, Brochant, ii. 6. Alumine Sulfatée alkaline, Hauy, ii. 387, 388.\n\nExter. Char.—Native alum is usually found in small capillary crystals, sometimes adhering to other minerals, and very rarely in stalactitical masses. The form of the crystal of alum is the regular octahedron, which is usually obtained artificially. Externally it is dull, or slightly glimmering, but internally shining, with a silky or vitreous lustre; fracture fibrous; very soft; taste astringent.\n\nChem. Char.—Before the blow-pipe melts easily in its water of crystallization, then froths up, and becomes a white spongy mass.\n\nAlum is a triple salt, a sulphate of alumina and potash. It rarely happens that all the three ingredients exist together in nature. The potash is usually added during the preparation of artificial alum.\n\nAccording to the examination of native alum by Klaproth, from the alum cavern at Cape Miseno near Naples, it appears that from 1000 lbs. of the material furnished by nature, 470 lbs. may be obtained, having the requisite quantity of potash; and by an addition of potash to promote the crystallization, 290 lbs. more may be obtained. Analyt. Eff. i. 268. The following is the analysis of the aluminous schilus from Freyenthalde by the same chemist.\n\n| Substance          | Quantity |\n|--------------------|----------|\n| Alumina            | 15.25    |\n| Oxide of iron      | 7.50     |\n| Potash             | 2.25     |\n| Sulphuric acid and water of crystallization | 77. |\n\n100.00* Analyt. Eff. ii. 73.\n\nLocalties, &c.—Native alum is found in those places where the aluminous stones, already described, abound, as in the neighbourhood of volcanoes, and in coal mines. An extensive alum manufactory has been carried on for several years with great skill and success, at Lord Glasgow's coal work near Paisley, mentioned above. The materials are obtained from the rubbish in the old wastes, which consists of the aluminous schilus from the roof and pavement of the coal. These mines also abound with iron pyrites; and from the decomposition of all these substances the native vitriol and native alum are obtained.\n\nUses.—The uses of alum in various arts are too well known to require any enumeration.\n\n3. Species. MOUNTAIN BUTTER.\n\nLa Beurre de Montagne, Broch. ii. 10.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive; internal lustre strongly glimmering, waxy; fracture foliated; fragments blunt-edged.\n\nColour grayish white, sulphur yellow, or yellowish brown; translucent at the edges; feels greasy; taste astringent.\n\nLocalties, &c.—This species is found in similar situations with the former. In its native repository it is nearly as soft as butter, and has something of the appearance, from which it has its name. Perhaps it ought to be considered merely as a variety of the former. The same remark may be applied to another variety called plumose alum.\n\n4. Species. CAPILLARY SALT. Sulphate of Magnesia.\n\nLe Sel Capillaire, Broch. ii. 8. Haar Salt, or Hair Salt, of the Germans.\n\nExter. Char.—This salt is always found in fine capillary crystals, so closely united together as to form a compact mass; lustre thinning, or weakly shining, silky; fracture fibrous.\nColour white, sometimes greenish, grayish, or yellowish; translucent, friable; taste alluring.\n\nConstituent Parts.—This salt was supposed to be a plumbate or native alum; but it appears from the analysis of Klaproth, to be a sulphate of magnesia, with a small proportion of iron. We have examined a similar capillary salt from the coal mines near Pailley, which also appeared to be a sulphate of magnesia, but with a greater proportion of sulphate of iron.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This native salt is found in similar situations with the former species.\n\n5. Species. Native Epsom Salt, or Sulphate of Magnesia.\n\nLe Sel amer Natif, Broch. ii. 11. Epsom Salt, Kir. ii. 12.\n\nExter. Char.—The characters already given of the former species are equally applicable to this, excepting that it is said to exist sometimes in an earthy form, when it has a dull appearance.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Found in a state of efflorescence on limestone, porphyry, sandstones; and it exists in solution in many mineral waters, as in that of Epsom in England, from which it has its name. This salt also constitutes part of the efflorescence which is observed on walls built with lime.\n\n6. Species. Native Glauber Salt, or Sulphate of Soda.\n\nGlauber Salt, Kirw. ii. 9. Le Sel de Glauber Natif, Broch. ii. 14.\n\nExter. Char.—This salt is sometimes found massive or earthy, rarely flaky or crystallized. The crystals are often acicular, or in irregular, six-sided prisms, terminated by a three-sided pyramid, placed on the lateral edges or faces. Lustre shining, vitreous; but exposed to the air becomes dull. Fracture uneven; that of the crystals conchoidal. Fragments blunt-edged.\n\nColour yellowish or grayish white; opaque or transparent; brittle; taste cooling or bitter.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This salt is usually found in the neighbourhood of mineral springs which hold common salt in solution, from the decomposition of which, and the combination of its base with sulphuric acid, it is obtained. It is not unfrequent on the banks of salt lakes, and in a state of efflorescence on sandstone, marl, sometimes on the surface of the ground, and sometimes on walls built with lime and mortar. It is found in most countries in the world.\n\nII. Genus. Nitrates.\n\n1. Species. Native Nitre, or Nitrate of Potash.\n\nNitre, Kirw. ii. 25. Le Nitre Natif, Broch. ii. 17. Potasse Nitratée, Hauy, ii. 346. Saltpetre.\n\nEffem. Char.—Does not deliquesce, and detonates with a combustible body.\n\nExter. Char.—This salt is commonly found superficial, in acicular crystals, rarely massive, and more rarely crystallized in six-sided prisms; lustre shining, vitreous; fracture conchoidal; fragments sharp-edged.\n\nColour snow white, grayish or yellowish white; translucent; soft; easily frangible or friable; taste saline.\n\nConstituent Parts.

Ed. I. 279.\n\nExter. Char., &c.—Native nitre is found in Italy near Molletta, in Naples, from which that analyzed by Klaproth was obtained, and which is disposed in small beds, or more rarely in veins, on limestone. Native nitre is also not uncommon in Hungary, Spain, France, and Peru, in which latter country, and in the East Indies, where it is very abundant, it is found efflorescent on the surface of the ground at certain seasons of the year.\n\nUses.—The uses of nitre for some economical purposes, in various arts, in medicine, but particularly in the manufacture of gun-powder, are well known.\n\nIII. Genus. Muriates.\n\n1. Species. Rock Salt.\n\nCommon Salt, Sal Gem, Kirw. ii. §1. Le Sel de Cuirasse, Broch. ii. 20. Soude Muriatée, Hauy, ii. 356.\n\nEffem. Char.—Soluble in water, and divisible into cubes.\n\nThis species is divided into two subspecies; 1. foliated, and 2. fibrous rock salt.\n\nSubspecies 1. Foliated Rock Salt.\n\nLe Sel Gemme Lamelleux, Broch. ii. 21. Lamellar Salt Gem, Kirw. ii. 32. Soude Muriatée Amorphe, Hauy, ii. 359.\n\nExter. Char.—Usually found massive in considerable beds, sometimes disseminated in large masses, or kidney-form, flaky, or crystallized in perfect cubes; surface of the crystals smooth; lustre shining, vitreous; fracture foliated; cleavage threefold and rectangular; fragments cubic.\n\nColour grayish, yellowish, or reddish white, flesh or brownish red; transparent or translucent; soft; streak grayish white; taste saline.\n\nChem.

It is also accompanied with gypsum, sandstone, limestone. It is sometimes also found in veins.\n\nRock salt is found in most countries of the world; the most celebrated mines are those of Wilczka, which have been wrought for 500 years. There are mines of this mineral in Poland, Silesia, and in Bavaria and Siberia; at Cordova in Spain it constitutes an entire mountain. Rock salt is also found in abundance in Cheshire in England. It is found also in Africa, Asia, as well as in North and South America.\n\nSubspecies 2. Fibrous Rock Salt.\n\nFibrous Sal Gem, Kirw. ii. 32. Le Sel Gemme Fibreux, Broch. ii. 25. Soude Muriaée Fibreuse, Hauy, ii. 359.\n\nExter. Char.—This variety is found massive, in small wedge-shaped veins; lustrous glimmering, rarely weakly shining; fracture fibrous, curved parallel or divergent; fragments wedge-shaped, with sharp edges.\n\nColour grayish white, yellowish or pearl gray, lavender blue, violet blue, or flesh red; varies between translucent and semitransparent. The other characters of fibrous rock salt correspond with those of the preceding subspecies, and it is found in similar situations accompanying it.\n\n2. Species. Sea Salt.\n\nThis salt can perhaps scarcely be considered as a separate species. It is found on the shores of the ocean, or of salt lakes during the dry seasons of the year, in consequence of the evaporation and diminution of the water which holds it in solution.\n\nUses.—The various uses of salt in domestic economy and many of the arts are well known.\n\nSpecies 3. Native Sal Ammoniac.\n\nSal Ammoniac, Kirw. ii. 33. Le Sel Ammoniac Natif, Broch. ii. 27. Ammoniaque Muriaée, Hauy, ii. 380.\n\nEffem. Char.—Entirely volatile by the application of heat.\n\nExter. Char.—Most commonly found in superficial layers, or efflorescent; sometimes also massive or stalactical, and rarely crystallized. Primitive form of its crystals a regular octahedron; integrant molecule a regular tetrahedron. The crystals are described to be in the form of cubes, fixed pyramids, and dodecahedral; lustrous shining, often only glimmering or dull and vitreous. Fracture even; fragments sharp-edged.\n\nColour white, grayish, or yellowish; soft, and often friable; taste saline, pungent, and bitter.\n\nChem. Char.—Very soluble in water, producing a considerable degree of cold; rubbed with lime, gives out a pungent odour of ammonia.\n\nConstituent Parts. Klaproth.\n\nMuriate of ammonia 77.5\nSulphate of ammonia 2.5\n\nLocalities, &c.—This salt is a volcanic production, and found deposited in the cavities of lava, as on Vesuvius and Etna, and in the Lipari islands. It is also met with in Iceland, in Persia, and different places of Asia. The substance analyzed by Klaproth was from Tartary. This salt has also been discovered in the neighbourhood of coal mines in Britain, which have been accidentally on fire. Sal ammoniac from Egypt may be considered rather as an artificial production.\n\nIV. Genus. Carbonates.\n\n1. Species. Native Soda, or Carbonate of Soda.\n\nNatron, Kirw. ii. 6. L'Alkali Mineral, Broch. ii. 30. Soude Carbonatée, Hauy, ii. 373.\n\nEffem. Char.—Soluble in water, and effervesces with nitric acid.\n\nExter. Char.—Found in small particles, which are usually in the state of powder; is dull and meagre to the touch.\n\nColour grayish white, or yellowish gray; taste sharp alkaline.\n\nChem. Char.—Very fusible before the blow-pipe; the solution renders vegetable blues green.\n\nThe following are the constituent parts of Egyptian natron or soda, analyzed by Klaproth.\n\n| Constituent       | Percentage |\n|-------------------|------------|\n| Carbonate of soda | 32.6       |\n| Sulphate of soda  | 20.8       |\n| Muriate of soda   | 15         |\n| Water             | 31.6       |\n\n100.0\n\nLocalities, &c.—Native soda is found on the surface of the soil, or on the borders of lakes which evaporate during the summer, in Egypt, where it has been long collected, and known under the name of natron. In the neighbourhood of Debreczin in Hungary, it is found efflorescent on a heathy soil; in Bohemia, on a decomposed gneiss rock, where it is annually collected in considerable quantity in the spring of the year. Natron is also found near Naples, in Persia, Bengal, and China. It exists also in solution in many mineral waters.\n\nUses.—This salt is very extensively employed in many arts.\n\nAnother variety of native soda has been described. This is in the form of radiated masses, which are composed of acicular crystals. It seems to be a purer carbonate of soda. The following are the constituent parts according to the analysis of Klaproth.\n\n| Constituent       | Percentage |\n|-------------------|------------|\n| Soda              | 37         |\n| Carbonic acid     | 38         |\n| Water             | 22.5       |\n| Sulphate of soda  | 2.5        |\n\n100.0\n\n2. Species. Native Magnesia, or Carbonate of Magnesia.\n\nA pretty pure carbonate of magnesia, discovered by Dr Mitchell; and another which contains an admixture of\nof filica discovered by Giobert, has been already described under the magnesian genus, species 1. which see.\n\nV. GENUS. BORATES.\n\n1. Species. Borax.\n\nId. Kirw. ii. 37. Borax Natif, Broch. ii. 33. Soude Boratée, Haüy, ii. 366.\n\nEffus. Char.—Taste sweetish; fusible with considerable intumescence into a vitreous globule.\n\nExter. Char.—This salt is found massive and disseminated, but most frequently crystallized; the forms are a six-sided prism with the two opposite faces broader; the same prism having its lateral edges truncated, or having its two narrow terminal edges truncated; the crystals are usually imbedded in an earthy mass; surface a little rough, sometimes smooth, and usually covered with a white earthy crust; lustre shining, waxy; fracture foliated.\n\nColour grayish white, yellowish or greenish; semi-transparent, or only translucent; refraction double; soft; brittle; greasy to the feel. Spec. grav. 1.740.\n\nConstituent Parts.—When borax is purified, it is a compound of soda and boracic acid; but in its native state it is always contaminated with earthy matters.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Borax is brought from Persia and Thibet. According to some travellers, it is got from the waters of a lake by evaporation in the open air; but according to others it is ready formed on the borders of the lake, where common salt is also collected.\n\nUse.—Borax is still farther purified after it is brought to Europe, for the purpose of employing it in the arts, particularly as a flux in metallurgical operations.\n\n2. Species. Boracite, or Borate of Magnesia.\n\nBoracite, Kirw. i. 172. Id. Brochant, i. 589.\n\nExter. Char.—Always found crystallized: 1. In cubes, having the edges and four of the angles truncated; 2. The cube, having all the edges and angles truncated. When these truncations are increased on the edges, a dodecahedron is nearly formed, or when they increase on the angles, the resulting form is an octahedron. Surface of the crystals smooth, sometimes rough; lustre thinning or resplendent; internal lustre thinning, refrinous; fracture conchoidal; fragments sharp-edged.\n\nColour ash or yellowish gray, grayish or greenish white; semitransparent or translucent, often opaque; semifluid; rather easily frangible. Spec. grav. 2.56.\n\nChem. Char.—Melts before the blowpipe, froths up, and yields a yellowish enamel, on which small rough points appear, and are thrown off like sparks by continuing the heat.\n\n(b) Boracite and cryolite do not certainly possess all the characters that entitle them to a place among the salts; but as magnesia is the predominant base of the one and soda of the other, it was thought better to introduce them here than to multiply divisions.\n\nVI. GENUS. FLUATES.\n\n1. Species. Cryolite, or Fluate of Soda and Alumina.\n\nId. Brochant, ii. 505. Alumine Fluatée Alkaline, Haüy, ii. 398.\n\nExter.

Spec. grav. 2.94.\n\nChem. Char.—Melts in the flame of a candle, and from its easy fusibility it derives its name. It then becomes hard, and is changed into a flag, which is somewhat caustic. Soluble with effervescence in sulphuric acid, and gives out white vapours that corrode glass.\n\nConstituent Parts.\n\n| Klarnoth. | Vanquelin. |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Soda      | 36         | 32         |\n| Alumina   | 23.5       | 21         |\n| Fluoric acid and water | 40.5 | 47 |\n\nLocalities, &c.—Cryolite was brought to Copenhagen from Greenland, but nothing is known of its repository (b).\n\nTHIRD CLASS. COMBUSTIBLES.\n\nI. GENUS. SULPHUR.\n\n1. Species. Native Sulphur.\n\nId. Kirwan, ii. 69. Le Soufre Natif, Brochant, ii. 37.\n\nThis species is divided into two subspecies; 1. Common; 2. Volcanic native sulphur.\n\nSubspecies\nSubspecies 1. Common Native Sulphur.\n\nExter. Char.—Sulphur is found massive, disseminated in superficial layers, or crystallized. Primitive form of its crystals is an octahedron, whose faces are scalene triangles; the integrant molecule is an irregular tetrahedron. The usual forms of the crystals are, 1. That of the primitive form, in which two four-sided oblique-angled pyramids are joined base to base; of which the common base is a rhomb, whose two diagonals are as 5 to 4; 2. The same form having its summits truncated; 3. The first form having its summit surmounted by an obtuse four-sided acumenation, set on the lateral faces; 4. Or, having the common base truncated; or, 5. Having its obtuse lateral edges truncated; or, 6. Having the obtuse angles of the common base truncated. The crystals are of various sizes, most frequently grouped; surface smooth; lustre resplendent; internal lustre shining, or weakly shining, between resinous and adamantine; fracture fine grained, uneven, sometimes conchoidal or splintery; fragments sharp-edged.\n\nColour yellow, greenish, or grayish yellow; translucent or semitransparent; refraction double; soft; brittle, and very easily frangible; gives out by rubbing a fulphureous smell. Spec. grav. 1.99 to 2.03.\n\nChem. Char.—Burns with a peculiar blue flame, and gives out a pungent odour, which is well known.\n\nNative sulphur is not always pure; it is often contaminated with earthy matters.\n\nPhys. Char.—Sulphur becomes electric by friction, and its electricity is negative.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Native sulphur is most commonly found in stratiform mountains, chiefly in those of gypsum, marl, and compact limestone, and there it exists in the form of nodules. Found also, but rarely, and in small quantity, in the veins of primitive mountains. Sulphur is found in many countries of the world, as in Poland, Hungary, Switzerland, Spain, and Sicily, where the finest crystals yet known are found.\n\nSubspecies 2. Native Volcanic Sulphur.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive, in rounded pieces, stalactitical, cellular, or in thin sublimed layers, sometimes also crystallized in confused groups; internal lustre weakly shining or shining; fracture uneven; fragments blunt-edged.\n\nColour the same as the former, but inclining sometimes a little towards gray; translucent; in other characters it resembles the preceding.\n\nLocalities, &c.—As its name imports, this variety is found near volcanoes, where it is sublimed among the lava. The sulphur of Aetna and Vesuvius chiefly, and also that of Iceland, and of some of the islands in the West Indies, is collected, and forms a very important article in commerce.\n\nUses.—Sulphur is one of the most valuable substances in various arts. It is employed in the bleaching of woollen stuffs and silks; it forms an essential ingredient in gunpowder, and it is the base of sulphurous and sulphuric acid, which are so extensively employed in tanning, hat-making, dyeing, and other arts and manufactures.\n\nII. BITUMINOUS GENUS.\n\n1. Species. Petroleum, or Mineral Oil.\n\nLe Naphtha, and L’Huile Minérale Commune, Broch. ii. 59. and 60. Naphtha and Petrole, Kirwan, ii. 42. and 43. Bitume Liquide Brune, ou Noirâtre, Haüy, iii. 312.\n\nExter. Char.—Found fluid and somewhat viscid. Colour blackish or reddish brown; almost opaque; feels very greasy; exhales a strong bituminous odour; taste pungent, acid. Spec. grav. 0.708. to 0.854.\n\nChem. Char.—Burns easily with a dense smoke, and leaves some earthy residue. When exposed to the air it becomes thicker and less fluid.\n\nIts constituent parts are carbon, hydrogen, and a small portion of oxygen.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Petroleum is generally found in the vicinity of coal, rising to the surface of the water which flows from coal strata. It is not uncommon in different parts of the world. It is found in Lancashire in England, and at St Catherine’s well near Libberton, in the vicinity of Edinburgh.\n\nNaphtha, which is considered merely as a purer kind of mineral oil, is found in considerable abundance in different parts of Persia, on the shores of the Caspian Sea, in Calabria, Sicily, and America. In 1822, a spring of naphtha of a topaz yellow colour, burning easily, and leaving little residue, with a specific gravity of 0.83, was discovered in the state of Parma in Italy, and afforded such a quantity as to be sufficient to illuminate the streets of Genoa.\n\nUses.—Naphtha has been sometimes employed in the composition of varnish, in that of fire-works, for the purpose of heating rooms, when it is mixed with a small quantity of earth; and in Persia and other countries it is burnt in lamps as a substitute for oil. Formerly it was employed in medicine as a vermifuge.\n\n2. Species. Mineral Pitch.\n\nThis is divided into three subspecies; 1. elastic; 2. earthy; and 3. flaky.\n\nSubspecies 1. Elastic Mineral Pitch.\n\nMineral Caoutchouc, Kirw. ii. 48. La Poix Minérale Élastique, Broch. ii. 64. Bitume Élastique, Haüy, iii. 313.\n\nExter. Char.—Found in masses of different sizes, disseminated, sometimes superficial, or stalactitical; lustre dull, rarely glimmering; internal lustre shining, resinous.\n\nColour brownish black, hair-brown, often veined yellow; translucent at the edges; soft consistence like elastic gum, and also elastic. It gives out the smell of leather. Spec. grav. 0.902 to 1.23.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This mineral was discovered in 1785 in the mine of Odin in Derbyshire in England, where it is accompanied with galena, calcareous spar, heavy spar, fluor spar, and blende.\n\nThis substance effaces the marks of black lead on paper, like elastic gum; but stains the paper.\nSubspecies 2. Earthy Mineral Pitch.\n\nServicompact Mineral Pitch, or Maltha, Kirw. ii. 46. La Poix Minérale Terreuse, Broch. ii. 65.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive; internally dull; fracture earthy, sometimes uneven; fragments blunt-edged. Colour blackish brown, sometimes clove brown; streak shining, and darker coloured; very soft; feels greasy; smell bituminous.\n\nChem. Char.—Burns with much flame, and smoke; exhales a strong odour, and leaves carbonaceous and earthy matter.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Found in the principality of Neufchatel in Switzerland.\n\nSubspecies 3. Slaggy Mineral Pitch.\n\nCompact Mineral Pitch, Kirw. ii. 46. La Poix Minérale Scoriacée, Broch. ii. 66. Bitume Solide, Hauy, iii. 313. Asphaltum, or Jews Pitch, of others.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive and disseminated, superficial or stalactitical; lustre resplendent, resinous; fracture conchoidal; fragments sharp-edged.\n\nColour perfect black, sometimes brownish-black; opaque, rarely translucent at the edges; lustre remains in the streak; soft; feels greasy; by rubbing gives out a bituminous odour. Spec. grav. 1.07 to 1.6.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This variety frequently accompanies the preceding. It is found at Morfeld in the Palatinate, at Neufchatel in Switzerland. It is found floating on the surface of the lake Asphaltum in Judea, from which it derives its name of Jews pitch. It is there collected by the inhabitants of the country as an object of commerce, and at the same time, it is said to diminish the quantity of noxious vapours which it exhales—so noxious that birds flying over it drop down dead, whence it has the name of Dead sea. This variety of mineral pitch is found in other places, sometimes connected with coal and limestone strata, and sometimes with mineral veins. But the island of Trinidad furnishes the greatest quantity of this substance. In that island there is a pitch lake of about four miles in circumference; but it appears from the information of Mr Spon, in a letter to Mr Tobin of Bristol, by whom this information was communicated, along with a number of specimens to Mr Hatchett, that the substance formerly supposed to be mineral pitch, is nothing more than a porous stone impregnated with that substance; so that what was supposed to be an immense lake of mineral pitch or asphaltum, is only the stone of the country impregnated with bitumen. Mr Hatchett thinks this stone may be arranged in the argillaceous genus*.\n\n3. Species. Amber.\n\nId. Kirw. ii. 65. Le Succin, Broch. ii. 69. Id.

Char.—Also found in rounded pieces of various sizes; surface rough and uneven; dull, sometimes glimmering; internal lustre resplendent, resinous; sometimes transparent. In its other external and chemical characters, it resembles the preceding.\n\nPhys. Char.—Amber becomes strongly electric by friction, a property known to the ancients. From the Greek and Latin word elelrum, the term electricity is derived.\n\nConstituent Parts.—Amber is composed of a large proportion of oil, and of a peculiar acid, the succinic, which is obtained by distillation.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Amber is found in the vicinity of bituminous wood, but most commonly in the sand on the shores of the ocean, and chiefly on the shores of the Baltic. It is found also in Sweden, France, Italy, and on the east coast of England. Amber frequently contains small parts of vegetables, and entire insects. Of the origin of this substance nothing certain is yet known.\n\nUses.—The uses of amber for ornamental purposes, are well known. In this country it was formerly in higher estimation than at present. It still forms an important article of commerce in eastern countries.\n\n4. Species. Mellite, or Honey Stone.\n\nId. Hauy, iii. 335. La Pierre de Miel, Broch. ii. 73. Mellite, Kirw. ii. 68.\n\nExter.

Pitch Coal.\n\nLa Houille Piceiforme, Brochant, ii. 49.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive or disseminated; and sometimes parts of vegetables, such as the branches of trees, are observed. Lustre shining, resplendent, resinous; fracture conchoidal; fragments sharp-edged.\n\nColour perfect black, and the longitudinal fracture sometimes brownish; soft; easily frangible. Specific gravity 1.3.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This is one of the most common varieties of coal, and therefore is found in all coal countries.\n\nUses.—As it is susceptible of a fine polish, it is employed for various ornamental purposes. The substance known by the name of jet, belongs to this variety.\n\nSubspecies 2. Columnar Coal.\n\nLa Houille Scapiforme, Brochant, ii. 15.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive; in its fracture shining, or weakly shining, resinous; fracture more or less perfectly conchoidal; fragments indeterminate.\n\nColour perfect black, or brownish black. It is composed of distinct concretions, which are columnar, parallel, slightly curved, whose surfaces are smooth and shining; is soft, and easily frangible.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This is a very rare variety of coal.

The coal at Kilkenny in Ireland belongs also to this variety; and from the places where it is found, is called Wigan or Kilkenny coal.\n\nUses.—Before being employed as fuel with other kinds of coal, this variety, being susceptible of a fine polish, is cut and formed into various useful and ornamental purposes. It is said that the choir of the cathedral church of Litchfield is covered with plates of this coal alternating with black marble.\n\nSubspecies 5. Foliated Coal.\n\nLe Charbon Lamelleux, Brochant, ii. 54.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive; principal fracture resplendent; crofs fracture thinning; principal fracture more or less foliated; crofs fracture somewhat uneven; fragments rhomboidal.\n\nColour perfect black, and on the sides of the fissures superficial colours appear, like the colours of tempered steel, or those of the peacock's tail; easily frangible.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This coal is found at Liege, in Saxony, near Dresden, and in some parts of France.\n\nSubspecies 6. Coarse Coal.\n\nLa Houille Grossiere, Brochant, ii. 55.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive; is weakly shining, resinous; fracture uneven, or more or less flat; fragments blunt edged.\n\nColour grayish black, sometimes brownish black; streak shining; soft; easily frangible.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Accompanies the other kinds of coal, whose localities have been already mentioned.\n\n7. Species. Coal Blende.\n\nThis is divided into two subspecies, conchoidal and flaty.\n\nSubspecies 1. Conchoidal Coal Blende.\n\nLa Houille Eclatante, Brochant, ii. 50. Glanz-kohle of the Germans.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive, rarely disseminated; lustre thinning or repleendent, approaching to metallic; fracture perfectly conchoidal; fragments not very sharp edged.\n\nColour iron black, inclining to brown, or exhibiting the superficial colours like tempered steel; soft; easily frangible.\n\nChem. Char.—Burns without any flame, leaving a white ash.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This variety of coal is very rare. It is found at Newcastle, and at Meißner in Hesse, along with the other varieties of coal.\n\nSubspecies 2. Slaty Coal Blende.\n\nNative Mineral Carbone, Kirw. ii. 49. La Blende Charbonneuse, Brochant, ii. 57. Anthracite, Hatiy, ii. 307.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive, and disseminated; internal lustre thinning, or repleendent, and between metallic and vitreous; fracture more or less perfectly flat; crofs fracture flat conchoidal; fragments sometimes cubic, and sometimes in tables.\n\nColour perfect black, approaching more or less to iron black, or grayish or bluish black; opaque; stains, but does not write; soft; rather brittle; very easily frangible. Spec. grav. 1.3 to 1.8.\n\nChem. Char.—Reduced to powder, and heated in a crucible, this coal gives neither a sulphurous nor bituminous smell, and neither sulphur nor bitumen can be obtained from it. After being long exposed to heat, it consumes slowly without flame, and loses during the process about two-thirds of its weight. The residue is of a blackish gray colour, which shows that the combustion has not been complete.\n\nConstituent Parts.\n\n| Pure carbone | Panzenberg | Dolomien |\n|--------------|------------|----------|\n| Silica       | 2          | 13.19    |\n| Alumina      | 5          | 3.29     |\n| Oxide of iron| 3          | 3.47     |\n| Loes         |            | 8        |\n\nLocalities, &c.—This variety has been found in a vein at Schemitz in Hungary, in Pais de Vaud, in a transported rock, which seems to be intermediate between granite and breccia; at Konigsberg in Norway, where it is accompanied with native silver; in Saxony it forms an entire bed in a mountain of clay slate; also found in the island of Arran in Scotland.\n\nIII. GRAPHITE Genus.\n\n1. Species. Graphite, or Black Lead.\n\nPlumbago, Kirw. ii. 58. Le Graphite, Broch. ii. 76. Fer Carbureé, Hauy, iv. 98.\n\nThis species is divided into two subspecies, scaly and compact.\n\nSubspecies 1. Scaly Graphite.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive and disseminated; lustre glimmering or shining, metallic; fracture foliated, conchoidal,\nchoidal, sometimes uneven or flaty; fragments bluntedged, sometimes trapezoidal; commonly appears in distinct granular concretions, which are small or fine grained, with a splintery aspect.\n\nColour intermediate between bluish black and light iron black; sometimes steel gray, or brownish black; opaque; streak thinning; stains and writes; soft; easily frangible; feels greatly.\n\nSubspecies 2. Compact Graphite.\n\nChem. Char.—This subspecies approaches so near to the former in its characters, that it seems difficult to distinguish it. The following characters and circumstances connected with the natural history of graphite, refer to both. Specific gravity 1.987 to 2.456.\n\nChem. Char.—When exposed to heat in a furnace, it gives out, during combustion, a great proportion of carbonic acid, leaving a residuum of red oxide of iron.\n\n| Constituent Parts | Berthollet. | Scheele. | Vauquelin. |\n|-------------------|------------|----------|------------|\n| Carbon | 90.9 | 90 | 23 |\n| Iron | 9.1 | 10 | 2 |\n| Silica | - | - | 38 |\n| Alumina | - | - | 37 |\n\nOf the above analysis it must be observed, that the two first by Berthollet and Scheele must have been very pure specimens of graphite; and, on the contrary, the specimens analyzed by Vauquelin must have been very impure, containing so large a proportion of earthy matters, and so small a proportion of the proper ingredients of that mineral.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This mineral, which is not very common, is found chiefly in primitive mountains. It is met with in Spain, France, Bavaria, and Hungary. In England at Borrowdale near Keswick in Cumberland; and at Craigman, near New Cumnock, in Ayrshire in Scotland, where it is found in detached masses among rocks nearly similar to those which accompany coal.\n\nUses.—Graphite or black lead is employed for making pencils. The coarser parts are employed in making crucibles. It is also employed for covering cast iron, such as grates, to defend them from rust; and on account of its unctuous property, it is applied to those parts of machines which are subject to friction, for the purpose of diminishing it.\n\n2. Species. Mineral Charcoal.\n\nThis substance, which accompanies the other varieties of coal already described, is of a woody texture, and has therefore a fibrous fracture, with somewhat of a shining and silky lustre. It is usually found in thin layers with the other varieties of coal, and perhaps it might be considered as coal less perfectly formed; but in its characters it agrees so much with the varieties of coal blende, that it seems quite unnecessary to make it a separate species.\n\nFourth Class. Metallic Ores.\n\nI. Platina Genus.\n\nSpecies. Native Platina.\n\nId. Kirw. ii. 103. Le Platine Natif, Broch. ii. 86. Platine Natif Ferrifere, Hauy, iii. 368.\n\nEffem. Char.—Of a silver white colour, and infusible.\n\nExter. Char.—Platina is found in the form of small flat or rounded grains; surface smooth, with shining metallic lustre; streak resplendent.\n\nColour light steel gray, or silver white; semi-hard; ductile; flexible in thin plates. Spec. grav. 15.601 to 17.7; but when purified, and hammered, 23, and according to some, 24.\n\nChem. Char.—Is almost infusible without addition, in the focus of a burning glass, or exposed to the action of oxygen gas. It does not amalgamate with mercury, and is only soluble in nitro-muriatic acid.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Platina was first brought to Europe by Don Ulloa in 1748. The repository of this metal is not known, and it has been found only in South America, till lately that it was discovered in gray silver ore from the mine of Guadalcanal in Spain. In the analysis of this ore, Vauquelin found the platina to be in the proportion of \\( \\frac{1}{76} \\).\n\nUses.—Platina is one of the most valuable mineral substances, as, on account of its hardness and infusibility, it may be applied to many of the purposes of gold and iron; and from its properties of being less liable to change when exposed to the air, or to the action of other chemical agents, it answers those purposes in a superior degree.\n\nPlatina in its crude state is alloyed with other metallic substances. It has been long known that it is accompanied with particles of iron, gold, and some other substances. It contains also an ore of one of the new metals. This is iridium, which is alloyed with osmium, another new metal; both which were discovered by Mr Tennant. This ore is composed of plates; it is not malleable; its specific gravity is 19.5; and it is not acted on by nitro-muriatic acid, which dissolves platina. Rhodium and palladium, two other new metals, are alloyed with platina.\n\nII. Gold Genus.\n\nSpecies. Native Gold.\n\nThis species is divided into three subspecies; 1. golden yellow; 2. brass yellow; and, 3. grayish yellow.\n\nSubspecies 1. Golden-yellow Gold.\n\nL'Or Natif, Jaune d'Or, Broch. ii. 89. Native Gold, Kirw. i. 93.\n\nExter. Char.—Gold is found most frequently disseminated, superficial, or in grains; reticulated, dendritical, capillary, or cellular, often in small plates, more rarely crystallized. The forms of its crystals which have been observed, are small perfect cubes, regular octahedrons, dodecahedrons, double eight-sided pyramids, terminated by four-sided summits, placed on the four\nMetallic four lateral edges of the pyramids alternately; but the crystals are small and ill defined; the surface is smooth and resplendent; that of the small plates drusy and shining; that of the grains only strongly glimmering; internal lustre weakly shining, metallic; fracture hackly.\n\nThis variety presents the perfect colour of gold. It is soft; perfectly ductile, flexible, but not elastic; streak resplendent. Spec. grav. of pure gold 19.25 to 19.64.\n\nSubspecies 2. Brass-yellow Gold.\n\nL'Or Naif d'un jaune de laiton, Broch. ii. 91.\n\nExter. Char.—This variety is almost always found disseminated in small particles, or superficial; sometimes also capillary, in small plates, or crystallized in thin six-sided tables.\n\nThe colour is that of brass of various shades, according to the proportion of alloy. In other characters it resembles the former, excepting in the specific gravity, which is inferior, owing to the greater proportion of other metals with which it is alloyed.\n\nSubspecies 3. Grayish-yellow Gold.\n\nL'Or Natif d'un jaune grisâtre, Broch. ii. 92.\n\nExter. Char.—This variety is also found disseminated in small flattened grains; surface is not very smooth; almost uneven, and weakly shining.\n\nColour steel gray, approaching to that of brass; spec. grav. of this variety is greater than the last, but inferior to the first. In other external characters they are the same.\n\nChem. Char.—Native gold is only soluble in nitric acid; platinum is also soluble in the same acid, but it is not like gold, precipitated from its solution by sulphate of iron.\n\nConstituent Parts.—Native gold is not always found pure. It is frequently alloyed with silver or copper, or with both, and sometimes also, it is said, with platinum. To these alloys the difference of colour, which is the foundation of the division into three varieties, is owing. The first variety is the purest, containing only a small proportion of silver or copper; the second has a greater proportion of these metals; and the third, it is supposed, is alloyed with a small portion of platinum.\n\nUses.—Gold (on account of its indestructible nature, and its remarkable malleability and ductility), is one of the most important and valuable of the metals for many purposes; but its uses, whether as money, or articles of luxury, are too well known to require enumeration. As pure gold has no great degree of hardness, it is necessary to alloy it with a portion of copper. This is not less than $\\frac{1}{3}$, and never more than $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Gold is chiefly found in primitive mountains, and there it is usually in veins, sometimes disseminated in the rock itself. The accompanying substances are quartz, feldspar, limestone, heavy spar, pyrites, red silver, vitreous silver, and galena. Gold is also mixed with manganese, gray cobalt, nickel, and malachite. Gold has also been found, it is said, in fossil substances, as in petrified wood, penetrated with siliceous earth, a mass of which was dug out at the depth of 50 fathoms, in an argillaceous breccia, or, as is supposed by some, a porphyry with an argillaceous basis, in Transylvania. This is considered as a proof of the more recent formation of gold, as well as the discovery of Patrin, who found native gold surrounded by muriate of silver, in the mine of Zmeof in Siberia. Muriate of silver is supposed to be comparatively a late production.\n\nBut gold is perhaps more common to alluvial soil; there it is disseminated in grains, along with siliceous, argillaceous, and ferruginous sand, of which certain soils are composed; and also in the sand of many rivers; and it is observed that the gold is most abundant when the waters are at the lowest, and especially soon after floods, which shows that the gold is carried down along with the earthy matters which are swept away by the violence of the current. It has been supposed too, that the gold found in the bed of rivers, has been detached, by the force of the waters, from the veins and primitive rocks traversed by these currents; and according to this opinion, attempts have been made to trace the source of these auriferous sands, in the hope of discovering the native repository of this precious metal; but these attempts have usually failed, for it has been found that the gold is peculiar to the alluvial soil through which the stream is carried, and in which the gold is collected. This point seems to be established by the observations of naturalists. 1. The soil of those plains frequently contains, to a certain depth, and in particular places, particles of gold, which may be separated by washing. 2. The bed of the rivers and auriferous streams yields a greater proportion of gold, after the plains which are traversed by those rivers have been flooded, than in any other circumstances. 3. It has always been observed, that gold is found in the sand of rivers in a very limited space. By examining the sand of these rivers higher up, and nearer to their source, no gold is found; so that if this metal were derived from the rocks, which are swept by the currents, the quantity would be greatest nearest to their sources; but observation has proved the contrary. Thus the river Orco contains no gold, but from Pont to the place where it joins the Po. The Tefin affords no gold till it has traversed lake Major, where its course must have been retarded, and where all the heavy particles of matter which it carried along with it from the primitive mountains, must have been deposited. The quantity of the gold collected on the Rhine near Straßburg, is greater, than what is found near Baffe, which is more in the vicinity of the mountains. No gold has been discovered in the sands of the Danube during the first part of its course. Those sands become only auriferous below Effending. The same remark may be applied to the Ems. The sands of the upper part of this river, which traverses the mountains of Stiria, contain no gold; but from the place where it enters the plain at Steyer, till it joins the Danube, its sands are auriferous, and sufficiently rich to be washed with advantage.\n\nThe most of the auriferous sands in all parts of the world, are of a black or reddish colour, and consequently ferruginous. From this circumstance, connected with the gold of alluvial land, some naturalists have inferred, that it is owing to the decomposition of auriferous pyrites. It was observed by Reaumur, that the sand which accompanies gold in most of the rivers, and particularly in the Rhone and the Rhine, is like that of Ceylon.\nCeylon and Expilly, composed of iron and small grain of rubies, corundum, hyacinth. Titanium also has been discovered. It has been observed besides, that the gold of alluvial soil is purer than that which is immediately obtained from rocks, from which it is supposed that it has a different origin. It does not appear to be certainly ascertained, that gold is found in volcanic soil.\n\nSuch are the general facts relative to the repositories of gold. We shall now briefly mention the more remarkable places where gold has been found and collected, beginning with those of Europe.\n\nSpain formerly had mines of gold; the richest was in the province of Asturias, where it was dug out from regular veins. These mines, according to ancient historians, were wrought by the Phoenicians, and afterwards by the Romans; but they have been totally abandoned since the discovery of America, and the mineral riches of that country. The rivers of Spain, as well as the Tagus in Portugal, contain auriferous sand.\n\nThe only mine of gold which in modern times has been wrought in France, was discovered in 1781, at Gardette, in the valley of Oisans, department of Isère. This was a regular vein of quartz, traversing a mountain of gneiss, and containing auriferous sulphuret of iron, and some fine specimens of native gold; but it was not sufficiently rich to defray the expense of the operations. Many of the rivers of that country contain auriferous sand, as the Rhone, the Rhine, the Garonne, and others of smaller note; and it is said that gold is also found among the black sand, and particles of molybdenum ore, in the neighbourhood of Paris.\n\nIn Piedmont there are some mines of gold. At the foot of Mount Rosa, veins of auriferous sulphuret of iron have been discovered, traversing gneiss; and although these pyrites do not yield more than 10 or 11 grains of gold in the quintal, it has been found worth while to continue the operations. On the south side of the Apennine mountains, there are several auriferous rivers and soils.\n\nSome of the rivers of Switzerland also contain auriferous sands. Such are those of the Reuss and the Aar.\n\nIn Germany the only gold mine which is wrought is in Salzburg, in the chain of mountains which traverses that country from east to west, and which separates it from the Tyrol and Carinthia.\n\nBut Schemnitz and Cremnitz are the most remarkable places in Europe for mines of gold and auriferous sands. The gold of Schemnitz is accompanied by silver, lead, and iron pyrites, and the matrix is quartz. Auriferous sand is found not only in the bed of the river Neva, but this sand is still richer in the plain through which the river flows. According to De Born, this is a ferruginous sand, lying below a bed of chalk.\n\nIn Transylvania the celebrated gold mine of Nagyag is remarkable for having the gold combined with native tellurium. There is also another mine at Felsőbánya, the ore of which is an auriferous sulphuret of silver, in a vein of a kind of jasper. The rivers of this country also contain gold. The plains on the banks of the river Moros contains an auriferous sand, which is deposited between two beds, neither of which yields a particle of gold. The upper stratum is vegetable soil, and the lower is composed of schistus.\n\nThe mines of Hungary are the only gold mines in Europe which are of any importance.\n\nIn Sweden gold is obtained from the mine of Edelfors in the province of Smoland. This mine yields native gold, and auriferous iron pyrites. The veins are composed of brown quartz, traversing a mountain of schistose hornstone. The gold is sometimes disseminated in the rock itself.\n\nIn Greece, the island of Thasos in the Archipelago Greece, was celebrated in antiquity for its rich mines of gold. The ancients also, it is said, found abundance of gold in Thrace and Macedonia.\n\nThe alluvial soil in several places of the British Isles, has also furnished gold. Not many years ago, a considerable quantity of gold was collected in a sandy soil, on the mountains of Wicklow in Ireland. Several masses of native gold, exceeding an ounce in weight, were found in that soil; one weighing 22 ounces was found, which is said to be the largest specimen of native gold found in Europe.\n\nIt would appear that gold was collected at a very early period, in Scotland, and particularly in the mine field of Leadhills; but the most extensive operations were carried on by Bulmer, an Englishman, in the time of Queen Elizabeth. The trenches, heaps of soil that had been turned up, and other marks of these operations, yet visible between Leadhills and Elvanfoot, still retain the name of Bulmer's Workings, and the place where the gold was washed, is still called the gold four. At that time, it is said, an immense quantity of gold was collected. Not many years ago, similar operations were resumed, by the advice of a German; but so far as we understand, the quantity of gold collected was scarcely equal to the expense. The operations during the last attempt were carried on under the superintendence of the late Mr John Taylor, manager of the mines at Wanlockhead; a man of no common sagacity, by which he was enabled to collect many curious facts with regard to the natural history of gold. The gold was found in that country immediately under the vegetable soil; and the method of conducting the operation was, to direct a small stream of water so as to carry this soil along with it, to basins or hollow places, where the water might deposit the matters which had been carried along by its current. The matter deposited was repeatedly washed, till the whole of the earthy substances were carried off. The gold being heavier, sunk to the bottom, and remained behind. Among other facts which Mr Taylor communicated to us, and which he observed during the progress of these operations he found, that the gold was always most abundant near the top of the lead veins which traverse that country. He was so satisfied of this fact, that he could tell, merely by the quantity of gold increasing, when they approached to a vein; and on the other hand the quantity diminishing as they receded from the vein. This fact shows that there is some connection between metallic veins and the formation or deposition of gold.\n\nGold is still found in the soil of that country; but whether the quantity be less than formerly, or the expense of collecting it, from the difference in the price of labour, greater, the produce is by no means equal to the expenses, and therefore searching for gold is now only the employment of the leisure hours of some of the miners.\nThe whole extent of the continent of Asia furnishes gold, in greater or smaller quantity. Gold is found in several of the mines of Siberia, and particularly in that of Bercof, which yields auriferous pyrites partially decomposed, and disseminated in a vein of quartz. In the southern parts of Asia, many mines, and particularly the sands of the rivers, contain gold. The Pactolus, a small river of Lydia, was celebrated in antiquity for the quantity of gold which it yielded, and it was supposed to be the source of the riches of Croesus.\n\nJapan, Formosa, Ceylon, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, the Philippines, and other islands of the Indian Archipelago, are supposed to be rich in gold at this day.\n\nThe greatest quantity of gold which the ancients possessed, before what was obtained from Spain, was brought from Africa. The gold of Africa, which still forms an important article of commerce, is always in the state of gold dust; a circumstance which shows that it is chiefly extracted from alluvial soil by washing. Little gold is found in the northern parts of Africa; three or four places are remarkable for the quantity of gold which they yield. The first is that part of the country between Darfour and Abyssinia. The gold collected there is brought by the Negroes for sale in quills of the ostrich and of the vulture. It would appear that this country was known to the ancients, who regarded Ethiopia as a country rich in gold; and Herodotus mentions that the king of that country exhibited to the ambassadors of Cambyses, all the prisoners bound with chains of gold.\n\nThe second great source of gold dust in Africa is to the south of the great desert Zara, in the western part of that country. The gold is collected in that extensive flat which stretches along the foot of the lofty mountains, among which the rivers Senegal, Gambia, and Niger, have their origin. Gold is found in the sands of all these rivers. Bambouk, which lies to the north-west of these mountains, supplies the greatest part of the gold which is sold on the western coast of Africa; at Morocco, Fez, and Algiers, as well as that which is brought to Cairo and Alexandria in Egypt.\n\nA third region of Africa where gold is abundant, is on the south-east coast, opposite to Madagascar; and it is said that the gold brought from Ophir, in the time of Solomon, was from that part of Africa.\n\nAmerica is the richest country of the world, in modern times, in this precious metal. There it is collected in the alluvial soil, and in the beds of rivers, and sometimes, but more rarely, in veins. In Mexico, gold is chiefly found in the numerous silver veins of that country. All the rivers in the province of the Caracas, about 10° north of the equator, furnish gold. In the Spanish part of America, Chili furnishes gold from the alluvial soil, as well as the province of Choco, where it is more abundant; while that of Peru is obtained from veins of quartz, marked with ferruginous spots.\n\nBut the greatest quantity of gold of commerce comes from Brazil, where it is collected in the alluvial soil, and in the sand of rivers, and extracted by washing. Gold is found almost everywhere in that country, at the foot of the immense chain of mountains which is nearly parallel with the coast, and which stretches from the 5° to the 30° of S. Lat.\n\n### III. Genus. MERCURY.\n\n#### 1. Species. NATIVE MERCURY.\n\n**Mercury**, Kirw. ii. 223. **Mercure Natif**, Broch. ii. 241. Id. Hauy, iii. 423.\n\n**Effem.

Sp. gr. 13.568 to 13.81.\n\n**Chem. Char.**—Volatile before the blow-pipe, without diffusing any perceptible odour.\n\nNative mercury is understood to be pure, and having all the properties of that metal; but it is sometimes amalgamated with a little silver, which destroys its fluidity in a slight degree, and renders it somewhat viscous.\n\n**Localities, &c.**—Native mercury is usually found along with the other ores of that metal, as at Idria, in Friuli, and at Almaden in Spain; but the great proportion of the mercury of commerce is obtained by distillation from native cinnabar. There is also, it is said, a rich mine of native mercury near Guaneca Velica in Peru.\n\n**Uses.**—For many purposes mercury is one of the most important of metallic substances. It is extensively employed in metallurgy, in extracting gold and silver from their ores, by the process to be afterwards described, called amalgamation. The uses of mercury in gilding, in silvering the backs of mirrors, and in medicine, are well known.\n\n#### 2. Species.

It is found chiefly at Rosenau in Hungary, in Moersfeld, and Mochlandberg, in the duchy of Deux Ponts, and at Sahlberg in Sweden. It is usually found in a yellowish or reddish ferruginous clay, and accompanied by other ores of mercury.\n\n3. Species. CORNEOUS ORE OF MERCURY.\n\nMercury mineralized by the vivriolic and marine acids, Kirw. ii. 229. La Mine de Mercure corneé, Broch. ii. 101. Mercure muriaté, Hauy, iii. 447.\n\nExter. Char.—Colour pearl gray, volatilized by the blow-pipe.\n\nExter. Char.—Rarely found massive or disseminated, but usually in thin crusts, or in small globules, composed of an assemblage of small crystals, which are either perfect cubes, or fixed prisms, terminated by a four-sided pyramid; a fixed prism bevelled at the extremity; or an eight-sided prism with four broad and four narrow alternating faces.

It was discovered in the mercury mines of the duchy of Deux Ponts by Woulfe, and has been since found at Almaden in Spain, and at Horowitz in Bohemia. The repository is in the cavities of a ferruginous clay, which is mixed with malachite and gray copper ore.\n\n4. Species. LIVER OR HEPATIC ORE OF MERCURY.\n\nMine de Mercure hépatique, Broch. ii. 104. Hepatic mercurial ore, Kirw. ii. 224.

It is found also, along with other ores of mercury, in Spain and Siberia.\n\nLiver ore of mercury consists of cinnabar, or the sulphuret of mercury, mixed with a portion of indurated bituminous clay. At Idria it is called branderz, or coaly earth, on account of the predominance of the bitumen.\n\n5. Species. CINNABAR.\n\nThis species is also divided into two subspecies, common and fibrous.\n\nSubspecies 1. COMMON CINNABAR.\n\nLe Cinnabre Commun, Broch. ii. 107. Dark Red Cinnabar, Kirw. ii. 223.

Forms of the crystals are, a double four-sided pyramid with truncated summits; a cube having its opposite diagonal angles truncated; a rhomboidal prism; a three-sided prism terminated by a three-sided pyramid, which also is truncated. The crystals which are usually small, are confusedly grouped together; surface of the rhomboidal prism transversely streaked, of the others smooth; external lustre shining or resplendent; internal the same, or only glimmering, vitreous, or adamantine; fracture foliated, uneven, or rarely splintery; fragments sharp-edged.\n\nColour cochineal red, carmine red, and in some varieties lead-gray; opaque, rarely translucent at the edges; crystals translucent, or semitransparent; streak shining, scarlet red; tender, and easily frangible. Spec. grav. 6.902 to 7.86.\n\nChem. Char.—Before the blow-pipe, common cinnabar is entirely volatilized with a blue flame, and a fulphureous odour.\n\n| Constituent Parts | Lampadius |\n|------------------|----------|\n| Mercury          | 81       |\n| Sulphur          | 15       |\n| Iron             | 4        |\n\nLocalities, &c.—This is the most common ore of mercury, and may be considered as the gangue or matrix of the other ores. Found not only in primitive mountains, where it forms beds in clay and chlorite slate, but also in stratiform mountains, and even in alluvial rocks. The mines of Almaden in Spain, of Idria in Friuli, and those of the duchy of Deux Ponts, have furnished the greatest quantity of common cinnabar. It is also found in Bohemia, Saxony, and Hungary, and in small quantity in France.\n\nSubspecies 2. FIBROUS CINNABAR.\n\nLe Cinnabre d'un Rouge vif, Brochant, ii. 111. Bright red Cinnabar, Kirwan, ii. 229. Mercure sulfuré fibreux, Hauy, iii. 445.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive, disseminated, or superficial,\nMetallic ficial; lustre glimmering, silky, often also entirely dull; fracture fine grained earthy, or fibrous; fragments blunt-edged.\n\nColour bright scarlet red, sometimes crimson or aurora red; opaque; streak thinning scarlet red; stains very tender or friable, and very easily frangible.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This variety is very rare in a state of purity. According to Haüy, most of the specimens owe their texture to an admixture of radiated sulphuret of iron. It has been found chiefly at Wolfstein in the Palatinate, where it is accompanied by brown iron ore and hematites.\n\nUses.—Cinnabar is dug out chiefly for the purpose of extracting the metallic mercury. It is employed also as a colouring matter in painting; but the cinnabar used for this purpose is chiefly artificial.\n\nSome other varieties of cinnabar, or sulphuret of mercury, have been noticed by mineralogists, as a native ethiops mineral. This is of a black colour, a loose concretion, and it stains the fingers. It appears to be some bituminous substance penetrated with cinnabar. It is found at Idria.\n\nAlkaline cinnabar of De Born is found at the same place; is of a bright red colour, foliated fracture, with rhomboidal fragments; and supposed to be cinnabar penetrated with an alkaline sulphuret, the odour of which it gives out by friction. Another variety of cinnabar, usually called native vermilion, is in the form of powder. This substance is very rare, but is also sometimes found at Idria.\n\nIV. SILVER Genus.\n\n1. Species. NATIVE SILVER.\n\nId. Kirwan, ii. 108. Id. Brochant, ii. 114. Id. Haüy, iii. 384.\n\nThis is divided into two subspecies, common and auriferous.\n\nSubspecies 1. COMMON NATIVE SILVER.\n\nExter. Char.—Common native silver is usually found disseminated or superficial, under different imitative forms, as dendritic, filiform, capillary, dendritic, reticulated, veined, or in thin plates; and sometimes crystallized, in cubes, octahedrons, rectangular four-sided prisms, double six-sided pyramids with truncated extremities, double three-sided pyramids with truncated angles, and hollow four-sided pyramids. The crystals are small and grouped together in rows, or dendritical, or reticulated; surface smooth; that of the plates druffy, that of dendritic, filiform, and capillary silver; longitudinally streaked; external lustre glimmering or resplendent; internal always glimmering, metallic; fracture hackly; fragments rather sharp-edged.\n\nColour silvery white, but sometimes on the surface yellowish-brown, or grayish black; opaque; soft; perfectly ductile; flexible, but not elastic; streak thinning, metallic. Spec. grav. 10 to 10.47.\n\nChem. Char.—Native silver is soluble in nitric acid, and may be precipitated by muriatic acid, the muriate of silver being insoluble; or by immersing a plate of copper in the solution of nitrate of silver, the silver is reduced, and appears in the metallic state.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Native silver is not uncommon in most of the mines which furnish the other ores of that metal. The accompanying substances are usually heavy spar, quartz, calcareous spar, fluor spar, pyrites, blende, cobalt, and galena. Native silver is very abundant in Mexico and Peru, and it is also not uncommon in Siberia, in Germany, France, and was lately discovered in the Herland mine in Cornwall.\n\nSubspecies 2. AURIFEROUS SILVER.\n\nExter. Char.—This variety is rarely found massive, but is usually disseminated in small particles, or superficial, or reticulated, or in thin plates; lustre shining or resplendent; fracture hackly.\n\nColour between silver white and brass yellow, sometimes approaching to gold yellow; it is soft, perfectly ductile; flexible without being elastic, and its specific gravity is greater than common native silver in proportion to the quantity of gold with which it is alloyed.\n\nConstituent Parts.—Auriferous silver is a compound of silver alloyed with gold, the latter sometimes in very considerable proportion.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This mineral is very rare. It is found at Konigsberg in Norway, disseminated in massive calcareous spar, fluor spar, and rock crystal, accompanied by blende, galena, and pyrites, in a vein which traverses a rock of slaty hornblende. It is also found in Siberia, in granular heavy spar accompanied by vitreous silver ore, vitreous copper ore, and pyrites.\n\n2. Species. ANTIMONIAL SILVER ORE.\n\nArgent Antimonial, Brochant, ii. 119. Id. Haüy, iii. 391. Antimoniated Native Silver, Kirwan, ii. 110.\n\nExter. Char.—Colour silvery white; brittle.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive or disseminated, kidney-form, or crystallized in four-sided oblique prisms, in six-sided prisms, sometimes with the lateral edges truncated, in six-sided tables, and in cubes, having some of the angles truncated. Surface of the crystals longitudinally streaked; lustre weakly shining, or only glimmering; internal lustre shining or resplendent; fracture foliated.\n\nColour silvery white, sometimes a superficial colour between yellow, black, and gray, or the colour of tempered steel; streak shining; semihard. Spec. grav. 9.44.\n\nChem. Char.—Before the blow-pipe it is easily reduced; the antimony is driven off and gives out its peculiar odour, while the pure silver remains behind incrustated with a brown flag, which communicates to borax a green colour.\n\nWhen antimonial silver is dissolved in nitric acid, a whitish crust, which is the oxide of antimony, soon appears on the surface.\n\nThis mineral, as its name imports, is an alloy of silver and antimony, in which sometimes a small portion of iron is observed. The proportions of the two metals seem to be very variable.\nConstituent Parts.\n\n| Klaproth | Vauquelin |\n|----------|-----------|\n| Silver   | 76        |\n| Antimony | 24        |\n|          | 100       |\n\nLocalities, &c.—This ore of silver is accompanied by calcareous spar, heavy spar, native silver, galena, and quartz, in a vein near the duchy of Furttenberg in Swabia. It has also been found in carbonate of lime and heavy spar near Guadalcanal in Spain.\n\n3. Species. Arsenical Silver Ore.\n\nId. Kirw. ii. iii. Argent Antimonial Arsenifere, et ferrifere, Haüy, iii. 398.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive or disseminated, kidney-form or globular, and also crystallized in perfect six-sided prisms; in similar prisms a little flattened, and having the lateral edges rounded; and in acute six-sided pyramids with truncated summits. Luster weakly shining, sometimes shining; internal luster shining or resplendent; fracture foliated; fragments sharp-edged.\n\nColour tin-white, or lead gray, but exposed to the air yellowish, or steel gray; streak shining; soft; brittle.\n\nChem. Char.—Before the blow-pipe the arsenic is driven off in fumes, diffusing the smell of garlic; there remains behind an impure globule of silver.\n\nConstituent Parts.\n\n| Klaproth |\n|----------|\n| Silver   | 12.75   |\n| Arsenic  | 35      |\n| Iron     | 44.25   |\n| Antimony | 4       |\n| Loes     | 4       |\n|          | 100.00  |\n\nLocalities, &c.—This is a rare mineral, which has been found at Andreaeburg in the Hartz, accompanied by native arsenic, red silver ore, galena, brown blende, and calcareous spar.\n\n4. Species. Corneous Silver Ore.\n\nId. Kirwan. ii. 113. La Mine Corné, Broch. ii. 127. Argent Muriate, Haüy, iii. 418.\n\nEfflo. Char.—The colour of horn; fusible like wax.\n\nExter. Char.—Rarely found massive; sometimes disseminated in globular pieces, often in superficial layers, and very often crystallized. The forms are, the perfect cube, capillary or needle-formed crystals; the crystals are always small, and commonly grouped together. Surface smooth, shining or weakly shining; internal luster the same; refractive; fracture uneven, or flat conchoideal; fragments blunt-edged.\n\nColour light pearl gray, violet blue, or lead gray; becomes brown or blackish in the air; translucent; sometimes only at the edges; very soft; receives the impression of the nail; ductile, and in thin plates, flexible. Spec. grav. 4.748 to 4.804.\n\nChem. Char.—Corneous silver ore melts very easily before the blow-pipe, giving out a disagreeable smell, and the globule of silver remains.\n\nConstituent Parts.\n\n| Klaproth |\n|----------|\n| Silver   | 67.75   |\n| Muriatic acid | 21     |\n| Sulphuric acid | .25    |\n| Oxide of iron | 6      |\n| Alumina  | 1.75    |\n| Lime     | .25     |\n| Loes     | 3       |\n|          | 100.00  |\n\nLocalities, &c.—Muriate of silver is always found at the upper part of the vein, and it is said that it sometimes accompanies organized substances. Leaves of native silver have been found attached to petrifications, at Frankenberg in Hesse; it is supposed that this metallic silver is the result of the decomposition of the muriate of silver. Corneous silver ore is almost always accompanied by vitreous silver, footy silver, brown iron ore; more rarely by native silver, red silver, galena, quartz, and heavy spar. It is found in Peru and Mexico, in the mines of Freyberg in Saxony, at Allemont in France, and in Siberia.\n\nAnother variety of muriate of silver has been described by some mineralogists under the name of earthy corneous silver ore; or, according to the fanciful German name, butter-milk earth. This variety has an earthy fracture, owing to a portion of alumina which is combined with it. It is almost friable; the lustre of the streak is resinous, and it feels somewhat greasy.\n\nChem. Char.—Before the blow-pipe it is slightly agglutinated without melting, and small globules of silver exude from the mass.\n\nConstituent Parts.\n\n| Klaproth |\n|----------|\n| Silver   | 25      |\n| Muriatic acid | 8     |\n| Alumina  | 67      |\n| With a trace of copper | —     |\n|          | 100     |\n\nThis variety is found at Andreaeburg in the Hartz. Another variety has been described under the name of alkaline silver ore, which is nothing more than the muriate of silver combined with carbonate of lime.\n\n5. Species. Sooty Silver Ore.\n\nId. Kirw. ii. 117. L'Argent Noir, Broch. ii. 132.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive or disseminated, perforated or corroded; in superficial layers upon other minerals, or in rounded pieces, covered by muriate of silver; consistence intermediate between solid and friable; dull; fracture fine grained earthy; fragments blunt-edged.\n\nColour bluish black, or blackish gray; streak shining, metallic; stains a little; easily frangible.\n\nChem. Char.—Melts easily before the blow-pipe into a flaky mass, which, by continuing the heat, is partially volatilized, and the globule of silver remains.\nIts constituent parts are still unknown; as it is usually accompanied by vitreous, corneous, and some other silver ores, it is supposed to be a mixture of those ores in different proportions.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Found in Saxony, in France, and in Hungary.\n\n6. Species. Vitreous Silver Ore.\n\nSulphurated Silver Ore, Kirw. ii. 115. L'Argent Vitreux, Brochant, ii. 134. Argent Sulphure, Hauy, iii. 398.\n\nExter. Char.—Commonly found massive, disseminated, or superficial; sometimes dendritic, filiform, capillary, dendritic, or reticulated, with other forms and impositions. It is also crystallized in cubes, which are either perfect or truncated on the angles or edges; in octahedrons, which are either perfect, or truncated on the angles; in flat, double, three-sided pyramids, the edges of the one corresponding to the faces of the other; in rectangular four-sided prisms, terminated by a four-sided pyramid; in equiangular six-sided prisms, terminated at the two extremities by a three-sided pyramid; corresponding alternately to three of the lateral edges, forming the garnet dodecahedron, of which all the lateral edges are sometimes slightly truncated; in broad and flat six-sided prisms bevelled at the extremity, and having the angles at the acute lateral edges truncated. The crystals are commonly small, and grouped together in rows, or in knots, like the steps of a stair; the cube and the octahedron are the most common, and the cube is sometimes hollow. The surface of the crystal is usually smooth, sometimes rough or drusy; lustre between shining and weakly glimmering; internal lustre shining, metallic; fracture conchoidal, sometimes foliated; fragments blunt-edged.\n\nColour dark lead-grey, steel grey, or blackish grey, varying by exposure to the air; streak shining; soft; ductile; may be cut with a knife; flexible without being elastic. Spec. grav. 6.009 to 7.215.\n\nChem. Char.—Before the blow-pipe it melts with difficulty; sulphur, antimony, and arsenic, are partially driven off, and there remains a button of metallic silver, which is not very ductile, accompanied by a brown flag.\n\nConstituent Parts. Klaproth.\n\n| Constituent Parts | Klaproth |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| Silver            | 66.5     |\n| Sulphur           | 12.      |\n| Antimony          | 10.      |\n| Iron              | 5.       |\n| Copper and arsenic| 5        |\n| Earthy matters    | 1.       |\n| Losses            | 5.       |\n\nLocalities, &c.—This is one of the richest silver ores; and it is usually accompanied by red silver ore, vitreous silver ore, some other metallic ores, and various earthy spars. It is pretty common in Saxony and Hungary, but less abundant than vitreous silver ore. It is also occasionally met with in most other silver mines.\n\n8. Species. Red Silver Ore.\n\nId. Kirw. ii. \"122. Id. Broch. ii. 143. Argent Antimonie Sulphure, Hauy, iii. 402.\n\nThis is divided into two subspecies; dark red, and bright red silver ore.\n\nSubspecies 1. Dark Red Silver Ore.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive or disseminated, superficial, dendritical, or crystallized in equiangular six-sided prism, which is either terminated by a three-sided pyramid set on the lateral edges, or has its terminal edges truncated, or is terminated by an obtuse six-sided pyramid set on the lateral faces, and having the summit and lateral edges of the pyramid truncated; sometimes the summit of the pyramid is terminated by a second three-sided pyramid, and sometimes the lateral edges of the prism are bevelled. The crystals are small, and variously grouped together, commonly smooth and resplendent, rarely streaked; internal lustre weakly shining, or only glimmering, adamantine, often femimetallic; fracture usually uneven, sometimes conchoidal; fragments rather blunt-edged.\n\nColour between cochineal red and lead grey, and sometimes iron black; crystals translucent; in masses opaque; streak but weakly shining, between cochineal red.\nred and crimson red; soft; brittle, and easily frangible. Spec. grav. 5.56 to 5.58.\n\nChem. Char.—Before the blow-pipe it derrupitates and flies off before becoming red, and then melts with frothing up; part is volatilized and sublimes in the form of a yellowish white powder, and leaves a button of metallic silver.\n\nIts constituent parts are supposed to be nearly the same as the following.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Found in almost all silver mines, and is usually accompanied by other silver ores, as well as different metallic ores.\n\nSubspecies 2. Bright Red Silver Ore.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive, disseminated, or superficial, and very often crystallized. The forms of its crystals resemble some of those of the former, or are simple six-sided pyramids, or acute six-sided pyramids, having the lateral angles alternately acute and obtuse, with the summit surmounted by a three-sided pyramid placed on the obtuse edges of the first; or surmounted by a six-sided pyramid set on the lateral faces. The crystals are sometimes acicular, and are combined together in a fibrous or reticulated form. Surface of the crystals sometimes smooth, sometimes drusy; streaked longitudinally, but the pyramids are streaked transversely or obliquely; lustre resplendent or shining; internal lustre thinning or weakly thinning and adamantine; fracture conchoidal, or fine grained uneven; fragments rather blunt-edged.\n\nColour blood-red, or light cochineal red, sometimes bluish on the surface; crystals semitransparent; in masses translucent, often opaque; streak aurora red; soft, easily frangible. Spec. grav. 5.44 to 5.59.\n\nChem. Char.—Melts before the blow-pipe; blackens, and burns with a bluish flame, giving out white fumes with the odour of garlic. A button of nearly pure silver remains behind.\n\nConstituent Parts.\n\n|                | Kluproth. | Vanquelina. |\n|----------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Silver         | 62        | 56.67       |\n| Antimony       | 18.5      | 16.13       |\n| Sulphur        | 11        | 15.07       |\n| Sulphuric acid and water | 8.5 | -           |\n| Oxygen         | -         | 12.13       |\n\nThe garlic smell, which was formerly supposed to be owing to arsenic, arises from the antimony, which is volatilized by the action of the blow-pipe; although, according to Proust, there are ores of red silver which contain sometimes arsenic and sometimes antimony separately, and sometimes the two metals combined. The red colour of this ore is by Thenard ascribed to the antimony in the state of purple oxide.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Red silver ore is usually accompanied by native arsenic, other ores of silver, as well as other metallic ores; and it is found in Bohemia, Saxony, France, Spain, and Hungary.\n\n9. Species. White Silver Ore.\n\nId. Broch. ii. 150. Light Gray Silver Ore, Kirw. ii. 119.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive and disseminated; lustre strongly glimmering; fracture even; fragments blunt-edged.\n\nColour bright lead-gray, or steel-gray; soft; streak shining. Spec. grav. 5.322.\n\nConstituent Parts.—According to some, this mineral is composed of silver, antimony, and sulphur; but according to others, minerals which have been reckoned white silver ores, contain a very considerable proportion of lead, and therefore ought to be arranged among the ores of that metal. Such are the following analyses by Kluproth.\n\n|                | Light coloured. | Dark coloured. |\n|----------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Silver         | 20.40           | 9.25           |\n| Lead           | 48.06           | 41.             |\n| Antimony       | 7.88            | 21.5            |\n| Iron           | 2.25            | 1.75            |\n| Sulphur        | 12.25           | 2.2             |\n| Alumina        | 7               | 1.75            |\n| Silica         | .25             | -              |\n| Lofs           | 1.91            | 2.25            |\n\nLocalities, &c.—The real white silver ore has been chiefly found in the mine of Himelfurth, near Freyberg in Saxony, in a gangue of quartz, and accompanied by galena, red silver, and blende.\n\n10. Species. Black Silver Ore.\n\nExter. Char.—This ore of silver is of a cellular texture; the streak is shining and metallic; it is brittle, and of a black colour; but it can only be known to be a silver ore by obtaining globules of silver under the blow-pipe. It is usually accompanied by vitreous red silver ores. It is supposed that it is some of the other species of silver ores that may have undergone some change from chemical agents. The silver it contains is in very variable proportions.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Found in some of the silver mines at Freyberg in Saxony, and Allemont in France. It is common in Peru and Mexico, and it is called by the Spaniards, negrillo.\n\nBesides the silver ores already described, other species have been mentioned by mineralogists, the existence of which has not been distinctly ascertained; as the carbonate of silver of Widenmann and Kirwan, composed of 72.5 parts of silver, 12 of carbonic acid, and 15.5 of carbonate of antimony and oxide of copper *; the reddish and greenish black silver ore, also described by Kirwan, which is supposed to be a mixture of native and sulphurated silver †. Light lamellar silver ore ‡, † ibid. 125, composed of alumina, sulphuret of silver, oxide of iron ‡ ibid. 116, and manganese.\n\nV. Copper Genus.\n\n1. Species. Native Copper.\n\nId. Kirw. ii. 128.

Spec. grav. 7.72 to 8.58.\n\nChem. Char.—Copper immersed for some time in a solution of ammonia, or volatile alkali, changes it to a beautiful blue colour.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Native copper is not a very rare mineral; it is found in many copper mines accompanied by the other ores of copper, as in the copper mines of Siberia, Saxony, Hungary, Sweden, and Cornwall in England.\n\n2. Species. Vitreous Copper Ore.\n\nId. Kirw. ii. 144. Id. Broch. ii. 162. Cuivre Sulfure, Haüy, iii. 531.\n\nThis is divided into two subspecies; compact and foliated.\n\nSubspecies 1. Compact Vitreous Copper Ore.\n\nExter.

Spec. grav. 4.08 to 4.3.\n\nChem. Char.—Before the blow-pipe it decrepitates; gives out a sulphurous odour; fuses into a black globule, and the heat being continued, metallic copper appears. Borax heated with it acquires a green colour.\nThis ore of copper is composed of sulphur, copper and iron in variable proportions, and sometimes also a small admixture of gold or silver.\n\nLocalities, &c.—This is a very common copper ore. It is equally found in primitive and stratiform mountains, either in veins or in beds, and sometimes in great abundance; in Saxony, Hungary, Sweden, France, and England.\n\n5. Species.

Species. Black Copper Ore.\n\nId. Kirwan, ii. 143. Id. Brochant, ii. 180.\n\nExter. Char.—Found in the state of powder, with a dull appearance, and little coherence, sometimes incrusting other ores of copper; usually friable; stains; feels meagre.\n\nColour brownish black, sometimes deep brown.\n\nChem. Char.—Gives out before the blow-pipe a fulphurous smell, and melts with borax into a greenish flag.\n\nIt is supposed to arise from the decomposition of vitreous copper ore and copper pyrites, and contains sometimes from 40 to 50 per cent. of copper.\n\n8.

Crystals small, usually aggregated; surface smooth, shining; internally thinning, or weakly shining, between metallic and adamantine; fracture imperfectly foliated; fragments rather sharp edged.\n\nColour similar to the former; opaque, translucent at the edges; crystals semi-transparent.\n\nSubspecies 3. Capillary Red Copper Ore.\n\nFibrous Red Copper Ore, Kirwan, ii. 137. Le Cuivre Oxidé Rouge Capillaire, Brochant, ii. 184.\n\nExter. Char.—Found in small capillary crystals, which are disseminated in small bundles, or sometimes form a superficial incrustation; lustre shining and adamantine.\n\nColour carmine red, cochineal or scarlet red; crystals translucent.\n\nChem. Char.—Red copper ore is easily reduced before the blow-pipe without any odour; entirely soluble in muriatic acid without effervescence, but effervesces in nitric acid; by which means it may be distinguished from cinnabar, which is insoluble, and from red silver ore, which diffuses with effervescence.\n\nThe constituent parts of red copper ore are supposed to be copper and oxygen, and not a carbonate of copper, as was formerly conjectured.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Red copper ore is found in various places accompanying the other ores of the same metal, and\nand particularly native copper. The crystallized varieties are rare.\n\n9. Species. Brick-red Copper Ore.\n\nId. Kirwan, ii. 127. Id.

It is found in Bohemia, Norway, Siberia, and in the different mines of lead and copper in Britain.\n\nThe earthy variety is found in superficial layers on a clayey marl in Hesse, and it is also found superficial on sandstone in Thuringia. Sometimes the whole of the sandstone is impregnated with this earthy carbonate of copper, there called copper sand earth, or copper sandstone. A similar sandstone, at Gourock near Greenock in Scotland, was a few years ago dug out for the purpose of extracting copper.\n\n12. Species. Malachite.\n\nId. Kirwan, ii. 131. Id. Brochant, ii. 197.\n\nThis species is divided into two subspecies, fibrous and compact.\n\nSubspecies\nSubspecies 1. Fibrous Malachite.\n\nCuivre Carbonaté Vert Soyeux. Hauy, iii. 573.\n\nExter.

They are found in Germany, but the finest specimens are brought from Siberia. Scotland affords fibrous malachite in small quantity, as at Leadhills and in Shetland. Malachite is also met with in Cornwall and Derbyshire in England.\n\nUses.—Malachite, when pure, is sometimes employed as a pigment. The compact variety is susceptible of a fine polish; which, with its beautiful and delicate colours, has brought it into much estimation for various ornamental purposes.\n\nThe largest and finest specimen of compact malachite known, is in the cabinet of Dr Guthrie at Peterburgh. It is 32 inches long, 17 broad, and two inches thick. It is estimated, according to the account of Patrin, who describes it, at 20,000 francs, above 800l. sterling. If we are rightly informed, this splendid mass of malachite was once offered to sale in Britain, but, having found no purchaser, was carried back to Russia.\n\n13. Species. Green Copper Ore.\n\nMountain Green, Kirw. ii. 134. Id. Broch. ii. 203.\n\nExter.

Spec. grav. 2.88.\n\nChem. Char.—The crystals of these varieties decrepitate before the blow-pipe, and give out the odour of arsenic.

The copper mines of Spain are situated on the frontiers of Portugal, and yield from veins of considerable thickness, yellow pyrites. France possesses copper mines in the Pyrenees, near Lyons, in Volges, and in the neighborhood of Savoy, in the department of Mont Blanc. There are extensive copper mines in Piedmont, which have been wrought to a very considerable depth.\n\nThe copper mines of Cornwall in England, which are in primitive rocks, have been long celebrated. The most abundant ores are copper pyrites, accompanied by native copper, which latter, it is observed, is most usually found near the surface. The same mines yield all the varieties of arseniate of copper. The Aston copper mines on the borders of the counties of Derby and Stafford are situated in limestone, in very declining or nearly perpendicular beds; but the richest copper mines in England are those of the island of Anglesea, where is a mass of pyritous copper ore of immense thickness, yielding from 16 to 40 per cent. of copper. Native copper is also found near the surface, and immediately under the turf.\nThe mines of Cronebane, in the county of Wicklow in Ireland, are very considerable. They are situated in a primitive mountain, composed of flinty slate and argillaceous schilus, which alternate with beds of steatites.\n\nIn Germany, Hungary, Sweden, Norway, and Siberia, there are many extensive and valuable copper mines. In the eastern parts of the Asiatic continent, in the island of Japan, in China, and in some of the islands of the Indian ocean, rich copper ores are abundant.\n\nAfrica, in various places of that extensive region, abounds with ores of copper, as in the mountains to the north of the Cape of Good Hope. On the western coast of Africa, the natives dig out copper ore, and are acquainted with the mode of extracting it.\n\nIn North America masses of native copper have been found, near Hudson's Bay; but the richest copper mines in the world are those of South America, and particularly in Chili, from which masses of native copper of immense magnitude have been obtained. The copper mines of Peru and Mexico are also wrought to great advantage.\n\nVI. IRON Genus.\n\n1. Species. NATIVE IRON.\n\nId. Kirw. ii. 156. Id. Brochant, ii. 215. Id. Hatty, iv. i.\n\nExter. Char.—Found massive or branched; surface smooth, shining; internal lustre shining, metallic; fracture hackly; fragments rather sharp-edged.\n\nColour light steel gray, or silvery white; semi-hard; streak shining; perfectly ductile; flexible; but not elastic.\n\nLocalities, &c.—The existence of native iron as a terrestrial production still remains doubtful. It is said that it has been found along with other ores of iron, in Saxony and in France. The only instances fully established of the discovery of native iron, are those of the immense mass found by Pallas in Siberia, which amounted to no less than 1680lb, or 13 cwt. and another of 3 cwt., which was discovered by Rubin de Celis in South America; but these masses correspond so nearly with the substances which are certainly known to have fallen from the atmosphere, in their constituent parts, that it seems extremely probable they have had a similar origin. But for a full account of this curious subject, see METEOROLITE.\n\n2. Species. IRON PYRITES.\n\nMartial Pyrites, Kirwan. ii. 76. Id. Brochant, ii. 221. Fer sulfure, Hatty, iv. 65.\n\nSubspecies 1.

Hitchett.\n\n| Sulphur | 52.15 |\n|---------|-------|\n| Iron    | 47.85 |\n\nSome varieties of common iron pyrites contain a mixture of gold, which is supposed to be accidental, as the external characters are not affected by it, and it is only recognized by chemical analysis. These varieties are called auriferous pyrites.\n\nSubspecies 2. RADIATED IRON PYRITES.\n\nExter.

It is found in Saxony and Bohemia, in Derbyshire.\nThis variety is more subject than the first to decomposition.\n\nCapillary pyrites is only found in small quantity, as in Saxony, and Andreasberg in the Hartz.\n\nHepatic pyrites is only found in veins, particularly those of silver and lead, accompanied with quartz, calcareous spar, and heavy spar, as in Germany and Siberia, and at Wanlockhead in Scotland.\n\nExposed to the air, this variety is extremely liable to decomposition.\n\n3.

Char.—Massive or disseminated; internal lustre shining or weakly thinning; fracture uneven, rarely conchoidal; fragments rather sharp-edged.\n\nColour between copper red and bronze yellow; when exposed to the air it becomes brownish or tarnished; hard, or semifluid; brittle. Spec. grav. 4.51.\n\nPhys. Char.—This variety of pyrites acts on them magnetic needle, but not very powerfully.\n\nChem. Char.—Before the blow-pipe it gives out a slight odour of sulphur, and melts easily into a grayish black globule, which is attracted by the magnet.\n\nConstituent Parts. Hatchett.\n\n| Iron | 63.5 |\n| Sulphur | 36.5 |\n\nLocality, &c.—Magnetic pyrites has been only found in primitive rocks, as in micaceous schistus; and is usually disposed in beds, along with other ores of iron, and accompanied by quartz, hornblende, and garnets. It is found in Saxony, Bavaria, Bohemia, and in Caernarvonshire in Wales.\n\nUses.—This, as well as the former species, is employed for the purpose of extracting sulphur, or of manufacturing copperas, or sulphate of iron.\n\n4. Species. MAGNETIC IRON ORE.\n\nMagnetic Ironstone, Kirwan, ii. 158. Id. Brochant, ii. 235. Fer Oxidulé, Hätiy, iv. 10.\n\nThis is divided into two subspecies, common and arenaceous.\n\nSubspecies 1. COMMON MAGNETIC IRON ORE.\n\nExter. Char.—Massive or disseminated, and often also crystallized in six-sided prisms, having a three-sided pyramid at each extremity, set on three alternate lateral edges; an oblique four-sided prism; a double four-sided pyramid, or perfect octahedron, which is sometimes truncated on all its edges. Crystals of various sizes; faces sometimes smooth; those of the four-sided prism streaked transversely; lustre shining; internal lustre resplendent, or weakly glimmering; fracture uneven, sometimes conchoidal or foliated; fragments rather blunt-edged.\n\nColour iron-black, perfect black, or steel-gray; streak brownish black; semifluid, or hard; brittle; more or less easily flangible. Spec. grav. 4.2 to 4.93.\n\nSubspecies 2. ARENAEUS MAGNETIC IRON ORE.\n\nExter. Char.—Found in rounded grains, from the size of millet to that of a nut, and sometimes in small octahedral crystals; external surface rough or weakly glimmering; internal shining or resplendent; fracture conchoidal; fragments sharp-edged.\n\nColour deep iron-black, sometimes ash gray.\n\nPhys. Char.—Magnetic iron ore, as the name imports, strongly attracts the magnetic needle, and iron filings; to the compact varieties of this ore, in which this property was first discovered, the name of natural magnet is given.\n\nChem. Char.—Magnetic iron ore becomes brown before the blow-pipe, and colours borax dark green.\n\nConstituent Parts.—This is supposed to be an oxide of iron in considerable purity, as it yields from 80 to 90 per cent of metallic iron.\n\nLocalities, &c.—Common magnetic iron ore is very common in primitive mountains, particularly in those of gneiss and micaceous schistus, where it forms very powerful beds, and even entire mountains. It is disseminated in crystals in chlorite schistus, as in Corfica, and in basalt and greenstone, at Taberg in Sweden. Found in Saxony, Bohemia, and Italy, and particularly in the island of Elba in the Mediterranean; and indeed is very universally distributed over every part of the globe.\n\nThe second variety, or magnetic sand, is found in the beds of rivers, in a loose state, and sometimes imbedded in basalt and wacken. It is found in those countries where the other ores of iron abound; and also in the sand of many of the rivers within the torrid zone, as in Jamaica, St Domingo, &c.\n\nUses.—Magnetic iron is wrought for the purpose of obtaining metallic iron. Most of the Swedish iron ores belong to this variety, and furnish the iron which is so celebrated on account of its superior qualities, throughout Europe.\n\nMagnetic sand; where it is abundant, is also smelted as an iron ore.\n\n5.

Represents the goniometer or graphometer, an instrument invented by Carangeau for measuring the angles of crystals. MTN is a graduated semicircle of brass or silver, furnished with two arms or rulers AB, FG, one of which, FG, has a slit from a to R, excepting the cross bar at K, which strengthens the instrument. This arm is fixed to a brass ruler at R and c placed behind, and which makes part of the semicircle. The arm FG is connected with the ruler behind by nails which enter the slit and are furnished with nuts. The other arm has also a slit or opening from x to c, where it is fixed to the first by the screw nail which passes through both. By slackening the screws, the two parts c G and c B may be shortened at pleasure. The arm AB being only fixed at c, which is the centre of the circle, moves round this centre, while the arm GF remains constantly fixed in the direction of the diameter which passes through the points o and 180°. The upper part of the arm AB should be brought to a thin edge from x to s, and the line of this edge should pass through the centre c; because it is by this edge that the measure of the angle on the graduated circumference is indicated.\n\nTo discover the measure of any angle of a crystal, the two arms c B, c G are brought into contact with the sides containing the angle, and the degree indicated by the line x s on the circumference denotes the measure of that angle. The instrument is so contrived that the arms may be shortened for the convenience of applying it in different cases. But it might happen that it could not be applied in cases where the crystals are aggregated or attached to the matrix. This difficulty is obviated by another contrivance. The semicircle is furnished with a hinge at 90°, by which means it may be diminished at pleasure to a quadrant, by folding back one half. There is a small bar of steel, one end of which is fixed behind the immovable arm FG, and the other is attached by a notch and screw nail at O. When this nail is unscrewed, the bar c O falls behind the ruler which supports FG, and thus one half of the semicircle folds back, and any angle not exceeding 90° may be measured; but when the angle is greater, it must be replaced.\n\nFig. 2. is an apparatus by which small degrees of electricity...\nelectricity may be observed in minerals. A is a small brass needle with knobs a b, and moveable on the pivot at the middle. The mineral whose electricity is to be tried, is rubbed on silk or woollen, and then presented to one of the knobs; and by the distance at which the knob begins to be attracted, the strength of the electricity may be, in some degree, estimated. In the same way substances which become electric by heat, such as the tourmaline, are to be tried; the same apparatus may be employed. To ascertain in what part of the mineral the different electricities exist, take a stick of sealing wax, at the extremity of which a silk thread has been attached, and having rubbed the wax, bring alternately the opposite extremities of the substance, for example, each of the summits of a tourmaline, within a small distance of the silk thread. If the extremity which is brought near the thread possesses negative electricity, the thread will be repelled; on the contrary, it will be attracted. Or the experiment may be made in another way, particularly when the electrical body is small, or its electricity feeble. At B, fig. 2, the tourmaline t' is held by a pair of pincers in such a way that the pole t is at a small distance from the knob a of the needle. C c is the stick of wax, one of whose extremities is placed on a tube of glass U u, and which acts by its extremity C, on the knob a, to excite it in positive electricity. In this case the wax, after the extremity which has been rubbed is placed in the position described, communicates to the knob of the needle to which it is presented, an electricity contrary to its own; so that the extremity of the tourmaline acted on by positive electricity, repels the needle to which it is presented, and the other extremity, possessing negative electricity, attracts the needle.\n\nFig. 3. is a spirit of wine blow-pipe, nearly on the plan of that invented by Mr Paul. It is made of brass, and consists of the following parts.\n\na Is a hollow oval frame about five inches in its longest dimension, which supports the pillar d and the two lamps b c, which may burn either oil or alcohol, but the latter is the best. The rim e slips upon the pillar d as low as the shoulder of the latter will permit, but the rim may be raised at pleasure and kept fast by the screw-peg f. The rim supports the boiler g which is a single hollow piece of thick brass containing about an ounce of alcohol, and has four openings, viz. three at top h i k, and one at bottom to receive the tube o. This latter is long enough to reach the level of the outside of the top of the boiler, and consequently the alcohol within the boiler cannot readily boil over into the tube, and the opening k which corresponds with it, is closely shut by a screw stopper, hollowed out a little beneath, to allow the free passage of the vapour down the tube. Here the vaporized alcohol is prevented from condensing at the point o by the contiguity of the flame of the lamp b, and as it passes on through the hollow p q into the jet tube r, it is immediately kindled by the flame of the lamp c, and the united flames are compelled sideways with such violence as to form a long pencil of blue flame, attended with a considerable roaring noise. This continues as long as any alcohol is left in the boiler, which allows ample time for most blowpipe operations. The boiler is filled at the opening h. The centre hole i is nicely fitted with a small brass plug kept down by a thin slip of iron l, the other end of which slips over the top of the upright pillar d, and is confined between two flat screw-plates m n. The use of this is as a safety valve to take away all danger of the boiler bursting by the confined vapour not being able to escape fast enough through the jet-pipe r, for when the internal pressure is great, the elasticity of the iron spring l allows the valve i to rise sufficiently to let out part of the enclosed vapour. The screw stoppers h and k are made still tighter by collars of leather, as is the part where the tube o joins the boiler. The jet-pipe r has a complete rotary motion, so that the flame may be impelled in any direction. This is effected by turning in the form of a ball that part of the pipe which is inclosed in the hollow p q.\n\nBut this blow-pipe, although an elegant philosophical apparatus, will not be found to answer where a great degree of heat is required to be kept up for a considerable time. Other contrivances, therefore, of a simpler nature, have been proposed; and perhaps the best of these is the blow-pipe which is used by the mouth. The following is a description of a blow-pipe of this kind.\n\nFig. 4. represents this blow-pipe. a is a brass tube, having a circular enlargement c, for the purpose of condensing the moisture which is blown from the lungs; the smaller end d is moveable round the centre e, so that any degree of obliquity may be given to the flame. Fig. 5. is a separate jet-pipe with a small opening, which is screwed on the blow-pipe at d; and it may be convenient to have two or three jet-pipes of different sizes, according as a larger and more moderate, or a smaller and more intense flame is wanted. b is a piece of ivory which slips on the larger end, for the purpose of being applied to the mouth, as being more agreeable.\n\nThe best kind of flame for blowing through with the common blow-pipe is a wax or tallow candle with a very large wick, which should be kept snuffed moderately low, and the wick turned a little aside from the pipe. A spirit lamp is sometimes used, which makes a perfectly clear flame without smoke, but weak when used in this way. There is a kind of knack in blowing with the mouth, which is not easily described, and requires a little practice to be performed with ease. As the flame must often be kept for several minutes, the act of respiration must be carried on through the nostrils without interruption, and the fires of blowing must be performed merely by compression of the cheeks upon the air in the mouth.\n\nThe substance to be heated is placed either on a piece of charcoal or a metallic support. When the former is used, a large close well-burnt piece of charcoal must be chosen, a small shallow hole scooped out with a knife, and the substance laid upon it. The charcoal itself kindles all round the hole, and the hole is thus gradually enlarged; and the heat too is kept up round the substance much more uniformly than when a metal support is used. At the same time however the chemical effect produced by heated charcoal should not be forgotten, particularly the reduction of metallic oxides, and the deoxygenation of the fixed acids; so that, for example, a small heap of minium or litharge heated red-hot on charcoal...\ncharcoal by the blow-pipe, is speedily reduced to a globule of metallic lead; the phosphates are partially reduced to phosphurets, &c.\n\nFor a metallic support, platinum is in general by far the best material. A small spoon of this metal, the shank of which may be stuck in a cork when held, and a small silver cup, the shank of which is fixed into a wooden handle, may be used in fusions with borax or alkaline fluxes. A small forceps lately brought into use, and made entirely of two thin pieces of platinum joined by rivets, and bent, will be useful in holding any small hard substance in the blow-pipe flame for any length of time, without danger of the points of the forceps melting; and it is also found that this metal is so much more a conductor of heat than any other, that the forceps never gets too hot for the naked fingers to touch at the bend.*\n\nFig. 6 represents a portable pocket blow-pipe, invented by Dr Wollaston, and of its actual size. The interior tube is longer than the exterior, that it may be readily withdrawn; and the upper edge of the large end is turned outward, to diminish the effort of the lips requisite for retaining it in the mouth.\n\nFig. 7 represents the whole apparatus, one half of its real dimensions, and connected for use. The small extremity a is placed obliquely at an angle of about 120°, that the flame impelled by it may be carried to a more convenient distance from the eye, and thus answering the purpose of a longer blow-pipe. This oblique piece a is composed of three parts, the largest of which is made stronger, that it may not be injured by use. One end is closed, and into the other is inserted a small peg of wood, perforated so as to receive the tip which is intended to be occasionally separated, for the purpose of passing a fine needle into it, to remove obstructions†.\n\nPLATES CCCLII. and CCCLIHI.\n\nFig. 1.

She disputed with Neptune the honour of giving a name to the city of Athens; when they agreed that whosoever of them should produce what was most useful to mankind, should have that advantage. Neptune, with a stroke of his trident, formed a horse; and Minerva caused an olive to spring from the ground, which was judged to be most useful, from its being the symbol of peace. Minerva changed Arachne into a spider, for pretending to excel her in making tapestry. She fought the giants; favoured Cadmus, Ulysses, and other heroes; and refused to marry Vulcan, chiding rather to live in a state of celibacy. She also deprived Tirefias of sight, turned Medusa's locks into snakes, and performed several other exploits.\n\nMinerva is usually represented by the poets, painters, and sculptors, completely armed, with a composed but agreeable countenance, bearing a golden breastplate, a spear in her right hand, and her aegis or shield in the left, on which is represented Medusa's head encircled with snakes, and her helmet was usually entwined with olives.\n\nMinerva had several temples both in Greece and Italy. The usual victim offered her was a white heifer, never yoked. The animals sacred to her were the cock, the owl, and the basilisk.\n\nMINERVA CASTRUM, ARX MINERVAE, MINERVINUM, or TEMPLE MINERVAE, in Ancient Geography, a citadel, temple, and town on the Ionian sea, beyond Hydrus; seen a great way out at sea. Now Castrum, a town of Otranto in Naples. E. Long. 19. 25. N. Lat. 46. 8.\n\nMINERVA PROMONTORIUM, in Ancient Geography, the seat of the Sirens, a promontory in the Sinus Paefanum, the south-boundary of Campania on the Tuscan coast; so called from a temple of Minerva on it; situated to the south of Surrentum, and therefore called SURRENTIUM. Now Capo della Minerva, on the west coast of Naples, over against the island Capri.\n\nMINERVALIA, in Roman antiquity, festivals celebrated in honour of Minerva, in the month of March; at which time the scholars had a vacation, and usually made a present to their masters, called from this festival Minerval.\n\nMINGRELIA, anciently COLCHIS, a part of Western Georgia, in Asia; bounded on the east by Iberia, or Georgia properly so called; on the west, by the Euxine sea; on the south, by Armenia, and part Mingrelia of Pontus; and on the north, by Mount Caucasus.\n\nColchis, or Mingrelia, is watered by a great many rivers; as the Corax, the Hippus, the Cyaneus, the Charidus, the Phasis, where the Argonauts landed, the Abasrus, the Cissus, and the Ophis, all emptying themselves into the Euxine sea. The Phasis does not spring from the mountains in Armenia, near the sources of the Euphrates, the Araxes, and the Tigris, as Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy, Dionysius, and after them Arrian, Reland, Calmet, and Sanfion, have falsely asserted; but rises in Mount Caucasus; and flows not from south to north, but from north to south, as appears from the map of Colchis or Mingrelia in Thevenot's collection, and the account which Sir John Chardin gives of that country. This river forms in its course a small island called also Phasis: whence the pheasants, if Isidorus is to be credited, were first brought to Europe, and thence called by the Greeks Phasiani. The other rivers of Colchis are considerable.\n\nThe whole kingdom of Colchis was in ancient times very pleasant and fruitful, as it is still where duly cultivated; abounded in all necessaries of life; and was enriched with many mines of gold, which gave occasion to the fable of the Golden Fleece and the Argonautic expedition, so much celebrated by the ancients.\n\nSir John Chardin tells us, that this country extends above 100 miles in length and 60 in breadth; being not near so extensive as the ancient Colchis, which reached from the frontiers of Iberia or Georgia Proper, westward to the Palus Maeoticus: that it is beautifully diversified with hills, mountains, valleys, woods, and plains, but badly cultivated; that there are all the kinds of fruits which are found in England, growing wild, but tasteless and insipid for want of culture: that, if the natives understood the art of making wines, those of this country would be the finest in the world: that there are many rivers which have their source in Mount Caucasus, particularly the Phasis, now called the Rione: that the country abounds in beesves, hogs, wild boars, flags, and other venison; and in partridges, pheasants, and quails: that falcons, eagles, pelicans, lions, leopards, tygers, wolves, and jackals, breed on Mount Caucasus, and sometimes greatly annoy the country: that the people are generally handsome, the men strong and well made, and the women very beautiful; but both sexes very vicious and debauched: that they marry their nieces, aunts, or other relations, indifferently; and take two or three wives.\nMIN\n\nMingrelia, wives if they please, and as many concubines as they will: that they not only make a common practice of killing their children, but even murder them, or bury them alive, when they find it difficult to bring them up: that the common people use a sort of paste, made of a plant called gom, instead of bread; but that of the better sort consists of wheat, barley, or rice: that the gentry have an absolute power over their vassals, which extends to life, liberty, and estate: that their arms are the bow and arrow, the lance, the sabre or broadsword, and the buckler: that they are very natty, and eat sitting cross-legged upon a carpet, like the Persians; but the poorer sort upon a mat or bench, in the same posture: that the country is very thin of inhabitants, no less than 12,000 being supposed to be fed yearly to the Turks and Persians: that the principal commodities exported from it are, honey, wax, hides, caftor, martens skins, flax seed, thread, silk, and linen cloth; but that there are no gold or silver mines now, and very little money: that the revenue of the prince or viceroy amounts to about 20,000 crowns per annum: that the inhabitants call themselves Christians; but that both they and their priests are altogether illiterate, and ignorant of the doctrines and precepts of Christianity: that their bishops are rich, have a great number of vassals, and are clothed in scarlet and velvet: and that their service is according to the rites of the Greek church, with a mixture of Judaism and Paganism.\n\nThe cities of most note in this country in ancient times were Pityus; Dioscurias, or Dioscorias, which was so called from Castor and Pollux, two of the Argonauts, by whom it is supposed to have been founded, and who in Greek are styled Dioscuri, at present known by the name of Savatapoli; Aca on the Pindus, supposed to be the same as Hippolis; Phaestus, so called from the river on which it stood; Cyta, at the mouth of the river Cynaeus, the birthplace of the famous Medea, called from thence, by the poets, Cyteis; Saracae, Zadris, Suriem, Madia, and Zolifia. As for modern cities, it does not appear that there are any here considerable enough to merit a description; or, if there are, they seem to be little, if at all, known to Europeans.\n\nMINHO, a great river in Spain, which taking its rise in Galicia, divides that province from Portugal, and falls into the Atlantic at Caminha.\n\nMINIATURE, in a general sense, signifies representation in a small compass, or less than the reality.\n\nMINIATURE PAINTING;\n\nA delicate kind of painting, consisting of little points or dots; usually done on vellum, ivory, or paper, with very thin, simple, water colours.—The word comes from the Latin minium, \"red lead;\" that being a colour much used in this kind of painting. The French frequently call it mignature; from mignon, \"fine, pretty,\" on account of its smallness and delicacy: and it may be ultimately derived from pingere, \"small.\"\n\nMiniature is distinguished from other kinds of painting by the smallness and delicacy of its figures and faintness of the colouring; on which account it requires to be viewed very near.\n\nSect. I. Of Drawing and Designing.\n\nTo succeed in this art, a man should be perfectly skilled in the art of designing or drawing: but as most people who affect the one, know little or nothing of the other, and would have the pleasure of painting without giving themselves the trouble of learning to design (which is indeed an art that is not acquired without a great deal of time, and continual application), inventions have been found out to supply the place of it; by means of which a man designs or draws without knowing how to design.\n\nThe first is chalking: that is, if you have a mind to do a print or design in miniature, the backside of it, on another paper, must be blackened with small coal, and then rubbed very hard with the finger wrapped in a linen cloth: afterwards the cloth must be lightly drawn over the side so blackened that no black grains may remain upon it to soil the vellum you would paint upon; and the print or draught must be fastened upon the vellum with four pins, to keep it from shifting.\n\nVox. XIV. Part I.\n\nAnd if it be another paper that is blackened, it must be put between the vellum and the print, or draught, with the blackened side upon the vellum. Then, with a blunted pin or needle, you must pass over the principal lines or strokes of the print, or draught, the contours, the plait of the drapery, and over every thing else that must be distinguished; pressing so hard, that the strokes may be fairly marked upon the vellum underneath.\n\nCopying by squares is another convenient method for such as are but little skilled in the art of designing, and would copy pictures, or other things, that cannot be chalked. The method is this: The piece must be divided into many equal parts by little squares, marked out with charcoal, if the piece be clear and whitish, and the black can be fairly seen upon it; or with white chalk, if it be too brown and dusky. After which, as many squares of equal dimensions must be made on white paper, upon which the piece must be designed; because, if this be done immediately upon vellum, (as one is apt to miscarry in the first attempt), the vellum may be foiled with false touches. But when it is neatly done upon paper, it must be chalked upon the vellum in the manner before described. When the original and the paper are thus ordered, observe what is in each square of the piece to be designed; as a head, an arm, a hand, and so forth; and place it in the corresponding part of the paper. And thus finding where to place all the parts of the piece, you have nothing to do but to form them well, and to join them together. By this method you may reduce or enlarge a piece to what compass you please, making the squares of your paper greater or less than those of the original; but they must always be of an equal number.\n\nTo copy a picture, or other thing, in the same size.\nDrawing and proportion, another method is, to make use of varnished paper, or of the skin of a hog's bladder, very transparent, such as is to be had at the gold-beaters. Talc or umber will likewise do as well. Lay any one of those things upon your piece; through it you will see all the strokes and touches, which are to be drawn upon it with a crayon or pencil. Then take it off; and fastening it under paper or vellum, set up both against the light in the manner of a window; and with a crayon, or a silver needle, mark out upon the paper or vellum you have put uppermost, all the lines and touches you shall see drawn upon the varnished paper, bladder, tale, or umber, you have made use of, and which will plainly appear through this window.\n\nAfter this manner, making use of the window, or of glass exposed to the light, you may copy all sorts of prints, designs, and other pieces on paper or vellum: laying and fastening them under the paper or vellum upon which you would draw them. And it is a very good and a very easy contrivance for doing pieces of the same size and proportion.\n\nIf you have a mind to make pieces look another way, there is nothing to be done but to turn them; laying the printed or drawn side upon the glass, and fastening the paper or vellum upon the back of it; remembering to let your lights fall on the left side.\n\nA good method likewise to take a true copy of a picture in oil, is to give a touch of the pencil upon all the principal strokes, with lake tempered with oil; and to clap upon the whole a paper of the same size: then passing the hand over it, the touches of the lake will stick and leave the design of your piece expressed upon the paper, which may be chalked like other things. But you must remember to take off with the crumb of bread what remains of the lake upon the picture before it be dry.\n\nYou must likewise make use of pounce, made of powdered charcoal put in a linen rag; with which the piece you would copy must be rubbed, after you have pricked all the principal strokes or touches, and fastened white paper or vellum underneath.\n\nWhen the piece is marked out upon the vellum you must pass with a pencil of very clear carmine over all the traces, that they may not be effaced as you work; then clean your vellum with the crumb of bread, that no black may remain upon it.\n\nThe vellum must be pasted upon a plate of brads or wood, of the size you would make your piece, to keep it firm and tight. But this pasting must be on the edges of your vellum only, and behind the plate, for which purpose your vellum must exceed your plate above an inch on every side; for the part you paint upon must never be pasted; because it would not only give it an ill look, but you could not take it off if you would. Cut off the little flaps and locks of the vellum; and wetting the fair side with a linen cloth dipped in water, clap the other upon the plate with a clean paper between them; so much as hangs over must be pasted upon the back of the plate, drawing it equally on all sides, and hard enough to stretch it well.\n\n**Sect. II. Of Materials.**\n\nThe chief colours made use of for painting in miniature are,\n\n- Carmine.\n- Venice and Florence lake.\n- Rose pink.\n- Vermilion.\n- Red lead.\n- Brown red.\n- Red orpiment.\n- Ultramarine.\n- Verditer.\n- Indigo.\n- Gall stone.\n- Yellow ochre.\n- Dutch pink.\n- Gamboge.\n- Naples yellow.\n- Pale masticot.\n- Deep yellow masticot.\n- Ivory black.\n- Lamp black.\n- True Indian ink.\n- Bitre, or wood foot.\n- Raw umber.\n- Burnt umber.\n- Sap green.\n- Verdigris.\n- Flake white.\n- Crayons of all colours.\n- Gold and silver shells.\n- Leaf gold and leaf silver.\n\nThe seven transparent colours, which are used where writing is seen through the colour.\n\n- Lake.\n- Blue.\n- Yellow.\n- Liquid\n  - Grass-green.\n  - Dark-green.\n  - Purple colour.\n  - Brown.\n\nMost of these colours necessary for miniature painting may easily be prepared by attending to the directions given under the article Colour-Making.\n\nAs colours taken from earth and other heavy matter are always too coarse be they never so well ground, especially for delicate work, because of a certain sand remaining in them; the finest parts may be drawn out by diluting them with the finger in a cup of water. When they are well steeped, let them settle a while; then pour out the clearest, which will be at top, into another vessel. This will be the finest, and must be let dry; and when it is used, must be diluted with gum water.\n\nIf you mix a little of the gall of an ox, a carp, or an eel, particularly of the last, in green, black, gray, yellow, and brown, colours, it will not only take away their greasy nature, but also give them a lustre and brightness they have not of themselves. The gall of eels must be taken out when they are skinned, and hung upon a nail to dry; and when you would use it, it must be diluted with brandy; add a little of it mixed with the colour you have diluted already. This likewise makes the colour stick better to the vellum, which it hardly does when it is greasy; moreover, this gall hinders it from scaling.\nSome colours are made clearer by fire; as yellow ochre, brown red, ultramarine, and umber: all others are darkened by it. But if you heat the said colours with a sharp fire, they change; for the brown red becomes yellow; yellow ochre becomes red; umber reddens also. Cerufs by fire takes the colour of citron, and is often called magicot. Observe, that yellow ochre heated, becomes more tender than it was, and softer than brown red. Likewise brown red heated becomes softer than fine yellow ochre. Both are very proper. The finest and truest ultramarine, heated upon a red-hot iron, becomes more glittering; but it wastes, and is coarser and harder to work with in miniature.\n\nAll these colours are diluted in little cups of ivory, made on purpose, or in sea shells, with water in which gum arabic and sugar candy are put. For instance, in a glass of water put a piece of gum as big as a walnut, and half that quantity of sugar candy. This last hinders the colours from scaling when they are laid on, which they generally do when they want it, or the vellum is greasy.\n\nThis gum water must be kept in a neat bottle corked; and you never must take any out of it with a pencil that has colour upon it, but with a quill or some such thing.\n\nSome of this water is put in the shell with the colour you would temper, and diluted with the finger till it be very fine. If it be too hard, you must let it soften in the shell with the said water before you dilute it. Afterwards let it dry; and do thus with every colour, except lily-green, fap-green, and gamboge, which must be tempered with fair water only. But ultramarine, lake, and bistre, are to be more gummed than other colours.\n\nIf you make use of sea shells, you must let them steep two or three days beforehand in water; then cleanse them in boiling hot water, mixed with vinegar, in order to carry off a certain salt, which otherwise sticks to them, and spoils the colours that are put to them.\n\nTo know whether colours are sufficiently gummed, you have nothing to do but to give a stroke of the pencil upon your hand when they are diluted, which dries immediately; if they chap and scale, there is too much gum; if they rub out by passing the finger over them, there is too little. It may be seen likewise when the colours are laid on the vellum, by passing the finger over them. If they stick to it like a powder, it is a sign there is not gum enough, and more must be put to the water with which you temper them: but take care you do not put too much; for that makes the colour extremely hard and dry. It may be known likewise by their glueiness and brightness: so the more they are gummed, the darker they paint; and when you have a mind to give a greater strength to a colour than it has of itself, you have nothing to do but to give it a great deal of gum.\n\nProvide yourself with an ivory pallet, very smooth, as big as your hand; on one side of which the colours for the carnation, or naked parts of a picture, are to be ranged in the following manner. In the middle put a great deal of white, pretty largely spread; because it is the colour most made use of: and upon the edge, from the left to the right, place the following colours at a little distance from the white.\n\nMalticot,\nDutch pink,\nOrpiment,\nYellow ochre,\nGreen; composed of verditer, Dutch pink, and white, in equal quantities.\nBlue; made of ultramarine, indigo, and white, to a great degree of paleness.\nVermilion,\nCarmine,\nBistre, and\nBlack.\n\nOn the other side of the pallet, spread some white in the same manner as for the carnation. And when you have a mind to paint draperies, or other things, place near the white the colour you would make them of, in order to work, as shall be shown hereafter.\n\nThe use of good pencils is a great matter. In order to make a good choice, wet them a little; and if the hairs keep close together as you turn them upon the finger, and make but one point, they are good; but if they close not together, but make several points, and some are longer than others, they are good for nothing. When they are too sharp pointed, with only four or five hairs longer than the rest, yet closing all together, they are, notwithstanding, good; but they must be blunted with a pair of scissors, taking care at the same time you do not chip away too much. It is proper to have two or three sorts of them; the largest for laying the grounds and dead colouring, and the smallest for finishing.\n\nTo bring the hairs of your pencil to join close together and make a good point, you must often put the pencil just between your lips when you are at work; moistening and pressing it close with the tongue, even when there is colour upon it; for if there be too much, some of it is taken off by this means, and enough left for giving fine and equal touches. You need not apprehend this will do you any harm. None of the colours for miniature, except orpiment, when they are prepared, have either ill taste or ill quality. This expedient must especially be used for dotting, and for finishing, particularly the naked parts of a picture, that the touches may be neat and fair, and not too much charged with colour. As for draperies and other things, as well in dead colouring as in finishing, it is sufficient, in order to make the hairs of your pencil join well, and to unload it when it has too much colour, to draw it upon the edge of the shell, or upon the paper you must put upon your work to rest your hand on, giving some strokes upon it before you work upon your piece.\n\nTo work well in miniature, you must do it in a room that has but one window, and fix yourself very near it, with a table and desk almost as high as the window; placing yourself in such a manner, that the light may always come in on the left side, and never forward or on the right.\n\nWhen you would lay a colour on all parts equally strong, as for a ground, you must take your mixtures in shells, and put in enough for the thing you design to paint; for if there be not enough, it is a great chance but the colour you mix afterwards is too dark or too light.\nSect. III. Of Working.\n\nAfter having spoke of vellum, pencils, and colours, let us now show how they are to be employed. In the first place, then, when you would paint a piece, be it carnation, drapery, or any thing else, you must begin by dead-colouring; that is to say, by laying your colours on with liberal strokes of the pencil, in the smoothest manner you can, as the painters do in oil; not giving it all the force it is to have for a finishing; that is, make the lights a little brighter, and the shades less dark, than they ought to be; because in dotting upon them, as you must do after dead-colouring, the colour is always fortified, and would at last be too dark.\n\nThere are several ways of dotting; and every painter has his own. Some make their dots perfectly round; others make them a little longish; others hatch by little strokes that cross each other every way, till the work appears as if it had been wrought with dots. This last method is the best, the boldest, and the soonest done: wherefore such as would paint in miniature ought to use it, and to insure themselves from the first to dot in the plump and the soft way; that is to say, where the dots are lost, in a manner, in the ground upon which you work, and only so much appears as is sufficient to make the work seem dotted. The hard and the dry way is quite the reverse, and always to be avoided. This is done by dotting with a colour much darker than your ground, and when the pencil is not moistened enough with the colour, which makes the work seem rough and uneven.\n\nStudy likewise carefully to lose and drown your colours one in another, so that it may not appear where they disjoin; and to this end, soften or allay your touches with colours that partake of both, in such sort that it may not appear to be your touches which cut and disjoin them. By the word cut, we are to understand what manifestly separates and divides, and does not run in and blend itself with the neighbouring colours; which is rarely practised but upon the borders of drapery.\n\nWhen your pieces are finished, to heighten them a little, give them a fine air; that is to say, give, upon the extremity of the lights, small touches with a colour yet lighter, which must be lost and drowned with the rest.\n\nWhen the colours are dry upon your pallet or in your flasks, in order to use them, they must be diluted with water. And when you perceive they want gum, which is seen when they easily rub off the hand or the vellum if you give a touch with them upon either, they must be tempered with gum water instead of pure water, till they are in condition.\n\nThere are several sorts of grounds for pictures and portraitures. Some are wholly dark, composed of bitre, umbre, and Cologn earth, with a little black and white; others more yellow, in which is mixed a great deal of ochre; others grayer, which partake of indigo. In order to paint a ground, make a wash of the colour or mixture you would have it, or according to that of the picture or portraiture you would copy; that is to say, a very light lay, in which there is hardly anything but water, in order to soak the vellum.\n\nThen pass another lay over that, somewhat thicker, and strike it on very smoothly with large strokes as quick as you can, not touching twice in the same place before it be dry; because the second stroke carries off what has been laid on at the first, especially when you lean a little too light upon the pencil.\n\nOther dark grounds are likewise made of a colour a little greenish; and those are most in use, and the properest to lay under all sorts of figures and portraitures; because they make the carnation, or naked parts of a picture, appear very fine; are laid on very easily, and there is no occasion to dot them, as one is often obliged to do the others, which are rarely made smooth and even at the first; whereas in these one seldom fails of success at the first bout. To make them, you must mix black, Dutch pink, and white, all together: more or less of each colour, according as you would have them darker or lighter. You are to make one lay very light, and then a thicker, as of the first grounds. You may also make them of other colours, if you please; but these are the most common.\n\nWhen you paint a holy person upon one of these grounds, and would paint a small glory round the head of your figure, you must not lay the colour too thick in that part, or you may even lay none at all, especially where this glory is to be very bright; but lay for the first time with white and a little ochre mixed together, of a sufficient thickness; and in proportion as you go from the place of the head, put a little more ochre; and to make it lose itself, and die away with the colour of the ground, hatch with a free stroke of the pencil, following the round of the glory sometimes with that of the ground, mixing a little white or ochre with the last when it paints too dark to work with: and do this till one be insensibly lost in another, and nothing can be seen to disjoin them.\n\nTo fill an entire ground with a glory, the brightest part is laid on with a little ochre and white, adding more of the first in proportion as you come nearer the edges of the picture: and when the ochre is not strong enough (for you must always paint darker and darker), add gall stone, afterwards a little carmine, and lastly bititre. This first laying, or dead colouring, is to be made as soft as possible; that is to say, let these shadowings lose themselves in one another without gap or intersection. Then the way is to dot upon them with the same colours, in order to drown the whole together; which is pretty tedious, and a little difficult, especially when there are clouds of glory on the ground. Their lights must be fortified in proportion as you remove from the figure, and finished as the rest, by dotting and rounding the clouds; the bright and obscure parts of which must run insensibly into one another.\n\nFor a day sky, take ultramarine and a good deal of white, and mix them together. With this make a lay, as smooth as you can, with a large pencil and liberal strokes, as for grounds; applying it paler and paler as you descend towards the horizon; which must be done with vermilion or red lead, and with white of the same strength with that where the sky ends, or something less; making this blue lose itself in the red, which you bring down to the skirts of the earth, or tops of houses; mixing towards the end gall stone and\nSect. IV.\n\nMINIATURE PAINTING.\n\nOf Working.\n\nThere is likewise made another red drapery, which is first drawn with vermilion, mixing white with it to dead colour the bright places, laying it pure and unmixed for those that are darker, and adding carmine for the grand shades. It is finished afterwards, like other draperies, with the same colours. And when the carmine with the vermilion do not darken enough, work with the first alone, but only in the deepest of the shades.\n\nA drapery of lake is made in the same manner with that of carmine; mixing a good deal of white with it for the bright places, and very little for those that are dark. It is finished likewise with dotting; but you have nothing to do with vermilion in it.\n\nViolet draperies are likewise done after this manner; after making a mixture of carmine and ultramarine, putting always white for the bright parts. If you would have your violet be columbine or dove colour, there must be more carmine than ultramarine: but if you would have it bluer and deeper, put more ultramarine than carmine.\n\nA drapery is made of a flesh colour, beginning with a lay made of white, vermilion, and very pale lake; and making the shades with the same colours, using less white in them. This drapery must be very pale and tender, because the stuff of this colour is thin and light; and even the shades of it ought not to be deep.\n\nTo make a yellow drapery, put a lay of masticot over all; then one of gamboge upon that, excepting the brightest places, where the masticot must be left entire; the dead colour with ochre, mixed with a little gamboge and masticot, putting more or less of the last according to the strength of the shades. And when these colours do not darken enough, add gall stone. And gall stone pure and unmixed is used for the thickest shades; mixing a little bitre with it, if there be occasion to make them still darker. You finish by dotting with the same colours you dead-coloured with, and losing the lights and the shades in one another.\n\nIf you put Naples yellow, or Dutch pink, in lieu of masticot and gamboge, you will make another sort of yellow.\n\nThe green drapery is made by a general lay of verditer; with which, if you find it too blue, mix masticot for the lights, and gamboge for the shades. Afterwards add to this mixture lily-green or fap-green, to shadow with; and as the shades are thicker, put more of these last greens, and even work with them pure and unmixed where they are to be extremely dark. You finish with the same colours, a little darker.\n\nBy putting more yellow, or more blue, in these colours, you may make different sorts of green as you please.\n\nTo make a black drapery, you dead colour with black and white, and finish with the same colour, putting more black as the shades are thicker; and for the darkest, mix indigo with it, especially when you would have the drapery appear like velvet. You may always give some touches with a brighter colour, to heighten the lights of any drapery whatsoever.\n\nA white woollen drapery is made by a lay of white, in which there must be a very small matter of ochre, orpiment, or gall stone, that it may look a little yellowish.\n\nSect. IV. Of Draperies.\n\nTo paint a blue drapery, put ultramarine near the white upon your pallet; and mix a part of the one with the other, till it makes a fine pale, and has a body. With this mixture you must form the brightest parts; and then adding more ultramarine, form such as are darker; and go on after this manner till you come to the deepest plait and the thickest shades, where you must lay pure ultramarine: and all this must be done as for a first forming or dead colouring; that is to say, laying the colour on with free strokes of the pencil, yet as smooth as you can; losing the lights in the shades with a colour neither so pale as the light nor so dark as the shades. Then dot with the same colour as in the first forming, but a small matter deeper; that the dots may be fairly seen. All the parts must be drowned one in another, and the plait appears without interfection. When the ultramarine is not dark enough to make the deeper shades, how well forever it be gummed, mix a little indigo with it to finish them. And when the extremities of the lights are not bright enough, heighten them with white and a very little ultramarine.\n\nA drapery of carmine is done in the same manner as the blue; except that in the darkest places there is to be a lay of pure ultramarine, before you dead colour with carmine, which must be applied at top; and in the strongest shades, it must be gummed very much. To deepen it the more, mix a little bitre with it.\nThen dead-colour, and finish the shades with blue, a little black, white, and bistre; putting a great deal of the last in the darkest.\n\nThe light gray is begun with black and white, and finished with the same colour deeper.\n\nFor a brown drapery, make a lay of bistre, white, and a little brown red; and shadow with this mixture, made a little darker.\n\nThere are other draperies, called variable, because the lights are of a different colour from the shades. These are mostly used for the vestments of angels, for young and gay people, for scarfs and other airy attire, admitting of a great many folds, and flowing at the pleasure of the wind. The most common are the violets; of which they make two sorts; one, where the lights are blue; and the other, where they are yellow.\n\nFor the first, put a lay of ultramarine and very pale white upon the lights; and shadow with carmine, ultramarine, and white, as for a drapery wholly violet; so that only the grand lights appear blue. Yet they must be dotted with violet, in which there is a great deal of white, and lost infinitely in the shades.\n\nThe other is done by putting upon the lights only, instead of blue, a lay of masticot; working the rest as in the drapery all violet, excepting that it must be dotted, and the light parts blended with the shadowy, that is, the yellow with the violet, with a little gamboge.\n\nThe carmine red is done like the last; that is, let the lights be done with masticot, and the shades with carmine; and to lose the one in the other, make use of gamboge.\n\nThe lake red is done like that of carmine.\n\nThe green is done as the lake: always mixing verditer with lily or sap green, to make the shades; which are not very dark.\n\nSeveral other sorts of draperies may be made at discretion, always taking care to preserve the union of the colours, not only in one sort of cloth or so, but also in a group of several figures; avoiding, as much as the subject will allow, the putting of blue near the colour of fire, of green against black; and so of other colours which cut and disjoin, and whose union is not kind enough.\n\nSeveral other draperies are made of foul colours, as brown red, bistre, indigo, &c. and all in the same manner. Likewise of other colours, simple and compound; the agreement between which is always to be minded, that the mixture may produce nothing harsh and disagreeable to the eye. No certain rule can be laid down for this. The force and effect of your colours are only to be known from use and experience, and you must work according to that knowledge.\n\nLinen cloths are done thus: After drawing the plaits or folds, as is done in a drapery, put a lay of white over all; then dead colour, and finish the shades with a mixture of ultramarine, black, and white, using more or less of the last, according to their strength or tenderness; and in the greatest deepenings put bistre, mixed with a little white; giving only some touches of this mixture, and even of pure bistre, upon the extremities of the greatest shadows, where the folds must be drawn, and lost with the rest.\n\nThey may be done in another manner, by making of a general lay of this mixture of ultramarine, black, and very pale white; and dead colour (as has been said before) with the same colour, but a little deeper. And when the shades are dotted and finished, heighten the lights with pure white, and lose them with the deepenings of the linen. But of whatever sort you make them, when they are finished, you must give a yellowish tinct of orpiment and white to certain places; laying it lightly on, and as it were in water; so that what is underneath may, notwithstanding, plainly appear, as well the shadows as the dotting.\n\nYellow linen cloth is done by putting a lay of white, mixed with a little ochre. Then form and finish the shades with bistre, mixed with white and ochre; and in the thickest shades use pure bistre; and before you finish, give some tints here and there of ochre and white, and others of white and ultramarine, as well upon the shades as the lights; but let them be very bright: and drown the whole together in dotting, and it will look finely. As you finish, heighten the extremities of the lights with masticot and white. You may add to this sort of linen, as well as to the white, certain bars from space to space, as in Turkey mantuas; that is, small stripes blue and red with ultramarine and carmine; one of red between two of blue, very bright and clear upon the lights, and deeper upon the shades. Virgins are pretty often dressed with veils of this sort (by Popish painters), and scarfs of this kind are put about necks that are bare; because they become the tinct mighty well.\n\nIf you would have both these sorts of linen transparent, and the stuff or other thing that is beneath appear through them, make the first lay for them very light and clear, and mix in the colour to shadow with, a little of that which is underneath, especially towards the end of the shades; and only do the extremities of the lights, for the yellow, with masticot and white; and for the white, with pure white.\n\nThey may be done in another manner, especially when you would have them altogether as clear as muslin, lawn, or gauze. To this end form and finish what is to be beneath, as if nothing was to be put over it. Then mark out the light and clear folds with white or masticot; and a shadowy with bistre and white, or with black, blue, and white, according to the colour you would make them of; making the rest somewhat fainter; yet this is not necessary but for the parts that are not to be so clear.\n\nCrape is done the same way; excepting that the folds of the shades and the lights, and the borders too, are to be marked out with little filaments of black upon what is underneath; which is likewise to be finished beforehand.\n\nWhen you would make a stuff like a watered tabby, make the waves upon it with a colour a little lighter, or a little darker, in the lights and the shades.\n\nThere is a manner of touching draperies which distinguishes the filken from the woollen. The last are more terrestrial and sensible; the others more light and fading. But it must be observed, that this is an effect which depends partly upon the stuff and partly upon the colour; and for the employing these in a manner suitable to the subjects and the deepenings of painting,\nOf painting, we shall here touch upon their different qualities.\n\nWe have no colour which partakes more of light, nor which comes nearer the air, than white; which shows it to be fickle and fleeting. It may, nevertheless, be held and brought to by some neighbouring colour, more heavy and sensible, or by mixing them together.\n\nBlue is a most fleeting colour: and so we see, that the sky and the remotest views of a picture are of this colour; but it will become lighter and flicker in proportion as it is mixed with white.\n\nPure black is the heaviest and most terrestrial of all colours; and the more of it you mix with others, the nearer you bring them to the eye.\n\nNevertheless, the different dispositions of black and white make also their effects different: for white often makes black disappear, and black brings white more into view; as in the reflection of globes, or other figures to be made round, where there are always parts that fly as it were from the eye, and deceive it by the craft of art: and under the white are here comprehended all the light colours; as under the black, all the heavy colours.\n\nUltramarine is then soft and light.\n\nOchre is not so much so.\n\nMasticot is very light; and so is verditer.\n\nVermilion and carmine come near this quality.\n\nOrniment and gamboge not so near.\n\nDutch pink is an indifferent colour, easily taking the quality of others. So it is made terrestrial by mixing it with colours that are so; and, on the contrary, the most light and fleeting by joining it with white or blue.\n\nBrown red, umber, dark greens, and bistre, are the heaviest and most terrestrial, next to black.\n\nSkilful painters, who understand perspective, and the harmony of colours, always observe to place the dark and sensible colours on the fore parts of their pictures; and the most light and fleeting they use for the distances and remote views. And as for the union of colours, the different mixtures that may be made of them will learn you the friendship or antipathy they have to one another. And upon this you must take your measures for placing them with such agreement as shall please the eye.\n\nFor the doing of lace, French points, or other things of that nature, put over all a lay of blue, black, and white, as for linen: then heighten the flowerwork with pure white: afterwards make the shades above with the first colour, and finish them with the same. When they are upon the carnation or naked parts of a picture, or upon any thing else that you would show through another, finish what is beneath, as if nothing was to be put over it: and at top, make the points or lace with pure white, shadowing and finishing them with the other mixture.\n\nIf you would paint a fur, you must begin with a kind of drapery, done, if it be dark, with bistre and white, making the shadowings of the same colour, with less white. If the fur be white, do it with blue, white, and a little bistre. And when this beginning, or first forming, is done, instead of dotting, draw small strokes, turning, now in one manner, now in another, according to the course and flating of the hair. Heighten the lights of dark furs with ochre and white, and of the other with white and a little blue.\n\nFor doing a building, if it be of stone, take indigo, bistre, and white, with which make the beginning or first form of it: and for shadowing it, put less of this last; and more bistre than indigo, according to the colour of the stone you would paint. To these you may likewise add a little ochre, both for the forming and the finishing. But to make it finer, you must give, here and there, especially for old fabrics, blue and yellow teints, some with ochre, others with ultramarine, mixing always white with them, whether before the first forming, provided they appear through the draught, or whether upon it, losing or drowning them with the rest when you finish.\n\nWhen the building is of wood, as there are many sorts, it is done at discretion; but the most ordinary way is to begin or first form with ochre, bistre, and white, and finish without white, or with very little; and if the shades are deep, with pure bistre. In the other they add sometimes vermilion, sometimes green or black; in a word, just according to the colour they would give it; and they finish with dotting, as in draperies and every thing else.\n\nSect. V. Of Carnations, or the naked parts of a Painting.\n\nThere are in carnation so many different colourings, that it would be a difficult thing to give general rules upon so variable a subject. Nor are they minded, when one has got, by custom and practice, some habit of working easily: and such as are arrived to this degree, employ themselves in copying their originals, or else they work upon their ideas, without knowing how: insomuch, that the most skilful, who do it with less reflection and pains than others, would likewise be more put to it to give an account of their maxims and knowledge in the matter of painting, if they were to be asked what colours they made use of for such and such a colouring, a teint here, and another there.\n\nNevertheless, as beginners want some instruction at the first, we will show in general after what manner several carnations are to be done.\n\nIn the first place, After having drawn your figure with carmine, and ordered your piece, apply for women and children, and generally for all tender colourings, a lay of white, mixed with a very little of the blue made for faces, of which we have told the composition; but let it hardly be seen.\n\nAnd for men, instead of blue, they put in this first lay a little vermilion; and when they are old, a little ochre is mixed with it.\n\nAfterwards follow all the traces with vermilion, carmine, and white, mixed together; and begin all the shades with this mixture, adding white in proportion as they are weaker; and putting but little in the darkness, and none, in a manner, in certain places where strong touches are to be given; for instance, in the corner of the eye; under the nose; at the ears; under the chin; in the separations of the fingers; in all joints; at the corners of the nails; and generally in every part where you would mark out separations.\nin shades that are obscure. Neither need you fear to give to those places all the force and strength they ought to have as soon as you begin or first form them, because in working at top with green, the red you have put there is always weakened.\n\nAfter having begun, or first formed, or dead-coloured, with red, make blue teints with ultramarine and a great deal of white, upon the parts which fly from the eye; that is to say, upon the temples; under and in the corners of the eyes; on both sides the mouth, above and below; a little upon the middle of the forehead; between the nose and the eyes; on the side of the cheeks; on the neck and other places where the flesh assumes a bluish cast. Yellowish teints are likewise made with ochre or orpiment, and a little vermilion mixed with white, under the eyebrows, on the sides of the nose towards the bottom, a little underneath the cheeks, and upon the other parts which rise and come nearer the eye. It is especially from these teints that the natural complexion is to be observed, in order to catch it; for painting being an imitation of nature, the perfection of the art consists in the justness and simplicity of the representation, especially in face painting.\n\nWhen, therefore, you have done your first lay, your dead-colouring, and your teints, you must work upon the shades, dotting with green for the carnations or naked parts, mixing, according to the rule we have given for the teints, a little blue for the parts which fly from the eye; and, on the other hand, making it a little yellower for those that are more sensible; that is to say, which rise, and come nearer the eye; and at the end of the shades, on the side of the light, you must blend and lose your colour insensibly in the ground of the carnation with blue, and then with red, according to the places where you paint. If this mixture of green does not work dark enough at first, pass over the shades several times, now with red, and now with green; always dotting; and this do till they are as they should be.\n\nAnd if you cannot with these colours give the shades all the force they ought to have, finish, in the darkest, with bitre mixed with orpiment, ochre, or vermilion, and sometimes with pure bitre, according to the colouring you would make, but lightly, laying on your colour very clear.\n\nYou must dot upon the clear and bright places with a little vermilion or carmine, mixed with much white, and a very small matter of ochre, in order to lose them with the shadowy, and to make the teints die away insensibly into one another; taking care, as you dot, or hatch, to make your strokes follow the turnings and windings of the fleety parts. For though the rule be to cross always, this dotting or hatching ought to appear a little more here, because it rounds the parts. And as this mixture might make a colouring too red, if it was always to be used, they work likewise in every part, to blend the teints and the shades with blue and a little green, and much white, so mixed as to be very pale; excepting, nevertheless, that this colour must not be put upon the cheeks, nor upon the extremities of the clear parts, no more than the other mixture upon their last, which must be left with all their light; as certain places of the chin, of the nose, and of the forehead, and upon the cheeks; which, and the cheeks, ought nevertheless to be redder than the rest, as well as the feet, the hollows of the hands, and the fingers of both.\n\nObserve, that these two last mixtures ought to be so pale, that the work shall hardly be visible; for they serve only to soften it; to unite the teints with one another, and the shades with the lights, and to drown the traces. Care must likewise be taken that you work not too much with the red mixture upon the blue teints, nor with the blue upon the others; but change the colour from time to time, when you perceive it works too blue or too red, till the work be finished.\n\nThe white of the eyes must be shadowed with this same blue, and a little flesh colour; and the corners, on the side of the nose, with vermilion and white; giving them a little touch of carmine. The whole is softened with this mixture of vermilion, carmine, white, and a very small matter of ochre.\n\nThe apples or balls of the eyes are done with the mixture of ultramarine and white; the last prevailing a little; adding a little bitre, if they are yellowish; or a little black, if they are gray. Make the little black circle in the middle, called the crystal of the eye; and shadow the balls with indigo, bitre, or black, according to the colour they are of; giving to each a small touch of pure vermilion round the crystal; which must be lost with the rest at the finishing. This gives vivacity to the eye.\n\nThe round or circumference of the eye is done with bitre and carmine; that is to say, the slits or partings, and the eyelids, when they are large and bold; especially the upper ones; which must afterwards be softened with the red or blue mixtures we have mentioned before, to the end they may be lost in one another, and nothing seem interlocked. When this is done, give a little touch of pure white upon the crystal, on the side of the lights. This makes the eye shine, and gives life to it.\n\nThe mouth is dead-coloured with vermilion, mixed with white; and finished with carmine, which is softened as the rest. And when the carmine does not work dark enough, mix a little bitre with it. This is to be understood of the corners in the separation of the lips; and particularly, of certain mouths half open.\n\nThe hands, and all the other parts of carnation, are done in the same manner as the faces; observing, that the ends of the fingers be a little redder than the rest. When your whole work is formed and dotted, mark the separations of all the parts with little touches of carmine and orpiment mixed together, as well in the shadowy as the light places; but a little deeper and stronger in the first, and lose them in the rest of the carnation.\n\nThe eyebrows and the beard are dead-coloured, as are the shades of carnations; and finished with bitre, ochre, or black, according to the colour they are of, drawing them by little strokes the way they ought to go; that is to say, give them all the nature of hair. The lights of them must be heightened with ochre and bitre, a little vermilion, and much white.\n\nFor the hair of the head, make a lay of bitre, ochre, and white, and a little vermilion. When it is very dark coloured, use black instead of ochre. Afterwards form the shadowy parts with the same colours, putting\nSect. VI.\n\nMINIATURE PAINTING.\n\nOf less white in them; and finish with pure bistre, or mixed with ochre or black, by small strokes very fine, and close to each other, waving and buckling them according to the curling of the hair. The light parts must also be heightened by little strokes with ochre or orpiment, white, and a little vermilion. After which, lose the lights and the shades in each other, by working sometimes with a dark and sometimes with a light colour.\n\nAnd for the hair about the forehead, through which the skin is seen, it must be first formed with the colour thereof, and that of the carnation, working and shadowing with one and the other, as if you designed to paint none. Then form it, and finish with bistre. The lights are to be heightened as the other. Gray hair is dead-coloured with white, black, and bistre, and finished with the same colour, but deeper; heightening the bright and clear parts of the hair, as well as those of the eyebrows and the beard, with white and very pale blue, after having formed them as the others, with the colour of the flesh or skin; and finish with bistre.\n\nBut the most important thing is to soften one's work; to blend the teints in one another, as well as the beard and the hair about the forehead, with the other hair and the carnation; taking especial care not to work rough and dry; and that the traces, turnings, and windings of the carnation or naked parts, be not interfeeted. You must likewise accustom yourself to put white in your colours only in proportion as you work lighter or darker; for the colour you use the second time must be always a little stronger and deeper than the first, unless it be for softening.\n\nDifferent colourings are easily made, by putting more or less of red, or blue, or yellow, or bistre, whether for the dead-colouring, or for the finishing—That for women ought to be bluish; that for children a little red; and both fresh and florid. That for men ought to be yellower; especially when they are old.\n\nTo make a colouring of death, there must be a first lay of white and orpiment, or a very pale ochre: dead-colour with vermilion, and lake, instead of carmine, and a good deal of white; and afterwards work over it with a green mixture, in which there is more blue than any other colour, to the end the flesh may be livid and of a purple colour. The tints are done the same way as in another colouring; but there must be a great many more blue than yellow ones, especially upon the parts which fly from the sight, and about the eyes; and the last are only to be upon the parts which rise and come nearer the eye. They are made to die away in one another, according to the ordinary manner; sometimes with very pale blue, and sometimes with ochre and white, and a little vermilion; softening the whole together. The parts and contours must be rounded with the same colours. The mouth is to be, in a manner, of a quite violet. It is dead-coloured, however, with a little vermilion, ochre, and white; but finished with lake and blue; and to give it the deep strokes, they take bistre and lake, with which they likewise do the same to the eyes, the nose, and the ears. If it be a crucifix, or some martyr, upon whom blood is to be seen, after the finishing the carnation, form it with vermilion, and finish it with carmine, making in the drops of blood a little bright reflecting spark, to round them. For the crown of thorns, make a lay of sea green and masticot; shadow it with bistre and green; and heighten the clear and light parts with masticot.\n\nIron is formed, or first laid, with indigo, a little black and white; and finished with pure indigo, heightening it with white.\n\nFor painting fire and flames, the lights are done with masticot and orpiment; and for the shades, they mix vermilion and carmine.\n\nA smoke is done with black, indigo, and white, and sometimes with bistre; one may likewise add vermilion or ochre, according to the colour it is to be of.\n\nPearls are painted by putting a lay of white, and a little blue: they are shadowed and rounded with the same colour, deeper; a small white dot is made almost in the middle on the side of the light; and on the other side, between the shadow and the edge of the pearl, they give a touch with masticot, to make the reflection; and under the pearls is made a little shadow of the colour of the ground they are upon.\n\nDiamonds are made with pure black; then they heighten them with little touches of white on the side of the light. It is the same thing for any other jewels you have a mind to paint: there is nothing to be done but to change the colour.\n\nFor making a figure of gold, put a lay of shell-gold, and shadow it with gallstone. Silver is done the same way; excepting that it must be shadowed with indigo.\n\nOne great means of acquiring a perfection in the art, is to copy excellent originals. We enjoy with pleasure and tranquillity the labour and pains of others. But a man must copy a great number before he is able to produce as fine effects; and it is better to be a good copier than a bad author.\n\nSect. VI. Of Landscapes.\n\nIn the first place, After having ordered the economy of your landscape as of your other pieces, you must form the nearest grounds or lands, when they are to appear dark, with sap or lily-green, bistre, and a little verditer, to give a body to your colour; then dot with this mixture, but a little darker, adding sometimes a little black to it.\n\nFor such pieces of ground as the light falls upon, and which are therefore clear and bright, make a lay of ochre and white, then shadow and finish with bistre. In some they mix a little green, particularly for shadowing and finishing.\n\nThere are sometimes upon the fore part certain reddish lands; which are dead-coloured with brown-red, white, and a little green; and finished with the same, putting a little more green in them.\n\nFor the making of grass and leaves upon the foreground, you must, when that is finished, form with sea-green, or verditer, and a little white; and for those that are yellowish, mix masticot. Afterwards shadow them with lily-green, or bistre and gallstone, if you would have them appear withered.\n\nThe grounds or lands at a little distance are formed\nwith verditer, and shadowed and finished with sap-green, adding bitre for some of the touches here and there.\n\nSuch as are at a greater distance, are done with sea-green and a little blue; and shadowed with verditer.\n\nIn a word, the farther they go, the more bluish they are to be made; and the farthest distance ought to be of ultramarine and white; mixing in some places small touches of vermilion.\n\nWater is painted with indigo and white, and shadowed with the same colour, but deeper; and to finish it, instead of dotting, they do nothing but make strokes and traces without crofting; giving them the same turn with the waves, when there are any. Sometimes a little green must be mixed in certain places, and the light and clear parts heightened with pure white, particularly where the water foams.\n\nRocks are dead-coloured like buildings of stone; excepting that a little green is mixed for forming and shadowing them. Blue and yellow tints are made upon them, and lost with the rest in finishing. And when there are small branches, with leaves, moss, or grass, when all is finished, they are to be raised at top with green and masticot. They may be made yellow, green, and reddish, for appearing dry in the same manner as on the ground. Rocks are dotted as the rest; and the farther they are off the more grayish they are made.\n\nCastles, old houses, and other buildings of stone and wood, are done in the manner above mentioned; speaking of those things, when they are upon the first lines. But when you would have them appear at a distance, you must mix brown-red and vermilion, with much white; and shadow very tenderly with this mixture; and the farther they are off, the weaker are the strokes to be for the separations. If they are covered with slate, it is to be made bluer than the rest.\n\nTrees are not done till the sky be finished; one may, nevertheless, spare the places of them when they contain a good number; and however it be, such as come near the eye, are to be dead-coloured with verditer, mixing sometimes ochre; and shadowed with the same colours, adding lily-green. Afterwards you must work leaves upon them by dotting without crofting: for this must be done with small length dots, of a darker colour, and pretty full of it, which must be conducted on the side the branches go, by little tufts of a little darker colour. Then heighten the lights with verditer or sea-green, and masticot, making leaves in the same manner; and when there are dry branches or leaves, they are dead-coloured with brown-red or gallstone, with white; and finished with gallstone, without white, or with bitre.\n\nThe trunks of trees are to be dead-coloured with ochre, white, and a little green, for the light and clear parts; and for the dark, they mix black, adding bitre and green for shadowing one and the other.—Blue and yellow tints are likewise made upon them and little touches given here and there with white and masticot; such as you ordinarily see upon the bark of trees.\n\nThe branches which appear among the leaves are done with ochre, verditer, and white; or with bitre and white; according to the light they are placed in. They must be shadowed with bitre and lily-green.\n\nTrees, which are at a little distance, are dead-coloured with verditer and sea-green; and are shadowed and finished with the same colours, mixed with lily-green. When there are some which appear yellowish, lay with ochre and white, and finish with gallstone.\n\nFor such as are in the distances and remote views, you must dead-colour with sea-green; with which, for finishing, you must mix ultramarine. Heighten the lights of one and the other with masticot, by small disjointed leaves.\n\nIt is the most difficult part of landscape, in manner of miniature, to leaf a tree well. To learn, and break one's hand to it a little, the way is to copy good ones; for the manner of touching them is singular, and cannot be acquired but by working upon trees themselves; about which you must observe to make little boughs, which must be leafed, especially such as are below and toward the sky.\n\nAnd generally, let your landscapes be coloured in a handsome manner, and full of nature and truth; for it is that which gives them all their beauty.\n\nSect. VII. Of Flowers.\n\nIt is an agreeable thing to paint flowers, not only on account of the splendour of their different colours, but also by reason of the little time and pains that are bestowed on trimming them. There is nothing but delight in it; and, in a manner, no application. You maim and bungle a face, if you make one eye higher than another; a small nose with a large mouth; and so of other parts. But the fears of these disproportions constrain not the mind at all in flower painting; for unless they be very remarkable, they spoil nothing. For this reason, most persons of quality, who divert themselves with painting, keep to flowers. Nevertheless, you must apply yourself to copy justly; and for this part of miniature, as for the rest, we refer you to nature, for she is your best model. Work, then, after natural flowers; and look for the tints and different colours of them upon your pallet; a little use will make you find them easily; and to facilitate this to you at the first, we shall, in the continuance of our design, show the manner of painting some; for natural flowers are not always to be had; and one is often obliged to work after prints, where nothing is seen but graving.\n\nIt is a general rule, that flowers are designed and laid like other figures; but the manner of forming and finishing them is different: for they are first formed only by large strokes and traces, which you must turn at the first the way the small ones are to go, with which you finish; this turning aiding much thereto. And for finishing them, instead of hatching or dotting, you draw small strokes very fine, and very close to one another, without crofting; repassing several times, till your dark and your clear parts have all the force you would give them.\n\nOf Roses.—After making your first sketch, draw with carmine the red rose, and apply a very pale lay of carmine and white. Then form the shades with the same colour, putting less white in it: and lastly, with pure\nOf pure carmine, but very bright and clear at the first; fortifying it more and more as you proceed in your work, and according to the darkness of the shades. This is done by large strokes. Then finish; working upon it with the same colour by little strokes, which you must make go the same way with those of the graving, if it be a print you copy; or the way the leaves of the rose turn, if you copy after a painting, or after nature; losing the dark in the clear parts, and heightening the greatest lights, and the brightest or most lightsome leaves, with white and a little carmine. You must always make the hearts of roses, and the side of the shadow darker than the rest; and mix a little indigo for shadowing the first leaves, particularly when the roses are blown, to make them seem faded. The feed is dead-coloured with gamboge; with which a little sap-green is mixed for shadowing. Roses streaked with several colours, ought to be paler than others, that the mixture of colours may be better seen; which are done with carmine; a little darker in the shades, and very clear in the lights; always hatching by strokes. For white roses you must put a lay of white, and form and finish them as the red; but with black, white, and a little bistre; and make the feed a little yellower. Yellow roses are done by putting in every part a lay of masticot, and shadowing them with gamboge, gallstone, and bistre; heightening the clear and light places with masticot and white.\n\nThe stiles, the leaves, and the buds of all sorts of roses are formed with verditer, with which is mixed a little masticot and gamboge; and for shadowing them, they add sap-green, putting less of the other colours when the shades are deep. The outside of the leaves ought to be bluer than the inside; therefore it must be dead-coloured with sea green, and sap green mixed with that for shadowing, making the veins or fibres on this side clearer than the ground, and those on the other side darker. The prickles which are upon the stiles and buds of roses, are done with little touches of carmine, which are made to go every way; and for those that are upon the stalks, they are formed with verditer and carmine, and shadowed with carmine and bistre; making the bottom of the stalks more reddish than the top, i.e., you must mix with the green carmine and pure bistre.\n\nOf Tulips.—As there is an infinity of tulips, different from one another, one cannot pretend to mention the colours with which they are all done. We will only touch upon the handiwork, called streaked; and these streaks are dead-coloured with very clear carmine in some places, and with darker in others; finishing with the same colour by little strokes, which must be carried the same way with the streaks. And in others is put first a lay of vermilion. Then they form them by mixing carmine, and finish them with pure carmine. In some they put Florence lake over the vermilion instead of carmine. Some are done with lake and carmine mixed together, and with lake alone, or with white and lake for the first forming; whether it be rosy pink or Florence lake. There are some of a purple colour, which are formed with ultramarine, carmine, or lake, sometimes bluer and sometimes redder. The manner of doing both one and the other is the same; there is no difference but in the colours. You must, in certain places, as between the streaks of vermilion, carmine, or lake, sometimes put blue made of ultramarine and white, and sometimes a very bright purple, which is finished by strokes as the rest, and lost with the streaks. There are some likewise that have fawn tints, that are made with lake, bistre, and ochre, according as they are; but this is only in fine and rare tulips, and not in the common ones. For shadowing the bottom of them, they ordinarily take indigo and white for such whose streaks are of carmine. For such as are of lake, they take black and white; with which, in some, bistre is mixed, and in others green. Some are likewise to be shadowed with gamboge and umber, and always by strokes and traces, that turn as the leaves turn. Other tulips are likewise done, called bordered; that is to say, the tulip is not streaked but on the edges of the leaves, where there is a border. It is white in the purple; red in the yellow; yellow in the red; and red in the white. The purple is laid with ultramarine, carmine, and white; shadowing and finishing it with this mixture. The border is spared; that is to say, let only a light lay of white be put there, and let it be shadowed with very bright indigo. The yellow is formed with gamboge, and shadowed with the same colour, mixing ochre and umber or bistre with it. The border is laid with vermilion, and finished with a very small matter of carmine. The red is formed with vermilion, and finished with the same colour, mixing carmine or lake with it. The bottom and the border are done with gamboge; and for finishing, they add gallstone and umber, or bistre. The white is shadowed with black, blue, and white. Indian ink is very proper for this. The shadowings of it are very tender. It produces alone the effect of blue and white, mixed with the other black. The border of this white tulip is done with carmine. In all these sorts of tulips, they leave a nerve or finew in the middle of the leaves that are brighter than the rest; and the borders are drowned at the bottom by small traces, turning crooked; for they must not appear cut and separated, as the streaked or party-coloured. They make them likewise of several other colours. When they happen to be such whose bottoms on the inside are black, as it were, they form and finish them with indigo, as also the feed about the nozzle or stalk. And if the bottom is yellow, it is formed with gamboge, and finished by adding umber or bistre. The leaves and the stalks of tulips are ordinarily formed with sea green, and shadowed and finished with lily green, by large traces all along the leaves. Some may likewise be done with verditer, mixing masticot with it, and shadowed with sap green, that the green of the shades may be yellower.\n\nThe Anemony, or Wind flower.—There are several sorts of them, as well double as single. The last are ordinarily without streaks. Some are made of a purple colour, with purple and white, shadowing them with the same colour; some redder, others bluer; sometimes very pale, and sometimes very dark. Others are formed with lake and white, and finished with the same, putting less white; some without any white at all. Others are formed with vermilion, and shadowed with the same colour; adding carmine. We see likewise white ones, and some of a citron colour. The last are laid with masticot; and one and the other, shadowed\nshadowed and finished sometimes with vermilion, and sometimes with very brown lake, especially near the feed, at the bottom; which is often likewise of a blackish colour, that is done with indigo, or black and blue, mixing for some a little bitre; and always working by very fine strokes and traces, and losing the lights in the shades. There are others that are brighter and clearer at the bottom than anywhere else; and sometimes they are perfectly white there, though the rest of the flower be dark. The feed of all these anemones is done with indigo and black, with a very little white, and shadowed with indigo; and in some it is raised with masticot. The double anemones are of several colours. The handsomest have their large leaves streaked. Some are done, that is, the streaked or partly coloured, with vermilion, to which carmine is added for the finishing; shadowing the rest of the leaves with indigo; and for the small leaves within, a lay is put of vermilion and white, and they are shadowed with vermilion mixed with carmine, mixing here and there some stronger touches, especially in the heart of the flower, next the great leaves on the side of the shadow. They finish with carmine, by little strokes and traces, turning the same way with the mixed or partly colours, and the leaves. They form and finish the streaks or party colours of some others, as well as the small leaves, with pure carmine; leaving, nevertheless, in the middle of the leaf, a little circle, in which is laid dark purple, which is lost with the rest. And when all is finished, they give some touches with this same colour round about the small leaves, especially on the side of the shadow, drowning them with the large ones, the remainder of which is shadowed either with indigo or black. In some, the small leaves are done with lake or purple, though the party colours of the large ones be done with carmine. There are others, whose mixed colours are done with carmine, in the middle of most of the large leaves; putting in some places vermilion underneath, and losing these colours with the shadows of the bottom; which are done with indigo and white. The small leaves are laid with masticot, and shadowed with very dark carmine on the side of the shade, and with very clear on the side of the light, leaving there in a manner pure masticot, and giving only some little touches with orpiment and carmine, to separate the leaves, which may be shadowed sometimes with a very little pale green. There are double anemones painted all red, and all purple. The first are formed with vermilion and carmine, in a manner without white, and shadowed with pure carmine, well gummed, that they may be very dark. Purple anemones are laid with purple, and white, and finished with white. In a word, there are double anemones as there are single ones, of all colours; and they are done in the same manner. The green of one and the other is verditer; with which masticot is mixed for forming. It is shadowed and finished with sap green. The files of them are a little reddish; wherefore they are shadowed with carmine mixed with bitre, and sometimes with green, after having laid them with masticot.\n\nThe Carnation and the Pink.—It is with pinks and carnations as with anemones and tulips; that is, there are some mixt-coloured, and others of one single colour. The first are streaked and diversified sometimes with vermilion and carmine; sometimes with pure lake, or with white; some streaks very dark, and others very pale; sometimes by little streaks and diversifications, and sometimes by large ones. Their bottoms are ordinarily shadowed with indigo and white. There are pinks of a very pale flesh colour, and streaked and diversified with another, a little deeper, made with vermilion and lake. Others, which are of lake and white, are shadowed and streaked without white. Others all red, which are done with vermilion and carmine as dark as possible. Others all of lake. And, lastly, there are others, wherein nature or fancy is the rule. The green of one and the other is sea green, shadowed with lily green or sap green.\n\nThe Red Lily.—It is laid with red lead, formed with vermilion, and in the deepest of the shades with carmine; and finished with the same colour by strokes and traces, turning as the leaves turn. The clear and light parts are heightened with red lead and white. The feed is done with vermilion and carmine. The green parts are done with verditer, shadowed with lily or sap green.\n\nThe Day Lily.—There are three sorts of them:\n\n1. The gridelin, a little red;\n2. The gridelin, very pale; and,\n3. The white.\n\nFor the first they put a lay of lake and white, and shadow and finish with the same colour deeper; mixing a little black to deaden it, especially in the darkest places.\n\nThe second are laid with white, mixed with a very little lake and vermilion, in such a manner that these two last colours are hardly seen. Afterwards they shadow with black and a little lake, working redder in the middle of the leaves, next the stalks; which ought to be, as also the feed, of the same colour, particularly towards the top; and at the bottom a little greener.\n\nThe file of the feed is laid with masticot, and shadowed with sap green.\n\nThe other day lilies are done by putting a lay of pure white, and shadowing and finishing with black and white.\n\nThe stalks of these last, and the greens of them all, are done with sea green, and shadowed with sap green.\n\nThe Hyacinth, or Purple Flower.—There are four sorts of them:\n\n- The blue, a little dark;\n- Others paler;\n- The gridelin;\n- And the white.\n\nThe first are laid with ultramarine and white; and shadowed and finished with less white. Others are laid and shadowed with pale blue. The gridelines are formed with lake and white, and a very small matter of ultramarine; and finished with the same colour a little deeper. For the last they put a lay of white; then they shadow them with black, with a little white; and finish them all by strokes and traces, following the turnings and windings of the leaves. The green and the stalks of such as are blue, are done with sea and lily green very dark; and in the stalks of the first may be mixed a little carmine, to make them reddish. The stalks of the two others, as also the green, are\nare formed with verditer and masticot, and shadowed with sap green.\n\nThe Piony.—A lay of Venice lake and white must be put on all parts, pretty strong; then shadow with leaf white, and with none at all in the darkest places; after which finish with the same colour by traces, turning them as for the rose; gumming it very much in the deepest of the shades, and raising the lights and the edges of the most lightsome leaves with white and a little lake. Little veins are likewise made, which go like the strokes in hatching, but are more visible. The green of this flower is done with sea green, and shadowed with sap green.\n\nCowslips.—They are of four or five colours. There are some of a very pale purple.\n\nThe gridelin. The white and the yellow.\n\nThe purple is done with ultramarine, carmine, and white; putting leaf white for shadowing. The gridelin is laid with Venice lake, and a very small matter of ultramarine, with much white; and shadowed with the same colour deeper. For the white a lay of white must be put; and they must be shadowed with black and white; and finished, as the others, by traces or strokes. The heart of these cowslips is done with masticot in the shape of a star, which is shadowed with gamboge, making a little circle in the middle with sap green. The yellow are laid with masticot, and shadowed with gamboge and umber. The stiles, the leaves, and the buds, are formed with verditer, mixed with a little masticot, and finished with sap green; making the fibres or veins, which appear upon the leaves, with this same colour; and heightening the lights of the largest with masticot.\n\nThe Ranunculus, or Crow-foot.—There are several sorts of them: the finest are the orange-coloured. For the first, they put a lay of vermilion, with a very small matter of gamboge; and add carmine for shadowing; finishing it with this last colour, and a little gallstone. In the others may be put Venice lake instead of carmine, especially in the heart of the flower. The orange-coloured are laid with gamboge, and finished with gallstone, vermilion, and a little carmine; leaving some little yellow streaks. The green of the stiles is done with verditer and very pale masticot; mixing lily green to shadow them. That of the leaves is a little darker.\n\nThe Crocus.—These are of two colours:\n\nYellow and purple. The yellow are formed with masticot and gallstone, and shadowed with gamboge and gallstone; after which, upon each leaf, on the outside, are made three streaks, separate from one another, with bistre and pure lake; which are left, by little traces, in the bottom. The outside of the leaves is left all yellow.—The purple is laid with carmine, mixed with a little ultramarine, and very pale white. They are formed and finished with leaf white; making likewise, in some, purple stripes or streaks, very dark, as in the yellow; and in others only small veins. The feed of both is yellow, and is done with orpiment and gallstone. For the stiles, they put a lay of white, and shadow with black, mixed with a little green. The green of this flower is formed with very pale verditer, and shadowed with sap green.\n\nThe Iris.—The Persian iris is done by putting, for the inside leaves, a lay of white, and shadowing them with indigo and green together, leaving a little white separation in the middle of each leaf; and for those on the outside, they put in the same place a lay of masticot, which is shadowed with galilone and orpiment; making little dark and longish dots over all the leaf, at a small distance from one another. And at the end of each are made large strains, with bistre and lake in some, and in others with pure indigo, but very black. The rest, and the outside of the leaves, are shadowed with black. The green is formed with sea green, and very pale masticot, and shadowed with sap green. The Sufian iris is laid with purple and white, putting a little more carmine than ultramarine; and for the shades, especially in the middle leaves, they put leaf white; and, on the contrary, more ultramarine than carmine; making the veins of this very colour, and leaving in the middle of the inside leaves a little yellow finew. There are others which have this very finew in the first leaves; the end of which only is bluer than the rest. Others are shadowed and finished with the same purple, redder: They have also the middle finew on the outside leaves; but white and shadowed with indigo. There are likewise yellow ones; which are done by putting a lay of masticot and orpiment; shadowing them with galilone, and making the veins upon the leaves with bistre. The green of one and the other is done with sea green, mixing a little masticot for the stiles. They are shadowed with sap green.\n\nThe Jasmine.—It is done with a lay of white, and shadowed with black and white; and for the outside of the leaves, they mix a little bistre; making the half of each, on this side, a little reddish with carmine.\n\nThe Tuberosé.—For the doing of this, they make a lay of white, and shadow with black, with a little bistre in some places; and for the outside of the leaves they mix a little carmine, to give them a reddish tint, particularly upon the extremities. The feed is done with masticot, and shadowed with sap green. The green of it is laid with verditer, and shadowed with sap green.\n\nThe Hellebore.—The flower of hellebore is done almost in the same manner; that is, let it be laid with white, and shadowed with black and bistre, making the outside of the leaves a little reddish here and there. The feed is laid with dark green, and raised with masticot. The green of it is foul and rusty, and is formed with verditer, masticot, and bistre; and finished with sap green and bistre.\n\nThe White Lily.—It is laid with white, and shadowed with black and white. The feed is done with orpiment and gallstone. And the green is done as in the tuberosé.\n\nThe Snow-drop.—It is formed and finished as the white lily. The feed is laid with masticot, and shadowed with gallstone. And the green is done with sea and sap green.\n\nThe Jonquil.—It is laid with masticot and gallstone, and finished with gamboge and gallstone. The green is formed with sea green, and shadowed with sap green.\n\nThe Daffodil.—All daffodils, the yellow, the double, and the single, are done by putting a lay of masticot: they are formed with gamboge, and finished by adding umber and bistre; excepting the bell in the middle, which is done with orpiment and gallstone.\nbordered or edged with vermilion and carmine. The white are laid with white, and shadowed with black and white; excepting the cup or bell, which is done with masticot and gamboge. The green is sea green, shadowed with sap green.\n\nThe Marigold.—It is done by putting a lay of masticot, and then one of gamboge; shadowing it with this very colour, after vermilion is mixed with it: and for finishing, they add gallstone and a little carmine. The green is done with verditer, shadowed with sap green.\n\nThe Austrian Rose.—For making the Austrian rose, they put a lay of masticot, and another of gamboge. Then they form it, mixing gallstone; and finish it with the last colour, adding bititre and a very small matter of carmine in the deepest shades.\n\nThe Indian Pink, or French Marigold.—It is done by putting a lay of gamboge; shadowing it with this colour, after you have mixed a good deal of carmine and gallstone with it; and leaving about the leaves a little yellow border of gamboge, very clear in the lights, and darker in the shades. The feed is shadowed with bititre. The green, as well of the rose as the pink, is formed with verditer, and finished with sap green.\n\nThe Sunflower.—It is formed with masticot and gamboge, and finished with gallstone and bititre. The green is laid with verditer and masticot, and shadowed with sap green.\n\nThe Passionflower.—It is done as the rose, and the green of the leaves likewise; but the veins are done with a darker green.\n\nPoetical Pinks and Sweet William.—They are done by putting a lay of lake and white; shadowing them with pure lake, with a little carmine for the last; which are afterwards dotted on all parts with little round dots, separate from one another; and the threads in the middle are raised with white. The green of them is sea green, which is finished with sap green.\n\nThe Scabious.—There are two sorts of scabious, the red and the purple. The leaves of the first are laid with Florentine lake, in which there is a little white; and shadowed without white; and for the middle, which is a great blos or bulk in which the feed lies, it is formed and finished with pure lake, with a little ultramarine or indigo to make it darker. Then they make little white length dots over it, at a pretty distance from one another, clearer in the light than in the shade, making them go every way. The other is done by putting a lay of very pale purple, as well upon the leaves as the blos in the middle; shadowing both with the same colour, a little deeper; and instead of little white touches for the feed, they make them purple; and about each grain they make out a little circle, and this over the whole blos or bulk in the middle. The green is formed with verditer and masticot, and shadowed with sap green.\n\nThe Sword or Day Lily.—It is laid with Florence lake and very pale white; formed and finished with pure lake, very clear and bright in some places, and very dark in others; mixing even bititre in the thickest of the shades. The green is verditer, shadowed with sap green.\n\nHeraticca, or Liverwort.—There is red and blue. The last is done by putting on all parts a lay of ultramarine, white, and a little carmine or lake; shadowing the inside of the leaves with the mixture, but deeper; excepting those of the first rank; for which, and for the outside of every one of them, they add indigo and white, that the colour may be paler, and not so fine. The red is laid with lake cumbbine and very pale white; and finished with leaf white. The green is done with verditer, masticot, and a little bititre; and shadowed with sap green, and a little bititre, especially on the outside of the leaves.\n\nThe Pomegranate.—The flower of the pomegranate is laid with red lead shadowed with vermilion and carmine; and finished with this last colour. The green is laid with verditer and masticot, and shadowed with sap green.\n\nThe flower of the Indian Bean.—It is done with a lay of Levant lake and white; shadowing the middle leaves with pure lake; and adding a little ultramarine for the others. The green is verditer, shadowed with sap green.\n\nThe Columbine.—There are columbines of several colours: the most common are the purple, the gridelin, and the red. For the purple, they lay with ultramarine, carmine, and white; and shadow with this mixture deeper. The gridelin are done the same way, putting a great deal less ultramarine than carmine. The red are done with lake and white, finishing with less white. There are some mixed flowers of this kind, of several colours; which must be formed and finished as the others, but paler, making the mixtures of a little darker colour.\n\nThe Lark's Heel.—These are of different colours, and of mixed colours: the most common are the purple, the gridelin and the red; which are done as the columbines.\n\nViolets and Pansies.—Violets and pansies are done the same way; excepting that in the last the two middle leaves are bluer than the others, that is, the borders or edges; for the inside of them is yellow; and there little back veins are made, which take their beginning from the heart of the flower, and die away towards the middle.\n\nThe Muscipula, or Catch-fly.—There are two sorts of it, the white and the red; the last is laid with lake and white, with a little vermilion, and finished with pure lake. As for the knot or nozzle of the leaves, it is formed with white and a very small matter of vermilion, mixing bititre or gallstone to finish it. The leaves of the white are laid with white; adding bititre and masticot upon the knots which are shadowed with pure bititre, and the leaves with black and white. The green of all these flowers is done with verditer and masticot, and shadowed with sap green.\n\nThe Crown Imperial—which is of two colours, the yellow and the red. The first is done by putting a lay of orpiment, and shadowing it with gallstone and orpiment with a little vermilion. The other is laid with orpiment and vermilion, and shadowed with gallstone and vermilion; making the beginning of the leaves next the file, with lake and bititre, very dark; and veins with this mixture both in one and the other, all along the leaves. The green is done with verditer and masticot, shadowed with sap green and gamboge.\n\nThe Cyclamen, or Snowdrop.—The red is laid with\nMINIM, in Music, a note equal to two crotchets, or half a semiflave. See Music.\n\nMINIMS, a religious order in the church of Rome, founded by St Francis de Paula, towards the end of the 15th century. Their habit is a coarse black woollen stuff, with a woollen girdle, of the same colour, tied in five knots. They are not permitted to quit their habit and girdle night nor day. Formerly they went barefooted, but are now allowed the use of shoes.\n\nMINIMUM, in the higher geometry, the least quantity attainable in a given case.\n\nMINISTER, a person who preaches, performs religious worship in public, administers the sacraments, &c.\n\nMINISTER OF STATE, a person to whom the prince intrusts the administration of government. See COUNCIL.\n\nForeign MINISTER, is a person sent into a foreign country, to manage the affairs of his province or of the state to which he belongs. Of these there are two kinds: those of the first rank are ambassadors and envoys extraordinary, who represent the persons of their sovereigns; the ministers of the second rank are the ordinary residents.\n\nMINIUM, or RED-LEAD. See Chemistry Index.\n\nMINNIN, a stringed instrument of music among the ancient Hebrews, having three or four chords to it, although there is reason to question the antiquity of this instrument; both because it requires a hair bow, which was a kind of plectrum not known to the ancients, and because it so much resembles the modern viol. Kircher took the figures of this, the nachal, chinnor, and psalter, from an old book in the Vatican library.\n\nMINOR,\nMINOR, a Latin term, literally denoting left; used in opposition to major, greater.\n\nMINOR, in Law, denotes a person under age; or who, by the laws of the country, is not yet arrived at the power of administering his own affairs, or the possession of his estate. Among us, a person is a minor till the age of twenty-one, before which time his acts are invalid. See AGE, and INFANT.\n\nIt is a maxim in the common law, that in the king there is no minority, and therefore he hath no legal guardian; and his royal grants and acts to acts of parliament are good, though he has not in his natural capacity attained the legal age of twenty-one. It is also provided by the custom and law of parliament, that no one shall sit or vote in either house, unless he be twenty-one years of age. This is likewise expressly declared by stat. 7. and 8 Will. III. cap. 25. with regard to the house of commons.\n\nMINOR, in Logic, is the second proposition of a formal or regular syllogism, called also the assumption.\n\nMINOR, in Music, is applied to certain concords, which differ from or are lower than others of the same denomination by a lesser semitone or four commas.—Thus we say, a third minor, or lesser third, or a sixth major and minor. Concords that admit of major and minor, i.e. greater and less, are said to be imperfect concords.\n\nMINORCA, an island of the Mediterranean, situated between 39 and 40 degrees of north latitude, and near four degrees of east longitude. It is about 33 miles in length from north-west to south-east, in breadth from eight to twelve, but in general about ten miles; so that in size it may nearly equal the county of Huntingdon or Bedfordshire. The form is very irregular; and the coasts are much indented by the sea, which forms a great number of little creeks and inlets, some of which might be very advantageous.\n\nThis island is one of those called by the ancient Romans Baleares, which arose from the dexterity of the inhabitants in using the sling. It fell under the power of the Romans, afterwards of the northern barbarians, who destroyed that empire. From them it was taken by the Arabs; who were subdued by the king of Majorca, and he by the king of Spain. The English subdued it in 1708; it was afterwards retaken by the French in 1756, but restored to Britain by the treaty of Paris in 1763. The Spaniards took it in 1782; and in 1798, it again became subject to Great Britain.\n\nThe air of this island is much more clear and pure than in Britain; being seldom darkened with thick fogs; yet the low valleys are not free from mists and unwholesome vapours; and in windy weather the spray of the sea is driven over the whole island. Hence it happens that utensils of brass or iron are extremely susceptible of rust, in spite of all endeavours to preserve them; and household furniture becomes mouldy. The summers are dry, clear, calm, and excessively hot; the autumns moist, warm, and unequal; at one time perfectly serene, at another cloudy and tempestuous. During the winter there are sometimes violent storms, though neither frequent nor of long continuance; and whenever they cease, the weather returns to its usual serenity. The spring is always variable, but resembles the winter more than the summer. The changes of heat and cold are neither so great nor so sudden in this climate as in Minorca, many others. In the compass of a year, the thermometer seldom rises much above the 80th, or falls below the 48th degree. In summer there is scarcely ever a difference of four or five degrees between the heat of the air at noon and at night: and in winter the variation is still less considerable. But this must be understood of a thermometer shaded from the influence of the solar beams: for if exposed to them it will often rise 12, 14, or 16 degrees higher than what we have mentioned; and in other seasons the difference between the heat of the air in the sun and the shade is much greater. Yet even in the dog-days, the heat of the atmosphere, at least in open places, seldom surpasses that of human blood. The winds are very boisterous about the equinoxes, and sometimes during the winter. At other times they are generally moderate, and, according to the observations of seamen, they rarely blow in the same direction near the islands adjacent to the gulf of Lyons as in the open sea. During the summer there is commonly a perfect calm in the mornings and evenings; but the middle of the day is cooled by refreshing breezes which come from the east, and, following the course of the sun, increase gradually till two or three in the afternoon, after which they insensibly die away as night approaches. This renders the heat of the sun less dangerous and inconvenient; and if these breezes intermit for a day or two, the natives grow languid and inactive from the heat. The northerly winds in general are clear and healthy, dispel the mists, and make a clear blue sky; whilst those which blow from the opposite quarter, render the air warm, moist, and unhealthy. The north wind is superior in power to all the rest; which appears from hence, that the tops of all the trees incline to the south, and the branches on the north side are bare and blasted. The next to it in force is the north-west. Both are frequent towards the close of winter and in the spring; and, being dry and cold, they shrivel up the leaves of the vegetables, destroy their tender shoots, and are often excessively detrimental to the vineyards and rising corn. The piercing blasts at that season from the north-east, as they are more moist, and more frequently attended with rain, are less prejudicial. The south and south-east winds are by much the most unhealthy. In whatever seasons they blow, the air is foggy, and affects the breathing; but in the summer season they are sultry and suffocating. An excessive dejection of spirits is then a universal complaint; and on exposing the thermometer to the rays of the sun, the mercury has frequently risen above the 100th degree. The west wind is usually drier than the south: the east is cold and blistering in the spring, and sultry in the summer.\n\nThe weather in Minorca is generally fair and dry; but when it rains, the showers are heavy, though of short continuance, and they fall most commonly in the night. The sky in summer is clear, and of a beautiful azure, without clouds or rain; but moderate dews descend regularly after sunset. In autumn the weather becomes less serene; whirlwinds and thunder become frequent; and in the night time lightning, and those meteors called falling stars, are very common. Water spouts also are often seen at that season, and frequently break upon the shore. A sudden alteration in the weather takes place about the autumnal equinox; the skies are\nMinorca are darkened with clouds, and the rains fall in such quantities, that the torrents thereby occasioned, pouring down from the hills, tear up trees by the root, carry away cattle, break down fences, and do considerable mischief to the gardens and vineyards. But these annual heavy rains are much more violent than lasting; always falling in sudden and heavy showers, with intervals of fair weather. They are accompanied with thunder, lightning, and squalls of wind, most commonly from the north. Hail and snow are often intermixed with the rains which fall in winter and in spring; but the snow, for the most part, dissolves immediately; and ice is here an uncommon appearance.\n\nThe whole coast of Minorca lies low; and there are only a few hills near the centre, of which the most considerable, named Toro by the inhabitants, may be seen at the distance of 12 or 14 leagues from the land. The surface of the island is rough and unequal; and in many places divided by long narrow vales of a considerable depth, called barancos by the natives. They begin towards the middle of the island, and after several windings terminate at the sea. The south-west side is more plain and regular than towards the north-east; where the hills are higher, with low marshy valleys betwixt them, the soil less fruitful, and the whole tract unhealthy to man and beast. Near the towns and villages the fields are well cultivated, and enclosed with stone walls; but the rest for the most part are rocky, or covered with woods and thickets. There are some pools of standing water, but very few rivulets, which is the greatest defect about the island, as the inhabitants have scarcely any wholesome water excepting what is saved from the clouds.\n\nThe soil is light, thin, and very stony, with a good deal of sea salt, and, in some places, of calcareous nitre intermixed. In most places there is so little earth, that the island appears to be but one large irregular rock, covered here and there with mould, and an infinite variety of stones. Notwithstanding this, however, it is not only extremely proper for vineyards, but produces more wheat and barley than could at first sight be imagined; and if the peasants may be credited, it would always yield a quantity of corn and wine sufficient for the natives, did not the violence of the winds, and the excessive drought of the weather, frequently spoil their crops. The fields commonly lie fallow for two years, and are sown the third. About the latter end of winter, or the beginning of spring, they are first broken up; and next autumn, as soon as the rains fall, they are again ploughed and prepared for receiving the proper seeds. The tillage is very easily performed; for a plough so light as to be transported from place to place on the ploughman's shoulder, and to be drawn by a heifer, or an ass sometimes assisted by an ox, is sufficient for opening so thin a soil. The later the harvest happens, the more plentiful it proves. The barley is usually cut down about the 20th of May and the wheat is reaped in June, so that the whole harvest is commonly got in by Midsummer day. The grain is not thrashed with flails as in this country, but trodden out on a smooth piece of rock by oxen and asses, according to the custom of the eastern nations.\n\nThe natives of Minorca are commonly lean, thin, and well-built, of a middle stature, and olive complexion; but their character is by no means agreeable. Such is the natural impetuosity of their temper, that the slightest cause provokes them to anger, and they seem to be incapable of forgiving or forgetting an injury. Hence quarrels break out daily, even among neighbours and relations; and family disputes are transmitted from father to son; and thus, though lawyers and petty-generals are very numerous in this country, there are still too few for the clients. Both sexes are, by constitution, extremely amorous: they are often betrothed to each other while children, and marry at the age of 14. The women have easy labours, and commonly return in a few days to their usual domestic business; but, lest the family should become too numerous for their income, it is a practice among the poorer sort to keep their children at the breast for two or three years, that by this means the mothers may be hindered from breeding.\n\nBread of the finest wheat flour, well fermented and well baked, is more than half the diet of people of all ranks. Rice, pulse, vermicelli, herbs and roots from the garden, summer fruits, pickled olives and pods of the Guinea pepper, make up almost all the other half, so that scarce a fifth of their whole food is furnished from the animal kingdom, and of this fifth makes by much the most considerable portion. On Fridays, and other fast days, they abstain entirely from flesh; and during Lent they live altogether on vegetables and fish, excepting Sundays, when they are permitted the use of eggs, cheese, and milk. Most of their dishes are highly-seasoned with pepper, cloves, cinnamon, and other spices; and garlic, onions, or leeks, are almost constant ingredients. They eat a great deal of oil, and that none of the sweetest or best flavoured; using it not only with salads, but also with boiled and fried fish, greens, pulse, &c., instead of butter. A slice of bread soaked in boiled water, with a little oil and salt, is the common breakfast of the peasants, well known by the name of oleagua. Their ordinary meals are very frugal, and consist of very little variety; but on festivals and other solemn occasions their entertainments are to the last degree profuse and extravagant, inasmuch that the bill of fare of a country farmer's wedding dinner would scarce be credited.\n\nWith regard to other matters, the Minorquins are accused of prodigious indolence in the way of business, and neglect of the natural advantages they possess. In the bowels of the earth are iron, copper, and lead ores, of none of which any use hath been made except the last. A lead mine was worked to advantage some time ago, and the ore sent into France and Spain for the use of the potters in those countries. The proprietor discontinued his work on some small discouragement; and indeed it is said, that these people are of all mankind the most easily put out of conceit with an undertaking that does not bring them in mountains of present gain, or that admits of the slightest probability of disappointing their most sanguine expectations; nor will their purse admit of many disappointments; and thus their poverty co-operating with their natural despondency and love of ease, is the principal cause of their backwardness to engage in projects, though ever so promising, for the improvement of their private fortune, and the advantage of the commerce of their country.\nMinorca country. This lead ore went under the name of vernis among the natives, as it was wholly used by the potters in varnishing and glazing their earthen vessels.\n\nThere are few exports of any account, and they are obliged to their neighbours for near one-third of their corn, all their oil, and such a variety of articles of less consideration, that nothing could prevent them from a total bankruptcy, but the English money circulated by the troops, which is exchanged for the daily supplies of provisions, increased by the multiplication of vineyards, the breeding of poultry, and the production of vegetables, in a proportion of at least five to one since the island has been in our possession. It will not require many words to enumerate their exports: they make a sort of cheese, little liked by the English, which sells in Italy at a very great price; this, perhaps, to the amount of 800l. per annum.—The wool they send abroad may produce 900l. more.—Some wine is exported; and, if we add to its value that of the home consumption, which has every merit of an export, being nine parts in ten taken off by the troops for ready money, it may well be estimated at 16,000l. a-year. In honey, wax, and salt, their yearly exports may be about 400l., and this comes pretty near the sum of their exports, which we estimate together at 18,100l. sterling per annum.\n\nA vast balance lies against them, if we consider the variety and importance of the articles they fetch from other countries, for which they must pay ready cash. Here it may be necessary to withdraw some things from the heap, such as their cattle, sheep, and fowls, on which they get a profit; for the country does not produce them in a sufficient abundance to supply them, especially when we have a fleet of men of war stationed there.\n\nTheir imports are, corn, cattle, sheep, fowls, tobacco, oil, rice, sugar, spices, hardware, and tools of all kinds; gold and silver lace; chocolate, or cocoa to make it; tobacco, timber, plank, boards, millstones, tobacco pipes, playing cards, turnery ware, seeds, soap, saddles; all manner of cabinetmakers work, iron spikes, nails, fine earthen ware, glass lamps, brassery; paper, and other stationary wares; copperas, galls, dye stuffs, painters brushes and colours; musical instruments, music, and strings; watches, wine, fruit; all manner of fine and printed linens, mullins, cambrics, and laces; bottles, corks, starch, indigo, fans, trinkets, toys, ribbands, tape, needles, pins, silk, mohair, lanthorns, cordage, tar, pitch, rosin, drugs, gloves, fire arms, gunpowder, shot, and lead; hats, caps, velvet, cotton stuffs, woollen cloths, stockings, capes, medals, vestments, lutes, pictures, images, agnus dei's, books, pardons, bulls, relics, and indulgencies.\n\nThe island is divided into what they style terminos, of which there were anciently five, now reduced to four, and resemble our counties. The termino of Ciutadella, at the north-western extremity of the island, is styled from this place, which was once a city, and the capital of Minorca. It makes a venerable and majestic figure, even in its present state of decay, having in it a large Gothic cathedral, some other churches and convents, the governor's palace, and an exchange, which is no contemptible pile.—There are in it 600 houses, which before the seat of government and the courts of justice were removed to Mahon, were fully inhabited; and Minorca, there are still more gentlemen's families here than in all the rest of the island. It hath a port commodious enough for the vessels employed in the trade of this country, which, though in the possession of a maritime power, is less than it formerly was. It is still, in the style of our officers, the best quarters (and there are none bad) in the country; and if there was a civil government, and the place made a free port, the best judges are of opinion it would very soon become a flourishing place again; and the fortifications, if it should be found necessary, might then also be easily restored and improved.\n\nThe termino of Ferrerias is the next, a narrow slip reaching across from sea to sea, and the country little cultivated; it is therefore united to Mercadal. In this last termino stands Mont-toro in the very centre of the isle, and the highest ground, some say the only mountain in it; on the summit of which there is a convent, where even in the hottest months the monks enjoy a cool air, and at all times a most delightful prospect. About six miles north from Mont-toro stands the castle that covers Port Fornelles, which is very spacious harbour on the east side of the island. There are in it shoals and foul ground, which, to those who are unacquainted with them, render it difficult and dangerous; yet the packets bound from Mahon to Marseilles frequently take shelter therein; and while the Spaniards were in possession of the isle, large ships and men of war frequented it. At a small distance from this lies another harbour called Ada, which runs far into the land; but being reputed unsafe, and being so near Fornelles, is at present useless. The country about it is, however, said to be the pleasantest and wholesomest spot in the island, and almost the only one plentifully supplied with excellent spring water; so that the gardens are well laid out, and the richest and finest fruits grow here in the highest perfection. Alaior is the next termino, in which there is nothing remarkable but the capital of the same name, well situated on an eminence, in a pleasant and tolerably cultivated country.\n\nThe termino of Mahon, at the south-east end of the island, is at present the most considerable of them all, containing about 60,000 English acres, and nearly one-half of the inhabitants in Minorca. The town of Mahon derives its name from the Carthaginian general Mago, who is universally allowed to be its founder.—It stands on an eminence on the west side of the harbour, the ascent pretty steep. There are in it a large church, three convents, the governor's palace, and some other public edifices. It is large, but the streets are winding, narrow and ill paved. The fortres of St Philip stands near the entrance of the harbour, which it covers, is very spacious, of great strength, with subterranean works to protect the garrison from bombs, large magazines, and whatever else is necessary to render it a complete fortification, and hath a numerous and well disposed artillery. Port Mahon is allowed to be the finest harbour in the Mediterranean, about 90 fathoms wide at its entrance, but within very large and safe, stretching a league or more into the land. Beneath the town of Mahon there is a very fine quay, one end of which is reserved for the ships of war, and furnished with all the accommodations necessary for careening and refitting them; the other serves for merchantmen.\nOn the other side of the harbour is Cape Mola, where it is generally agreed a fortress might be constructed which would be impregnable, as the castle of St Philip was esteemed before we took it, and bestowed so much money upon it, that, though some works were erected at Cape Mola, it was not judged proper to proceed in the fortifications there at a fresh expense; at least this is the only reason that hath been assigned. Minorca was taken by the Spaniards during the American war, and is now in their possession.\n\nMINORS, or FRIERS MINOR, an appellation which the Franciscans assume, out of show of humility; calling themselves fraters minores, i.e. lesser brothers, and sometimes minorites. There is also an order of regular minors at Naples, which was established in the year 1388, and confirmed by Sixtus V.\n\nMINOS, in Fabulous History, a king of Crete, son of Jupiter and Europa. He flourished about 1432 years before the Christian era. He gave laws to his subjects, which still remained in full force in the age of the philosopher Plato, about 1000 years after the death of the legislator. His justice and moderation procured him the appellation of the favourite of the gods, the confident of Jupiter, and the wise legislator, in every city of Greece; and, according to the poets, he was rewarded for his equity after death with the office of supreme and absolute judge in the infernal regions. In this capacity he is represented sitting in the middle of the shades, and holding a sceptre in his hand. The dead plead their different causes before him; and the impartial judge shakes the fatal urn, which is filled with the destinies of mankind. He married Ithona, by whom he had Lycaetes, who was the father of Minos II.\n\nMINOS II. was a son of Lycaetes, the son of Minos I., and king of Crete. He married Pasiphae, the daughter of Sol and Perseis, and by her he had many children. He increased his paternal dominions by the conquest of the neighbouring islands; but showed himself cruel in the war which he carried on against the Athenians, who had put to death his son Androgeus. He took Megara by the treachery of Scylla; and not satisfied with victory, he obliged the vanquished to bring him yearly to Crete seven chosen boys and the same number of virgins to be devoured by the Minotaur. This bloody tribute was at last abolished when Theseus had destroyed the monster. When Daedalus, whose industry and invention had fabricated the labyrinth, and whose imprudence in afflicting Pasiphae in the gratification of her unnatural desires, had offended Minos, fled from the place of his confinement with wings, and arrived safe in Sicily; the incensed monarch pursued the offender, resolved to punish his infidelity. Cocalus, king of Sicily, who had hospitably received Daedalus, entertained his royal guest with dissembled friendship; and, that he might not deliver to him a man whose ingenuity and abilities he so well knew, he put Minos to death. Minos died about 35 years before the Trojan war. He was father of Androgeus, Glaucon, and Deucalion; and two daughters, Phaedra, and Ariadne. Many authors have confounded the two Minoses, the grandfather and the grandson; but Homer, Plutarch, and Diodorus, prove plainly that they were two different persons.\n\nMINOTAUR, in Fabulous History, a celebrated monster, half a man and half a bull, according to this verse of Ovid,\n\n*Semitovemque virum, semivirumque bovem.*\n\nIt was the fruit of Pasiphae's amour with a bull. Minos refused to sacrifice a white bull to Neptune, an animal which he had received from the god for that purpose. This offended Neptune, and he made Pasiphae the wife of Minos enamoured of this fine bull, which had been refused to his altar. Daedalus profited his talents in being subservient to the queen's unnatural desires; and by his means, Pasiphae's horrible passions were gratified, and the Minotaur came into the world. Minos confined in the labyrinth this monster, which convinced the world of his wife's lasciviousness, and reflected disgrace upon his family. The Minotaur usually devoured the chosen young men and maidens which the tyranny of Minos yearly exacted from the Athenians. Theseus delivered his country from this tribute, when it had fallen to his lot to be sacrificed to the voracity of the Minotaur; and by means of Ariadne, the king's daughter, he destroyed the monster, and made his escape from the windings of the labyrinth.—The fabulous tradition of the Minotaur, and of the infamous commerce of Pasiphae with a favourite bull, has been often explained. Some suppose that Pasiphae was enamoured of one of her husband's courtiers called Taurus; and that Daedalus favoured the passions of the queen, by suffering his house to become the retreat of the two lovers. Pasiphae some time after brought twins into the world, one of whom greatly resembled Minos and the other Taurus; and in the natural resemblance of their countenance with that of their supposed fathers, originated their name, and consequently the fable of the Minotaur.\n\nMINOW, a very small species of cyprinus, so well known that it needs no description.\n\nMINSTER, (Saxon, Mynter or Mynstre), anciently signified the church of a monastery or convent.\n\nMINSTREL, an ancient term for a singer and instrumental performer.\n\nThe word minstrel is derived from the French *ménestrier*, and was not in use here before the Norman conquest. It is remarkable, that our old monkish historians do not use the word *citaredus*, *cantator*, or the like, to express a minstrel in Latin; but either *minus*, *histrion*, *joculator*, or some other word that implies *gloria*. Hence it should seem that the minstrels set off their fingering by mimicry or action; or, according to Dr Brown's hypothesis, united the powers of melody, poem, and dance.\n\nThe Saxons as well as the ancient Danes, had been accustomed to hold men of this profession in the highest reverence. Their skill was considered as something divine, their persons were deemed sacred, their attendance was solicited by kings, and they were everywhere loaded with honours and rewards. In short, poets and their art were held among them in that rude admiration which is ever shown by an ignorant people to such as excel them in intellectual accomplishments. When the Saxons were converted to Christianity, in proportion as letters prevailed among them this rude admiration began to abate, and poetry was no longer a peculiar profession. The poet and the minstrel became\ncame two persons. Poetry was cultivated by men of letters indiscriminately, and many of the most popular rhymes were composed amidst the leisure and retirement of monasteries. But the minstrels continued a distinct order of men, and got their livelihood by singing verses to the harp at the houses of the great. There they were still hospitably and respectfully received, and retained many of the honours shown to their predecessors the Bards and Scalds. And indeed, though some of them only recited the compositions of others, many of them still composed songs themselves; and all of them could probably invent a few stanzas on occasion. There is no doubt but most of the old heroic ballads were produced by this order of men. For although some of the larger metrical romances might come from the pen of the monks or others, yet the smaller narratives were probably composed by the minstrels who sung them. From the amazing variations which occur in different copies of these old pieces, it is evident they made no scruple to alter each other's productions, and the reciter added or omitted whole stanzas according to his own fancy or convenience.\n\nIn the early ages, as is hinted above, this profession was held in great reverence among the Saxon tribes, as well as among their Danish brethren. This appears from two remarkable facts in history, which show that the same arts of music and song were equally admired among both nations, and that the privileges and honours conferred upon the professors of them were common to both; as it is well known their customs, manners, and even language, were not in those times very dissimilar.\n\nWhen King Alfred the Great was desirous to learn the true situation of the Danish army, which had invaded his realm, he assumed the dress and character of a minstrel; and taking his harp, and only one attendant (for in the earliest times it was not unusual for a minstrel to have a servant to carry his harp), he went with the utmost security into the Danish camp. And though he could not but be known to be a Saxon, the character he had assumed procured him an hospitable reception; he was admitted to entertain the king at table, and stood among them long enough to contrive that assault which afterwards destroyed them. This was in the year 878.\n\nAbout 60 years after, a Danish king made use of the same disguise to explore the camp of King Athelstan. With his harp in his hand, and dressed like a minstrel, Anlaf, king of the Danes went among the Saxon tents, and taking his stand near the king's pavilion, began to play, and was immediately admitted. There he entertained Athelstan and his lords with his singing and his music; and was at length dismissed with an honourable reward, though his songs must have discovered him to have been a Dane. Athelstan was saved from the consequences of this stratagem by a soldier, who had observed Anlaf bury the money which had been given him, from some scruple of honour or motive of superstition. This occasioned a discovery.\n\nFrom the uniform procedure of both these kings, it is plain that the same mode of entertainment prevailed among both peoples, and that the minstrel was a privileged character among both. Even as late as the reign of Edward II, the minstrels were easily admitted into the royal presence, as appears from a passage in Stow, which also shows the splendour of their appearance.\n\n\"In the year 1316, Edward II did solemnize his feast of Pentecost at Westminster, in the great hall; where sitting royally at the table with his peers about him, there entered a woman adorned like a minstrel, fitting on a great horse trapped, as minstrels then used, who rode round about the tables, showing patience; and at length came up to the king's table and laid before him a letter, and forthwith turning her horse, saluted every one, and departed.\"—The subject of this letter was a remonstrance to the king on the favours heaped by him on his minions, to the neglect of his knights and faithful servants.\n\nThe messenger was sent in a minstrel's habit, as what would gain an easy admission; and was a woman concealed under that habit, probably to disarm the king's resentment; for we do not find that any of the real minstrels were of the female sex; and therefore conclude this was only an artful contrivance peculiar to that occasion.\n\nIn the 4th year of Richard II, John of Gaunt erected at Tetbury in Staffordshire a court of minstrels, with a full power to receive suit and service from the men of that profession within five neighbouring counties, to enact laws, and determine their controversies; and to apprehend and arrest such of them as should refuse to appear at the said court, annually held on the 16th of August. For this they had a charter, by which they were empowered to appoint a king of the minstrels with four officers to preside over them. These were every year elected with great ceremony; the whole form of which is described by Dr Plott; in whose time, however, they seem to have become mere musicians.\n\nEven so late as the reign of King Henry VIII, the reciters of verses or moral speeches learnt by heart, intruded without ceremony into all companies; not only in taverns, but in the houses of the nobility themselves. This we learn from Erasmus, whose argument led him only to describe a species of these men who did not sing their compositions; but the others that did, enjoyed without doubt the same privileges.\n\nWe find that the minstrels continued down to the reign of Elizabeth; in whose time they had lost much of their dignity, and were sinking into contempt and neglect. Yet still they sustained a character far superior to anything we can conceive at present of the singers of old ballads.\n\nWhen Queen Elizabeth was entertained at Killingworth castle by the earl of Leicester in 1575, among the many devices and pageants which were exhibited for her entertainment, one of the personages introduced was that of an ancient minstrel, whose appearance and dress are so minutely described by a writer there present, and gives us so distinct an idea of the character, that we shall quote the passage at large.\n\n\"A person very meet seemed he for the purpose, of a xlv. years old, apparelled partly as he would himself. His cap off: his head seemingly rounded tonsorwise: fair kembed, that, with a sponge daintly dipped in a little capon's grease, was finely smoothed, to make it shine like a mallard's wing. His beard snugly shaven;\"\nMINT\n\nMIN\n\nshaven; and yet his shirt after the new trink, with ruffs fair flarched, fleeced, and glittering like a pair of new shoes marthalled in good order with a setting stick, and strut, 'that' every ruff stood up like a wafer. A fide [i.e. long] gown of Kendale green, after the freshness of the year now, gathered at the neck with a narrow gorget, fastened afore with a white clasp and a keeper close up to the chin; but easily, for heat, to undo when he lift. Seemingly begirt in a red caddis girdle: from that a pair of capped Sheffield knives hanging at two sides. Out of his bosom drawn from a lappet of his napkin edged with a blue lace, and marked with a D for Damian; for he was but a bachelor yet.\n\n\"His gown had fide [i.e. long] sleeves down to midleg, slit from the shoulder to the hand, and lined with white cotton. His doublet sleeves of black worsted: upon them a pair of points of tawny chamlet laced along the wrist with blue threaden pointes. A wealt towards the hands of fustian-a-napes.

We suppose such as were retained by noble families wore their arms hanging down by a silver chain as a kind of badge. From the expression of Squire Minfrel above, we may conclude there were other inferior orders, as Yeomen Minfrels or the like.\n\nThis minfrel, the author tells us a little below, \"after three lowly courtesies, cleared his voice with a hem... and wiped his lips with the hollow of his hand for filing his napkin; tempered a string or two with his wrist; and, after a little warbling on his harp for a prelude, came forth with a solemn song, warranted for glory out of King Arthur's acts, &c.\"\n\nTowards the end of the 16th century, this class of men had lost all credit, and were sunk so low in the public opinion, that in the 39th year of Elizabeth a statute was passed by which \"minfrels, wandering abroad, were included among 'rogues, vagabonds, and flurdy beggars,\" and were adjudged to be punished as such.

See COINAGE.\n\nThere were anciently mints in almost every county in England; but the only mint at present in the British dominions is that in the tower of London. The officers of the mint are, 1. The warden of the mint, who is the chief; he oversees the other officers, and receives the bullion. 2. The master worker who receives bullion from the wardens, causes it to be melted, delivers it to the moneyers, and, when it is coined, receives it again. 3. The comptroller, who is the overseer of all the inferior officers, and sees that all the money is made to the just assize. 4. The assay master, who weighs the gold and silver, and sees that it is according to the standard. 5. The two auditors who take the accounts. 6. The surveyor of the melting; who, after the assay master has made trial of the bullion, sees that it is cast out, and not altered after it is delivered to the melter. 7. The engraver; who engravés the stamps and dies for the coinage of the money. 8. The clerk of the irons; who sees that the irons are clean and fit to work with. 9. The melter, who melts the bullion before it be coined. 10. The provost of the mint; who provides for and oversees all the moneyers. 11. The blanchers, who anneal and cleanse the money. 12. The moneyers; some of whom forge the money, some share it, some round and mill it, and some stamp and coin it. 13. The porters who keep the gate of the mint.\n\nMint was also a pretended place of privilege, in Southwark, near the King's Bench, put down by statute. If any persons, within the limits of the mint, shall obstruct any officer in the serving of any writ or process, &c., or assault any person therein, so as he receive any bodily hurt, the offender shall be guilty of felony, and be transported to the plantations, &c.\n\nStat. 9 Geo. I.\n\nMINT MARKS. It hath been usual, from old time, to oblige the masters and workers of the mint, in the indentures made with them, \"to make a privy mark in all the money that they made, as well of gold as of silver, so that another time they might know, if need were, and witte which moneys of gold and silver among other of the same moneys, were of their own making, and which not.\" And whereas, after every trial of the pix at Westminster, the masters and workers of the mint, having there proved their moneys to be lawful and good, were immediately entitled to receive their quietus under the great seal, and to be discharged from all suits or actions concerning those moneys, it was then usual for the said masters and workers to change the privy mark before used for another, that so the moneys from which they were not yet discharged might be distinguished from those for which they had already received their quietus: which new mark they then continued to stamp upon all their moneys, until another trial of the pix gave them also their quietus concerning those.\n\nThe pix is a strong box with three locks, whose keys are respectively kept by the warden, master, and comptroller of the mint; and in which are deposited, sealed up in several parcels, certain pieces taken at random out of every journey as it is called; that is, out of every 15 pounds weight of gold, or 60 pounds weight of silver, before the same is delivered to the proprietors. And this pix is, from time to time, by the king's command, opened at Westminster, in the presence of the lord-chancellor, the lords of the council, the lords-commissioners of the treasury, the justices of the several benches, and the barons of the exchequer; before whom a trial is made, by a jury of goldsmiths impannelled and sworn for that purpose, of the collective weights of certain parcels of the several pieces of gold and silver taken at random from those contained in the pix; after which those parcels being severally melted, assays are then made of the bullion.\nbullion of gold and silver so produced, by the melting certain small quantities of the same against equal weights taken from the respective trial pieces of gold and silver that are deposited and kept in the exchequer for that use. This is called the trial of the pix; the report made by the jury upon that trial is called the verdict of the pix for that time; and the indented trial pieces just above mentioned, are certain plates of standard gold and standard silver, made with the greatest care, and delivered in upon oath, from time to time as there is occasion, by a jury of the most able and experienced goldsmiths, summoned by virtue of a warrant from the lords of the treasury to the wardens of the mystery of goldsmiths of the city of London for that purpose; and which plates being so delivered in, are divided each, at this time, into seven parts by indentures, one of which parts is kept in his majesty's court of exchequer at Westminster, another by the said company of goldsmiths, and two more by the officers of his majesty's mint in the tower; the remaining three being for the use of the mint, &c., in Scotland. The pix has sometimes been tried every year, or even oftener, but sometimes not more than once in several years; and from hence is understood how it comes to pass, that, among the pieces that are dated as well as marked, three or more different dates are sometimes found upon pieces impressed with the same mark; and again, that different marks are found upon pieces bearing the same date. These marks are first observable upon the coins of King Edward III.; the words above quoted concerning those marks are from the indentures made with the lord Haftings, master and worker to King Edward IV.; and the marks themselves continued to be stamped very conspicuously upon the moneys, till the coinage by the mill and screw was introduced and settled after the Restoration, in the year 1662; since which time, the moneys being made with far greater regularity and exactness than before, these marks have either been totally laid aside, or such only have been used as are of a more secret nature, and only known to the officers and engravers concerned in the coinage; and indeed the constant practice that has ever since prevailed, of dating all the several pieces, has rendered all such marks of much less consequence than before.\n\nMINT. See MENTHA, BOTANY and Materia Medica, Index.\n\nMINUTURNÆ, a town of Campania, between Sinuessa and Formiae. It was in the marshes in this neighbourhood that Marius concealed himself in the mud to avoid the partizans of Sylla. The people condemned him to death; but when his voice alone had terrified the executioner, they showed themselves compassionate and favoured his escape.\n\nMINUET, a very graceful kind of dance, consisting of a coupee, a high step, and a balance: it begins with a beat, and its motion is triple.\n\nThe invention of the minuet seems generally to be ascribed to the French, and particularly to the inhabitants of the province of Poitou. The word is said by Menage and Furetiere to be derived from the French menu or menu, \"small, or little;\" and in strictness signifies a small pace. The melody of this dance consists of two strains, which, as being repeated, are called reprisal, each having eight or more bars, but never an odd number. The measure is three crotchets in a bar, and is thus marked $\\frac{3}{4}$, though it is commonly performed in the time $\\frac{3}{4}$. Walther speaks of a minuet in Lully's opera of Roland, each strain of which contains ten bars, the sectional number being 5; which renders it very difficult to dance.\n\nMINUTE, in Geometry, the 60th part of a degree of a circle.\n\nMINUTE of Time, the 60th part of an hour.\n\nMINUTE, in Architecture, usually denotes the 60th, sometimes the 30th, part of a module. See ARCHITECTURE.\n\nMinute is also used for a short memoir, or sketch of a thing taken in writing.\n\nMINUTIUS FELIX. See Felix.\n\nMINYÆ, a name given to the inhabitants of Orchomenos in Boeotia, from Minyas king of the country. Orchomenos the son of Minyas gave his name to the capital of the country; and the inhabitants still retained their original appellation, in contradiction to the Orchomenians of Arcadia. A colony of Orchomenians palled into Thessaly and settled in Kolchis; from which circumstance the people of the place, and particularly the Argonauts, were called Minyæ. This name they received, according to the opinion of some, not because a number of Orchomenians had settled among them, but because the chief and noblest of them were descended from the daughters of Minyas. Part of the Orchomenians accompanied the sons of Codrus when they migrated to Ionia. The descendants of the Argonauts, as well as the Argonauts themselves, received the name of Minyæ. They first inhabited Lemnos, where they had been born from the Lemnian women who had murdered their husbands. They were driven from Lemnos by the Pelasgi, about 1160 before the Christian era, and came to settle in Laconia, from whence they passed into Calliste with a colony of Macedonians.\n\nMIQUELETS, a name given to the Spaniards who inhabit the Pyrenean mountains on the frontiers of Arragon and Catalonia, and live by robbing.\n\nMIQUELON, a small desert island to the southwest of Cape May in Newfoundland, ceded to the French by the peace of 1763, for drying and curing their fish. W. Long, 54° 30'. N. Lat. 47° 22'.\n\nMIRABILIS, MARVEL OF PERU; a genus of plants belonging to the pentandria clas; and in the natural method ranking with those of which the order is doubtful. See BOTANY Index.\n\nMIRACLE, in its original sense, is a word of the same import with wonder; but in its usual and more appropriate signification, it denotes \"an effect contrary to the established constitution and course of things, or a sensible deviation from the known laws of nature.\"\n\nThat the visible world is governed by stated general rules, or that there is an order of causes and effects established in every part of the system of nature which falls under our observation, is a fact which cannot be controverted. If the Supreme Being, as some have supposed, be the only real agent in the universe, we have the evidence of experience, that, in the particular system to which we belong, he acts by stated rules. If he employs inferior agents to conduct the various motions from which the phenomena result, we have the same evidence that he has subject-\nMiracles ed those agents to certain fixed laws, commonly called the laws of nature. On either hypothesis, effects which are produced by the regular operation of these laws, or which are conformable to the established course of events, are properly called natural; and every contradiction to this constitution of the natural system, and the correspondent course of events in it, is called a miracle.\n\nIf this definition of a miracle be just, no event can be deemed miraculous merely because it is strange, or even to us unaccountable; since it may be nothing more than a regular effect of some unknown law of nature. In this country earthquakes are rare; and for monstrous births perhaps no particular and satisfactory account can be given: yet an earthquake is as regular an effect of the established laws of nature as any of those with which we are most intimately acquainted; and under circumstances in which there would always be the same kind of production, the monster is nature's genuine issue. It is therefore necessary, before we can pronounce any effect to be a true miracle, that the circumstances under which it is produced be known, and that the common course of nature be in some degree understood; for in all those cases in which we are totally ignorant of nature, it is impossible to determine what is, or what is not, a deviation from its course. Miracles, therefore, are not, as some have represented them, appeals to our ignorance. They suppose some antecedent knowledge of the course of nature, without which no proper judgment can be formed concerning them; though with it their reality may be so apparent as to prevent all possibility of a dispute.\n\nThus, were a physician to cure a blind man of cataract, by anointing his eyes with a chemical preparation which we had never before seen, and to the nature and effects of which we are absolute strangers, the cure would undoubtedly be wonderful; but we could not pronounce it miraculous, because, for anything known to us, it might be the natural effect of the operation of the unguent on the eye. But were he to recover his patient merely by commanding him to see, or by anointing his eyes with spittle, we should with the utmost confidence pronounce the cure to be a miracle; because we know perfectly that neither the human voice nor human spittle have, by the established constitution of things, any such power over the diseases of the eye. No one is now ignorant, that persons apparently dead are often restored to their families and friends, by being treated in the manner recommended by the Humane Society. To the vulgar, and sometimes even to men of science, these effects appear very wonderful; but as they are known to be produced by physical agency, they can never be considered as miraculous deviations from the laws of nature. On the other hand, no one could doubt of his having witnessed a real miracle who had seen a person that had been four days dead come alive out of his grave at the call of another, or who had even beheld a person exhibiting all the symptoms of death instantly resuscitated merely by being desired to live.\n\nThus easy is it, in all cases in which the course of nature is understood, to determine whether any particular event be really a miracle; while in circumstances where we know nothing of nature and its course, even a true miracle, were it performed, could not be admitted as such, or carry any conviction to the mind of a philosopher.\n\nIf miracles be effects contrary to the established constitution of things, we are certain that they will never be performed on trivial occasions. The constitution of things was established by the Creator and Governor of the universe, and is undoubtedly the offspring of infinite wisdom purposing a plan for the best of purposes. From this plan no deviation can be made but by God himself, or by some powerful being acting with his permission. The plans devised by wisdom are steady in proportion to their perfection, and the plans of infinite wisdom must be absolutely perfect. From this consideration, some men have ventured to conclude, that no miracle was ever wrought, or can rationally be expected; but mature reflection must soon satisfy us that all such conclusions are hasty.\n\nMan is unquestionably the principal creature in this world, and apparently the only one in it who is capable of being made acquainted with the relation in which he stands to his Creator. We cannot, therefore, doubt, but that such of the laws of nature as extend not their operation beyond the limits of this earth were established chiefly, if not solely, for the good of mankind; and if, in any particular circumstances, that good can be more effectually promoted by an occasional deviation from those laws, such a deviation may be reasonably expected. Were man, in the exercise of his mental and corporeal powers, subjected to the laws of physical necessity, the circumstances supposed would indeed never occur, and of course no miracle could be admitted. But such is not the nature of man.\n\nWithout repeating what has been said elsewhere (See Metaphysics, Part III, Chap. V.) of necessity and liberty, we shall here take it for granted, that the relation between motives and actions is different from that between cause and effect in physics; and that, mankind have such command over themselves, as that by their voluntary conduct, they can make themselves in a great degree either happy or miserable. We know likewise from history, that, by some means or other, almost all mankind were once sunk into the grossest ignorance of the most important truths; that they knew not the Being by whom they were created and supported; that they paid divine adoration to stocks, stones, and the vilest reptiles; and that they were slaves to the most impious, cruel, and degrading superstitions.\n\nFrom this depraved state it was surely not unworthy of the common \"Father of all\" to rescue his helpless creature, to enlighten their understandings that they might perceive what is right, and to present to them motives of sufficient force to engage them in the practice of it. But the understandings of ignorant barbarians cannot be enlightened by arguments; because of the force of such arguments as regard moral science they are not qualified to judge. The philosophers of Athens and Rome inculcated, indeed, many excellent moral precepts, and they sometimes ventured to expose the absurdities of the reigning superstition; but their lectures had no influence upon the multitude; and they had themselves imbibed such erroneous notions respecting the attributes of the Supreme Being, and the nature of the human soul, and converted those notions into first principles, of which they would not permit...\nMiracles, permit an examination, that even among them a thorough information was not to be expected from the powers of reasoning. It is likewise to be observed, that there are many truths of the utmost importance to mankind, which unassisted reason could never have discovered. Amongst these we may confidently reckon the immortality of the soul, the terms upon which God will be reconciled to sinners, and the manner in which that all-perfect Being may be acceptably worshipped; about all of which philosophers were in such uncertainty, that, according to Plato, \"Whatever is set right, and as it should be, in the present evil state of the world, can be so only by the particular interposition of God (A).\"\n\nAn immediate revelation from Heaven, therefore, was the only method by which infinite wisdom and perfect goodness could reform a bewildered and vicious race. But this revelation, at whatever time we suppose it given, must have been made directly either to some chosen individuals commissioned to instruct others, or to every man and woman for whose benefit it was ultimately intended. Were every person instructed in the knowledge of his duty by immediate inspiration, and were the motives to practise it brought home to his mind by God himself, human nature would be wholly changed: men would not be masters of their own actions; they would not be moral agents, nor by consequence be capable either of reward or of punishment.\n\nIt remains, therefore, that if God has been graciously pleased to enlighten and reform mankind, without destroying that moral nature which is essential to virtue, he can have done it only by revealing his truth to certain chosen instruments, who were the immediate instructors of their contemporaries, and through them have been the instructors of succeeding ages.\n\nLet us suppose this to have been actually the case, and consider how those inspired teachers could communicate to others every truth which had been revealed to themselves. They might easily, if it was part of their duty, deliver a sublime system of natural and moral science, and establish it upon the common basis of experiment and demonstration; but what foundation could they lay for those truths which unassisted reason cannot discover, and which, when they are revealed, appear to have no necessary relation to any thing previously known? To a bare affirmation that they had been immediately received from God, no rational being could be expected to assent. The teachers might be men of known veracity, whose simple assertion would be admitted as sufficient evidence for any fact in conformity with the laws of nature; but as every man has the evidence of his own consciousness and experience that revelations from heaven are deviations from these laws, an assertion so apparently extravagant would be rejected as false, unless supported by some better proof than the mere affirmation of the teacher. In this state of things, we can conceive no evidence sufficient to make such doctrines be received as the truths of God, but the power of working miracles committed to him who taught them. This would, indeed, be fully adequate to the purpose. For if there were nothing in the doctrines themselves impious, immoral, or contrary to truths already known, the only thing which could render the teacher's assertion incredible, would be its implying such an intimate communion with God as is contrary to the established course of things, by which men are left to acquire all their knowledge by the exercise of their own faculties.\n\nLet us now suppose one of those inspired teachers to tell his countrymen, that he did not derive them, on his ipse dixit, to believe that he had any supernatural communion with the Deity, but that for the truth of his assertion he would give them the evidence of their own senses; and after this declaration let us suppose him immediately to raise a person from the dead in their presence, merely by calling upon him to come out of his grave. Would not the only possible objection to the man's veracity be removed by this miracle? and his assertions that he had received such and such doctrines from God be as fully credited, as if it related to the most common occurrence? Undoubtedly it would; for when so much supernatural power was visibly communicated to this person, no one could have reason to question his having received an equal portion of supernatural knowledge. A palpable deviation from the known laws of nature, in one instance, is a sensible proof that such a deviation is possible in another; and in such a case as this, it is the witness of God to the truth of a man.\n\nMiracles, then, under which we include prophecy, are the only direct evidence which can be given of divine inspiration. When a religion, or any religious truth, is to be revealed from heaven, they appear to be absolutely necessary to enforce its reception among men; and this is the only case in which we can suppose them necessary, or believe for a moment that they ever have been or will be performed.\n\nThe history of almost every religion abounds with relations of prodigies and wonders, and of the intercourse of men with the gods; but we know of no religious system, those of the Jews and Christians excepted, which appealed to miracles as the sole evidence of its truth and divinity. The pretended miracles mentioned by Pagan historians and poets are not said to have been publicly wrought to enforce the truth of a new religion contrary to the reigning idolatry. Many of them may be clearly shown to have been mere natural events; (see Magic.) Others of them are represented as having been performed in secret on the most trivial occasions, and in obscure and fabulous ages long prior to the era of the writers by whom they are recorded. And such of them as at first view appear to be best attested, are evidently tricks contrived for interested purposes; to flatter power, or to promote the prevailing superstitions. For these reasons, as well as on account of the immoral character of the divinities by whom they are said to have been wrought, they are altogether unworthy of examination, and carry in the very nature of them the completest proofs of falsehood and imposture.\n\nBut\n\n(A) Ἐν τῷ ἐν καὶ ἀπειράνω, ὅτι πιστὸς ἐν τοῖς ἐν καὶ ἀπειράνω σὺν ἐν, ἐν τοῖς ἐν καὶ ἀπειράνω παλαιών. Οἴεσθε μείζων αὐτῷ συνειδήσεως.\nBut the miracles recorded of Moses and of Christ bear a very different character. None of them is represented as wrought on trivial occasions. The writers who mention them were eye witnesses of the facts; which they affirm to have been performed publicly, in attestation of the truth of their respective systems. They are indeed incorporated with these systems, that the miracles cannot be separated from the doctrines; and if the miracles were not really performed, the doctrines cannot possibly be true. Besides all this, they were wrought in support of revelations which opposed all the religious systems, superstitions, and prejudices, of the age in which they were given: a circumstance which of itself sets them, in point of authority, infinitely above the Pagan prodigies, as well as the lying wonders of the Roman church.\n\nIt is indeed, we believe, universally admitted, that the miracles mentioned in the book of Exodus and in the four Gospels, might, to those who saw them performed, be sufficient evidence of the divine inspiration of Moses and of Christ; but to us it may be thought that there is no evidence whatever, as we must believe in the miracles themselves, if we believe in them at all, upon the bare authority of human testimony. Why, it has been sometimes asked, are not miracles wrought in all ages and countries? If the religion of Christ was to be of perpetual duration, every generation of men ought to have complete evidence of its truth and divinity.\n\nTo the performance of miracles in every age and in every country, perhaps the same objections lie as to the immediate inspiration of every individual. Were those miracles universally received as such, men would be so overwhelmed with the number rather than with the force of their authority, as hardly to remain masters of their own conduct; and in that case the very end of all miracles would be defeated by their frequency. The truth, however, seems to be, that miracles so frequently repeated would not be received as such, and of course would have no authority; because it would be difficult, and in many cases impossible, to distinguish them from natural events. If they recurred regularly at certain intervals, we could not prove them to be deviations from the known laws of nature, because we should have the same experience for the one series of events as for the other; for the regular succession of supernatural effects, as for the established constitution and course of things.\n\nBe this, however, as it may, we shall take the liberty to affirm, that for the reality of the Gospel miracles we have evidence as convincing to the reflecting mind, though not so striking to vulgar apprehension, as those had who were contemporary with Christ and his apostles, and actually saw the mighty works which he performed. To the admirers of Mr Hume's philosophy this assertion will appear an extravagant paradox; but we hope to demonstrate its truth from principles which, consistently with himself, that author could not have denied. He has indeed endeavoured to prove*, that \"no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle;\" and the reasoning employed for this purpose is, that \"a miracle being a violation of the laws of nature which a firm and unalterable experience has established, the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can be; whereas our experience of human veracity, which (according to him) is the sole foundation of the evidence of testimony, is far from being uniform, and can therefore never preponderate against that experience which admits of no exception.\" This boastful and plausible argument has with equal candour and acuteness been examined by Dr Campbell†, who justly observes, that so far is the experience from being the sole foundation of the evidence of testimony, that, on the contrary, testimony is the sole foundation of by far the greater part of what Mr Hume calls firm and unalterable experience; and that if in certain circumstances we did not give an implicit faith to testimony, our knowledge of events would be confined to those which had fallen under the immediate observation of our own senses. For a short view of this celebrated controversy, in which the Christian so completely vanquishes the philosopher, see the word ABRIDGMENT.\n\nBut though Dr Campbell has exposed the sophistry of his opponent's reasoning, and overturned the principles from which he reasons, we are persuaded that he might safely have joined issue with him upon those very principles. To us, at least, it appears that the testimony upon which we receive the Gospel miracles is precisely of that kind which Mr Hume has acknowledged sufficient to establish even a miracle. \"No testimony (says he) is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavours to establish. When one tells me that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself whether it be more probable that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact which he relates should really have happened. I weigh the one miracle against the other; and according to the superiority which I discover, I pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater miracle.\" In this passage every reader may remark what did not escape the perspicacious eye of Dr Campbell, a strange confusion of terms; but as all miracles are equally easy to the Almighty; and as Mr Hume has elsewhere observed, that \"the raising of a feather, when the wind wants ever so little of a force requisite for that purpose, is as real a miracle as the raising of a house or a ship into the air;\" candour obliges us to suppose, that by talking of greater and less miracles and of always rejecting the greater, he meant nothing more, but that of two deviations from the known laws of nature he always rejects that which in itself is least probable.\n\nIf, then, we can show that the testimony given by the apostles and other first preachers of Christianity to the miracles of their master would, upon their supposition that those miracles were not really performed, have been as great a deviation from the known laws of nature as the miracles themselves, the balance must be considered as evenly poised by opposite miracles; and whilst it continues so, the judgement must remain in a state of suspense. But if it shall appear, that in this case the false testimony would have been a deviation from the laws of nature less probable in itself than the miracles recorded in the Gospels, the balance will be instantly destroyed; and by Mr Hume's maxim we shall be obliged to reject the supposition of falsehood in the testimony.\nof the apostles, and admit the miracles of Christ to have been really performed.\n\nIn this argument we need not waste time in proving that those miracles, as they are represented in the writings of the New Testament, were of such a nature, and performed before so many witnesses, that no imposition could possibly be practised on the senses of those who affirm that they were present. From every page of the Gospels this is so evident, that the philosophical adversaries of the Christian faith never suppose the apostles to have been themselves deceived, but boldly accuse them of bearing false witness. But if this accusation be well founded, their testimony itself is as great a miracle as any which they record of themselves or of their Matter.\n\nIt has been shown elsewhere (see Metaphysics, No. 138.), that by the law of association, which is one of the laws of nature, mankind, in the very process of learning to speak, necessarily learn to speak the truth; that ideas and relations are in the mind of every man so closely associated with the words by which they are expressed in his native tongue, and in every other language of which he is master, that the one cannot be entirely separated from the other; that therefore no man can on any occasion speak falsehood without some effort; that by no effort can a man give consistency to a premeditated detail of falsehood, if it be of any length, and include a number of particulars; and that it is still less possible for several men to agree in such a detail, when at a distance from each other, and cross questioned by their enemies.\n\nThis being the case, it follows, if the testimony of the apostles to their own and their Master's miracles be false, either that they must have concerted a consistent scheme of falsehood, and agreed to publish it at every hazard; or that God, or some powerful agent appointed by him, must have dissolved all the associations formed in their minds between ideas of sense and the words of language, and arbitrarily formed new associations, all in exact conformity to each other, but all in direct contradiction to truth. One or other of these events must have taken place; because, upon the supposition of falsehood, there is no other alternative. But such a dissolution and formation of associations as the latter implies, must, to every man who shall attentively consider it, appear to be as real a miracle, and to require as great an exertion of power, as the resurrection of the dead. Nor is the supposed voluntary agreement of the apostles in a scheme of falsehood an event less miraculous. When they sat down to fabricate their pretended revelation, and to contrive a series of miracles to which they were unanimously to appeal for its truth, it is plain, since they proved successful in their daring enterprise, that they must have clearly foreseen every possible circumstance in which they could be placed, and have prepared consistent answers to every question that could be put to them by their most inveterate and most enlightened enemies; by the statesman, the lawyer, the philosopher, and the priest. That such foreknowledge as this would have been miraculous, will not surely be denied; since it forms the very attribute which we find it most difficult to allow even to God himself. It is not, however, the only miracle which this supposition would compel us to swallow. The very resolution of the apostles to propagate the belief of false miracles in support of such a religion as that which is taught in the New Testament, is as great a miracle as human imagination can easily conceive.\n\nWhen they formed this design, either they must have hoped to succeed, or they must have foreseen that they should fail in their undertaking; and in either case, they chose evil for its own sake. They could not, if they foretold that they should fail, look for anything but that contempt, disgrace, and persecution, which were then the inevitable consequences of an unsuccessful endeavour to overthrow the established religion. Nor could their prospects be brighter upon the supposition of their success. As they knew themselves to be false witnesses and impious deceivers, they could have no hopes beyond the grave; and by determining to oppose all the religious systems, superstitions, and prejudices of the age in which they lived, they wilfully exposed themselves to inevitable misery in the present life, to infamy, and imprisonment, to stripes and death. Nor can it be said that they might look forward to power and influence when they should, through sufferings, have converted their countrymen; for so devious were they of obtaining nothing but misery, as the end of their mission, that they made their own perfection a test of the truth of their doctrines. They introduced the Master from whom they pretended to have received these doctrines as telling them, that \"they were sent forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; that they should be delivered up to councils, and scourged in synagogues; that they should be hated of all men for his name's sake; that the brother should deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child; and that he who took not up his cross and followed after him was not worthy of him.\" The very system of religion, therefore, which they invented and resolved to impose upon mankind, was so contrived, that the worldly prosperity of its first preachers, and even their exemption from persecution, was incompatible with its success. Had these clear predictions of the Author of that religion, under whom the apostles acted only as ministers, not been verified, all mankind must have instantly perceived that their pretence to inspiration was false, and that Christianity was a scandalous and impudent imposture. All this the apostles could not but foresee when they formed their plan for deluding the world. Whence it follows, that when they resolved to support their pretended revelation by an appeal to forged miracles, they wilfully, and with their eyes open, exposed themselves to inevitable misery, whether they should succeed or fail in their enterprise; and that they concerted their measures so as not to admit of a possibility of recompense to themselves, either in this life or in that which is to come. But if there be a law of nature, for the reality of which we have better evidence than we have for others, it is, that \"no man can choose misery for its own sake,\" or make the acquisition of it the ultimate end of his pursuit. The existence of other laws of nature we know by testimony and our own observation of the regularity of their effects. The existence of this law is made known to us not only by these means, but also by the still clearer and more conclusive evidence of our own consciousness.\n\nThus, then, do miracles force themselves upon our assent in every possible view which we can take of this interesting subject. If the testimony of the first preachers\npreachers of Christianity was true, the miracles recorded in the Gospel were certainly performed, and the doctrines of our religion are derived from heaven. On the other hand, if that testimony was false, either God must have miraculously effaced from the minds of those by whom it was given all the associations formed between their sensible ideas and the words of language, or he must have endowed those men with the gift of prefigurative, and have impelled them to fabricate a pretended revelation for the purpose of deceiving the world, and involving themselves in certain and foreseen destruction.\n\nThe power necessary to perform the one series of these miracles may, for any thing known to us, be as great as that which would be requisite for the performance of the other; and, considered merely as exertions of supernatural power, they may seem to balance each other, and to hold the mind in a state of suspense. But when we take into consideration the different purposes for which these opposite and contending miracles were wrought, the balance is instantly destroyed. The miracles recorded in the Gospels, if real, were wrought in support of a revelation which, in the opinion of all by whom it is received, has brought to light many important truths which could not otherwise have been made known to men; and which, by the confession of its adversaries, contains the purest moral precepts by which the conduct of mankind was ever directed. The opposite series of miracles, if real, was performed to enable, and even to compel, a company of Jews, of the lowest rank and of the narrowest education, to fabricate, with the view of inevitable destruction to themselves, a consistent scheme of falsehood, and by an appeal to forged miracles to impose it upon the world as a revelation from heaven. The object of the former miracles is worthy of a God of infinite wisdom, goodness, and power. The object of the latter is absolutely inconsistent with wisdom and goodness, which are demonstrably attributes of that Being by whom alone miracles can be performed. Whence it follows, that the supposition of the apostles bearing false testimony to the miracles of their Master, implies a series of deviations from the laws of nature, infinitely less probable in themselves than those miracles; and therefore by Mr. Hume's maxim, we must necessarily reject the supposition of falsehood in the testimony, and admit the reality of the miracles. So true it is, that for the reality of the Gospel miracles we have evidence as convincing to the reflecting mind, as those who had who were contemporary with Christ and his apostles, and were actual witnesses to their mighty works.\n\nMIRANDA-DE-EBRO, a town of Spain, in Old Castile, with a strong castle; seated in a country that produces excellent wine.

It was owing to her that her mother was employed by Pharaoh's daughter as nurse to Moses. She put herself at the head of the women of Israel after their passage through the Red sea, in order to sing the song which the men had sung before. She joined with her brother Aaron in murmuring against Moses, and was severely chastised for that action; for she became leprous, and continued separate from the rest without the camp for seven days. She died before her brothers, though in the same year with them, and was buried at the public expense.\n\nMIRROR, a name for a looking glass, or any polished body, whose use is to form the images of distant objects, by reflection of the rays of light. See REFLECTION.\n\nMirrors are either plane, convex, or concave. The first reflect the rays of light in a direction exactly similar to that in which they fall upon them, and therefore represent bodies of their natural magnitude. The convex ones make the rays diverge much more than before reflection, and therefore greatly diminish the images of those objects which they show: while the concave ones, by collecting the rays into a focus, not only magnify the objects they show, but will burn very fiercely when exposed to the rays of the sun; and hence they are commonly known by the name of burning mirrors. See Burning Mirrors.\n\nIn ancient times the mirrors were made of some kind of metal; and from a passage of the Mosaic writings we learn that the mirrors used by the Jewish women were made of brass. The Jews certainly had been taught to use that kind of mirrors by the Egyptians; from whence it is probable that brazen mirrors were the first kind used in the world. Any kind of metal, indeed, when well polished, will reflect very powerfully; but of all others silver reflects the most, though it has been in all countries too expensive a material for common use. Gold also is very powerful; and metals, or even wood, gilded and polished, will act very powerfully as burning mirrors. Even polished ivory, or straw nicely plaited together, will form mirrors capable of burning, if on a large scale.\n\nSince the invention of glasses, and the application of quicksilver to them, became generally known, it hath been universally employed for those plane mirrors used as ornaments to houses; but in making reflecting telescopes, they have been found much inferior to metallic ones. It doth not appear that the same superiority belongs to the metallic burning mirrors, considered merely as burning glasses; since the mirror with which M. Macquer melted platina, though only 22 inches diameter, and which was made of quicksilvered glass, produced much greater effects than M. Villette's metallic speculum, which considerably exceeded it in size. It is very probable, however, that this mirror of M. Villette's was by no means so well polished as it ought to have been; as the art of preparing the metal for taking the finest polish has but lately been discovered and published in the Philosophical Transactions by Mr. Mudge.

See ABORTION and MIDWIFERY.\n\nMISHNA, or MISNA, (from מִשְׁנָה, iteration), a part of the Jewish Talmud.\n\nThe Mishna contains the text; and the Gemara, which is the second part of the Talmud, contains the commentaries: so that the Gemara is, as it were, a glossary on the Mishna.\n\nThe Mishna consists of various traditions of the Jews, and of explanations of several passages of Scripture; these traditions serving as an explication of the written law, and supplement to it, are said to have been delivered to Moses during the time of his abode on the Mount; which he afterwards communicated to Aaron, Eleazar, and his servant Joshua. By these they were transmitted to the 70 elders, by them to the prophets, who communicated them to the men of the great Sanhedrim, from whom the wise men of Jerusalem and Babylon received them. According to Prideaux's account, they passed from Jeremiah to Baruch, from him to Ezra, and from Ezra to the men of the great synagogue, the last of whom was Simon the Just; who delivered them to Antigonus of Socho; and from him they came down in regular succession to Simeon, who took our Saviour in his arms; to Gamaliel, at whose feet Paul was educated; and last of all to Rabbi Judah the Holy, who committed them to writing in the Mishna. But Dr Prideaux, rejecting this Jewish fiction, observes, that after the death of Simon the Just, about 299 years before Christ, the Mischnical doctors arose, who, by their comments and conclusions, added to the number of those traditions which had been received and allowed by Ezra and the men of the great synagogue; so that towards the middle of the second century after Christ, under the empire of Antoninus Pius, it was found necessary to commit these traditions to writing; more especially, as their country had considerably suffered under Adrian, and many of their schools had been dissolved, and their learned men cut off; and therefore the usual method of preserving their traditions had failed. Rabbi Judah on this occasion being rector of the school at Tiberias, and president of the Sanhedrim in that place, undertook the work, and compiled it in six books, each consisting of several tracts, which altogether make up the number of 63. Prid. Connex. vol. ii. p. 468, &c. edit. 9. This learned author computes, that the Mishna was composed about the 150th year of our Lord; but Dr Lightfoot says, that Rabbi Judah compiled the Mishna about the year of Christ 190, in the latter end of the reign of Commodus; or, as some compute, in the year of Christ 220. Dr Lardner is of opinion, that this work could not have been finished before the year 190, or later. Collect. of Jewish and Heathen Testimonies, &c. vol. i. p. 172. Thus the book called the Mishna was formed; a book which the Jews have generally received with the greatest veneration. The original has been published with a Latin translation by Surenhusius, with notes of his own, and others from the learned Maimonides, &c. in 6 vol. fol. Amstel. A.D. 1698—1703. (See TALMUD.) It is written in a much purer style, and is not near so full of dreams and visions as the Gemara.\n\nMISDEMEANOUR, in Law, signifies a crime. Every crime is a misdemeanor; yet the law has made a distinction between crimes of a higher and a lower nature; the latter being denominated misdemeanours, the former felonies, &c. For the understanding of which distinction, we shall give the following definition from Blackstone's Commentaries, vol. iv. 5.\n\n\"A crime, or misdemeanor, is an act committed or omitted, in violation of a public law, either forbidding or commanding it. This general definition comprehends both crimes and misdemeanours; which, properly speaking, are mere synonymous terms; though, in common usage, the word crime is made to denote such offences as are of a deeper and more atrocious dye; while smaller faults, and omissions of less consequence, are comprised under the gentler name of misdemeanours only.\"\n\nMISE, in law books, is used in various senses: thus it sometimes signifies costs or expenses; in which sense it is commonly used in entering of judgements in actions personal. It is also used for the issue to be tried on the grand assize; in which case, joining of the mise upon the mere right, is putting in issue between the tenant and demandant, Who has the best or clearest right.\n\nMise, also signifies a tax or tallage, &c. An honorary gift, or customary present from the people of Wales to every new king or prince of Wales; anciently given in cattle, wine, and corn, but now in money, being 500l. or more, is denominated a mise: so was the usual tribute or fine of 3000 marks paid by the inhabitants of the county palatine of Chester at the change of every owner of the said earldom, for enjoying their liberties. And at Chester they have a mise-book, wherein in every town and village in the county is rated what to pay towards the mise. The 27 Hen. VIII. c. 26. ordains that lords shall have all such mises and profits of their lands as they had in times past, &c.\n\nMise, is sometimes also corruptly used for meagle, in law French meer, \"a meffhage;\" as a mise place, in some manors, is such a meffhage or tenement as answers the lord a heriot at the death of its owner.—2. Infl. §28.\n\nMISENUM, or MISENUS, in Ancient Geography; a promontory, port, and town in Campania, situated to the south-west of Baiae, in the Sinus Puteolanus, on the north side. Here Augustus had a fleet, called Clavis Misenumis, for guarding the Mare Internum; as he had another at Ravenna for the Superum.\n\nOn this peninsula a villa was built by Caius Marius, with a degree of elegance that gave great offence to the more austere among the Romans, who thought it ill suited to the character of so rough a soldier. Upon the same foundation Lucullus the plunderer of the eastern world, erected an edifice, in comparison of which the former house was a cottage; but even his magnificence was eclipsed by the splendour of the palace which the emperors raised upon the same spot. To these proud abodes\nMiser, abodes of heroes and monarchs, which have long been levelled to the ground, a few fishing huts, as Mr Swinburne informs us, and a lonely public house, have succeeded; hither boatmen resort to tipple perhaps on the identical site where the voluptuous matters of the world quaffed Chian and Falernian wines.\n\nMiser, a parlimonious person who is at the same time rich; or a wretch covetous to extremity, whom avarice has divested of all the charities of human nature, and made even an enemy to himself.\n\nOf this most unaccountable of all characters, many instances occur; some of them so extraordinary as almost to surpass belief. The following are here selected, as being of recent date, perfectly authentic, and the last of them in particular exhibiting an assemblage of qualities the most singular perhaps that ever existed in the same person. Too little dignified to merit a place in regular biography, yet too curious a variety of human character to pass unnoticed in this work, the present seemed the only title under which it could with propriety be introduced.\n\n1. In December 1793, died at Paris, literally of want, Mr Ottervald, a well-known banker. This man, originally of Neufchatel, felt the violence of the disease of avarice (for surely it is rather a disease than a passion of the mind) so strongly, that within a few days of his death, no improprieties could induce him to buy a few pounds of meat for the purpose of making a little soup for him. \"If true (said he), I should not dislike the soup, but I have no appetite for the meat; what then is to become of that?\" At the time that he refused this nourishment, for fear of being obliged to give away two or three pounds of meat, there was tied round his neck a silk bag, which contained 800 assignats of 100 livres each. At his outset in life, he drank a pint of beer which served him for supper, every night at a house much frequented, from which he carried home all the bottle corks he could come at. Of these, in the course of eight years, he had collected as many as sold for 12 louis d'or, a sum that had laid the foundation of his future fortune, the superstructure of which was rapidly raised by his uncommon success in stock jobbing. He died possessed of three millions of livres (125,000 sterling).\n\n2. The late John Elwes, Esq., was member for Berkshire in three successive parliaments. His family name was Meggot; and his father was a brewer of great eminence, and distinguished by no peculiarity of character; but his mother, though she was left nearly 100,000l. by her husband, starved herself to death! At an early period of life he was sent to Westminster School, where he remained for 10 or 12 years. During that time he certainly had not misapplied his talents; for he was a good classical scholar to the last: and it is a circumstance not a little remarkable, though well authenticated, that he never read afterwards, nor had he ever any knowledge in accounts; to which may in some measure be attributed the total ignorance he was always in as to his affairs. From Westminster School Mr Meggot removed to Geneva, where he soon entered upon pursuits more agreeable to him than study. The riding master of the academy, there had then to boast perhaps of three of the best riders in Europe, Mr Worley, Mr Elwes, and Sir Sidney Meadows. Of the three, Elwes was reckoned the most desperate; the young horses were always put into his hands, and he was the rough rider to the other two.\n\nOn his return to England, after an absence of two or three years, he was to be introduced to his uncle the late Sir Harvey Elwes, who was then living at Stoke in Suffolk, perhaps the most perfect picture of human penury that ever existed. The attempts at saving money were in him so extraordinary, that Mr Elwes perhaps never quite reached them, even at the last period of his life.—Of what temperance can do, Sir Harvey was an instance. At an early period of life he was given over for a consumption, and he lived till between 80 and 90 years of age. On his death, his fortune, which was at least 250,000l., fell to his nephew Mr Meggot, who by will was ordered to assume the name and arms of Elwes. To this uncle, and this property, Mr Elwes succeeded when he had advanced beyond the 40th year of his age. For 15 years previous to this period, he was well known in the more fashionable circles of London. He had always a turn for play; and it was only late in life, and from paying always and not always being paid, that he conceived disquiet at it. The theory which he professed, \"that it was impossible to talk a gentleman for money,\" he perfectly confirmed by the practice; and he never violated this feeling to the latest hour of his life.\n\nThe manners of Mr Elwes were such—so gentle, so attentive, so gentlemanly, and so engaging—that rudeness could not ruffle them, or strong ingratitude break their observance. He retained this peculiar feature of the old court to the last; but he had a pride beyond this: He had the most gallant disregard of his own person, and all care about himself that can be imagined. The instances in younger life, in the most imminent personal hazard, are innumerable; but when age had despoiled him of his activity, and might have rendered care and attention about himself natural, he knew not what they were: He wished no one to afflict him: \"He was as young as ever; he could walk; he could ride, and he could dance; and he hoped he should not give trouble even when he was old.\" He was at that time 75.\n\nIt is curious to remark how he contrived to mingle small attempts at saving with objects of the most unbounded dissipation. After fitting up a whole night at play for thousands with the most fashionable and profligate men of the time, amidst splendid rooms, gilt sofas, wax lights, and waiters attendant on his call, he would walk out about four in the morning, not towards home, but into Smithfield, to meet his own cattle, which were coming to market from Thaydonhall, a farm of his in Essex! There would this same man, forgetful of the scenes he had just left, stand in the cold or rain, bartering with a carcass butcher for a shilling! Sometimes when the cattle did not arrive at the hour he expected, he would walk on in the mire to meet them; and more than once has gone on foot the whole way to his farm without stopping, which was 17 miles from London, after fitting up the whole night. Had every man been of the mind of Mr Elwes, the race of innkeepers must have perished, and post-chaises have been returned back to those who made them; for it was the business of his life to avoid both. He always travelled on horseback. To see him setting out on a journey, was a matter truly curious; his first care was to put two or three eggs, boiled...\nboiled hard, into his great coat pocket, or any scraps of bread which he found; baggage he never took; then mounting one of his hunters, his next attention was to get out of London into that road where turnpikes were the fewest: then, stopping under any hedge where grass presented itself for his horse, and a little water for himself, he would sit down and refresh himself and his horse together.\n\nThe chief residence of Mr Elwes at this period of his life was in Berkshire, at his own seat at Marcham. Here it was he had two natural sons born, who inherit the greatest part of his property by a will made about the year 1785. The keeping of fox hounds was the only instance in the whole life of Mr Elwes of his ever sacrificing money to pleasure; and may be selected as the only period when he forgot the cares, the perplexities, and the regret, which his wealth occasioned. But even here every thing was done in the most frugal manner. Scrub, in the Beaux Stratagem, when compared with Mr Elwes's huntsman, had an idle life of it. This famous huntsman might have fixed an epoch in the history of servants: for in a morning, getting up at four o'clock, he milked the cows; he then prepared breakfast for Mr Elwes or any friends he might have with him: then slipping on a green coat, he hurried into the stable, saddled the horses, got the hounds out of the kennel, and away they went into the field. After the fatigues of hunting, he refreshed himself by rubbing down two or three horses as quickly as he could; then running into the house to lay the cloth, and wait dinner; then hurrying again into the stable to feed the horses—diversified with an interlude of the cows again to milk, the dogs to feed, and eight hunters to litter down for the night.\n\nIn the penury of Mr Elwes there was something that seemed like a judgement from heaven. All earthly comforts he voluntarily denied himself: he would walk home in the rain in London rather than pay a shilling for a coach; he would fit in wet clothes sooner than have a fire to dry them; he would eat his provisions in the last stage of putrefaction sooner than have a fresh joint from the butchers; and he wore a wig for above a fortnight, which his biographer saw him pick up out of a rut in a lane where they were riding. This was the last extremity of laudable economy; for to all appearance it was the cut-off wig of some beggar!\n\nMr Elwes had now resided about 13 years in Suffolk, when the contest for Berkshire presented itself on the dissolution of the parliament; and when, to preserve the peace of that county, he was nominated by Lord Cran-ven. Mr Elwes, though he had retired from public business for some years, had still left about him some of the seeds of more active life, and he agreed to the proposal. It came farther enhanced to him, by the agreement, that he was to be brought in by the freeholders for nothing. All he did on the occasion was dining at the ordinary at Reading; and he got into parliament for 18 pence!\n\nThough a new man, Mr Elwes could not be called a young member; for he was at this time nearly 60 years old when he thus entered on public life. But he was in possession of all his activity; and, preparatory to his appearance on the boards of St Stephen's Chapel, he used to attend constantly during the races and other public meetings all the great towns where his voters resided. At the different assemblies he would dance among the youngest to the last, after riding over on horseback, and frequently in the rain, to the place of meeting. A gentleman who was one night standing by, observed on the extraordinary agility of so old a man.—\"O! that is nothing (replied another); for Mr Elwes, to do this, rode 20 miles in the rain, with his shoes stuck into his boots and his bag-wig in his pocket.\"\n\nThe honour of parliament made no alteration in the dress of Mr Elwes: on the contrary, it seemed at this time to have attained additional meanness; and nearly to have reached that happy climax of poverty, which has more than once drawn on him the compassion of those who passed by him in the street. For the speaker's dinners, however, he had one suit, with which the speaker in the course of the sessions became very familiar. The minister likewise was well acquainted with it; and at any dinner of opposition full was his apparel the same. The wits of the minority used to say, \"that they had full as much reason as the minister to be satisfied with Mr Elwes, as he had the same habit with every body.\" At this period of his life Mr Elwes wore a wig. Much about the time when his parliamentary life ceased, that wig was worn out; so then, being older and wiser as to expense, he wore his own hair, which like his expenses was very small.\n\nAll this time the income of Mr Elwes was increasing hourly, and his present expenditure was next to nothing; for the little pleasures he had once engaged in he had now given up. He kept no house, and only one old servant and a couple of horses: he resided with his nephew: his two sons he had stationed in Suffolk and Berkshire, to look after his respective estates: and his dress certainly was no expense to him; for had not other people been more careful than himself, he would not have had it even mended.\n\nWhen he left London, he went on horseback to his country seats with his couple of hard eggs, and without once stopping upon the road at any house. He always took the most unfrequented road, and used every shift to avoid turnpikes. Marcham was the seat he now chiefly visited; which had some reason to be flattered with the preference, as his journey into Suffolk cost him only twopence-halfpenny, while that into Berkshire amounted to fourpence!\n\nAs Mr Elwes came into parliament without expense, he performed his duty as a member would have done in the pure days of our constitution: What he had not bought he never attempted to sell; and he went forward in that straight and direct path, which can alone satisfy a reflecting mind. Amongst the smaller memorials of the parliamentary life of Mr Elwes may be noted, that he did not follow the custom of members in general by fitting on any particular side of the house, but sat as occasion presented itself on either indiscriminately; and he voted much in the same manner, but never rose to speak. In his attendance at the house, he was always early and late; and he never left it for dinner, as he had accustomed himself to fasting, sometimes for 24 hours in continuance.\n\nWhen he quitted parliament, he was, in the common phrase, \"a fish out of water!\" The style of Mr Elwes's\nElwes's life had left him no domestic scenes to which he could retire—his home was dreary and poor—his rooms received no cheerfulness from fire; and while the outside had all the appearance of a \"House to be let,\" the inside was a desert; but he had his penury alone to thank for this, and for the want of all the little consolations which should attend old age, and smooth the pangs of declining life. At the close of the spring of 1785, he wished again to visit, which he had not done for some years, his seat at Stoke. But then the journey was a most serious object to him. The famous old servant was dead; all the horses that remained with him were a couple of worn-out brood mares; and he himself was not in that vigour of body in which he could ride 60 or 70 miles on the sufficiency of two boiled eggs. The mention of a poet chaise would have been a crime—\"He got a poet chaise, indeed! where was he to get the money?\" would have been his exclamation. At length he was carried into the country as he was carried into parliament, free of expense, by a gentleman who was certainly not quite so rich as Mr Elwes. When he reached Stoke—the seat of more active scenes, of somewhat resembling hospitality, and where his fox hounds had spread somewhat like vivacity around—he remarked, \"he had expended a great deal of money once very foolishly; but that a man grew wiser by time.\"\n\nThe rooms at this seat, which were now much out of repair, and would have all fallen in but for his son John Elwes, Esq., who had resided there, he thought too expensively furnished, as worse things might have served. If a window was broken, there was to be no repair but that of a little brown paper, or that of piecing in a bit of broken glass; which had at length been done so frequently, and in so many shapes, that it would have puzzled a mathematician to say \"what figure they described.\" To save fire, he would walk about the remains of an old greenhouse, or sit with a servant in the kitchen. During the harvest he would amuse himself with going into the fields to glean the corn on the grounds of his own tenants; and they used to leave a little more than common to please the old gentleman, who was as eager after it as any pauper in the parish. In the advance of the season, his morning employment was to pick up any stray chips, bones, or other things, to carry to the fire, in his pocket—and he was one day surprised by a neighbouring gentleman in the act of pulling down, with some difficulty, a crow's nest for this purpose. On the gentleman wondering why he gave himself this trouble—\"Oh, Sir,\" replied old Elwes, \"it is really a shame that these creatures should do so. Do but see what waste they make! They don't care how extravagant they are!\"\n\nAs no gleam of favourite passion, or any ray of amusement, broke through this gloom of penury, his insatiable desire of saving was now become uniform and systematic. He used still to ride about the country on one of these mares—but then he rode her very economically, on the soft turf, adjoining the road, without putting himself to the expense of shoes, as he observed, \"The turf was so pleasant to a horse's foot!\" And when any gentleman called to pay him a visit, and the boy who attended in the stables was profuse enough to put a little hay before his horse, old Elwes would filly steal back into the stable, and take the hay very carefully away. That very strong appetite which Mr Elwes had in some measure restrained during the long sitting of parliament, he now indulged most voraciously, and on every thing he could find. To save, as he thought, the expense of going to a butcher, he would have a whole sheep killed, and so eat mutton to the—end of the chapter. When he occasionally had his river drawn, though sometimes horse loads of small fish were taken, not one would he suffer to be thrown in again; for, he observed, \"He should never see them again!\" Game in the last stage of putrefaction, and meat that walked about his plate, would he continue to eat, rather than have new things killed before the old provision was finished. With this diet—the charnel house of fulness—his dress kept pace—equally in the last stage of absolute dissolution. Sometimes he would walk about in a tattered brown-coloured hat, and sometimes in a red and white woollen cap, like a prisoner confined for debt. His shoes he never would suffer to be cleaned, lest they should be worn out sooner. But still, with all this self-denial—that penury of life to which the inhabitant of an almshouse is not doomed—still did he think he was profuse, and frequently say, \"He must be a little more careful of his property.\" His disquietude on the subject of money was now continual. When he went to bed, he would put five or ten guineas into a bureau; and then, full of his money, after he had retired to rest, and sometimes in the middle of the night, he would come down to see if it was there.\n\nThe scene of mortification at which Mr Elwes was now arrived was all but a denial of the common necessaries of life: and indeed it might have admitted a doubt, whether or not, if his manors, his fish ponds, and some grounds in his own hands, had not furnished a subsistence, where he had not anything actually to buy, he would not, rather than have bought anything, have starved. Strange as this may appear, it is not exaggerated.—He one day, during this period, dined upon the remaining part of a moor hen, which had been brought out of the river by a rat! and at another ate an undigested part of a pike which a larger one had swallowed, but had not finished, and which were taken in this state in a net. At the time this last circumstance happened, he discovered a strange kind of satisfaction; for he said to a friend, \"Aye! this was killing two birds with one stone!\" In the room of all comment—of all moral—it let be remarked, that at this time Mr Elwes was perhaps worth nearly eight hundred thousand pounds! and, at this period, he had not made his will, of course was not saving from any sentiment of affection for any person.\n\nThe summer of 1788 Mr Elwes passed at his house in Welbeck street, London; and he passed that summer without any other society than that of two maid servants; for he had now given up the expense of keeping any male domestics. His chief employment used to be that of getting up early in a morning to visit some of his houses in Mary-le-bone, which during the summer were repairing. As he was there generally at four o'clock in a morning, he was of course on the spot before the workmen; and he used contentedly to sit down on the steps before the door, to scold them.\nthem when they did come. The neighbours who used to see him appear thus regularly every morning, and who concluded, from his apparel, that he was one of the workmen, observed, \"there never was so punctual a man as the old carpenter.\" During the whole morning he would continue to run up and down stairs to see the men were not idle for an instant with the same anxiety as if his whole happiness in life had been centered in the finishing of this house, regardless of the greater property he had at a stake in various places, and for ever employed in the minute only of affairs. Indeed such was his anxiety about this house, the rent of which was not above £5 a-year, that it brought on a fever which nearly cost him his life; but the fate which dragged him on thus strangely to bury him under the load of his own wealth, seemed as ruthless as it was unaccountable.\n\nIn the muscular and unencumbered frame of Mr Elwes there was every thing that promised extreme length of life; and he lived to above 70 years of age without any natural disorder attacking him: but, as Lord Bacon has well observed, \"the minds of some men are a lamp that is continually burning;\" and such was the mind of Mr Elwes. Removed from those occasional public avocations which had once engaged his attention, money was now his only thought. He roamed upon money—upon money he lay down to rest; and as his capacity sunk away from him by degrees, he dwindled from the real cares of his property into the puerile concealment of a few guineas. This little store he would carefully wrap up in various papers, and depositing them in different corners, would amuse himself with running from one to the other, to see whether they were all safe. Then forgetting, perhaps, where he had concealed some of them, he would become as seriously afflicted as a man might be who had lost all his property. Nor was the day alone thus spent—he would frequently rise in the middle of the night, and be heard walking about different parts of the house, looking after what he had thus hidden and forgotten.\n\nDuring the winter of 1789, the last winter Mr Elwes was fated to see, his memory visibly weakened every day; and from the unceasing wish to save money, he now began to fear he should die in want of it. Mr Gibbon had been appointed his builder in the room of Mr Adams; and one day, when this gentleman waited upon him, he said with apparent concern, \"Sir, pray consider in what a wretched state I am; you see in what a good house I am living; and here are five guineas, which is all I have at present; and how I shall go on with such a sum of money puzzles me to death. I dare say you thought I was rich; now you see how it is!\"\n\nMr George Elwes having now settled at his seat at Marcham in Berkshire, he was naturally desirous that, in the affections of his wife, his father might at length find a comfortable home. In London he was certainly most uncomfortable; but still, with these temptations before and behind him, a journey with any expense annexed to it was insurmountable. This, however, was luckily obviated by an offer from Mr Partis, a gentleman of the law, to take him to his ancient seat in Berkshire with his purse perfectly whole. But there was one circumstance still very distressing—the old gentleman had now nearly worn out his last coat, and he would not buy a new one; his son, therefore, with a pious fraud, contrived to get Mr Partis to buy him a coat, and make him a present of it. Thus formerly having had a good coat, then a bad one, and at last no coat at all, he was kind enough to accept one from a neighbour.\n\nMr Elwes carried with him into Berkshire five guineas and a half, and half a crown. Let the mention of this sum may appear singular, it should be said, that previous to his journey he had carefully wrapped it up in various folds of paper, that no part of it might be lost. On the arrival of the old gentleman, Mr George Elwes and his wife did every thing they could to make the country a scene of quiet to him. But \"he had that within\" which baffled every effort of this kind. Of his heart it might be said, \"there was no peace in Israel.\" His mind, cast away upon the vast and troubled ocean of his property, extending beyond the bounds of his calculation, returned to amuse itself with fetching and carrying about a few guineas, which in that ocean was indeed a drop. But nature had now carried on life nearly as far as she was able, and the fund was almost run out. The first symptom of more immediate decay was his inability to enjoy his rest at night. Frequently would he be heard at midnight as if struggling with some one in his chamber, and crying out, \"I will keep my money, I will; nobody shall rob me of my property.\" On any one of the family going into his room, he would start from this fever of anxiety, and, as if waking from a troubled dream, again hurry into bed, and seem unconscious of what had happened. At length, on the 26th November 1789, expired this miserably rich man, whose property, nearly reaching to a million, extended itself almost through every county in England.\n\nMISERICORDIA, in Law, is an arbitrary fine imposed on any person for an offence: this is called misericordia, because the amercement ought to be but small, and less than that required by magna charta. If a person is outrageously amerced in a court that is not of record, the writ called moderata misericordia lies for moderating the amercement according to the nature of the fault.\n\nMISFORTUNE. An unlucky accident.\n\nMISFORTUNE, or chance, in Law, a deficiency of the will; or committing of an unlawful act by misfortune or chance, and not by design. In such case, the will observes a total neutrality, and does not co-operate with the deed; which therefore wants one main ingredient of a crime. See CRIME.\n\nOf this, when it affects the life of another, we have spoken under the article HOMICIDE; and in this place have only occasion to observe, that if any accidental mischief happens to follow from the performance of a lawful act, the party stands excused from all guilt: but if a man be doing any thing unlawful, and a consequence ensues which he did not foresee or intend, as the death of a man or the like, his want of foresight shall be no excuse; for, being guilty of one offence, in doing antecedently what is in itself unlawful, he is criminally guilty of whatever consequence may follow the first misbehaviour.\n\nMISFEASANCE, in law books, signifies a trespass.\n\nMISLETOE,\nMISLETOE. See Viscum, Botany Index.\n\nMISNOMER, in Law, a misnaming or mistaking a person's name. The Christian name of a person should always be perfect; but the law is not so strict in regard to surnames, a small mistake in which will be dispensed with to make good a contract, and support the act of the party. See Plea to Indictment.\n\nMISPRISIONS, (a term derived from the old French, meprix, a neglect or contempt), are, in the acceptation of our law, generally understood to be all such high offences as are under the degree of capital, but nearly bordering thereon: and it is said, that a misprision is contained in every treason and felony whatsoever; and that, if the king so please, the offender may be proceeded against for the misprision only. And upon the same principle, while the jurisdiction of the star-chamber subsisted, it was held that the king might remit a prosecution for treason, and cause the delinquent to be censured in that court, merely for a high misdemeanor: as happened in the case of Roger earl of Rutland, in 43 Eliz. who was concerned in the earl of Essex's rebellion. Misprisions are generally divided into two sorts; negative, which consist in the concealment of something which ought to be revealed; and positive, which consist in the commission of something which ought not to be done.\n\n1. Of the first, or negative kind, is what is called misprision of treason; consisting in the bare knowledge and concealment of treason, without any degree of affent thereto; for any affent makes the party a principal traitor; as indeed the concealment, which was construed aiding and abetting, did at the common law; in like manner as the knowledge of a plot against the state, and not revealing it, was a capital crime at Florence, and other states of Italy. But it is now enacted by the statute 1 & 2 Ph. & Mar. c. 10, that a bare concealment of treason shall be only held a misprision. This concealment becomes criminal, if the party apprised of the treason does not, as soon as conveniently may be, reveal it to some judge of assize or justice of the peace. But if there be any probable circumstances of affent, as if one goes to a treasonable meeting, knowing beforehand that a conspiracy is intended against the king; or, being in such company once by accident, and having heard such treasonable conspiracy, meets the same company again, and hears more of it, but conceals it; this is an implied affent in law, and makes the concealer guilty of actual high treason.\n\nMisprison of felony is also the concealment of a felony which a man knows, but never affented to; for, if he affented, this makes him either principal or accessory. And the punishment of this, in a public officer, by the statute Wellm. r. 3 Edw. I. c. 9, is imprisonment for a year and a day; in a common person, imprisonment for a less discretionary time; and, in both, fine and ransom at the king's pleasure: which pleasure of the king must be observed, once for all, not to signify any extrajudicial will of the sovereign, but such as is declared by his representatives, the judges in his courts of justice; voluntas regis in curia, non in camera.\n\n2. Misprisons, which are merely positive, are generally denominated contempt or high misdemeanor; of which the principal is the mal administration of such high officers as are in public trust and employment. This is usually punished by the method of parliamentary impeachment; wherein such penalties, short of death, are inflicted, as to the wisdom of the house of peers shall seem proper; constituting usually of banishment, imprisonment, fines, or perpetual disability. Hither also may be referred the offence of embezzling the public money, called among the Romans peculatus; which the Julian law punished with death in a magistrate, and with deportation, or banishment, in a private person. With us it is not a capital crime, but subjects the committer of it to a discretionary fine and imprisonment.\n\nOther misprisons are, in general, such contempts of the executive magistrate as demonstrate themselves by some arrogant and undutiful behaviour towards the king and government: for a detail of which, vide Blackstone's Comment iv. 22.\n\nMISSAL, the Roman mass-book, containing the several masses to be said on particular days. It is derived from the Latin word missa, which, in the ancient Christian church, signified every part of divine service.\n\nMISSEL-BIRD, a species of Turdus. See Turdus, Ornithology Index.\n\nMISSIO, among the Romans, was a full discharge given to a folder after 20 years service, and differed from the exauclatorio, which was a discharge from duty after 17 years service. Every folder had a right to claim his missio at the end of 20 years.\n\nMISSION, in Theology, denotes a power or commission to preach the gospel. Jesus Christ gave his disciples their mission in these words, Go and teach all nations, &c.\n\nThe Romanists reproach the Protestants, that their ministers have no mission, as not being authorized in the exercise of their ministry, either by an uninterrupted succession from the apostles, or by miracles, or by any extraordinary proof of a vocation.\n\nMany among us deny any other mission necessary for the ministry than the talents necessary to discharge it.\n\nMission is also used for an establishment of people zealous for the glory of God and the salvation of souls; who go and preach the gospel in remote countries and among infidels.\n\nThere are missions in the East as well as in the West Indies. Among the Romanists, the religious orders of St Dominic, St Francis, St Augustine, and the Jesuits, have missions in the Levant, America, &c. The Jesuits have also missions in China, and all other parts of the globe where they have been able to penetrate. There have been also several Protestant missions for diffusing the light of Christianity through the benighted regions of Asia and America. Of this kind has been the Danish mission planned by Frederic IV. in 1706. And the liberality of private benefactors in our own country has been also extended to the support of missionaries among the Indians in America, &c.\n\nMISSIONARY, an ecclesiastic who devotes himself and his labours to some mission, either for the instruction of the orthodox, the conviction of heretics, or the conversion of infidels. See Jesuits.\n\nMISSISSIPPI, a noble river in America, which waters about five-eighths of the United States, forming\nMITTELLA, BASTARD AMERICAN SANICLE: A genus of plants belonging to the decandra clas, and in the natural method ranking under the 13th order, Suc-\nculenta. See Botany Index.\n\nMITHRA, feasts of, in antiquity, were feasts cele-\nbrated among the Romans in honour of Mithras or the\nsun. The most ancient instance of this Mithras among\nthe Romans occurs in an inscription dated in the third\ncentury of Trajan, or about the year of Christ 101.\nThis is the dedication of an altar to the sun under the\nabove name, thus inscribed, Deo Soli Mithrae. But the\nworship of Mithras was not known in Egypt and Syria\nin the time of Origen, who died about the year of\nChrist 263; though it was common at Rome for more\nthan a century before this time. The worship of Mi-\nthras was proclimed at Rome in the year 378, by or-\nder of Gracchus, prefect of the praetorium. According\nto M. Freret, the feasts of Mithras were derived from\nChaldea, where they had been instituted for celebrating\nthe entrance of the sun into the sign Taurus.\n\nMITHRAS, or MITHRA, a god of Persia and Chal-\ndea, supposed to be the sun. His worship was intro-\nduced at Rome. He is generally represented as a young\nman, whose head is covered with a turban after the\nmanner of the Persians. He supports his knee upon a\nbull that lies on the ground, and one of whose horns he\nholds in one hand, while with the other he plunges a\ndagger in his neck.\n\nMITHRIDATE, an old term, in Pharmacy; an\nantidote, or composition, in form of an electuary, sup-\nposed to serve either as a remedy or a preservative a-\ngainst poisons. It takes its name from the inventor,\nMithridates king of Pontus, who is said to have so for-\ntified his body against poisons with antidotes and prefer-\natives, that when he had a mind to dispatch himself,\nhe could not find any poison that would take effect.\n\nMITHRIDATES, the name of several kings of\nPontus. See Pontus.\n\nMITHRIDATES VII. surnamed Eupator and the Great,\nsucceeded to the throne at the age of 11 years, about\n123 years before the Christian era. The beginning of\nhis reign was marked by ambition, cruelty, and arti-\nfice. He murdered his own mother, who had been left\nby his father co-heiresses of the kingdom; and he forti-\nfied his constitution by drinking antidotes against the\npoison with which his enemies at court attempted to\ndestroy him. He early inured his body to hardship,\nand employed himself in the most manly exercises, of-\nten remaining whole months in the country, and mak-\ning frozen snow and the earth the place of his repose.\nNaturally ambitious and cruel, he spared no pains to\nacquire himself power and dominion. He murdered\nthe two sons whom his sister Laodice had had by Ari-\nrathes king of Cappadocia, and placed one of his own\nchildren, only eight years old, on the vacant throne.\nThese violent proceedings alarmed Nicomedes king of Bi-\nthynia, who had married Laodice the widow of Ariar-\nathes. He suborned a youth to be king of Cappadocia,\nas the third son of Ariarathes; and Laodice was sent\nto Rome to implore upon the senate, and assure them\nthat her third son was now alive, and that his preten-\nsions to the kingdom of Cappadocia were just and well\ngrounded. Mithridates, on his part, sent to Rome\nGordius the governor of his son; who solemnly declar-\ned before the Roman people, that the youth who sat\non the throne of Cappadocia was the third son and lawful heir of Ariarathes, and that he was supported as such by Mithridates. This intricate affair displeased the Roman senate; and finally to settle the dispute they took away the kingdom of Cappadocia from Mithridates, and Paphlagonia from Nicomedes. These two kingdoms being thus separated from their original possessors, were presented with their freedom and independence; but the Cappadocians refused it, and received Ariobarzanes for king. Such were the first seeds of enmity between Rome and the king of Pontus. Mithridates never lost an opportunity by which he might lessen the influence of his adversaries; and the more effectually to destroy their power in Asia, he ordered all the Romans that were in his dominions to be massacred. This was done in one night, and no less than 150,000, according to Plutarch, or 80,000 Romans, as Appian mentions, were made the victims of his cruelty. This called aloud for vengeance. Aquilus, and soon after Sylla, marched against Mithridates with a large army. The former was made prisoner; but Sylla obtained a victory over the king's generals; and another decisive engagement rendered him master of all Greece, Macedonia, Ionia, and Asia Minor. This ill fortune was aggravated by the loss of about 200,000 men, who were killed in the several engagements that had been fought; and Mithridates, weakened by repeated ill success by sea and land, sued for peace from the conqueror, which he obtained on condition of defraying the expenses which the Romans had incurred by the war, and of remaining satisfied with the possessions which he had received from his ancestors. While these negotiations of peace were carried on, Mithridates was not unmindful of his real interest. His poverty, and not his inclinations, obliged him to wish for peace. He immediately took the field with an army of 140,000 infantry, and 16,000 horse, which consisted of his own forces and those of his son-in-law Tigranes king of Armenia. With such a numerous army he soon made himself master of the Roman provinces in Asia; none dared to oppose his conquests; and the Romans, relying on his fidelity, had withdrawn the greatest part of their armies from the country. The news of his warlike preparations were no sooner heard, than Lucullus the consul marched into Asia; and without delay he blocked up the camp of Mithridates who was then besieging Cyzicus. The Asiatic monarch escaped from him, and fled into the heart of his kingdom. Lucullus pursued him with the utmost celerity; and would have taken him prisoner after a battle, had not the avidity of his soldiers preferred the plundering of a mule loaded with gold to the taking of a monarch who had exercised such cruelties against their countrymen, and shown himself so faithless to the most solemn engagements. After this escape Mithridates was more careful about the safety of his person; and he even ordered his wives and sisters to destroy themselves, fearful of their falling into the enemy's hands. The appointment of Glabrio to the command of the Roman forces, instead of Lucullus, was favourable to Mithridates, who recovered the greatest part of his dominions. The sudden arrival of Pompey, however, soon put an end to his victories. A battle in the night was fought near the Euphrates, in which the troops of Pontus laboured under every disadvantage. The engagement was by moon-light, and as the moon then shone in the face of the enemy, the lengthened shadows of the arms of the Romans having induced Mithridates to believe that the two armies were close together, the arrows of his soldiers were darted from a great distance, and their efforts rendered ineffectual. An universal overthrow ensued, and Mithridates, bold in his misfortunes, rushed through the thick ranks of the enemy at the head of 800 horsemen, 500 of whom perished in the attempt to follow him. He fled to Tigranes; but that monarch refused an asylum to his father-in-law, whom he had before supported with all the collected forces of his kingdom. Mithridates found a safe retreat among the Scythians; and though destitute of power, friends, and resources, yet he meditated the overthrow of the Roman empire, by penetrating into the heart of Italy by land. These wild projects were rejected by his followers, and he sued for peace. It was denied to his ambassadors; and the victorious Pompey declared, that, to obtain it, Mithridates must ask it in person. He scorned to trust himself in the hands of his enemy, and resolved to conquer or to die. His subjects refused to follow him any longer; and revolting from him, made his son Pharnaces king. The son showed himself ungrateful to his father; and even, according to some writers, he ordered him to be put to death. This unnatural treatment broke the heart of Mithridates; he obliged his wife to poison herself, and attempted to do the same himself. It was in vain: the frequent antidotes he had taken in the early part of his life, strengthened his constitution against the poison; and when this was unavailing, he attempted to stab himself. The blow was not mortal; and a Gaul who was then present, at his own request, gave him the fatal stroke, about 64 years before the Christian era. Such were the misfortunes, abilities, and miserable end, of a man, who supported himself so long against the power of Rome, and who, according to the declarations of the Roman authors, proved a more powerful and indefatigable adversary to the capital of Italy than the great Hannibal, Pyrrhus, Perseus, or Antiochus. Mithridates has been commended for his eminent virtues, and censured for his vices. As a commander he deserves the most unbounded applause; and it may create admiration to see him waging war with such success, during so many years, against the most powerful people on earth, led to the field by a Sylla, a Lucullus, and a Pompey. He was the greatest monarch that ever sat on a throne, according to the opinion of Cicero; and indeed no greater proof of his military character can be brought, than the mention of the great rejoicings which happened in the Roman armies and in the capital at the news of his death. No less than 12 weeks were appointed for public thanksgivings to the immortal gods; and Pompey, who had sent the first intelligence of his death to Rome, and who had partly hastened his fall, was rewarded with the most uncommon honours. It is said that Mithridates conquered 24 nations, whose different languages he knew, and spoke with the same ease and fluency as his own. As a man of letters he also deserves attention. He was acquainted with the Greek language, and even wrote in that dialect a treatise on botany. His skill in physic is well known; and even now there is a celebrated antidote which bears his name, and is called mithridate. Superstition as well as nature\nMITRIDATICUM BELLUM, the Mithridatic War, one of the longest and most celebrated wars ever carried on by the Romans against a foreign power. See Pontus.\n\nMITRA, was a cap or covering for the head, worn by the Roman ladies, and sometimes by the men; but it was looked upon as a mark of effeminacy in the last, especially when it was tied upon their heads.\n\nMITRE, a facerdotal ornament worn on the head, by bishops and certain abbots on solemn occasions; being a sort of cap, pointed and cleft at top. The high priest among the Jews wore a mitre or bonnet on his head. The inferior priests of the same nation had likewise their mitres; but in what respect they differed from that of the high priest, is uncertain. Some contend that the ancient bishops wore mitres; but this is by no means certain.\n\nMITRE, in Architecture, is the workmen's term for an angle that is just 45 degrees, or half a right angle. If the angle be a quarter of a right angle, they call it a half mitre.\n\nTo describe such angles, they have an instrument called the miter square; with this they strike mitre lines on their quarters or battens; and for dispatch, they have a mitre box, as they call it, which is made of two pieces of wood, each about an inch thick, one nailed upright on the edge of the other; the upper piece hath the mitre lines struck upon it on both sides, and a kerf to direct the saw in cutting the mitre joints readily, by only applying the piece into this box.\n\nMITRE is used by the writers of the Irish history for a fort of base money, which was very common there about the year 1270, and for 30 years before and as many after.\n\nThere were besides the mitre several other pieces, called, according to the figures impressed upon them, rofaries, lionades, eagles, and by the like names. They were imported from France and other countries, and were so much below the proper currency of the kingdom, that they were not worth so much as a halfpenny each. They were at length decreed in the year 1302, and good coins struck in their place. These were the first Irish coins in which the sceptre was left out. They were struck in the reign of Edward, the son of our Henry III., and are still found among the other antiquities of that country. They have the king's head in a triangle full faced. The penny, when well preserved, weighs 22 grains; the halfpenny 10½ grains.\n\nMITTAU, the capital of the duchy of Courland. It is strongly fortified; but was taken by the Swedes in 1701, and by the Muscovites in 1706. E. Long. 23, N. Lat. 56.44.\n\nMITTIMUS, as generally used, hath two significations. 1. It signifies a writ for removing or transferring of records from one court to another. 2. It signifies a precept, or command in writing, under the hand and seal of a justice of the peace, directed to the gaoler or keeper of some prison, for the receiving and safe keeping of an offender charged with any crime, until he be delivered by due course of law.\n\nMITYLENE, or Mytilene, in Ancient Geography, a celebrated, powerful, and affluent city, capital of the island of Lesbos. It received its name from Mitylene, the daughter of Macareus, a king of the country. It is greatly commended by the ancients for the stateliness of its buildings and the fruitfulness of its soil, but more particularly for the great men it produced: Pitacius, Alcaeus, Sappho, Terpander, Theophanes, Helianicus, &c., were all natives of Mitylene. It was long a seat of learning; and, with Rhodes and Athens, it had the honour of having educated many of the great men of Rome and Greece. In the Peloponnesian war, the Mitylenians suffered greatly for their revolt from the power of Athens; and in the Mithridatic wars, they had the boldness to resist the Romans, and disdain the treaties which had been made between Mithridates and Sylla. See Metellus.\n\nMIXT, or mixt body, in Chemistry, that which is compounded of different elements or principles.\n\nMIXTURE, a compound or assemblage of several different bodies in the same mass. Chemical mixture is attended with many phenomena which are never observed in simple mixtures; such as heat, effervescence, &c. To chemical mixture belong the union of acids and alkalies, the amalgamation of metals, solution of gums, &c., and upon it depend many of the principal operations of Chemistry. See that article, passim.\n\nMixture, in Pharmacy, a medicine which differs from a julep in this respect, that it receives into its composition not only salts, extracts, and other substances dissoluble in water; but also earths, powders, and such substances as cannot be dissolved.\n\nMIZEN, in the sea language, is a particular mast or sail. The mizen mast stands in the sternmost part of the ship. In some great ships there are two of these; when that next the main-mast is called the main-mizen, and that next the poop the bonaventure mizen.\n\nMIZRAIM, or Misraim, the dual name of Egypt, used in Scripture to denote the Higher and Lower Egypt, which see. It sometimes occurs singular, Maxor: 2 Kings xix. Isaiah xix. Micah vii.\n\nMNEMOSYNE, in fabulous history, a daughter of Coelus and Terra. She married Jupiter, by whom she had the nine Muses. The word mnemosyne signifies \"memory;\" and therefore the poets have rightly called Memory the mother of the Muses, because it is to that mental endowment that mankind are indebted for their progress in science.\n\nMNIUM, marshmoss; a genus of the natural order of musci, belonging to the cryptogamia class of plants. See Botany Index.\n\nMOAB, in Ancient Geography, a country of Arabia Petraea; so called from Moab the son of Lot, to whose posterity this country was allotted by divine appointment, Deut. xi. 9. It was originally occupied by the Emim, a race of giants extirpated by the Moabites, ibid. Moab anciently lay to the south of Ammon, before Sihon the Amorite stripped both nations of a part of their territory, afterwards occupied by the Israelites, Numb. xxii.; and then Moab was bounded by the river Arnon to the north, the Lacus Asphaltites to the west,\nMOAT, or DITCH, in fortification, a deep trench dug round the rampart of a fortified place, to prevent surprizes.\n\nThe brink of the moat, next the rampart, is called the scarpe; and the opposite one, the counter-scarpe.\n\nA dry moat round a large place, with a strong garison, is preferable to one full of water; because the passage may be disputed inch by inch, and the besiegers, when lodged in it, are continually exposed to the bombs, grenades, and other fire works, which are thrown incessantly from the rampart into their works. In the middle of dry moats, there is sometimes another small one, called cunette; which is generally dug so deep till they find water to fill it.\n\nThe deepest and broadest moats are accounted the best; but a deep one is preferable to a broad one; the ordinary breadth is about 20 fathoms, and the depth about 16.\n\nTo drain a moat that is full of water, they dig a trench deeper than the level of the water, to let it run off; and then throw hurdles upon the mud and slime, covering them with earth or bundles of rushes, to make a sure and firm passage.\n\nMOATAZALITES, or SEPARATISTS, a religious sect among the Turks, who deny all forms and qualities in the Divine Being; or who divest God of his attributes.\n\nThere are two opinions among the Turkish divines concerning God. The first admits metaphysical forms or attributes; as, that God has wisdom, by which he is wise; power, by which he is powerful; eternity, by which he is eternal, &c. The second allows God to be wise, powerful, eternal; but will not allow any form or quality in God, for fear of admitting a multiplicity. Those who follow this latter opinion are called Moatazalites; they who follow the former, Sephalites.\n\nThe Moatazalites also believed that the word of God was created in subjecta, as the schoolmen term it, and to consist of letters and sound; copies thereof being written in books to express or imitate the original: they denied absolute predestination, and affirmed that man is a free agent. This sect is said to have first invented the scholastic divinity; and is subdivided into no less than 20 inferior sects, which mutually brand one another with infidelity.\n\nMOBILE, MOVEABLE, any thing susceptible of motion, or that is disposed to be moved either by itself or by some other prior mobile or mover.\n\nPrimum Mobile, in the ancient astronomy, was a ninth heaven or sphere, imagined above those of the planets and fixed stars. This was supposed to be the first mover, and to carry all the lower spheres round along with it; by its rapidity communicating to them a motion whereby they revolved in 24 hours. But the diurnal revolution of the planets is now accounted for without the assistance of any such primum mobile.\n\nPerpetuum Mobile. See Perpetual Motion.\n\nMOCHO, Moco, or Mokha; by some supposed to be the Mula or Muza of Ptolemy, is a port and town on the Red sea, of considerable trade; contains about 10,000 inhabitants, Jews, Armenians, and Mohammedans; and it gives name to a kingdom extending along the most southern coast of Arabia; of which that part which lies next the sea is a dry barren desert, in some places 10 or 12 leagues over; but bounded by mountains, which being well watered, enjoy an almost perpetual spring; and besides coffee, the peculiar produce of this country, yields corn, grapes, myrrh, frankincense, cassia, balm, gums of several sorts, mangos, dates, pomegranates, &c. The weather here is hot and sultry in summer, especially when the south wind blows, that it would be insupportable, if it was not mitigated by the cool breezes that generally blow from the mountains on the north, or the Red and Arabian seas on the west and east. The heat in winter is equal to that of our warmest summers; and it is very seldom that either clouds or rain are seen. The city of Mocha is now the emporium for the trade of all India to the Red sea. The trade was removed hither from Aden, in consequence of the prophecy of a sheik, much revered by the people, who foretold that it would soon become a place of extensive commerce notwithstanding its disadvantageous situation. The buildings here are lofty, and tolerably regular, having a pleasant aspect from Mecca. The steeples of several mosques are very high, presenting themselves to view at a great distance. Their markets are well stored with beef, mutton, lamb, kid, camels, and antelopes flesh, common fowls, Guinea hens, partridges, and pigeons. The sea affords plenty of fish, but not savoury; which some think proceeds from the extreme saltness of the water and the nature of their aliment. The markets are also stocked with fruit, such as grapes, peaches, apricots, quinces, and nectarines; although neither shrub nor tree is to be seen near the town, except a few date trees. Frequently no rain falls here in two or three years, and seldom more than a shower or two in a year; but in the mountains, at the distance of about 25 miles from Mocha, the earth is watered with a gentle shower every morning, which makes the valleys fertile in corn and the fruits natural to the climate. The Arab inhabitants, though remarkably grave and superstitious, are said to be extremely covetous and hypocritical; robbing, thieving, and committing piracy, without the least scruple or remorse. The English and Dutch companies have handsome houses here, and carry on a great trade in coffee, olibanum, myrrh, aloes, liquid storax, white and yellow arsenic, gum arabic, myrrh, balm of Gilead, and other drugs. One inconvenience, however, they sustain from the violence and exactions of the Arabian princes; but the king's customs are easy, being fixed at three per cent. to Europeans. Of the coins at Mocha, the most current is the camafie, which rises and falls in value at the banker's discretion: they are from 50 to 80 for a current dollar, which is but an imaginary species, being always reckoned one and a half per cent. lower than Spanish dollars.\n\nMOCKING BIRD.

For its import in Grammar, see that article, No. 80.\n\nMode, in Metaphysics, seems properly to denote the manner of a thing's existence: but Locke, whole language\nlanguage in that science is generally adopted, uses the word in a sense somewhat different from its ordinary and proper signification. \"Such complex ideas, which, however compounded, contain not in them the supposition of subsisting by themselves, but are considered as dependencies on, or affections of, substances,\" he calls modes. Of these modes, there are, according to him, two sorts, which deserve distinct consideration. First, there are some \"which are only variations, or different combinations of the same simple idea, without the mixture of any other, as a dozen or a score; which are nothing but the ideas of so many distinct units added together;\" and these he calls simple modes. Secondly, \"There are others compounded of simple ideas of several kinds put together to make one complex one; v.g., beauty, consisting of a certain composition of colour and figure, causing delight in the beholder; theft, which being the concealed change of the possession of anything without the consent of the proprietor, contains, as is visible, a combination of several ideas of several kinds;\" and these he calls mixed modes. For the just distinction between ideas and notions, as well as between ideas and the qualities of external objects, which in this account of modes are all confounded together, see Metaphysics.\n\nMode, in Music, a regular disposition of the air and accompaniments, relative to certain principal sounds upon which a piece of music is formed, and which are called the essential sounds of the mode.\n\nOur modes are not, like those of the ancients, characterized by any sentiment which they tend to excite, but result from our system of harmony alone. The sounds essential to the mode are in number three, and form together one perfect chord. 1. The tonic or key, which is the fundamental note both of the tone and of the mode. 2. The dominant, which is a fifth from the tonic. 3. The mediant, which properly constitutes the mode, and which is a third from the same tonic. As this third may be of two kinds, there are of consequence two different modes. When the mediant forms a greater third with the tonic, the mode is major; when the third is lesser, it is minor. See Music.\n\nMODEL, in a general sense, an original pattern, proposed for any one to copy or imitate.\n\nThis word is particularly used, in building, for an artificial pattern made in wood, stone, plaster, or other matter, with all its parts and proportions, in order for the better conducting and executing some great work, and to give an idea of the effect it will have in large. In all great buildings, it is much the surest way to make a model in relief, and not to trust to a bare design or draught. There are also models for the building of ships, &c., and for extraordinary staircases, &c.\n\nThey also use modes in painting and sculpture; whence, in the academies, they give the term model to a naked man or women, disposed in several postures, to afford an opportunity to the scholars to design them in various views and attitudes.\n\nModels in imitation of any natural or artificial substance, are most usually made by means of moulds composed of plaster of Paris. For the purpose of making these moulds, this kind of plaster is much more fit than any other substance, on account of the power it has of absorbing water, and soon condensing into a hard substance, even after it has been rendered so thin as to be of the consistence of cream. This happens in a shorter or longer time as the plaster is of a better or worse quality; and its good or bad properties depend very much upon its age, to which, therefore, particular regard ought to be had. It is sold in the shops at very different prices; the finest being made use of for casts, and the middling sort for moulds. It may be very easily coloured by means of almost any kind of powder excepting what contains an alkaline salt; for this would chemically decompose the substance of it, and render it unfit for use. A very considerable quantity of chalk would also render it soft and useless, but lime hardens it to a great degree. The addition of common size will likewise render it much harder than if mere water is made use of. In making either moulds or models, however, we must be careful not to make the mixture too thick at first; for if this is done, and more water added to thin it, the composition must always prove brittle and of a bad quality.\n\nThe particular manner of making models (or casts, as they are also called) depends on the form of the subject to be taken. The process is easy, where the parts are elevated only in a slight degree, or where they form only a right or obtuse angle with the principal surface from which they project; but where the parts project in smaller angles, or form curves inclined towards the principal surface, the work is more difficult. This observation, however, holds good only with regard to hard and inflexible bodies; for such as are soft may often be freed from the mould, even though they have the shape last mentioned. But though this be the case with the soft original substance, it is not so with the inflexible model when once it is cast.\n\nThe moulds are to be made of various degrees of thickness, according to the size of the model to be cast; and may be from half an inch to an inch, or, if very large, an inch and a half. Where a number of models are to be taken from one mould, it will likewise be necessary to have it of a stronger contexture than where only a few are required, for very obvious reasons.\n\nIt is much more easy to make a mould for any soft anatomical substance than a rigid one, as in any of the vitreous models. The animal body; for the fluidity of the mixture makes it easily accommodate itself to the projecting parts of the substance; and as it is necessary to inflate these substances, they may be very readily extracted again by letting out the air which distended them.\n\nWhen a model is to be taken, the surface of the original is first to be greased, in order to prevent the plaster from sticking to it; but if the substance itself is slippery, as is the case with the internal parts of the human body, this need not be done: when necessary, it may be laid over with linseed oil by means of a painter's brush. The original is then to be laid on a smooth table, previously greased or covered with a cloth, to prevent the plaster sticking to it; then surround the original with a frame or ridge of glaziers' putty, at such a distance from it as will admit the plaster to rest upon the table on all sides of the subject for about an inch, or as much as is sufficient to give the proper degree of strength to the mould. A sufficient\ncient quantity of plaster is then to be poured as uniformly as possible over the whole substance, until it be everywhere covered to such a thickness as to give a proper substance to the mould, which may vary in proportion to the size. The whole must then be suffered to remain in this condition till the plaster has attained its hardness; when the frame is taken away, the mould may be inverted, and the subject removed from it; and when the plaster is thoroughly dry let it be well seasoned.\n\nHaving formed and seasoned the moulds, they must next be prepared for the casts by greasing the inside of them with a mixture of olive oil and lard in equal parts, and then filled with fine fluid plaster, and the plane of the mould formed by its resting on the surface of the table covered to a sufficient thickness with coarse plaster, to form a strong basis or support for the cast where this support is requisite, as is particularly the case where the thin and membranous parts of the body are to be represented. After the plaster is poured into the mould, it must be suffered to stand until it has acquired the greatest degree of hardness it will receive; after which the mould must be removed: but this will be attended with some difficulty when the shape of the subject is unfavourable; and in some cases the mould must be separated by means of a smallallet and chisel. If by these instruments any parts of the model should be broken off, they may be cemented by making the two surfaces to be applied to each other quite wet; then interposing between them a little liquid plaster; and lastly, the joint smoothed after being thoroughly dry. Any small holes that may be made in the mould can be filled up with liquid plaster, after the sides of them have been thoroughly wetted, and smoothed over with the edge of a knife.\n\nIn many cases it is altogether impracticable to prepare a mould of one piece for a whole subject; and therefore it must be considered how this can be done in such a manner as to divide the mould into the fewest pieces. This may be effected by making every piece cover as much of the pattern as possible, without surrounding such projecting parts, or running into such hollows as would not admit a separation of the mould. It is impossible, however, to give any particular directions in this matter which can hold good in every instance, the number of pieces of which the mould is to consist being always determined from the shape of the pattern. Thus the mould of the human calculus will require no more than three pieces, but that of an os femoris could scarce have fewer than ten or twelve.—Where any internal pieces are required, they are first to be made, and then the outer pieces after the former have become hard.\n\nTo make a mould upon a hard and dry substance, we must, in the first place, rub the surface of it smoothly over with the mixture of oil and lard above mentioned. Such hollows as require internal pieces are then to be filled up with fluid plaster; and while it continues in this state, a wire loop must be introduced into it, by which, when hardened, it can be pulled off. The plaster should be somewhat raised in a pyramidal form around this wire, and afterwards cut smooth with a knife while yet in its soft state; preserving two or three angular ridges from the loop to the outer edge, that it may fix the more steadily in the outer piece of the mould to be afterwards made upon it. Let the outer piece then be well greased, to prevent the second piece from adhering; the loop being enclosed with some glaziers putty, both to prevent the second piece from adhering and to preserve a hollow place for the cord.\n\nTo form the second or outside piece, mix a quantity of plaster proportioned to the extent of surface it is to cover and the intended thickness of the mould; when it is just beginning to thicken, or assumes such a consistency as not to run off very easily, spread it over the internal piece or pieces as well as the pattern, taking care at the same time not to go too far lest it should not deliver freely; and as the plaster becomes more tenacious, add more upon the pattern until it has become sufficiently thick, keeping the edges square and smooth like the edge of a board. The plaster should be spread equally upon all parts, which is best done by a painter's pallet knife or apothecary's bolus knife; but for this the instrument should be somewhat less pliable than it is commonly made.\n\nWhen the outside piece is hardened, the edges are to be pared smooth, and nearly made square with a small pointed knife. Little holes of a conical shape are to be made with the point of a knife about an inch distant from one another, according to the size of the piece. These are designed to receive the fluid plaster in forming the adjacent parts of the mould, and occasion points corresponding to the hollows; and are intended to preserve the edges of the different pieces steadily in their proper relative situations. The third piece is then to be formed in a manner similar to the second; greasing the edges of the former plentifully with hog's lard and oil, to prevent the pieces from adhering to each other. Thus the pattern is to be wholly enclosed, only leaving a proper orifice for pouring in the plaster to form the model; small holes being also bored in the mould opposite to the wire-loops fixed in the inside pieces, through which a cord is to be conveyed from the loop to confine such pieces during the time of casting. In some cases, however, it is not necessary that the mould should totally enclose the pattern; for instance, where a model is to be made of a pedestal, or a bust of any part of the human body. The bottom of such moulds being left open, there is accordingly ample room for pouring in the plaster.\n\nAfter the mould is completely formed, it is next to be dried either naturally or by a gentle artificial heat, and then seasoned in the following manner:—Having been made thoroughly dry, which, if the mould is large, will require two or three weeks, it is to be brushed over plentifully with linseed oil boiled with sugar of lead, finely levigated litharge, or oil of vitriol. The inside and joints of the mould should be particularly well supplied with it. If the mould be large, it is needless to attend to the outside; but when the moulds are small, it will not be improper to boil them in the oil; by which means their pores are more exactly filled than could otherwise be done. After the moulds have undergone this operation, they are again set by to dry, when, being greased with olive oil and hog's lard, they are fit for use. If linseed oil be used for greasing the moulds, it will in a short time impart a disagreeable yellow colour to the casts.\nThe mould being properly prepared and seasoned, nothing more is requisite to form the model than to pour the finest liquid plaster of Paris into it. After a layer of this, about half an inch in thickness, has been formed all round the mould, we may use the coarser kind to fill it up entirely, or to give to the model what thickness we please.\n\nBesides the models which are taken from inanimate subjects, it has been frequently attempted to take the exact resemblance of people while living, by using their face as the original of a model, from whence to take a mould; and the operation, however disagreeable, has been submitted to by persons of the highest ranks in life. A considerable difficulty occurs in this, however, by reason of the person's being apt to shrink and distort his features when the liquid is poured upon him; neither is he altogether without danger of suffocation, unless the operator well understands his business.\n\nTo avoid the former inconvenience, it will be proper to mix the plaster with warm instead of cold water, by which means the person will be under no temptation to shrink; and to prevent any danger of a fatal accident, the following method is to be practised: Having laid the person horizontally on his back, the head must first be raised by means of a pillow to the exact position in which it is naturally carried when the body is erect; then the parts to be represented must be very thinly covered over with fine oil of almonds by means of a painter's brush; the face is then to be first covered with fine fluid plaster, beginning at the upper part of the forehead, and spreading it over the eyes, which are to be kept close, that the plaster may not come in contact with the globe; yet not closed so strongly as to cause any unnatural wrinkles. Cover then the nose and ears, plugging first up the meatus auditory with cotton, and the nostrils with a small quantity of tow rolled up, of a proper size, to exclude the plaster. During the time that the nose is thus stopped, the person is to breathe through the mouth; in this state the fluid plaster is to be brought down low enough to cover the upper lip, observing to leave the rolls of tow projecting out of the plaster. When the operation is thus far carried on, the plaster must be suffered to harden; after which the tow may be withdrawn, and the nostrils left free and open for breathing. The mouth is then to be closed in its natural position, and the plaster brought down to the extremity of the chin. Begin then to cover that part of the breast which is to be represented, and spread the plaster to the outsides of the arms and upwards, in such a manner as to meet and join that which is previously laid on the face: when the whole of the mass has acquired its due hardness, it is to be cautiously lifted, without breaking, or giving pain to the person. After the mould is constructed, it must be seasoned in the manner already directed; and when the mould is cast, it is to be separated from the mould by means of a small mallet and chisel. The eyes, which are necessarily shown closed, are to be carved, so that the eyelids may be represented in an elevated posture; the nostrils hollowed out, and the back part of the head, from which, on account of the hair, no mould can be taken, must be finished according to the skill of the artist. The edges of the model are then to be neatly smoothed off, and the bust fixed on its pedestal.\n\nThe method of making models in the plaster of Paris is undoubtedly the most easy way of obtaining pliable models. When models, however, are made of such dels, &c., large objects that the model itself must be of considerable size, it is vain to attempt making it in the way above described. Such models must be constructed by the hand with some soft substance, as wax, clay, putty, &c., and it being necessary to keep all the proportions with mathematical exactness, the construction of a single model of this kind must be a work of great labour and expense as well as of time. Of all those which have been undertaken by human industry, however, perhaps the most remarkable is that constructed by General Pfister, to represent the mountainous parts of Switzerland. It is composed of 142 compartments, of different sizes and forms, respectively numbered, and so artfully put together, that they can be separated and replaced with the greatest ease. The model itself is 20½ feet long and 12 broad, and formed on a scale which represents two English miles and a quarter by an English foot: comprehending part of the cantons of Zug, Zurich, Schweitz, Unterwalden, Lucerne, Berne, and a small part of the mountains of Glarus; in all, an extent of country of 18½ leagues in length and 12 in breadth. The highest point of the model, from the level of the centre (which is the lake of Lucerne), is about ten inches; and as the most elevated mountain represented therein rises 1475 toises or 9440 feet above the lake of Lucerne, at a gross calculation, the height of an inch in the model is about 900 feet. The whole is painted of different colours, in such a manner as to represent objects as they exist in nature; and so exactly is this done, that not only the woods of oak, beech, pine, and other trees, are distinguished, but even the strata of the several rocks are marked, each being shaped upon the spot, and formed of granite, gravel, or such other substances as compose the natural mountain. So minute also is the accuracy of the plan, that it comprises not only all the mountains, lakes, rivers, towns, villages, and forests, but every cottage, bridge, torrent, road, and even every path is distinctly marked.\n\nThe principal material employed in the construction of this extraordinary model, is a mixture of charcoal, lime, clay, a little pitch, with a thin coat of wax; and is so hard that it may be trod upon without any damage. It was begun in the year 1766, at which time the general was about 50 years of age, and it employed him till the month of August 1785; during all which long space of time he was employed in the most laborious and even dangerous tasks.—He raised the plans with his own hands on the spot, took the elevation of mountains, and laid them down in their several proportions. In the prosecution of this laborious employment, he was twice arrested for a spy; and in the popular cantons was frequently forced to work by moonlight, in order to avoid the jealousy of the peasants, who imagined that their liberty would be endangered should a plan of their country be taken with such minute exactness. Being obliged frequently to remain on the tops of some of the Alps, where no provisions could be procured, he\nMODENA, a duchy of Italy, bounded on the south by Tuscany and the republic of Lucca, on the north by the duchy of Mantua, on the east by the Bolognese and the territories of the Church, and on the west by the duchy of Parma; extending in length from south to north about 56 English miles, and in breadth between 24 and 36, and yielding plenty of corn, wine, and fruits, with mineral waters. In some places also petroleum is skimmed off the surface of the water of deep wells made on purpose; and in others is found a kind of earth or topsoil, which, when pulverized, is said to be an excellent remedy against poison, fevers, dysenteries, and hypochondriac disorders. The country of La Salfa affords several kinds of petrifications. The principal rivers are the Crostolo, Secchia, and Panaro. The family of Este, dukes of Modena, is very ancient. They had their name from Este, a small city in the district of Padua. In 1753, the duke was appointed imperial vicar general, field marshal, and governor of the Milanese, during the minority of the archduke Peter Leopold, who was declared governor general of the Austrian Lombardy. The duke, though a vassal of the empire, hath an unlimited power within his own dominions.\n\nMODENA, an ancient city, in Latin Mutina, which gives name to a duchy of Italy, and is its capital. It stands 28 miles east of Parma, 44 almost south of Mantua, and 20 west of Bologna; and is a pretty large and populous, but not a handsome city. The population is said to amount to about 40,000. It is much celebrated by Roman authors for its grandeur and opulence; but was a great sufferer by the siege it underwent during the troubles of the triumvirate. It hath long been the usual residence of the dukes; and is also the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Bologna. Mr Keyser says, that when Decius Brutus was besieged here by Mark Antony, Hirtius the consul made use of carrier pigeons; and that, even at this day, pigeons are trained up at Modena to carry letters and bring back answers. This city hath given birth to several celebrated persons, particularly Tasso the poet, Corregio the great painter, Sigonius the civilian and historian, Da Vignola the architect, and Montecuculi the imperial general. The tutelary saint of it is named Geminianus. The ducal palace is a very noble edifice, in which, among the other fine pictures, the birth of Christ by Corregio, called la Notte Felice, is much celebrated. The only manufacture for which this city is noted, is that of mats, of which great numbers are exported. The churches of the Jesuits, of the Theatines, and of St Moderation Dominic, are well worth viewing. In the college of St Carlo Boromeo between 70 and 80 young noblemen are continually maintained, and instructed both in the sciences and gentle exercises. St Beatrix, who was of the family of Este, is said to knock always at the gate of the palace three days before any of the family dies. Before most of the houses are covered walks or porticoes, as at Bologna. The city is fortified, and on its fourth side stands the citadel. E. Long. 11°. N. Lat. 44°. 34'.\n\nMODERATION, in Ethics, is a virtue consisting in the proper government of our appetites, passions, and pursuits, with respect to honours, riches, and pleasures; and in this sense it is synonymous with temperance: it is also often used to denote candour.\n\nMODERATOR, in the schools, the person who presides at a dispute, or in a public assembly: thus the president of the annual assembly of the church of Scotland is styled moderator.\n\nMODERN, something new, or of our time; in opposition to what is antique or ancient.\n\nMODERN Authors, according to Naude, are all those who have wrote since Boethius. The modern philosophy commences with Galileo; the modern astronomy with Copernicus.\n\nMODESTY, in Ethics, is sometimes used to denote humility; and sometimes to express chastity, or purity of sentiments and manners.—Modesty, in this last sense, and as particularly applied to women, is defined by the authors of the Encyclopédie Methodique, as a natural, chary, and honest shame; a secret fear; a feeling on account of what may be accompanied with disgrace. Women who possess only the remains of a culpable modesty, make but feeble efforts to resist: those who have obliterated every trace of modesty from their countenance, soon extinguish it completely in their soul, and throw aside for ever the veil of decency. She, on the contrary, who truly possesses modesty, passes over in silence attempts against her honour, and forbears speaking of those from whom she has received an outrage, when in doing so she must reveal actions and expressions that might give alarm to virtue.\n\nThe idea of modesty is not a chimera, a popular prejudice, or an illusion arising from laws and education. Nature, which speaks the same language to all men, has, with the unanimous consent of nations, annexed contempt to female incontinence. To resist and to attack are laws of her appointment: and while she bestows desires on both parties, they are in the one accompanied with boldness, in the other with shame. To individuals she has allotted long spaces of time for the purposes of self-preservation, and but moments for the propagation of their species. What arms more gentle than Modesty could she have put into the hands of that sex which she designed to make resistance.\n\nIf it were the custom for both sexes to make and receive advances indiscriminately, vain importunity would not be prevented: the fire of passion would never be fanned up, but languish in tedious liberty; the most amiable of all feelings would scarcely warm the human breast; its object would with difficulty be attained. That obstacle which seems to remove this ob-\nModesty jeft to a distance, in fact brings it nearer. The veil of shame only makes the defires more attractive. Modesty kindles that flame which it endeavours to suppress: its fears, its evasions, its caution, its timid avowals, its pleasing and affecting finesses, speak more plainly what it wishes to conceal, than passion can do without it: it is Modesty, in short, which enhances the value of a favour, and mitigates the pain of a refusal.\n\nSince modesty is the secret fear of ignominy; and since all nations, ancient or modern, have confessed the obligation of its laws; it must be absurd to violate them in the punishment of crimes, which should always have for its object the re-establishment of order. Was it the intention of those oriental nations, who exposed women to elephants, trained for an abominable species of punishment, to violate one law by the observance of another? By an ancient practice among the Romans, a girl could not be put to death before she was marriageable. Tiberius found means to evade this law, by ordering them to be violated by the executioner previous to the infliction of punishment; the refinement of a cruel tyrant, who sacrificed the morals to the customs of his people! When the legislature of Japan caused women to be exposed naked in the market places, and obliged them to walk on all fours like brutes, modesty was shocked: but when it wanted to force a mother—when it wanted to compel a son—nature received an outrage.\n\nSuch is the influence of climate in other countries, that the physical part of love possesses an almost irresistible force. The resistance is feeble; the attack is accompanied with a certainty of success. This is the case at Patana, at Bantam, and in the small kingdoms on the coast of Guinea. When the women in these countries (says Mr Smith) meet with a man, they lay hold of him and threaten to inform their husbands if he despises their favours. But here the sexes seem to have abolished the laws peculiar to each. It is fortunate to live in a temperate climate-like ours, where that sex which possesses the most powerful charms exerts them to embellish society; and where modest women, while they reserve themselves for the pleasures of one, contribute to the amusement of all.\n\nMODIFICATION, in Philosophy, that which modifies a thing, or gives it this or that manner of being. Quantity and quality are accidents which modify all bodies.\n\nDecree of Modification, in Scots Law, a decree ascertaining the extent of a minister's stipend, without proportioning it among the persons liable in payment.\n\nMODILLIONS, in Architecture, ornaments in the corniche of the Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite columns.\n\nMODIUS, a Roman dry measure for all sorts of grain, containing 32 heminae, or 16 sextarii, or one third of the amphora; amounting to an English peck. See Measure.\n\nMODULATION, the art of forming anything to certain proportion.\n\nMODULATION, in reading or speaking. See Reading.\n\nMODULATION, in Music, derived from the Latin modulari. This word in our language is susceptible of several different significations. It frequently means Module no more than an air, or a number of musical sounds properly connected and arranged. Thus it answers to what Mr Malcolm understands by the word tune, when he does not expressly treat concerning the tuning of instruments. Thus likewise it expresses the French word chant; for which reason, in the article Music, we have frequently expressed the one word by the other. But the precise and technical acceptation to which it ought to be confined, is the art of composing melody or harmony agreeably to the laws prescribed by any particular key, that of changing the key, or of regularly and legitimately passing from one key to another. See Music.\n\nMODULE, in Architecture, a certain measure, or bigness, taken at pleasure, for regulating the proportions of columns, and the symmetry or disposition of the whole building. Architects generally choose the semidiameter of the bottom of the column for their module, and this they subdivide into parts or minutes.\n\nMCEONIA, or MCEONIA. See MCEONIA and LYDIA.\n\nMCESTIA, or MYSTIA, in Ancient Geography, a country of Europe, extending from the confluence of the Savaus and the Danube to the shores of the Euxine. It was divided into Upper and Lower Mcezia. Lower Mcezia was on the borders of the Euxine, and comprehended that tract of country which received the name of Pontus from its vicinity to the sea. Upper Mcezia lay beyond the other, in the inland country.\n\nMOFFAT, a village of Scotland, in Annandale, in the county of Dumfries, 50 miles south-west of Edinburgh; famous for its sulphureous well, which has been in just estimation for near 150 years as a remedy in all cutaneous and rheumatic complaints; and for its chalybeate spring, called Hartfell spaw, which was discovered above 50 years ago, and is of a very bracing quality.—The place is chiefly supported by the company who resort thither for the benefit of its waters and air; but it has also a manufacture of coarse woollen stuffs. It is a well-built clean village; and contains many good and even elegant lodgings, a tolerable assembly room, a bowling green and walks, and one of the best inns between London and Edinburgh.\n\nMOFFETTA. See AMPSANCTI.\n\nMOGODORE, or MOGADORE, a large, uniform, and well built town in the kingdom of Morocco, situated about 350 miles from Tangier on the Atlantic ocean, and surrounded on the land side by deep and heavy lands. The European factory here consists of about a dozen mercantile houses of different nations, whose owners, from the protection granted them by the emperor, live in full security from the Moors, whom indeed they keep at a rigid distance. They export, to America, mules; to Europe, Morocco leather, hides, gum arabic, gum sandarac, ostrich feathers, copper, wax, wool, elephants teeth, fine mats, beautiful carpeting, dates, figs, raisins, olives, almonds, oil, &c. In return, they import timber, artillery of all kinds, gunpowder, woollen cloths, linens, lead, iron in bars, all kinds of hardware and trinkets, such as looking glasses, snuff boxes, watches, small knives, &c.; tea, sugar, spices, and most of the useful articles which are not otherwise to be procured in this empire. The town is regularly fortified on the\nsea side; and on the land, batteries are so placed as to prevent any incursion from the southern Arabs, who are of a turbulent disposition, and who, from the great wealth which is known to be always in Mogodore, would gladly avail themselves of any opportunity that offered to pillage the town. The entrance, both by sea and land, consists of elegant stone arch-ways, with double gates. The market-place is handsomely built, with piazzas of the same materials; and at the water port there is a customhouse and powder magazine, both of which are neat stone buildings. Besides these public edifices, the emperor has a small but handsome palace for his occasional residence. The streets of the town, though very narrow, are all in straight lines; and the houses, contrary to what we meet with in the other towns of the empire, are lofty and regular. The bay, which is little better than a road, and is very much exposed when the wind is at north-west, is formed by a curve in the land, and a small island about a quarter of a mile from the shore.\n\nIts entrance is defended by a fort well furnished with guns.\n\nMOGULS, a celebrated nation of Asia, whose conquests formerly were the most rapid and extensive of any people recorded in history. They themselves deduce their origin from Japhet, or, as they call him, Japhit, the son of Noah. His son Turk, they say, was the first king, or khan, of those nations who are now known by the separate names of Turks, Tartars, and Moguls; and the Tartars especially assert, that their proper designation is Turks. To this prince is attributed many of those inventions which barbarous nations commonly ascribe to their first sovereigns. He was succeeded by Taumak; in whose reign the whole posterity of Turk were divided into four large tribes, denominated the orders of Erlat, Gialair, Kaugin, Berlas or Perlas; of which last came the famous Timur Beg, or Tamerlane.—From this time to that of Alanza Khan, we meet with nothing remarkable. In his reign the Turks being immersed in all kinds of luxury, universally apostatized into idolatry. Having two sons, Tartar and Mogul, he divided his dominions among them, and thus gave rise to the two empires of the Tartars and Moguls.\n\nThe two nations had not long existed before they began to make war upon each other; and after long contention, the event at last was, that II Khan, emperor of the Moguls, was totally overthrown by Siuntz Khan, emperor of the Tartars; and to great was the defeat, that the Mogul nation seems to have been almost exterminated. Only two of II Khan's family survived this disaster. These were Kajan his youngest son, and Nagos his nephew, who were both of an age, and had both been married the same year. These two princes, with their wives, had been taken prisoners by Siuntz Khan, but found means to make their escape to their own country. Here they seized upon all the cattle which had not been carried off by the Tartars: which was easily done, as having none to dispute the property with them; then stripping some of the slain, they took their clothes, and retired into the mountains. They passed several mountains without much difficulty; but at last advanced to the foot of one exceedingly high, which had no way over it but a very small path made by certain animals, called in the Tartar language archara. This path they found themselves obliged to make use of, though it was so strait, that only one could pass at a time, and he was in the most imminent danger of breaking his neck at the least false step. Having ascended the mountain on one side by this arpath, they descended by the same on the other side; and were agreeably surprised to find themselves in a delightful most delightful tract, interperled with rivulets and charming meadows, abounding with a vast variety of delicious fruits, and enclosed on all sides by inaccessible mountains, in such a manner as to shelter them from all future pursuits of the Tartars. Here they lived some time, and gave this beautiful country the name of Irgana-kon, in illusion to its situation; Irgana signifying, in the old language of the Moguls, a \"valley,\" and Kon a \"deep height.\"\n\nIn process of time these two families very much increased. Kajan, whose posterity was the most numerous, called his descendants Kajath; but the people springing from Nagos were divided into two tribes; one of which received the appellation of Nagoster, and the other that of Durlagan.\n\nThese two Mogul princes and their descendants lived in this place for more than 400 years; but the latter then finding it too narrow for them, meditated a return to the country from which their forefathers had been driven. For some time, however, they found this impracticable, as the path that conducted their ancestors had been long since destroyed. At last they discovered, that one part of the high mountain above-mentioned was not very thick in a certain place; and also, that it consisted entirely of iron ore. To this, having before set fire to a layer of wood, and another of charcoal, laid along the foot of the mountain, they applied 70 large bellows, and at last melted the mountain in such a manner, that an opening was made large enough for a loaded camel to pass; and through this passage they all marched out with great joy.\n\nThe Moguls having thus issued as it were from a new world, overthrew the Tartars in their turn; and whence continued to be a very considerable nation till the time of their great hero Temujin, afterwards called Jenghiz Khan, whom they extol in the most extravagant manner. It is difficult, however, to say, at the time Temujin made his appearance, how far the dominions of the Moguls extended, or in what estimation they were held by their neighbours. It seems to be pretty certain that great part of the vast region, now known by the name of Tartary, was then in a state of considerable civilization, and likewise extremely populous, as we find mention made of many cities which the Moguls destroyed; and the incredible multitudes whom they slaughtered, abundantly show the populousness of the country. On the east, the country of the Moguls and Tartars had the great desert which divides Tartary from China; on the west, it had the empire of Karazm, founded by Mahmud Gazni; and on the south were the countries now known by the name of Indoflan, Sind, Pegu, Tonquin, and Cochin China. Thus it came to pass, that the eastern part of modern Tartary, and all Siberia. This whole region was divided among a great number of Aymacks, or tribes; who had each one or more khans, according as it was more or less numerous, or divided into branches. Among these that of the Kara-its was the most powerful: their prince\nprince assumed the title of Grand Khan, and among the rest the Moguls were tributary to him; but, according to the Chinese historians, both the one and the other were tributary to the emperor of Kitay or Katay. China was divided into two parts: the nine southern provinces were in the hands of the Chinese emperors of the Song dynasty, who kept their court at Hang-chew, the capital of the province of Chek-yang; the five northern provinces, excepting part of Shenfu, were possessed by the Kin, a people of Eastern Tartary, from whom are descended the Manchew Tartar, at present masters of China. This vast dominion was named Kitay or Katay, and was divided into two parts: that which belonged to China, was properly called Kitay; and the part which belonged to Tartary was called Karakitay, in which some even include the territories of the Moguls, Karaits, and other tribes which are the subject of the present history. The western part of the empire of Kitay was possessed by a Turkish prince, who had lately founded a new kingdom there called Hya; whose capital city was Hya-chew, now Ninghia in Shenfu, from whence the kingdom took its name. To the west of Hya lay Tangut; a country of great extent, and formerly very powerful; but at that time reduced to a low state, and divided among many princes; some of whom were subject to the emperor of Hya, and others to the emperor of China. All Tartary to the westward as far as the Caspian sea, with the greater part of Little Bucharia, which then passed under the general name of Turkestan, was subject to Ghurkhan, Khurkhan, or Kaver Khan; to whom even the Gazni monarchs are said to have been tributary. This Ghurkhan had been prince of the Western Kitay or Lyau; who, driven out of Kitay by the king, settled in Little Bucharia, and the country to the north, where they founded a powerful state about the year 1124.\n\nThus the Moguls, properly so called, had but a very small extent of empire which could be called their own, if indeed they had any, when Temujin made his appearance. This hero is said by the Tartars to have been of divine origin, since his family could be traced no farther back than ten generations, the mother of whom was got with child by a spirit. The names and transactions of his predecessors are equally uncertain and unimportant: he himself, however, was born in the year 1163, and is said to have come into the world with concealed blood in his hands; from whence it was prognosticated that he would be a great warrior, and obtain the victory over all his enemies.\n\nThis prediction, if any such there was, Temujin most literally fulfilled. At the time of his father's decease, his subjects amounted to between 30,000 and 40,000 families; but of these two-thirds quickly deserted, and Temujin was left almost without subjects. When only 13 years of age, he fought a bloody battle against the revolters; but either was defeated, or gained an indecisive victory; so that he remained in obscurity for 27 years longer. His good fortune at last he owed to the friendship of Vang Khan, who ruled over a great number of Tartar tribes to the north of Kitay, and has been heard of under the name of Profter John among the Europeans. This prince took Temujin under his protection; and a rebellion being afterwards raised against himself, Temujin was made his general, and the khan was kept in possession of his throne: soon after which Temujin subdued the tribes which had revolted from himself, treating them at the same time with the utmost barbarity.\n\nThis happened in the year 1201; but Vang Khan, who instead of continuing the friend of Temujin, now became jealous, and resolved to destroy him by treachery. With contrivance he proposed a marriage between Temujin's son Jiujin's daughter and another between Temujin's daughter and his own son. Temujin was invited to the camp of Vang Khan, in order to celebrate this double marriage; but receiving intelligence of some evil intention against him, he excused himself to Vang Khan's messengers, and desired that the ceremony might be put off to some other time.\n\nA few days after the departure of these messengers, Badu and Kakhik, two brothers, who kept the horses of one of Vang Khan's chief domestics, came and informed Temujin, that the grand Khan finding he had mislaid his aim, was resolved to set out instantly, and surprize him next morning, before he could suspect any danger. Temujin, alarmed at this intelligence, quitted his camp, in the night time, and retired with all his people to some distance. He was scarce gone when Vang Khan's troops arrived, and discharged an incredible number of arrows among the empty tents; but finding nobody there, they pursued Temujin in such haste that they fell into great disorder. In this condition they were suddenly attacked and routed by Temujin; after which an open war with Vang Khan took place.\n\nBy this quarrel almost all the princes of Tartary Temujin were put in motion, some siding with Temujin, and others with Vang Khan. But at last fortune declared in favour of the former: Vang Khan was overthrown in a battle, where he lost 40,000 men; and obliged to fly for refuge to a prince named Tayyan Khan, who was Temujin's father-in-law, and his own enemy, and by whom he was ungenerously put to death. Temujin immediately began to seize on his dominions, great part of which voluntarily submitted; but a confederacy was formed against him by a number of Vang Khan's tributaries, at the head of whom was Jamuka, a prince who had already distinguished himself by his enmity to Temujin; and even Tayyan Khan himself was drawn into the plot, through jealousy of his son-in-law's good fortune. But Temujin was well prepared; and in the year 1204 attacked Tayyan Khan, entirely routed his army, killed himself, and took Jemuka prisoner, whose head he caused instantly to be struck off; after which he marched against the other tribes who had conspired against him. Them he quickly reduced; took a city called Kaybin, where he put all to the sword who had borne arms against him; and reduced all the Mogul tribes in 1205.\n\nTemujin now, having none to oppose him, called a general diet, which he appointed to be held on the first day of the spring 1206; that is, on the day in which the sun entered Aries. To this diet were summoned all the great lords both Moguls and Tartars; and in the mean time, to establish good order in the army, he divided his soldiery into bodies of 10,000, 1000, 100, and 10 men, with their respective officers, all subordinate to the generals, or those who commanded the bodies of 10,000; and these were to act under his own\nMoguls own sons. On the day of holding the diet, the princes of the blood and great lords appeared dressed in white. Temujin dressed in the same manner, with his crown on his head, sat down on his throne, and was complimented by the whole assembly, who wished him the continuance of his health and prosperity. After this they confirmed the Mogul empire to him and his successors, adding all those kingdoms which he had subdued, the descendants of whose vanquished kings were deprived of all right or title to them; and after this he was proclaimed emperor with much ceremony. During this inauguration, a pretended prophet declared that he came from God to tell the assembly, that from thenceforth Temujin should assume the name of Jenghiz Khan, or the most Great Khan of khans; prophesying also, that all his posterity should be khans from generation to generation. This prophecy, which was no doubt owing to Temujin himself, had a surprising effect on his subjects, who from that time concluded that all the world belonged of right to them, and even thought it a crime against heaven for any body to pretend to resist them.\n\nJenghiz Khan having now reduced under his subjection all the wandering tribes of Moguls and Tartars, began to think of reducing those countries to the south and south-west of his own, where the inhabitants were much more civilized than his own subjects; and the countries being full of fortified cities, he must of course expect to meet with more resistance. He began with the emperor of Hya, whose dominions he invaded in 1209, who at last submitted to become his tributary. But in the mean time Jenghiz Khan himself was supposed to be tributary to the emperor of Kitay: who, in 1210, sent him an officer, demanding the customary tribute. This was refused with the utmost indignation, and a war commenced, which ended not but with the dilution of the empire of Kitay, as mentioned under the article China.\n\nIn the year 1216, Jenghiz Khan resolved to carry his arms westward, and therefore left his general Muhuli to pursue his conquests in Kitay. In his journey westward he overthrew an army of 300,000 Tartars who had revolted against him; and, in 1218, sent ambassadors desiring an alliance with Mohammed Karazm Shah, emperor of Gazna. His ambassador was haughtily treated; however, the alliance was concluded; but soon after broken, through the treachery as it is said, of the Karazmian monarch's subjects. This brought on a war attended with the most dreadful devastations, and which ended with the entire destruction of the empire of Karazm or Gazna, as related under the article Gazna.\n\nAfter the reduction of Karazm, part of the Moguls broke into Iran or Persia, where also they made large conquests, while others of their armies invaded Georgia and the countries to the west; all this time committing such enormities, that the Chinese historians say both men and spirits burnt with indignation. In 1225, Jenghiz Khan returned to Hya, where he made war on the emperor for having sheltered some of his enemies. The event was, that the emperor was slain, and his kingdom conquered, or rather destroyed; which, however, was the last exploit of this most cruel conqueror, who died in 1227, as he marched to complete the destruction of the Chinese.\n\nThe Mogul empire, at the death of Jenghiz Khan, extended over a prodigious tract of country; being more than 1800 leagues in length from east to west, and upwards of 1000 in breadth from north to south. Its extent was acknowledged emperor after Jenghiz Khan; and had under his immediate government Mogulestan (the country of the Moguls properly so called), Kitay, and the countries eastward to the Tartarian sea. Jagaty his brother governed under him a great part of the western conquests. The country of the Kipjacks, and others to the east, and north-east, north, and north-west, were governed by Batu or Patu the son of Juji, who had been killed in the wars; while Tuli or Toley, another son of Jenghiz Khan, had Khorasan, Persia, and what part of India was conquered. On the east side the Mogul arms were still attended with success; not only the empire of Kitay, but the southern part of China, was conquered, as already related under that article, No. 24—42. On the west side matters continued much in the same way till the year 1254, when Magu, or Menkho, the fourth khan of the Moguls, (the same who was afterwards killed at a siege in China*), raised a great army,* See China which he gave to his brother Hulaku or Hulage, to extend his dominions westward. In 1255 he entered Iran, where he suppressed the Ismaelians or Assassins, of whom an account is given under the article Assassins, and two years afterwards he advanced to Bagdad, which he took, and cruelly put the caliph to death, treating the city with no more lenity than the Moguls usually treated those which fell into their hands. Everything was put to fire and sword; and in the city and its neighbourhood the number of slain, it is said, amounted to 1,600,000. The next year he invaded Syria; the city of Damascus was delivered up, and, as it made no resistance, the inhabitants were spared; but Aleppo being taken by storm, a greater slaughter ensued there than had taken place at Bagdad, not even the children in their cradles being spared. Some cities of this country revolted the next year, or the year after; but falling again into the hands of the Moguls, they were plundered, and the inhabitants butchered without mercy, or carried into slavery.\n\nHulaku died in 1264, and at his death we may fix the greatest extent of the Mogul empire. It now comprehended the whole of the continent of Asia, excepting part of Indostan, Siam, Pegu, Cochin China, and a few of the countries of Lesser Asia, which had not been attacked by them; and during all these vast conquests no Mogul army had ever been conquered, except one by Jalaloddin, as mentioned under the article Gazna.—From this period, however, the empire began to decline. The ambition of the khans having prompted them to invade the kingdoms of Japan and Cochin China, they were miserably disappointed in their attempts, and lost a great number of men. The same bad success attended them in Indostan; and in a short time this mighty empire broke into several smaller ones. The governors of Persia being of the family of Jenghiz Khan, owned no allegiance to any superior; those of Tartary did the same. The Chinese threw off the yoke; and thus the continent of Asia wore much the same face that it had done before Jenghiz Khan began his conquests.\nThe successors of Hulaku reigned in Persia till the year 1355; but that year Abu Said Khan, the eighth from Hulaku, dying, the affairs of that country fell into confusion for want of a prince of the race of Jenghiz Khan to succeed to the throne. The empire, therefore, was divided among a great number of petty princes who fought against each other almost without intermission, till in the year 1369 Timur Bek, or Tamerlane, one of these princes, having conquered a number of others, was crowned at Balkh, with the pompous title of Saheb Karan; that is, \"the emperor of the age, and the conqueror of the world.\" As he had just before taken that city, and destroyed one of his most formidable rivals who had shut himself up in it, the new emperor began his reign with beheading some of the inhabitants, imprisoning others, burning their houses, and selling the women and children for slaves.\n\nIn 1370 he crossed the Sihun, made war on the Getes, and attacked Karazm. Next year he granted a peace to his enemies; but two years after, he again invaded the country of the Getes, and by the year 1379 had fully conquered that country as well as Korazm; and from that time he continued to extend his conquests in much the same manner as Jenghiz Khan had done, though with less cruelty.—In 1387 he had reduced Armenia, Georgia, and all Persia; the conquest of which last was completed by the reduction of Ispahan, 720,000 of the inhabitants of which were slaughtered on account of a sedition raised by some rash or evil disposed persons.\n\nAfter the reduction of Persia, Timur turned his arms northward and westward, subduing all the countries to the Euphrates. He took the city of Bagdad; subdued Syria; and having ravaged great part of Ruffa, returned to Persia in 1396, where he splendidly feasted his whole army. In 1398 he invaded Indofstan, crossed the Indus on the 17th of September, reduced several fortresses, and made a vast number of captives. However, as he was afraid that, in case of any emergency, these prisoners might take part with the enemy, he gave orders to his soldiers to put all their Indian slaves to death; and in consequence of this inhuman order, more than 100,000 of these poor wretches were slaughtered in less than an hour.\n\nIn the beginning of the year 1399 Timur was met by the Indian army; whom after a desperate battle, he defeated with great slaughter, and soon after took the city of Delhi the capital of the country. Here he seated himself on the throne of the Indian emperors, and here the sharifs, kadis, and principal inhabitants of the city, came to make their submission, and begged for mercy. The tame elephants and rhinoceroses likewise were brought to kneel before him as they had been accustomed to do to the Indian emperors, and made a great cry as if they implored his clemency. These war elephants, 120 in number, were, at his return, sent to Samarcand, and to the province where his sons resided. After this, at the request of the lords of the court, Timur made a great feast; at which he distributed presents to the princes and principal officers.\n\nDelhi at this time consisted of three cities, called Seyri, Old Delhi, and Jehan Penah. Seyri was surrounded with a wall in form of a circle, Old Delhi was the same, but much larger, lying south-west of the other. These two parts were joined on each side by a wall; and the third, lying between them, was called Jehan Penah, which was larger than Old Delhi. Penah had ten gates; Seyri had seven, three of which looked towards Jehan Penah; this last had 13 gates, six to the north-west, and seven to the south-east. Everything seemed to be in a quiet posture; when, on the 12th of January 1399, the soldiery of Timur being assembled at one of the gates of Delhi, insulted the inhabitants of the suburbs. The great emirs were ordered to put a stop to these disorders; but their endeavours were not effectual. The sultan having a curiosity to see the rarities of Delhi, and particularly a famous palace adorned with 1000 pillars, built by an ancient king of India, went in with all the court; and the gate being on that occasion left open for everybody, above 15,000 soldiers got in unperceived. But there was a far greater number of troops in a large place between Delhi, Seyri, and Jehan Penah, who committed great disorders in the two last cities. This made the inhabitants in despair fall on them; and many, setting fire to their houses, burnt their wives and children. The soldiers seeing this confusion, did nothing but pillage the houses; while the disorder was increased by the admission of more troops, who seized the inhabitants of the neighbouring places who had fled thither for shelter. The emirs, to put a stop to this mischief, caused the gates to be shut; but they were quickly opened by the soldiery within, who rose in arms against their officers; so that by the morning of the 13th the whole army was entered, and this great city was totally destroyed. Some soldiery carried out 150 slaves, men, women, and children; nay, some of their boys had 20 slaves a piece to their share. The other spoils, in jewels, plate, and manufactures, were immense; for the Indian women and girls were adorned with precious stones, and had bracelets and rings on their hands, feet, and even toes, so that the soldiery were loaded with them. On the 13th, in Old Delhi, the Indians retired into the great mosque to defend themselves; but being attacked by the Tartars, they were all slaughtered, and towers erected with their heads. A dreadful carnage now ensued throughout the whole city, and several days were employed before the inhabitants could be made to quit it entirely; and as they went, the emirs took a number of them for their service. The artisans were also distributed among the princes and commanders; all but the masons, who were reserved for the emperor, in order to build him a spacious stone mosque at Samarcand.\n\nAfter this terrible devastation, Timur marched into the different provinces of Indofstan, everywhere defeating the Indians who opposed him, and slaughtering the Ghebrs or worshippers of fire. On the 25th of March he set out on his return, and on the 9th of May arrived at Samarcand. In a few months after his arrival, he was obliged to undertake an expedition into Persia, where affairs were in the utmost disorder on account of the misconduct of his son, whom he had appointed sovereign of that empire. Here Timur soon settled matters; after which he again set out on an expedition westward, reduced many places in Georgia which had not submitted before, and invaded and conquered Syria. At the same time he quarrelled with Bajazet the Turkish sultan, then busied in an enterprise against with Baja Constantinople, in which he would probably have succeeded had not Timur interfered. The cause of this Turkish sultan.\nquarrel at first was, that Bajazet had demanded tribute from a prince who was under Timur's protection, and is said to have returned an insulting answer to the Tartar ambassadors who were sent to him on that account. Timur, however, who was an enthusiast in the cause of Mahometanism, and considered Bajazet as engaged in the cause of heaven when besieging a Christian city, was very unwilling to disturb him in his pious work; and therefore undertook several expeditions against the princes of Syria and Georgia, in order to give the Turkish monarch time to cool and return to reason.\n\nAmong other places, he again invested the city of Bagdad, which had cast off its allegiance to him; and having taken it by storm, made such a dreadful massacre of the inhabitants, that 120 towers were erected with the heads of the slain. In the mean time Bajazet continued to give fresh provocation, by protecting one Kara Yusef a robber, who had even insulted the caravan of Mecca; so that Timur at length resolved to make war upon him. The sultan, however, foreseeing the danger of bringing such a formidable enemy against himself, thought proper to ask pardon, by a letter, for what was past, and promise obedience to Timur's will for the future. This embassy was graciously received; and Timur returned for answer, that he would forbear hostilities, provided Bajazet would either put Kara Yusef to death, send him to the Tartar camp, or expel him out of his dominions. Along with the Turkish ambassadors he sent one of his own; telling Bajazet that he would march into the confines of Anatolia, and there wait his final answer.\n\nThough Bajazet had seemed at first willing to come to an agreement with Timur, and to dread his superior power; yet he now behaved in such an unsatisfactory manner, that the Tartar monarch desired him to prepare for war; upon which he raised the siege of Constantinople, and having met Timur with an army greatly inferior to the Tartars, was utterly defeated and taken prisoner. According to some accounts, he was treated with great humanity and honour; while others inform us, that he was shut up in an iron cage, against which he dashed out his brains the following year. At any rate, it is certain that he was not restored to liberty, but died in confinement.\n\nThis victory was followed by the submission of many places of the Lesser Asia to Timur; the Greek emperor owning himself his tributary, as did also the sultan of Egypt. After this Timur once more returned to Georgia, which he cruelly ravaged; after which he marched to Samarcan, where he arrived in the year 1405. Here, being now an old man, this mighty conqueror began to look forward to that state which at one time or other is the dread of all living creatures; and Timur, in order to quiet the remorse of his own conscience, came to the following curious resolution, which he communicated to his intimate friends; namely, that \"as the vast conquests he had made were not obtained without some violence, which had occasioned the destruction of a great number of God's creatures, he was resolved, by way of atonement for his past crimes, to perform some good action; namely, to make war on the infidels, and exterminate the idolaters of China.\" This atonement, however, he did not live to accomplish; for he died the same year of a burning fever, in the 71st year of his age and 36th of his reign.\n\nOn the death of Timur, his empire fell immediately into great disorder, and the civil wars continued for five or six years; but at last peace was restored, by the settlement of Shah Rukh, Timur's son, on the throne. He did not, however, enjoy the empire in its full extent, or indeed much above one half of it; having only Karazm, Khorassan, Kandahar, Persia, and part of Hindoostan. Neither was he able, though a brave and warlike prince, to extend his dominions, though he transmitted them to his son Ulug Beg. He proved a wise and learned monarch; and is famous for the astronomical tables which he caused to be composed, and which are well known at this day. He was killed in 1448 by his son Abdallatif, who six months after was put to death by his own soldiers. After the death of Abdallatif, Abdallah, a grandson of Shah Rukh, seized the throne; but, after reigning one year, was expelled by Abulaid Mirza, the grandson of Miran Shah the son of Timur. His reign was one continued scene of wars and tumults; till at last he was defeated and taken prisoner by one Haflan Beg, who put him to death in 1468. From this time we may look upon the empire of Timur as entirely dissolved, though his descendants still reigned in Persia and Hindoostan, the latter of which is still known by the name of the Mogul's empire.\n\nOn the death of the above mentioned monarch, his History of son Babr or Babor succeeded him, but was soon driven out by the Uzbek Tartars; after which he resided some time in Gazna, whence he made incursions into Hindoostan, and at length became master of the whole empire, excepting the kingdoms of Dekan, Guzerat, and Bengal.—For the transactions subsequent to this period, see Hindoostan and India.\n\nMOHAIR, in commerce, the hair of a kind of goat frequent about Angora in Turkey; the inhabitants of which city are all employed in the manufacture of camlets made of this hair.\n\nSome give the name mohair to the camlets or stuffs made of this hair: of these there are two kinds; the one smooth and plain, the other watered like tabbies: the difference between the two only consists in this, that the latter is callendered, the other not. There are also mohairs both plain and watered, whose woof is of wool, cotton, or thread.\n\nMOHAIR Shell, in Conchology, a name given to a species of voluta, which seems of a closely and finely reticulated texture, and resembles on the surface a piece of mohair or a very close filkworm's web.\n\nMOHAWKS.

For the quantity and quality of the food, and the proportion of the meat to the drink, being given, the weight of a human body is less, and consequently its discharges greater in dry weather than in wet weather; which may be thus accounted for: the moisture of the air moistens the fibres of the skin and lessens perspiration by lessening their vibratory motion. When perspiration is thus lessened by the moisture of the air, urine indeed is by degrees increased, but not equally. Hence, according to Dr Bryan Robinson, we learn, that to keep a body of the same weight in wet weather as in dry, either the quantity of food must be lessened, or the proportion of the meat to the drink increased: and both these may be done by lessening the drink without making any change in the meat.\n\nThe instrument used for determining the degree of moisture in the air, is called an hygrometer. See Hygrometer.\n\nMOIVRE, ABRAHAM, a learned mathematician, was born at Vitri in Champagne, in France, 1667, where his father was a surgeon. At the revocation of the edict of Nantes, he came to England. Before he left France, he had begun the study of mathematics; and having perfected himself in that science in London, he was obliged, by necessity, to teach it. Newton's Principia, which accidentally fell into his hands, showed him how little progress he had made in a science of which he thought himself master. From this work he acquired a knowledge of the geometry of infinites with as great facility as he had learned the elementary geometry; and in a short time he was fit to be ranked with the most celebrated mathematicians. His success in these studies procured him a seat in the Royal Society of London and in the Academy of Sciences at Paris. His merit was so well understood in the former, that he was thought capable of deciding in the famous dispute between Leibnitz and Newton concerning the differential calculus.—He published a Treatise on Chances in 1738, and another on Annuities in 1752; both extremely accurate. The Philosophical Transactions contain many interesting memoirs of his composition.—Some of them treat of the method of fluxions; others are on the lunula of Hippocrates; others on physical astronomy, in which he resolved many important problems; and others, in short, on the analysis of the games of chance, in which he followed a different course from that of Montmort. Towards the close of his life he lost his sight and hearing; and the demand for sleep became so great that he required 20 hours of it in a day. He died at London, 1754, aged 87. His knowledge was not confined to mathematics; but he retained to the last a taste for polite literature. He was intimately acquainted with the best authors of antiquity; and he was frequently consulted about difficult passages in their works. Rabelais and Molière were his favourite French authors: he had them by heart; and he one day observed to one of his acquaintance, \"that he would rather have been Molière than Newton.\" He recited whole scenes of the Misanthrope with that delicacy and force with which he remembered to have heard them recited at Paris 70 years before, by Molière's own company. The character indeed was somewhat similar to his own. He judged severely of mankind; and could never conceal his disgust at the conversation of a fool, or his aversion to cunning and dissimulation. He was free from the affectation of science, and no one could know him to be a mathematician but from the accuracy of his thoughts. His conversation was general and instructive. Whatever he said was well digested and clearly expressed. His style possessed more strength and solicitude than ornament and animation; but he was always correct, and he bestowed as much pains on his sentences as on his calculations. He could never endure any bold affections or indecent witticisms against religion.\n\nMOLA, an ancient town of Italy, in the kingdom of Naples, and in the Terra di Lavoro, where they pretend to show the ruins of Cicero's house.

The Greeks called it σάρκα or σάρκεσις.\n\nMOLARES, or Dentes molares, in Anatomy, the large teeth, called in English the grinders. See Anatomy Index.\n\nMOLASSES, or Molosses. See Molosses.\n\nMOLDAVIA, a province of Turkey in Europe, bounded on the north-east by the river Nisiter, which divides it from Poland; on the east, by Bessarabia; on the south by the Danube, which parts it from Bulgaria; and on the west, by Walachia and Transylvania. It is 240 miles in length and 150 in breadth. It lies in a good air and fruitful soil, producing corn, wine, rich pastures, a good breed of horses, oxen, sheep, plenty of game, fish, fowl, honey, wax, and all European fruits. Its principal rivers are the Danube, Nieffer, Pruth, Bardaluch, and Ceret. The inhabitants are Christians of the Greek church, and Jassy is the principal town. It has been tributary to the Turks since the year 1574; who appoint a prince who is a native of the country, but have no regard to his being of the principal families. The province pays a large yearly tribute to the Turkish government; besides raising a great body of horse at its own expense.\n\nMOLE, a river in Surry, which has taken its name from running under ground. It first disappears at Boxhill, near Dorking, in the county of Surry, and emerges again near Leatherhead.\n\nMOLE. See Talpa, Mammalia Index; and for methods of destroying, see Vermin, Destruction of.\n\nMOLE, in Midwifery, a mass of flethy matter, of a spherical\nMole, or Mark. See Nevus.\n\nMole, in Architecture, a massive work formed of large stones laid in the sea by means of coffer dams, extended either in a right line or an arch of a circle, before a port, which it serves to close; to defend the vessels in it from the impetuosity of the waves, and to prevent the passage of ships without leave. Thus we say the mole of the harbour of Messina, &c.\n\nMole is sometimes employed to signify the harbour itself.\n\nMole, (mole), among the Romans, was also used for a kind of mausoleum, built in manner of a round tower on a square base, infilled, encompassed with columns, and covered with a dome.—The mole of the emperor Adrian, now the castle of St Angelo, was the greatest and most stately of all the moles. It was crowned with a brazen pine apple, wherein was a golden urn containing the ashes of the emperor.\n\nMole Cricket. See Gryllotalpa, Entomology Index.\n\nMole Hills. These little hillocks of earth are a very great prejudice to the pasture lands, not only in wasting so much of the land as they cover, but in obstructing the scythe in mowing. In the west of England they use a peculiar instrument for the breaking up of these; it is a flat board, very thick; and of about eight inches in diameter, into which there is fastened a perpendicular handle of three or four feet long. It has four broad and sharp iron teeth at the front, which readily cut through the hill, and spread the earth it confines of; and behind there is a large knob proper for breaking the clods with, if there are any. Some use a spade, or other common instrument, in the place of this, but not so well. There is, however, a much better instrument even than this, for destroying these hills, where they are in very great numbers. This is a kind of horse machine; it has a sharp iron about three feet over, and with a strong back.—It is about four or five inches broad, and has two long handles for a horse to be harnessed to, and a cross bar of iron to strengthen it at the bottom of the handles, reaching from the one handle to the other. The middle of this cross bar is furnished with one, two, or more sharp pieces of iron like small ploughshares, to cut the mole hills into two, three, or more parts. The iron behind is of a semicircular figure. A single horse is harnessed to this machine, and a boy must be employed to drive it, and a man to hold and guide it; the sharp irons or shares are the first things that meet the hill, they run through it, break its texture, and cut it into several parts; and the circular iron following immediately behind them, cuts up the whole by the roots, and leaves the land level. This instrument will destroy as many mole hills in one day as a common labourer can do in eight, and would be of very great advantage to the kingdom if brought into general use.\n\nMolière, John Baptist, a celebrated French comedian and dramatic writer, whose true name was Pocquelin, which for some reason he changed to that of Molière. He was the son of a valet de chambre, and was born at Paris about the year 1620. He went through the study of the classics under the Jesuits in the college of Clermont, and was destined for the bar; but at his quitting the law schools, he made choice of the actor's profession. From a strong attachment to the drama, his whole study and application were directed to the stage, and he continued till his death to exhibit plays, which were greatly applauded. It is said the first motive of his going upon the stage was to enjoy the company of an actress for whom he had contracted a violent fondness. His comedies are highly esteemed. And it is no wonder he so justly represented domestic feuds, and the torments of jealous husbands, or of those who have reason to be so; for it is asserted that no man ever experienced this more than Molière. His last comedy was Le Malade Imaginaire, which was brought on the stage in 1673; and Molière died on the fourth night of its representation; some say in acting the very part of the pretended dead man, which gave some exercise for the wits of the time; but according to others he died in his bed that night, from the bursting of a vein in his lungs by coughing. The king, as a last mark of his favour, prevailed with the archbishop of Paris to suffer him to be buried in consecrated ground; though he had irritated the clergy by his Tartuffe. The most esteemed editions of his works are that of Amsterdam, 5 vols. 12mo, 1699; and that of Paris, 6 vols. 4to, 1734.\n\nMolinists, in ecclesiastical history, a sect in the Roman church, who follow the doctrine and sentiments of the Jesuit Molina, relating to sufficient and efficacious grace. He taught that the operations of divine grace were entirely consistent with the freedom of human will; and he introduced a new kind of hypothesis to remove the difficulties attending the doctrines of predetermination and liberty, and to reconcile the jarring opinions of Augustines, Thomists, Semi-Pelagians, and other contentious divines. He affirmed, that the decree of predestination to eternal glory was founded upon a previous knowledge and consideration of the merits of the elect; that the grace, from whose operation, these merits are derived, is not efficacious by its own intrinsic power only, but also by the consent of our own will, and because it is administered in those circumstances, in which the Deity, by that branch of his knowledge which is called scientia media, foresees that it will be efficacious. The kind of prescience, denominated in the schools scientia media, is that foreknowledge of future contingents that arises from an acquaintance with the nature and faculties of rational beings, of the circumstances in which they shall be placed, of the objects that shall be presented to them, and of the influence which their circumstances and objects must have on their actions.\n\nMolinists, a sect among the Romanists, who adhere to the doctrine of Molinos. These are the same with what are otherwise called Quietists, whose chief principle was, that men ought to annihilate themselves in order to be united to God, and afterwards remain in quietness of mind, without being troubled for what shall happen to the body. Molinos, the author of these opinions, was a Spanish priest, and was born in 1627. His 68 propositions were examined in 1687 by the pope and inquisitors, who decreed that his doctrine was false and pernicious, and that his books should be burned. He was forced to recant his errors publicly in the Dominican church, and was condemned to perpetual imprisonment. He was then 60 years old, and had been spreading his doctrine 22 years before. He died in prison in 1692.\n\nMollugo, African Chickweed; a genus of plants\nMOL\n\nplants belonging to the triandra class, and in the natural method ranked under the 2nd order, Caryophyllae.\n\nSee Botany Index.\n\nMOLLUSCA, in the Linnaean system, one of the orders of vermes or worms. These are simple naked animals, not included in a shell, but furnished with limbs. See Helminthology Index.\n\nMOLOCH, a false god of the Ammonites, who dedicated their children to him, by making them \"pass through the fire,\" as the Scriptures express it. There are various opinions concerning this method of consecration. Some think, the children leaped over a fire sacred to Moloch; others, that they passed between two fires; and others, that they were really burnt in the fire, by way of sacrifice to this god. There is foundation for each of these opinions. For, first, it was usual among the pagans to lustrate or purify with fire; and, in the next place, it is expressly said, that the inhabitants of Sepharvaim burnt their children in the fire to Anamellech and Adramelech; much such deities as Moloch of the Ammonites.\n\nMoses, in several places, forbids the Israelites to dedicate their children to this god as the Ammonites did, and threatens death and utter extirpation to such persons as were guilty of this abominable idolatry. And there is great probability that the Hebrews were much addicted to the worship of this deity: since Amos, and after him St Stephen, reproaches them with having carried along with them into the wilderness the tabernacle of their god Moloch.\n\nSolomon built a temple to Moloch upon the mount of Olives; and Manasseh, a long time after, imitated his impiety, by making his son pass through the fire in honour of Moloch. It was chiefly in the valley of Tophet and Hinnom, to the east of Jerusalem, that the Israelites paid their idolatrous worship to this false god of the Ammonites.\n\nThere are various sentiments concerning the relation which Moloch had to the other pagan divinities. Some believe he was the same with Saturn, to whom it is well known that human sacrifices were offered. Others suppose him to be Mercury; others, Mars; others, Mitras; and others, Venus. Lastly, Others take Moloch to be the sun, or the king of heaven. Moloch was likewise called Milcom; as appears from what is said of Solomon, that he went after Ashtaroth the abomination of the Zidonians, and Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.\n\nMOLOSSUS, Molasses, or Melasses, that gross fluid matter remaining of sugar after refining, and which no boiling will bring to a consistence more solid than that of syrup; hence also called syrup of sugar.\n\nProperly, molasses are only the sediment of one kind of sugar called chypre, or brown sugar, which is the refuse of other sugars not to be whitened or reduced into loaves.\n\nMolasses are much used in Holland for the preparation of tobaccoe, and also among poor people instead of sugar. There is a kind of brandy or spirit made of molasses; but by some held exceedingly unwholesome. See below.\n\nArtificial Molasses. There has been found a method of making molasses from apples without the addition of sugar. The apple that succeeds best in this operation is a summer sweeting of a middle size, pleasant to the taste, and so full of juice that seven bushels will yield a barrel of cider.\n\nThe manner of making it is this: the apples are to be ground and pressed, then the juice is to be boiled in a large copper, till three quarters of it be evaporated: this will be done with a moderate fire in about six hours, with the quantity of juice above mentioned; by this time it will be of the consistence and taste as well as of the colour of molasses.\n\nThis new molasses serves all the purposes of the common kind; and is of great use in preserving cider. Two quarts of it, put into a barrel of racked cider, will preserve it, and give it an agreeable colour.\n\nThe invention of this kind of molasses was owing to Mr Chandler of Woodstock in New England, who living at a distance from the sea, and where the common molasses was very dear and scarce, provided this for the supply of his own family, and introduced the practice among people of the neighbourhood. It is to be observed, that this sort of apple, the sweeting, is of great use in making cider; one of the very best kinds we know being made of it. The people in New England also feed their hogs with the fallings of their orchards of these apples; and the consequence of this is, that their pork is the finest in the world.\n\nMOLOSSUS Spirit; a very clean and pure spirit, much used in England, and made from molasses or common treacle dissolved in water, and fermented in the same manner as malt or the common malt spirit. See Distillation.\n\nMOLOSSI, a people of Epirus, who inhabited that part of the country which was called Molossia, or Molossus, from King Molossus, a son of Pyrrhus and Andromache. This country had the bay of Ambracia on the south, and the country of the Perrhaebians on the east. The dogs of the place were famous, and received the name of Molossi among the Romans. Dodona was the capital of the country, according to some writers. Others, however, reckon it as the chief city of Thesprotia.\n\nMOLOSSUS, in the Greek and Latin poetry, a foot consisting of three long syllables. As audiri, cantabunt, virtutem.\n\nIt takes its name either from a dance in use among the people called Molossi or Epirotai; or from the temple of Jupiter Molossus, where odes were sung, in which this foot had a great share; or else because the march of the Molossi, when they went to the combat, was composed of these feet, or had the cadence thereof. The same foot was also called among the ancients, Vertumnus, extensipes, hippius, et caninus.\n\nMOLUCILLA, a genus of plants belonging to the didynamia clas, and in the natural method ranking under the 4th order, Verticillate.

See Botany Index.\n\nMONAGHAN, a county of Ireland, situated in the province of Ulster, is bounded by Tyrone on the north, Armagh on the east, Cavan and Louth on the south, and Fermanagh on the west. It is a mountainous tract, but in some places is well improved. It contains 170,090 Irish plantation acres, and is about 30 miles long and 22 broad. The linen trade of this county is averaged at 104,000l. yearly.\n\nMonaghan, the capital town of the county of that name, is distant 62 miles from Dublin, and gives title of baron to the family of Blayney. It was anciently called Muinechon. An abbey was founded here in a very early age, of which Moelodius the son of Aodh was abbot. In 1462, a monastery for conventional Franciscans was erected on the site of this abbey, which was granted on the general suppression of monasteries to Edward Withe, and a castle has been since erected on the site by Edward Lord Blayney.\n\nMONANDRIA, (from μονάς alone, and ἀνήρ a man or husband,) the name of the first class in Linnaeus's sexual system; consisting of plants with hermaphrodite flowers, which have only one stamen.\n\nMONARCHY, a large state governed by one; or a state where the supreme power is lodged in the hands of a single person. The word comes from the Greek ὁμογένεια, \"one who governs alone;\" formed of ὁμός, alike, and ἀρχή imperium, \"government.\" Of the three forms of government, viz., democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy, the last is the most powerful, all the fineness of government being knit together, and united in the hand of the prince; but then there is imminent danger of his employing that strength to improvident or oppressive purposes. As a democracy is the best calculated to direct the end of a law, and an aristocracy to invent the means by which that end shall be obtained, a monarchy is most fit for carrying those means into execution.\nThe most ancient monarchy was that of the Assyrians, which was founded soon after the deluge. We usually reckon four grand or universal monarchies; the Assyrian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman; though St Augustine makes them but two; viz. those of Babylon and Rome. Belus is placed at the head of the series of Assyrian kings who reigned at Babylon, and is by profane authors esteemed the founder of it, and by some the same whom the Scriptures call Nimrod. The principal Assyrian kings after Belus were Ninus, who built Nineveh, and removed the seat of empire to it; Semiramis, who, disguising her sex, took possession of the kingdom instead of her son, and was killed and succeeded by her son Ninias; and Sardanapalus, the last of the Assyrian monarchs, and more effeminate than a woman. After his death the Assyrian empire was split into three separate kingdoms, viz. the Median, Assyrian, and Babylonian. The first king of the Median kingdom was Arbaces; and this kingdom lasted till the time of Astyages, who was subdued and divested of his kingdom by Cyrus.\n\nIn the time of Cyrus there arose a new and second monarchy called the Persian, which stood upwards of 200 years from Cyrus, whose reign began A.M. 3468, to Darius Codomannus, who was conquered by Alexander, and the empire translated to the Greeks A.M. 3674.—The first monarch was Cyrus, founder of the empire. 2. Cambyses, the son of Cyrus. 3. Smerdis. 4. Darius, the son of Hylaiaspis, who reigned 521 years before Christ. 5. Xerxes, who reigned 485 years before Christ. 6. Artaxerxes Longimanus, who reigned 464 years before Christ. 7. Xerxes the second. 8. Ochus, or Darius, called Nothus, 424 years before Christ. 9. Artaxerxes Mnemon, 405 years before Christ. 10. Artaxerxes Ochus, 359 years before Christ. 11. Arsaces, 338 years before Christ. 12. Darius Codomannus, 336 years before Christ, who was defeated by Alexander the Great, and deprived of his kingdom and life about 331 years before Christ: the dominion of Persia after his death was translated to the Greeks.\n\nThe third monarchy was the Grecian. As Alexander, when he died, did not declare who should succeed him, there started up as many kings as there were commanders. At first they governed the provinces that were divided among them under the title of viceroys; but when the family of Alexander the Great was extinct, they took upon them the name of kings. Hence, in process of time, the whole empire of Alexander produced four distinct kingdoms, viz. 1. The Macedonian; the kings of which, after Alexander, were Antipater, Cassander, Demetrius Poliorcetes, Seleucus Nicanor, Meleager, Antigonus Doson, Philip, and Perseus, under whom the Macedonian kingdom was reduced to the form of a Roman province. 2. The Asiatic kingdom, which upon the death of Alexander fell to Antigonus, comprehending that country now called Anatolia, together with some other regions beyond Mount Taurus. From this kingdom proceeded two lesser ones, viz. that of Pergamus, whose last king, Attalus, appointed the Roman people to be his heir; and Pontus, reduced by the Romans into the form of a province, when they had subdued the last king, Mithridates. 3. The Syrian, of whose twenty-two kings the most celebrated were, Seleucus Nicanor, founder of the kingdom; Antiochus Deus; Antiochus the Great; Monarch Antiochus Epiphanes; and Tigranes, who was conquered by the Romans under Pompey, and Syria reduced into the form of a Roman province. 4. The Egyptian, which was formed by the Greeks in Egypt, and flourished near 240 years under 12 kings, the principal of whom were, Ptolemy Lagus, its founder; Ptolemy Philadelphus, founder of the Alexandrian library; and Queen Cleopatra, who was overcome by Augustus, in consequence of which Egypt was added to the domain of the Romans.\n\nThe fourth monarchy was the Roman, which lasted 244 years, from the building of the city until the time when the royal power was abrogated. The kings of Rome were Romulus, its founder; Numa Pompilius; Tullus Hostilis; Ancus Martius; Tarquinius Priscus; Servius Tullius; and Tarquin the Proud, who was banished, and with whom terminated the regal power.\n\nThere seems in reality no necessity to make the Medes, Persians, and Greeks, succeed to the whole power of the Assyrians, to multiply the number of the monarchies. It was the same empire still; and the several changes that happened in it did not constitute different monarchies. Thus the Roman empire was successively governed by princes of different nations, yet without any new monarchy being formed thereby. Rome, therefore, may be said to have immediately succeeded Babylon in the empire of the world. See Empire.\n\nOf monarchies some are absolute and despotic, where the will of the monarch is uncontroulable; others are limited, where the prince's authority is restrained by laws, and part of the supreme power lodged in other hands, as in Britain. See Government.\n\nSome monarchies again are hereditary, where the succession devolves immediately from father to son; and others are elective, where, on the death of the monarch, his successor is appointed by election, as in Poland.\n\nFifth-Monarchy Men, in the ecclesiastical history of England, were a set of wrong-headed and turbulent enthusiasts who arose in the time of Cromwell, and who expected Christ's sudden appearance upon earth to establish a new kingdom; and, acting in consequence of this illusion, aimed at the subversion of all human government.\n\nMONARDA, INDIAN HOEHOUND, a genus of plants belonging to the diandria clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 42th order Verticillatae. See Botany Index.\n\nMONASTEREVAN, a post town of Ireland, in the county of Kildare and province of Leinster, 36 miles from Dublin, so called from a magnificent abbey which was founded here, in which St Evan in the beginning of the 7th century placed a number of monks from South Munster, and which had the privilege of being a sanctuary. The consecrated bell, which belonged to this saint, was on solemn trials sworn upon by the whole tribe of the Eoganachts, and was always committed to the care of the Mac Evans, hereditary chief justices of Munster; the abbot of this house sat as a baron in parliament.—At the general suppression of monasteries, this abbey was granted to Lord Audley, who assigned it to Vicount Ely. It afterwards came into\nMonastery into the family of Moor, earls of Drogheda, and has been beautifully repaired by the present Lord Drogheda, still wearing the venerable appearance of an abbey. There is a nursery at Monasterervan for the charter schools of the province of Leinster; and the grand canal has been carried up to this town from Dublin, since which it has been much improved and enlarged with several new buildings.\n\nMonastery, a convent or house built for the reception of religious; whether it be abbey, priory, nunnery, or the like.\n\nMonastery is only properly applied to the houses of monks, mendicant friars, and nuns. The rest are more properly called religious houses. For the origin of monasteries, see Monastic and Monk.\n\nThe houses belonging to the several religious orders which obtained in England and Wales were, cathedrals, colleges, abbeys, priories, preceptories, commandries, hospitals, friaries, hermitages, chantries, and free chapels. These were under the direction and management of various officers. The dissolution of houses of this kind began so early as the 1312, when the Templars were suppressed; and in 1323 their lands, churches, advowsons, and liberties, here in England, were given by 17 Ed. II. st. 3. to the prior and brethren of the hospital of St John at Jerusalem. In the years 1390, 1437, 1441, 1459, 1497, 1505, 1508, and 1515, several other houses were dissolved, and their revenues settled on different colleges in Oxford and Cambridge. Soon after the last period, Cardinal Wolsey, by license of the king and pope, obtained a dissolution of above 30 religious houses for the founding and endowing his colleges at Oxford and Ipswich. About the same time a bull was granted by the same pope to Cardinal Wolsey to suppress monasteries, where there were not above six monks, to the value of 8000 ducats a-year, for endowing Windsor and King's College in Cambridge; and two other bulls were granted to Cardinals Wolsey and Campeius, where there were less than twelve monks, and to annex them to the greater monasteries; and another bull to the same cardinals to inquire about abbeys to be suppressed in order to be made cathedrals. Although nothing appears to have been done in consequence of these bulls, the motive which induced Wolsey and many others to suppress these houses was the desire of promoting learning; and Archbishop Cranmer engaged in it with a view of carrying on the reformation. There were other causes that concurred to bring on their ruin: many of the religious were loose and vicious; the monks were generally thought to be in their hearts attached to the pope's supremacy; their revenues were not employed according to the intent of the donors; many cheats in images, spurious miracles, and counterfeit relics, had been discovered, which brought the monks into disrepute; the Observant friars had opposed the king's divorce from Queen Catherine; and these circumstances operated, in concurrence with the king's want of a supply and the people's desire to save their money, to forward a motion in parliament, that in order to support the king's state and supply his wants, all the religious houses might be conferred upon the crown which were not able to spend above 200l. a-year; and an act was passed for that purpose 27 Hen. VIII. c. 28. By this act about 380 houses were Monastery dissolved, and a revenue of 30,000l. or 32,000l. a-year came to the crown; besides about 100,000l. in plate and jewels. The suppression of these houses occasioned discontent, and at length an open rebellion: when this was appealed, the king resolved to suppress the rest of the monasteries, and appointed a new visitation: which caused the greater abbeys to be surrendered apace; and it was enacted by 31 Hen. VIII. c. 13, that all monasteries, &c. which have been surrendered since the 4th of February, in the 27th year of his majesty's reign, and which hereafter shall be surrendered, shall be vested in the king. The knights of St John of Jerusalem were also suppressed by the 32 Hen. VIII. c. 24. The suppression of these greater houses by these two acts produced a revenue to the king of above 100,000l. a-year, besides a large sum in plate and jewels. The last act of dissolution in this king's reign was the act of 37 Hen. VIII. c. 4. for dissolving colleges, free chapels, chantries, &c. which act was farther enforced by 1 Edw. VI. c. 14. By this act were suppressed 90 colleges, 110 hospitals, and 2374 chantries and free chapels. The number of houses and places suppressed from first to last, so far as any calculations appear to have been made, seems to be as follow:\n\n| Of lesser monasteries, of which we have the valuation | 374 |\n| Of greater monasteries | 186 |\n| Belonging to the hospitalers | 48 |\n| Colleges | 90 |\n| Hospitals | 110 |\n| Chantries and free chapels | 2374 |\n\nTotal 3182\n\nBesides the friars houses and those suppressed by Wolsey, and many small houses of which we have no particular account.\n\nThe sum total of the clear yearly revenue of the several houses at the time of their dissolution, of which we have any account, seems to be as follow:\n\n| Of the greater monasteries | L. 104,919 13 3½ |\n| Of all those of the lesser monasteries of which we have the valuation | 29,702 1 10½ |\n| Knights hospitalers head house in London | 2385 12 8 |\n| We have the valuation of only 28 of their houses in the country | 3026 9 5 |\n| Friars houses of which we have the valuation | 751 2 0½ |\n\nTotal L. 140,786 19 3½\n\nIf proper allowances are made for the lesser monasteries and houses not included in this estimate, and for the plate, &c. which came into the hands of the king by the dissolution, and for the value of money at that time, which was at least five times as much as at present, and also consider that the estimate of the lands was generally supposed to be much under the real worth, we must conclude their whole revenues to have been immense.\n\nIt does not appear that any computation hath been made of the number of persons contained in the religious houses.\n\nThos.\nMonastery. Those of the lesser monasteries dissolved by 27 Hen. VIII. were reckoned at about 10,000.\n\nIf we suppose the colleges and hospitals to have contained a proportionable number, these will make about 5347.\n\nIf we reckon the number in the greater monasteries, according to the proportion of their revenues, they will be about 35,000; but as probably they had larger allowances in proportion to their number than those of the lesser monasteries, if we abate upon that account 5000, they will then be 30,000.\n\nOne for each chantry and free chapel, 2374.\n\nTotal 47,721.\n\nBut as there were probably more than one person to officiate in several of the free chapels, and there were other houses which are not included within this calculation, perhaps they may be computed in one general estimate at about 50,000. As there were pensions paid to almost all those of the greater monasteries, the king did not immediately come into the full enjoyment of their whole revenues: however, by means of what he did receive, he founded six new bishoprics, viz. those of Westminster (which was changed by Queen Elizabeth into a deanery, with twelve prebends and a school), Peterborough, Chester, Gloucester, Bristol, and Oxford. And in eight other sees he founded deaneries and chapters, by converting the priors and monks into deans and prebendaries, viz. Canterbury, Winchester, Durham, Worcester, Rochester, Norwich, Ely, and Carlisle. He founded also the colleges of Christ-church in Oxford and Trinity in Cambridge, and finished King's college there. He likewise founded professorships of divinity, law, physic, and of the Hebrew and Greek tongues, in both the said universities. He gave the house of Greyfriars and St Bartholomew's hospital to the city of London, and a perpetual pension to the poor knights of Windsor, and laid out great sums in building and fortifying many ports in the channel. It is observable, upon the whole, that the dissolution of these houses was an act, not of the church, but of the state; in the period preceding the Reformation, by a king and parliament of the Roman catholic communion in all points except the king's supremacy; to which the pope himself, by his bulls and licences, had led the way.\n\nMONASTIC, something belonging to monks, or the monkish life. The monastic profession is a kind of civil death, which in all worldly matters has the same effect with the natural death. The council of Trent, &c. fix fifteen years for the age at which a person may be admitted into the monastical state.\n\nSt Anthony is the person who, in the fourth century, first instituted the monastic life; as St Pachomius, in the same century, is said to have first set on foot the cenobitic life, i.e., regular communities of religious. In a short time the deserts of Egypt became inhabited with a set of solitaries, who took upon them the monastic profession. St Basil carried the monkish humour into the east, where he composed a rule which afterwards obtained through a great part of the west.\n\nIn the 11th century the monastic discipline was grown very remiss. St Odo first began to retrieve it in the monastery of Cluny; that monastery, by the conditions of its erection, was put under the immediate protection of the holy see; with a prohibition to all powers, both secular and ecclesiastical, to disturb the monks in the possession of their effects or the election of their abbot. In virtue hereof they pleaded an exemption from the jurisdiction of the bishop, and extended this privilege to all the houses dependent on Cluny. This made the first congregation of several houses, under one chief immediately subject to the pope, so as to constitute one body, or, as they now call it, one religious order. Till then, each monastery was independent and subject to the bishop. See Monk.\n\nMONDA, or MUNDA, in Ancient Geography, a river of Lusitania, running mid-way from east to west into the Atlantic, between the Durius and Tagus, and wading Comimbrica. Now the Mondego, a river of Portugal, which running by Coimbra, falls into the Atlantic, 30 miles below it.\n\nMONDAY, the second day of the week, so called as being anciently sacred to the moon; q.d. moon-day.\n\nMONDOVI, a considerable town of Italy, in Piedmont; with a citadel, university, and bishop's see. It is the largest and most populous town of Piedmont, and is seated in E. Long. 8. 6. N. Lat. 44. 33.\n\nMONEMUGI, an empire in the south of Africa, has Zanguerab on the east, Monomotapa on the south, Motamba and Makoko on the west, and Abyssinia on the north and partly to the east, though its boundaries that way cannot be ascertained. It is divided into the kingdoms of Mujaco, Makoko or Anfiko, Gingiro, Cambate, Alaba, and Monemugi Proper. This last lies in the middle of the torrid zone, and about the equinoctial line, south of Makoko, west of Zanguerab, north of Monomotapa, and east of Congo and of the northern parts of Monomotapa. To ascertain its extent, is too difficult a task, being a country so little frequented. The country known, abounds with gold, silver, copper mines, and elephants. The natives clothe themselves in silks and cottons, which they buy of strangers, and wear collars of transparent amber beads, brought them from Cambaya; which beads serve also instead of money; gold and silver being too common, and of little value among them.\n\nTheir monarch always endeavours to be at peace with the princes round about him, and to keep an open trade with Quito, Melinda, and Mombaza, on the east, and with Congo on the west; from all which places the black merchants resort thither for gold. The Portuguese merchants report, that on the east side of Monemugi there is a great lake full of small islands, abounding with all sorts of fowl and cattle, and inhabited by negroes. They relate also, that on the main land eastward they heard sometimes the ringing of bells, and that one could observe buildings very much like churches; and that from these parts came men of a brown and tawny complexion, who traded with those islanders, and with the people of Monemugi. This country abounds in palm wine, oil, and honey.\n\nMONETARIUS, or MONEYER, a name which antiquaries and medalists give to those who struck the ancient coins or monies.\n\nMany of the old Roman, &c. coins have the name of\nMoney, of the monetarius, either written at length, or at least the initial letters of it. See MEDAL.\n\nMoney, a piece of matter, commonly metal, to which public authority has affixed a certain value and weight to serve as a medium in commerce. See COIN, COMMERCE, and MEDALS; also the article BANK.\n\nMoney is usually divided into real or effective, and imaginary or money of account,\n\nI. REAL Money.\n\n1. History of real money. Real money includes all coins, or species of gold, silver, copper, and the like, which have course in common, and do really exist. Such are guineas, pittoles, pieces of eight, ducats, &c.\n\nReal money, civilians observe, has three essential qualities, viz., matter, form, and weight or value.\n\nFor the matter, copper is that thought to have been first coined; afterwards silver; and lastly gold, as being the most beautiful, scarce, cleanly, divisible, and pure of all metals.\n\nThe degrees of goodness are expressed in gold by carats; and in silver by pennyweights, &c. For there are several reasons for not coining them pure and without alloy, viz., the great loss and expense in refining them, the necessity of hardening them to make them more durable, and the scarcity of gold and silver in most countries. See ALLOY.\n\nAmong the ancient Britons, iron rings, or, as some say, iron plates, were used for money; among the Macedonians, iron bars quenched with vinegar, that they might not serve for any other use. Seneca observes, that there was anciently stamped money of leather, corium forma publica impressum. And the same thing was put in practice by Frederic II., at the siege of Milan; to say nothing of an old tradition among ourselves, that in the confused times of the barons wars the like was done in England; but the Hollanders, we know, coined great quantities of pasteboard in the year 1574.\n\nAs to the form of money, it has been more various than the matter. Under this are comprehended the weight, figure, impression, and value.\n\nFor the impression, the Jews, though they detected images, yet stamped on the one side of their thekel the golden pot which held the manna, and on the other Aaron's rod. The Dardans stamped two cocks fighting. The Athenians stamped their coins with an owl, or an ox; whence the proverb on bribed lawyers, Bos in lingua. They of Aegina, with a tortoise; whence that other saying, Virtutem et sapientiam vincunt testudines. Among the Romans, the monetarii sometimes impressed the images of men that had been eminent in their families on the coins; but no living man's head was ever stamped on a Roman coin till after the fall of the commonwealth. From that time they bore the emperor's head on one side. From this time the practice of stamping the prince's image on coins has obtained among all civilized nations; the Turks and other Mahometans alone excepted, who, in detestation of images, inscribe only the prince's name, with the year of the transmigration of their prophet.\n\nAs to the figure, it is either round, as in Britain; multangular or irregular, as in Spain; square, as in some parts of the Indies; or nearly globular, as in most of the rest.\n\nAfter the arrival of the Romans in this island, the Britons imitated them, coining both gold and silver with the images of their kings stamped on them. When the Romans had subdued the kings of the Britons, they also suppressed their coins, and brought in their own; which were current here from the time of Claudius to that of Valentinian the younger, about the space of 500 years.\n\nMr. Camden observes, that the most ancient English coin he had known was that of Ethelbert king of Kent, the first Christian king in the island; in whose time all money accounts begin to pass by the names of pounds, shillings, pence, and mancuses. Pence seems borrowed from the Latin pecunia, or rather from pendo, on account of its just weight, which was about threepence of our money. These were coarsely stamped with the king's image on the one side, and either the mint-master's, or the city's where it was coined, on the other. Five of these pence made their shilling, probably so called from scilingus, which the Romans used for the fourth part of an ounce. Forty of these shillings made their pound; and 400 of these pounds were a legacy, or a portion for a king's daughter, as appears by the last will of King Alfred. By these names they translated all sums of money in their old English testament; talents by punder; Judas's thirty pieces of silver by thirty feilings; tribute money, by pennining; the mite by jeorthing.\n\nBut it must be observed, they had no other real money, but pence only; the rest being imaginary moneys, i.e., names of numbers or weights. Thirty of these pence made a mancus, which some take to be the same with a mark; manca, as appears by an old MS. was quinta pars uncie. These mancuses or mancuses were reckoned both in gold and silver. For in the year 680 we read that Ina king of the West Saxons obliged the Kentishmen to buy their peace at the price of 30,000 mancuses of gold. In the notes on King Canute's laws, we find this distinction, that mancusa was as much as a mark of silver, and manca, a square piece of gold, valued at 30 pence.\n\nThe Danes introduced a way of reckoning money by ores, per oras, mentioned in Domesday book; but whether they were a several coin, or a certain sum, does not plainly appear. This, however, may be gathered from the Abbey book of Burton, that 20 ores were equivalent to two marks. They had also a gold coin called byzantine, or bezant, as being coined at Constantinople, then called Byzantium. The value of which coin is not only now lost, but was so entirely forgotten even in the time of King Edward III., that whereas the bishop of Norwich was fined a byzantine of gold to be paid the abbot of St. Edmund's Bury for infringing his liberties (as it had been enacted by parliament in the time of the Conqueror), no man then living could tell how much it was; so it was referred to the king to rate how much he should pay. Which is the more unaccountable, because but 100 years before, 200,000 bezants were exacted by the soldan for the ransom of St. Louis of France; which were then valued at 100,000 livres.\n\nThough the coining of money be a special prerogative of the king, yet the ancient Saxon princes communicated it to their subjects; inasmuch that in every good town there was at least one mint; but at Lon-\nThe Norman kings continued the same custom of coining only pence, with the prince's image on one side, and on the other the name of the city where it was coined, with a cross so deeply impressed, that it might be easily parted and broke into two halves, which, so broken, they called halfpence; or into four parts, which they called fourthings or farthings.\n\nIn the time of King Richard I., money coined in the east parts of Germany came in special request in England on account of its purity, and was called easterling money, as all the inhabitants of those parts were called Easterlings. And shortly after, some of those people failed in coining were sent for hither, to bring the coin to perfection; which since has been called sterling for Easterling. See Sterling.\n\nKing Edward I., who first adjusted the measure of an ell by the length of his arm, herein imitating Charles the Great, was the first also who established a certain standard for the coin, which is expressed to this effect by Greg, Rockley, mayor of London, and mint-master.—\"A pound of money containeth twelve ounces: in a pound there ought to be eleven ounces, two easterlings, and one farthing; the rest alloy. The said pound ought to weigh twenty shillings and three pence in account and weight. The ounce ought to weigh twenty pence, and a penny twenty-four grains and a half. Note, That eleven ounces two pence sterling ought to be of pure silver, called leaf silver; and the minter must add of other weight seventeen pence half-penny farthing, if the silver be so pure.\"\n\nAbout the year 1329, the states of Europe first began to coin gold; and among the rest, our King Edward III. The first pieces he coined were called florences, as being coined by Florentines: afterwards he coined nobles; then rose-nobles, current at 6s. 8d. half nobles called half pennies, at 3s. 4d. of gold; and quarters at 2s. called farthings of gold. The succeeding kings coined rose-nobles, and double rose-nobles, great sovereigns, and half Henry nobles, angels, and threepences.\n\nKing James I. coined units, double crowns, Britain crowns; then crowns, half-crowns, &c.\n\n2. Comparative value of Money and Commodities at different periods. The English money, though the same names do by no means correspond with the same quantity of precious metal as formerly, has not changed so much as the money of most other countries. From the time of William the Conqueror, the proportion between the pound, the shilling, and the penny, seems to have been uniformly the same as at present.\n\nEdward III., as already mentioned, was the first of our kings that coined any gold; and no copper was coined by authority before James I. These pieces were not called farthings, but farthing tokens, and all people were at liberty to take or refuse them. Before the time of Edward III., gold was exchanged, like any other commodity, by its weight; and before the time of James I., copper was stamped by any one person who chose to do it.\n\nIn the year 712 and 727, an ewe and lamb were rated at 1s. Saxon money till a fortnight after Easter. Between the years 900 and 1000, two hydes of land, each containing about 120 acres, were sold for 100 shillings. In 1000, by King Ethelred's laws, a horse was rated at 30s. a mare or a colt of a year old, at 20s. a mule or young ass, at 12s. an ox at 30s. a cow at 24s. a swine at 8d. a sheep at 1s. In 1043, a quarter of wheat was sold for 6s. Hence it is computed, that in the Saxon times there was ten times less money, in proportion to commodities, than at present. Their nominal specie, therefore, being about three times higher than ours, the price of every thing, according to our present language, must be reckoned thirty times cheaper than it is now.\n\nIn the reign of William the Conqueror, commodities were ten times cheaper than they are at present; from which we cannot help forming a very high idea of the wealth and power of that king: for his revenue was 400,000l. per annum, every pound being equal to that weight of silver, consequently the whole may be estimated at 1,200,000l. of the present computation; a sum which, considering the different value of money between that period and the present, was equivalent to 12,000,000l. of modern estimation.\n\nThe most necessary commodities do not seem to have advanced their price from William the Conqueror to Richard I.\n\nThe price of corn in the reign of Henry III. was near half the mean price in our times. Bishop Fleetwood has shown, that in the year 1240, which was in this reign, 4l. 13s. 9d. was worth about 50l. of our present money. About the latter end of this reign, Robert de Hay, rector of Souldern, agreed to receive 100s. to purchase to himself and successor the annual rents of 5s. in full compensation of an acre of corn.\n\nButchers meat, in the time of the great scarcity in the reign of Edward II. was, by a parliamentary ordinance, sold three times cheaper than our mean price at present; poultry somewhat lower, because being now considered as a delicacy, it has risen beyond its proportion. The mean price of corn at this period was half the present value, and the mean price of cattle one eighth.\n\nIn the next reign, which was that of Edward III., the most necessary commodities were in general about three or four times cheaper than they are at present.\n\nIn these times, knights, who served on horseback in the army, had 2s. a day, and a foot archer 6d. which last would now be equal to a crown a-day. This pay has continued nearly the same nominally (only that in the time of the commonwealth the pay of the horse was advanced to 2s. 6d. and that of the foot 1s. though it was reduced again at the Restoration), but soldiers were proportionably of a better rank formerly.\n\nIn the time of Henry VI., corn was about half its present value, other commodities much cheaper. Bishop Fleetwood has determined, from a most accurate consideration of every circumstance, that 3l. in this reign was equivalent to 28l. or 30l. now.\n\nIn the time of Henry VII., many commodities were three times as cheap here, and in all Europe, as they are at present, there having been a great increase of gold and silver in Europe since his time occasioned by the discovery of America.\n\nThe commodities whose price has risen the most since before the time of Henry VII., are butchers meat, fowls,\nMoney, fowls, and fish, especially the latter. And the reason why corn was always much dearer in proportion to other eatables, according to their prices at present, is, that in early times agriculture was little understood. It required more labour and expense, and was more precarious than it is at present. Indeed, notwithstanding the high price of corn in the times we are speaking of, the raising of it so little answered the expense, that agriculture was almost universally quitted for grazing; which was more profitable, notwithstanding the low price of butchers meat. So that there was constant occasion for statutes to restrain grazing, and to promote agriculture; and no effectual remedy was found till the bounty upon the exportation of corn; since which, above ten times more corn has been raised in this country than before.\n\nThe price of corn in the time of James I. and consequently that of other necessaries of life, was not lower, but rather higher, than at present: wool is not two thirds of the value it was then; the finer manufactures having sunk in price by the progress of art and industry, notwithstanding the increase of money. Butchers meat was higher than at present. Prince Henry made an allowance of near 4d. per pound for all the beef and mutton used in his family. This may be true with respect to London; but the price of butchers meat in the country, which does not even now much exceed this price at a medium, has certainly greatly increased of late years, and particularly in the northern counties.\n\nThe prices of commodities are higher in England than in France; besides that the poor people of France live upon much less than the poor in England, and their armies are maintained at less expense. It is computed by Mr Hume, that a British army of 20,000 men is maintained at near as great an expense as 60,000 in France, and that the English fleet, in the war of 1741, required as much money to support it as all the Roman legions in the time of the emperors. However, all that we can conclude from this is, that money is much more plentiful in Europe at present than it was in the Roman empire.\n\nIn the 13th century, the common interest which the Jews had for their money, Voltaire says, was 20 per cent. But with regard to this, we must consider the great contempt that nation was always held in, the large contributions they were frequently obliged to pay, the risk they ran of never receiving the principal, the frequent confiscations of all their effects, and the violent persecutions to which they were exposed; in which circumstances it was impossible for them to lend money at all, unless for most extravagant interest, and much disproportionate to its real value. Before the discovery of America, and the plantation of our colonies, the interest of money was generally 12 per cent. all over Europe; and it has been growing gradually less since that time, till it is now generally about four or five.\n\nWhen sums of money are said to be raised by a whole people, in order to form a just estimate of it, we must take into consideration not only the quantity of the precious metal according to the standard of the coin, and the proportion of the quantity of coin to the commodities, but also the number and riches of the people who raise it; for populous and rich countries will much more easily raise any certain sum of money than one that is thinly inhabited, and chiefly by poor people. This circumstance greatly adds to our surprise at the vast sums of money raised by William the Conqueror, who had a revenue nearly in value equal to 12,000,000l. of our money (allowance being made for the standard of coin and the proportion it bore to the commodities), from a country not near so populous or rich as England is at present. Indeed, the accounts historians give us of the revenues of this prince, and the treasure he left behind him, are barely credible.\n\nII. Imaginary Money, or Money of Account, is that which has never existed, or at least which does not exist in real specie, but is a denomination invented or retained to facilitate the stating of accounts, by keeping them still on a fixed footing, not to be changed, like current coins, which the authority of the sovereign raises or lowers according to the exigencies of the state. Of which kind are pounds, livres, marks, maravedies, &c. See the annexed Table, where the fictitious money is distinguished by a dagger (+).\n\nMoneys of Account among the Ancients.—1. The Greeks reckoned their sums of money by drachma, mina, and talenta. The drachma was equal to 7½d. sterling; 100 drachmæ made the mina, equal to 3l. 4s. 7d. sterling; 60 minæ made the talent, equal to 193l. 15s. sterling; hence 100 talents amounted to 19,375l. sterling. The mina and talentum, indeed, were different in different provinces: their proportions in Attic drachms are as follow: The Syrian mina contained 25 Attic drachms; the Ptolemaic 33½; the Antiochic and Eubœan 100; the Babylonian 116; the greater Attic and Tyrian 133½; the Æginean and Rhodian 166½. The Syrian talent contained 15 Attic minæ; the Ptolemaic 20; the Antiochic 60; the Eubœan 60; the Babylonian 70; the greater Attic and Tyrian 80; the Æginean and Rhodian 100.\n\n2. Roman moneys of account were the sesterius and sestertium. The sesterius was equal to 1d. 3½d. sterling. One thousand of these made the sestertium, equal to 8l. 1s. 5d. 2q. sterling. One thousand of these sesteria made the decies sestertium (the adverb centuries being always understood) equal to 8072l. 18s. 4d. sterling. The decies sestertium they also called decies centena millia nummum. Centes sestertium, or centes HS, were equal to 80,729l. 3s. 4d. Millies HS to 807,292l. 13s. 4d. Millies centes HS to 888,020l. 10s. 8d.\n\nTheory of Money.\n\nI. Of Artificial or Material Money.\n\n1. As far back as our accounts of the transactions of mankind reach, we find they had adopted the precious metals, that is, silver and gold, as the common measure of value, and as the adequate equivalent for every thing alienable.\n\nThe metals are admirably adapted for this purpose: they are perfectly homogeneous: when pure, their masses, or bulks, are exactly in proportion to their weights; no physical difference can be found between two pounds of gold, or silver, let them be the production of the mines of Europe, Asia, Africa, or America: they are perfectly malleable, fusible, and suffer\nthe most exact division which human art is capable to give them: they are capable of being mixed with one another, as well as with metals of a baser, that is, of a less homogeneous nature, such as copper; by this mixture they spread themselves uniformly through the whole mass of the composed lump, so that every atom of it becomes proportionally possessed of a share of this noble mixture; by which means the subdivision of the precious metals is rendered very extensive.\n\nTheir physical qualities are invariable: they lose nothing by keeping; they are solid and durable; and though their parts are separated by friction, like every other thing, yet still they are of the number of those which suffer least by it.\n\nIf money, therefore, can be made of any thing, that is, if the proportional value of things vendible can be measured by any thing material, it may be measured by the metals.\n\nII. The two metals being pitched upon as the most proper substances for realizing the ideal scale of money, those who undertake the operation of adjusting a standard, must constantly keep in their eye the nature and qualities of a scale, as well as the principles upon which it is formed.\n\nThe unit of the scale must constantly be the same, although realized in the metals, or the whole operation fails in the most essential part. This realizing the unit is like adjusting a pair of compasses to a geometrical scale, where the smallest deviation from the exact opening once given must occasion an incorrect measure. The metals, therefore, are to money what a pair of compasses is to a geometrical scale.\n\nThis operation of adjusting the metals to the money of account implies an exact and determinate proportion of both metals to the money unit, realized in all the species and denominations of coin, adjusted to that standard.\n\nThe smallest particle of either metal added to, or taken away from, any coins, which represent certain determinate parts of the scale, overturns the whole system of material money. And if, notwithstanding such variation, these coins continue to bear the same denominations as before, this will as effectually destroy their usefulness in measuring the value of things, as it would overturn the usefulness of a pair of compasses, to suffer the opening to vary, after it is adjusted to the scale representing feet, toises, miles, or leagues, by which the distances upon the plan are to be measured.\n\nIII. Debasing the standard is a good term, because it conveys a clear and distinct idea. It is diminishing the weight of the pure metal contained in that denomination by which a nation reckons, and which we have called the money unit. Raising the standard requires no farther definition, being the direct contrary.\n\nIV. Altering the standard (that is, raising or debasing the value of the money unit) is like altering the national measures or weights. This is best discovered by comparing the thing altered with things of the same nature which have suffered no alteration. Thus, if the foot of measure was altered at once over all England, by adding to it, or taking from it, any proportional part of its standard length, the alteration would be best discovered by comparing the new foot with that of Paris, or of any other country, which had suffered no alteration. Just so, if the pound sterling, which is the English unit, shall be found anyhow changed, and if the variation it has met with be difficult to ascertain because of a complication of circumstances, the best way to discover it, will be to compare the former and the present value of it with the money of other nations which has suffered no variation. This the course of exchange will perform with the greatest exactness.\n\nV. Artists pretend, that the precious metals, when absolutely pure from any mixture, are not of sufficient hardness to constitute a solid and lasting coin. They are found also in the mines mixed with other metals of a baser nature; and the bringing them to a state of perfect purity occasions an unnecessary expense. To avoid, therefore, the inconvenience of employing them in all their purity, people have adopted the expedient of mixing them with a determinate proportion of other metals, which hurts neither their fusibility, malleability, beauty, nor lustre. This metal is called alloy: and, being considered only as a support to the principal metal, is accounted of no value in itself. So that eleven ounces of gold, when mixed with one ounce of silver, acquires by that addition no augmentation of value whatever.\n\nThis being the case, we shall, as much as possible, overlook the existence of alloy, in speaking of money, in order to render language less subject to ambiguity.\n\n2. Incapacities of the Metals to perform the Office of an Invariable Measure of Value.\n\nI. Were there but one species of such a substance as we have represented gold and silver to be; were there but one metal possessing the qualities of purity, divisibility, and durability; the inconveniences in the use of it for money would be fewer by far than they are found to be as matters stand.\n\nSuch a metal might then, by an unlimited division into parts exactly equal, be made to serve as a tolerably steady and universal measure. But the rivalry between the metals, and the perfect equality which is found between all their physical qualities, so far as regards purity and divisibility, render them so equally well adapted to serve as the common measure of value, that they are universally admitted to pass current as money.\n\nWhat is the consequence of this? that the one measures the value of the other, as well as that of every other thing. Now the moment any measure begins to be measured by another, whose proportion to it is not physically, perpetually, and invariably the same, all the usefulness of such a measure is lost. An example will make this plain.\n\nA foot of measure is a determinate length. An English foot may be compared with the Paris foot, or with that of the Rhine; that is to say, it may be measured by them: and the proportion between their lengths may be expressed in numbers, which proportion will be the same perpetually. The measuring the one by the other will occasion no uncertainty; and we may speak of length by Paris feet, and\nMoney be perfectly well understood by others who are used to measure by the English foot, or by the foot of the Rhine.\n\nBut suppose that a youth of 12 years old takes it into his head to measure from time to time, as he advances in age, by the length of his own foot, and that he divides this growing foot into inches and decimals; what can be learned from his account of measures? As he increases in years, his foot, inches, and subdivisions, will be gradually lengthening; and were every man to follow his example, and measure by his own foot, then the foot of a measure now established would totally cease to be of any utility.\n\nThis is just the case with the two metals. There is no determinate invariable proportion between their value; and the consequence of this is, that when they are both taken for measuring the value of other things, the things to be measured, like lengths to be measured by the young man's foot, without changing their relative proportion between themselves, change, however, with respect to the denominations of both their measures. An example will make this plain.\n\nLet us suppose an ox to be worth 3000 pounds weight of wheat, and the one and the other to be worth an ounce of gold, and an ounce of gold to be worth exactly 15 ounces of silver: if the case should happen, that the proportional value between gold and silver should come to be as 14 to 1, would not the ox, and consequently the wheat, be estimated at less in silver, and more in gold, than formerly? Further, Would it be in the power of any state to prevent this variation in the measure of the value of oxen and wheat, without putting into the unit of their money less silver and more gold than formerly?\n\nIf therefore any particular state should fix the standard of the unit of their money to one species of the metals, while in fact both the one and the other are actually employed in measuring value; does not such a state resemble the young man who measures all by his growing foot? For if silver, for example, be retained as the standard, while it is gaining upon gold one fifteenth additional value; and if gold continue all the while to determine the value of things as well as silver; it is plain, that, to all intents and purposes, this silver measure is lengthening daily like the young man's foot, since the same weight of it must become every day equivalent to more and more of the same commodity; notwithstanding that we suppose the same proportion to subsist, without the least variation, between that commodity and every other species of things alienable.\n\nBuying and selling are purely conventional, and no man is obliged to give his merchandise at what may be supposed to be the proportion of its worth. The use, therefore, of an universal measure, is to mark, not only the relative value of the things to which it is applied as a measure, but to discover in an instant the proportion between the value of those, and of every other commodity valued by a determinate measure in all the countries of the world.\n\nWere pounds sterling, livres, florins, piastras, &c., which are all money of account, invariable in their values, what a facility would it produce in all transactions! what an assistance to trade! But as they are all limited or fixed to coins, and consequently vary from time to time, this example shows the utility of the invariable measure which we have described.\n\nThere is another circumstance which incapacitates the metals from performing the office of money; the substance of which the coin is made, is a commodity which rises and sinks in its value with respect to other commodities, according to the wants, competition, and caprices of mankind. The advantage, therefore, found in putting an intrinsic value into that substance which performs the function of money of account, is compensated by the instability of that intrinsic value; and the advantage obtained by the stability of paper, or symbolical money, is compensated by the defect it commonly has of not being at all times susceptible of realization into solid property or intrinsic value.\n\nIn order, therefore, to render material money more perfect, this quality of metal, that is, of a commodity, should be taken from it; and in order to render paper money more perfect, it ought to be made to circulate upon metallic or land security.\n\nII. There are several smaller inconveniences accompanying the use of the metals, which we shall here shortly enumerate.\n\n1mo. No money made of gold or silver can circulate long, without losing its weight, although it all along preserves the same denomination. This represents the contracting a pair of compasses which had been rightly adjusted to the scale.\n\n2do. Another inconvenience proceeds from the fabrication of money. Supposing the faith of princes who coin money to be inviolable, and the probity as well as capacity of those to whom they commit the inspection of the business of the metals to be sufficient, it is hardly possible for workmen to render every piece exactly of a proper weight, or to preserve the due proportion between pieces of different denominations; that is to say, to make every ten shillings exactly of the same weight with every crown piece and every five shillings struck in a coinage. In proportion to such inaccuracies, the parts of the scale become unequal.\n\n3to. Another inconvenience, and far from being inconsiderable, flows from the expense requisite for the coining of money. This expense adds to its value as a manufacture, without adding any thing to its weight.\n\n4to. The last inconvenience is, that by fixing the money of account entirely to the coin, without having any independent common measure, (to mark and control these deviations from mathematical exactness, which are either inseparable from the metals themselves, or from the fabrication of them), the whole measure of value, and all the relative interests of debtors and creditors, become at the disposal not only of workmen in the mint, of Jews who deal in money, of clippers and wailers in coin; but they are also entirely at the mercy of princes who have the right of coining, and who have frequently also the right of raising or debasing the standard of the coin, according as they find it most for their present and temporary interest.\n\n3. Methods which may be proposed for lessening the several Inconveniences to which Material Money is liable.\n\nThe inconveniences from the variation in the relative value\nvalue of the metals to one another, may in some measure be obviated by the following expedients.\n\n1sto, By considering one only as the standard, and leaving the other to seek its own value like any other commodity.\n\n2ndo, By considering one only as the standard, and fixing the value of the other from time to time by authority, according as the market price of the metals shall vary.\n\n3rdo, By fixing the standard of the unit according to the mean proportion of the metals, attaching it to neither; regulating the coin accordingly; and upon every considerable variation in the proportion between them, either to make a new coinage, or to raise the denomination of one of the species, and lower it in the other, in order to preserve the unit exactly in the mean proportion between the gold and silver.\n\n4tho, To have two units and two standards, one of gold and one of silver, and to allow every body to stipulate in either.\n\n5tho, Or last of all, To oblige all debtors to pay one half in gold, and one half in the silver standard.\n\n4. Variations to which the Value of the Money unit is exposed from every Disorder in the Coin.\n\nLet us suppose, at present, the only disorder to consist in a want of the due proportion between the gold and silver in the coin.\n\nThis proportion can only be established by the market price of the metals; because an augmentation and rise in the demand for gold or silver has the effect of augmenting the value of the metal demanded. Let us suppose, that today one pound of gold may buy fifteen pounds of silver: If tomorrow there be a high demand for silver, a competition among merchants to have silver for gold will ensue: they will contend who shall get the silver at the rate of 15 pounds for one of gold; this will raise the price of it; and in proportion to their views of profit, some will accept of less than the 15 pounds. This is plainly a rise in the silver, more properly than a fall in the gold; because it is the competition for the silver which has occasioned the variation in the former proportion between the metals.\n\nLet us now suppose, that a state, having with great exactness examined the proportion of the metals in the market, and having determined the precise quantity of each for realizing or representing the money unit, shall execute a most exact coinage of gold and silver coin. As long as that proportion continues unvaried in the market, no inconvenience can result from that quarter in making use of metals for money of account.\n\nBut let us suppose the proportion to change: that the silver, for example, shall rise in its value with regard to gold: will it not follow, from that moment, that the unit realized in the silver, will become of more value than the unit realized in the gold coin?\n\nBut as the law has ordered them to pass as equivalents for one another, and as debtors have always the option of paying in what legal coin they think fit, will they not all choose to pay in gold; and will not then the silver coin be melted down or exported, in order to be sold as bullion, above the value it bears when it circulates in coin? Will not this paying in gold also really diminish the value of the money unit, since upon this variation every thing must sell for more gold than before, as we have already observed.\n\nConsequently, merchandises, which have not varied in their relative value to any other thing but to gold and silver, must be measured by the mean proportion of the metals: and the application of any other measure to them is altering the standard. If they are measured by the gold, the standard is debased; if by silver, it is raised.\n\nIf, to prevent the inconvenience of melting down the silver, the state shall give up affixing the value of their unit to both species at once, and shall fix it to one, leaving the other to seek its price as any other commodity; in that case, no doubt, the melting down of the coin will be prevented; but will this ever restore the value of the money unit to its former standard? Would it, for example, in the foregoing supposition, raise the debased value of the money unit in the gold coin, if that species were declared to be the standard? It would indeed render silver coin purely a merchandise, and, by allowing it to seek its value, would certainly prevent it from being melted down as before; because the pieces would rise conventionally in their denomination; or an agio, as it is called, would be taken in payments made in silver; but the gold would not, on that account, rise in its value, or begin to purchase any more merchandise than before. Were therefore the standard fixed to the gold, would not this be an arbitrary and a violent revolution in the value of the money unit, and a debasement of the standard?\n\nIf, on the other hand, the state should fix the standard to the silver, which we suppose to have risen in its value, would that ever sink the advanced value which the silver coin had gained above the worth of the former standard unit? and would not this be a violent and an arbitrary revolution in the value of the money unit, and a raising of the standard?\n\nThe only expedient, therefore, is, in such a case, to fix the numerical unit to neither of the metals, but to contrive a way to make it fluctuate in a mean proportion between them; which is in effect the introduction of a pure ideal money of account.\n\nThe regulation of fixing the unit by the mean proportion, ought to take place at the instant the standard unit is fixed with exactness both to the gold and silver. If it be introduced long after the market proportion between the metal has deviated from the proportion established in the coin; and if the new regulation is made to have a retrospect, with regard to the acquiring of permanent contracts entered into while the value of the money unit had attached itself to the lowest currency in consequence of the principle above laid down; then the restoring the money unit to that standard where it ought to have remained (to wit, to the mean proportion) is an injury to all debtors, who have contracted since the time that the proportion of the metals began to vary.\n\nThis is clear from the former reasoning. The moment the market price of the metals differs from that in the coin, every one who has payments to make, pays in that species which is the highest rated in the coin; consequently, he who lends, lends in that species. If after the contract, therefore, the unit is carried,\nMoney. ried up to the mean proportion, this must be a loss to him who had borrowed.\n\nFrom this we may perceive, why there is less inconvenience from the varying of the proportion of the metals, where the standard is fixed to one of them, than when it is fixed to both. In the first case, it is at least uncertain whether the standard or the merchandise species is to rise; consequently, it is uncertain whether the debtors or the creditors are to gain by a variation. If the standard species should rise, the creditors will gain; if the merchandise species rises, the debtors will gain; but when the unit is attached to both species, then the creditors never can gain, let the metals vary as they will; if silver rises, then debtors will pay in gold; if gold rises, the debtors will pay in silver. But whether the unit be attached to one or to both species, the infallible consequence of a variation is, that one half of the difference is either gained or lost by debtors and creditors. The invariable unit is constantly the mean proportional between the two measures.\n\n5. How the Variations of the intrinsic value of the Unit of Money must affect all the domestic Interests of a Nation.\n\nIf the changing the content of the bushel by which grain is measured, would affect the interest of those who are obliged to pay, or who are entitled to receive, a certain number of bushels of grain for the rent of lands; in the same manner must every variation in the value of the unit of account affect all persons who, in permanent contracts, are obliged to make payments, or who are obliged to receive sums of money stipulated in multiples or in fractions of that money unit.\n\nEvery variation, therefore, upon the intrinsic value of the money unit, has the effect of benefiting the class of creditors at the expense of debtors, or vice versa.\n\nThis consequence is deduced from an obvious principle. Money is more or less valuable in proportion as it can purchase more or less of every kind of merchandise. Now, without entering anew into the causes of the rise and fall of prices, it is agreed upon all hands, that whether an augmentation of the general mass of money in circulation has the effect of raising prices in general or not, any augmentation of the quantity of the metals appointed to be put into the money unit, must at least affect the value of that money unit, and make it purchase more of any commodity than before: that is to say, 113 grains of fine gold, the present weight of a pound sterling in gold, can buy 113 pounds of flour; were the pound sterling raised to 114 grains of the same metal, it would buy 114 pounds of flour; consequently, were the pound sterling augmented by one grain of gold, every miller who paid a rent of ten pounds a-year, would be obliged to sell 1140 pounds of his flour, in order to procure ten pounds to pay his rent, in place of 1130 pounds of flour, which he sold formerly to procure the same sum; consequently, by this innovation, the miller must lose yearly ten pounds of flour, which his master consequently must gain. From this example, it is plain, that every augmentation of\n\nmetals put into the pound sterling, either of silver or gold, must imply an advantage to the whole class of creditors who are paid in pounds sterling, and consequently must be a proportional loss to all debtors who must pay by the same denomination.\n\n6. Of the Disorder in the British Coin, so far as it occasions the melting down or the exporting of the Specie.\n\nThe defects in the British coin are three.\n\n1mo. The proportion between the gold and silver in it is found to be as 1 to 15½, whereas the market price may be supposed to be nearly as 1 to 14½ light.\n\n2do. Great part of the current money is worn and light.\n\n3rd. From the second defect proceeds the third, to wit, that there are several currencies in circulation which pass for the same value, without being of the same weight.\n\n4to. From all these defects results the last and greatest inconvenience, to wit, that some innovation must be made, in order to set matters on a right footing.\n\nThe English, besides the unit of their money which they call the pound sterling, have also the unit of their weight for weighing the precious metals.\n\nThis is called the pound troy, and consists of 12 ounces, every ounce of 20 pennyweights, and every pennyweight of 24 grains. The pound troy, therefore, consists of 240 pennyweights and 5760 grains.\n\nThe fineness of the silver is reckoned by the number of ounces and pennyweights of the pure metal in the pound troy of the composed mass; or, in other words, the pound troy, which contains 5760 grains of standard silver, contains 5328 grains of fine silver, and 432 grains of copper, called alloy.\n\nThus standard silver is 11 ounces 2 pennyweights of fine silver in the pound troy to 18 pennyweights copper, or 111 parts fine silver to nine parts alloy.\n\nStandard gold is 11 ounces fine to 1 ounce silver or copper employed for alloy, which together make the pound troy; consequently, the pound troy of standard gold contains 5280 grains fine, and 480 grains alloy, which alloy is reckoned of no value.\n\nThis pound of standard silver is ordered, by statute of the 43rd of Elizabeth, to be coined into 62 shillings, 20 of which make the pound sterling; consequently, the 20 shillings contain 1718.7 grains of fine silver, and 1858.06 standard silver.\n\nThe pound troy of standard gold, ⅔ fine, is ordered, by an act of King Charles II., to be cut into 44½ guineas: that is to say, every guinea contains 129.43 grains of standard gold, and 118.644 of fine gold; and the pound sterling, which is ⅔ of the guinea, contains 112.994, which we may state at 113 grains of fine gold.\n\nThe coinage in England is entirely defrayed at the expense of the state. The mint price for the metals is the very same with the price of the coin. Whoever carries to the mint an ounce of standard silver, receives for it in silver coin 5s. 2d. or 62d.; whoever carries an ounce of standard gold receives in gold coin 3l. 17s. 10½d. the one and the other making exactly an ounce of the same fineness with the bullion. Coin, therefore, can have\nMoney have no value in the market above bullion; consequently, no loss can be incurred by those who melt it down.\n\nWhen the guinea was first struck, the government (not inclining to fix the pound sterling to the gold coin of the nation) fixed the guinea at 20 shillings, (which was then below its proportion to the silver), leaving it to seek its own price above that value, according to the course of the market.\n\nBy this regulation no harm was done to the English silver standard; because the guinea, or 118.644 grains fine gold, being worth more, at that time, than 20 shillings, or 1718.7 grains fine silver, no debtor would pay with gold at its standard value; and whatever it was received for above that price was purely conventional.\n\nAccordingly, guineas sought their own price until the year 1728, that they were fixed anew, not below their value as at first, but at what was then reckoned their exact value, according to the proportion of the metals, viz. at 21 shillings; and at this they were ordered to pass current in all payments.\n\nThis operation had the effect of making the gold a standard as well as the silver. Debtors then paid indifferently in gold as well as in silver, because both were supposed to be of the same intrinsic as well as current value; in which case no inconvenience could follow upon this regulation. But in time silver came to be more demanded; the making of plate began to prevail more than formerly, and the exportation of silver to the East Indies increasing yearly, made the demand for it greater, or perhaps brought its quantity to be proportionally less than before. This changed the proportion of the metals; and by slow degrees they have come from that of 1 to 15.2 (the proportion they were supposed to have when the guineas were fixed and made a lawful money at 21 shillings) to that of 14.5, the present supposed proportion.\n\nThe consequence of this has been, that the same guinea which was worth 1894.6 grains fine silver, at the time it was fixed at 21s. is now worth no more than 1719.9 grains of fine silver according to the proportion of 14.5 to 1.\n\nConsequently, debtors, who have always the option of the legal species in paying their debts, will pay pounds sterling no more in silver but in gold; and as the gold pounds they pay in are not intrinsically worth the silver pounds they paid in formerly according to the statute of Elizabeth, it follows that the pound sterling in silver is really no more the standard, since nobody will pay at that rate, and since nobody can be compelled to do it.\n\nBesides this want of proportion between the metals, the silver coined before the reign of George I. is now become light by circulation; and the guineas coined by all the princes since Charles II. pass by tale, though many of them are considerably diminished in their weight.\n\nLet us now examine what profit the want of proportion and the want of weight in the coin can afford to the money-jobbers in melting it down or exporting it.\n\nDid every body consider coin only as the measure for reckoning value, without attending to its value as a metal, the deviations of gold and silver coin from perfect exactness, either as to proportion or weight, would occasion little inconvenience.\n\nGreat numbers, indeed, in every modern society, consider coin in no other light than that of money of account; and have great difficulty to comprehend what difference any one can find between a light shilling and a heavy one, or what inconvenience there can possibly result from a guinea's being some grains of fine gold too light to be worth 21 shillings standard weight. And did every one think in the same way, there would be no occasion for coin of the precious metals at all; leather, copper, iron, or paper, would keep the reckoning as well as gold and silver.\n\nBut although there be many who look no farther than at the stamp on the coin, there are others whose sole business it is to examine its intrinsic worth as a commodity, and to profit of every irregularity in the weight and proportion of metals.\n\nBy the very institution of coinage, it is implied, that every piece of the same metal, and same denomination with regard to the money-unit, shall pass current for the same value.\n\nIt is, therefore, the employment of money-jobbers, to examine, with a scrupulous exactness, the precise weight of every piece of coin which comes into their hands.\n\nThe first object of their attention is, the price of the metals in the market: a jobber finds, at present, that with 14.5 pounds of fine silver bullion, he can buy one pound of fine gold bullion.\n\nHe therefore buys up with gold coin all the new silver as fast as it is coined, of which he can get at the rate of 15.2 pounds for one in gold; these 15.2 pounds silver coin he melts down into bullion, and converts that back into gold bullion, giving at the rate of only 14.5 pounds for one.\n\nBy this operation he remains with the value of \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\) of one pound weight of silver bullion clear profit upon the 15.2 pounds he bought; which \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\) is really lost by the man who inadvertently coined silver at the mint, and gave it to the money-jobber for his gold. Thus the state loses the expense of the coinage, and the public the convenience of change for their guineas.\n\nBut here it may be asked, Why should the money-jobber melt down the silver coin? can he not buy gold with it as well without melting it down? He cannot; because when it is in coin he cannot avail himself of its being new and weighty. Coin goes by tale, not by weight; therefore, were he to come to market with his new silver coin, gold bullion being sold at the mint price, we shall suppose, viz. at 3l. 17s. 10½d. sterling money per ounce, he would be obliged to pay the price of what he bought with heavy money, which he can equally do with light.\n\nHe therefore melts down the new silver coin, and sells it for bullion, at so many pence an ounce; the price of which bullion is, in the English market, always above the price of silver at the mint, for the reasons now to be given.\n\nWhen you sell standard silver bullion at the mint, you are to be paid in weighty money; that is, you receive for your bullion the very same weight in standard coin; the coinage costs nothing; but when you sell bullion in the market, you are paid in worn-out silver,\nMoney. Silver, in gold, in bank notes, in short, in every species of lawful current money. Now all these payments have some defect: the silver you are paid with is worn and light; the gold you are paid with is overrated, and perhaps also light; and the bank notes must have the same value with the specie with which the bank pays them; that is, with light silver or overrated gold.\n\nIt is for these reasons, that silver bullion, which is bought by the mint at 5s. 2d. per ounce of heavy silver money, may be bought at market at 6s. pence the ounce in light silver, overrated gold, or bank notes, which is the same thing.\n\nFurther, we have seen how the imposition of coinage has the effect of raising coin above the value of bullion, by adding a value to it which it had not as a metal.\n\nJust so, when the unit is once affixed to certain determined quantities of both metals, if one of the metals should afterwards rise in value in the market, the coin made of that metal must lose a part of its value as coin, although it retains it as a metal. Consequently, as in the first case it acquired an additional value by being coined, it must now acquire an additional value by being melted down. From this we may conclude, that when the standard is affixed to both the metals in the coin, and when the proportion of that value is not made to follow the price of the market, that species which rises in the market is melted down, and the bullion is sold for a price as much exceeding the mint price as the metal has risen in its value.\n\nIf, therefore, in England, the price of silver bullion is found to be at 6s. pence the ounce, while at the mint it is rated at 6s.; this proves that silver has risen above the proportion observed in the coin, and that all coin of standard weight may consequently be melted down with a profit of 1s. But as there are several other circumstances to be attended to which regulate and influence the price of bullion, we shall here pass them in review, the better to discover the nature of this disorder in the English coin, and the advantages which money-jobbers may draw from it.\n\nThe price of bullion, like that of every other merchandise, is regulated by the value of the money it is paid with.\n\nIf bullion, therefore, sells in England for 6s. pence an ounce, paid in silver coin, it must sell for 6s. 3½ threepence the pound troy; that is to say, the shillings it is commonly paid with do not exceed the weight of ⅓ of a pound troy; for if the 6s. 3½ threepence with which the pound of bullion is paid weighed more than a pound troy, it would be a shorter and better way for him who wants bullion to melt down the shillings and make use of the metal, than to go to market with them in order to get less.\n\nWe may, therefore, be very certain, that no man will buy silver bullion at 6s. pence an ounce, with any shilling which weighs above ⅓ of a pound troy.\n\nWe have gone upon the supposition that the ordinary price of bullion in the English market is 6s. pence per ounce. This has been done upon the authority of some late writers on this subject: it is now proper to point out the causes which may make it deviate from that value.\n\nI. It may, and certainly will vary, in the price, according as the currency is better or worse. When the expense of a war, or a wrong balance of trade, have carried off a great many heavy guineas, it is natural that bullion should rise; because then it will be paid for more commonly in light gold and silver; that is to say, with pounds sterling, below the value of 113 grains fine gold, the worth of the pound sterling in new guineas.\n\nII. This wrong balance of trade, or a demand for bullion abroad, becoming very great, may occasion a scarcity of the metals in the market, as well as a scarcity of the coin; consequently, an advanced price must be given for it in proportion to the greatness and height of the demand. In this case, both the specie and the bullion must be bought with paper. But the rise in the price of bullion proceeds from the demand for the metals and the competition between merchants to procure them, and not because the paper given as the price is at all of inferior value to the specie. The least discredit of this kind would not tend to diminish the value of the paper; it would annihilate it at once. Therefore, since the metals must be had, and that the paper cannot supply the want of them when they are to be exported, the price rises in proportion to the difficulties in finding metals elsewhere than in the English market.\n\nIII. A sudden call for bullion, for the making of plate. A goldsmith can well afford to give 6s. pence for an ounce of silver, that is to say, he can afford to give one pound of gold for 14 pounds of silver, and perhaps for less, notwithstanding that what he gives be more than the ordinary proportion between the metals, because he indemnifies himself amply by the price of his workmanship; just as a tavern keeper will pay any price for a fine fish, because, like the goldsmith, he buys for other people.\n\nIV. The mint price has as great an effect in bringing down the price of bullion, as exchange has in raising it. In countries where the metals in the coin are justly proportioned, where all the currencies are of legal weight, and where coinage is imposed, the operations of trade make the price of bullion constantly to fluctuate between the value of the coin and the mint price of the metals.\n\nNow let us suppose that the current price of silver bullion in the market is 6s. pence the ounce, paid in lawful money, no matter of what weight or of what metal. Upon this the money-jobber falls to work. All-threepences which are above ⅓ of a pound troy, he throws into his melting pot, and sells them as bullion for 6s. per ounce; all those which are below that weight he carries to market, and buys bullion with them at 6s. per ounce.\n\nWhat is the consequence of this?\n\nThat those who sell the bullion, finding the shillings which the money-jobber pays with perhaps not above ⅓ of a pound troy, they on their side raise the price of their bullion to 6s. the ounce.\n\nThis makes new work for the money-jobber; for he must always gain. He now weighs all threepences as they come to hand; and as formerly he threw into his melting pot those only which were worth more than ⅓ of a pound troy, he now throws in all that are in value.\nMoney. He then sells the melted shillings at 66d. the ounce, and buys bullion with the light ones at the same price.\n\nThis is the consequence of ever permitting any species of coin to pass by the authority of the stamp, without controlling it at the same time by the weight; and this is the manner in which money-jobbers gain by the currency of light money.\n\nIt is no argument against this exposition of the matter to say, that silver bullion is seldom bought with silver coin; because the pence in new guineas are worth no more than the pence of shillings of 6½ in the pound troy; that is to say, that 240 pence contained in ⅔ of a new guinea, and 240 pence contained in 28 shillings of 6½ to the pound troy, differ no more in the intrinsic value than 0.83 of a grain of fine silver upon the whole, which is a mere trifle.\n\nWhenever, therefore, shillings come below the weight of ⅔ of a pound troy, then there is an advantage in changing them for new guineas; and when that is the case, the new guineas will be melted down, and profit will be found in selling them for bullion, upon the principles we have just been explaining.\n\nWe have already given a specimen of the domestic operations of the money-jobbers; but these are not the most prejudicial to national concerns. The jobbers may be supposed to be Englishmen; and in that case the profit they make remains at home; but whenever there is a call for bullion to pay the balance of trade, it is evident that this will be paid in silver coin; never in gold, if heavy silver can be got; and this again carries away the silver coin, and renders it at home so rare, that great inconveniences are found for want of the lesser denominations of it. The loss, however, here is confined to an inconvenience; because the balance of trade being a debt which must be paid, we do not consider the exportation of the silver for that purpose as any consequence of the disorder of the coin. But besides this exportation which is necessary, there are others which are arbitrary, and which are made only with a view to profit of the wrong proportion.\n\nWhen the money-jobbers find difficulty in carrying on the traffic we have described, in the English market, because of the competition among themselves, they carry the silver coin of the country, and sell it abroad for gold, upon the same principles that the East India Company send silver to China in order to purchase gold.\n\nIt may be demanded, What hurt this trade can do to Britain, since those who export silver bring back the same value in gold? Were this trade carried on by natives, there would be no loss; because they would bring home gold for the whole intrinsic value of the silver. But if we suppose foreigners sending over gold to be coined at the English mint, and changing the gold into English silver coin, and then carrying off this coin, it is plain that they must gain the difference, as well as the money-jobbers. But it may be answered, That having given gold for silver at the rate of the mint, they have given value for what they have received. Very right; but so did Sir Hans Sloane, when he paid five guineas for an overgrown toad: he got value for his money; but it was value only to himself. Just so, whenever the English government shall be obliged to restore the proportion of the metals (as they must do), this operation will annihilate that imaginary value which they have hitherto fet upon gold; which imagination is the only thing which renders the exchange of their silver against the foreign gold equal.\n\nBut it is farther objected, that foreigners cannot carry off the heavy silver; because there is none to carry off. Very true; but then they have carried off a great quantity already: or if the English Jews have been too sharp to allow such a profit to fall to strangers, (which may or may not have been the case), then this disorder is an effectual stop to any more coining of silver for circulation.\n\n7. Of the Disorder in the British Coin, so far as it affects the Value of the Pound Sterling Currency.\n\nFrom what has been said, it is evident, that there must be found in England two legal pounds sterling, of different values; the one worth 113 grains of fine gold, the other worth 1718.7 grains of fine silver. We call them different: because these two portions of the precious metals are of different values all over Europe.\n\nBut besides these two different pounds sterling, which the change in the proportion of the metals has created, the other defects of the circulating coin produce similar effects. The guineas coined by all the princes since King Charles II., have been of the same standard weight and fineness, 44½ in a pound troy of standard gold. Fine: these have been constantly wearing ever since they have been coined; and in proportion to their wearing they are of less value.\n\nIf, therefore, the new guineas are below the value of a pound sterling in silver, standard weight, the old must be of less value still. Here then is another currency, that is, another pound sterling; or indeed, more properly speaking, there are as many different pounds sterling as there are guineas of different weights. This is not all; the money-jobbers having carried off all the weighty silver, that which is worn with use, and reduced even below the standard of gold, forms one currency more, and totally destroys all determinate proportion between the money unit and the currencies which are supposed to represent it.\n\nIt may be asked, how, at this rate, any silver has remained in England? It is answered, that the few weighty shillings which still remain in circulation, have marvellously escaped the hands of the money-jobbers: and as to the rest, the rubbing and wearing of these pieces has done what the state might have done; that is to say, it has reduced them to their due proportion with the lightest gold.\n\nThe disorder, therefore, of the English coin has rendered the standard of a pound sterling quite uncertain. To say that it is 1718.7 grains of fine silver, is quite ideal. Who are paid in such pounds? To say that it is 113 grains of pure gold, may also not be true; because there are many currencies worse than the new guineas.\n\nWhat then is the consequence of all this disorder? What effect has it upon the current value of a pound sterling? And which way can the value of that be determined?\n\nThe operations of trade bring value to an equation, notwithstanding the greatest irregularities possible; and\nvalue over all the world by the means of foreign exchange. This is a kind of ideal scale for measuring the British coin, although it has not all the properties of that described above.\n\nExchange considers the pound sterling as a value determined according to the combination of the values of all the different currencies, in proportion as payments are made in the one or the other; and as debtors generally take care to pay in the worst species they can, it consequently follows, that the value of the pound sterling should fall to that of the lowest currency.\n\nWere there a sufficient quantity of worn gold and silver to acquire all bills of exchange, the pound sterling would come down to the value of them; but if the new gold be also necessary for that purpose, the value of it must be proportionally greater.\n\nAll these combinations are liquidated and compensated with one another, by the operations of trade and exchange; and the pound sterling, which is so different in itself, becomes thereby, in the eyes of commerce a determinate unit; subject, however, to variations, from which it never can be exempted.\n\nExchange, therefore, is one of the best measures for valuing a pound sterling, present currency. Here occurs a question:\n\nDoes the great quantity of paper money in England tend to diminish the value of the pound sterling?\n\nWe answer in the negative. Paper money is just as good as gold or silver money, and no better. The variation of the standard, as we have already said, must influence the interests of debtors and creditors proportionally everywhere. From this it follows, that all augmentation of the value of the money unit in the specie must hurt the debtors in the paper money; and all diminutions, on the other hand, must hurt the creditors in the paper money as well as everywhere else. The payments, therefore, made in paper money, never can contribute to the regulation of the standard of the pound sterling; it is the specie received in liquidation of that paper money which alone can contribute to mark the value of the British unit; because it is affixed to nothing else.\n\nFrom this we may draw a principle, \"That in countries where the money unit is entirely affixed to the coin, the actual value of it is not according to the legal standard of that coin, but according to the mean proportion of the actual worth of those currencies in which debts are paid.\n\nFrom this we see the reason why the exchange between England and all other trading towns in Europe has long appeared so unfavourable. People calculate the real par, upon the supposition that a pound sterling is worth 1718.7 grains troy of fine silver, when in fact the currency is not perhaps worth 1638, the value of a new guinea in silver, at the market proportion of 1 to 14.5; that is to say, the currency is but 95.3 per cent. of the silver standard of the 43d of Elizabeth. No wonder then if the exchange be thought unfavourable.\n\nFrom the principle we have just laid down, we may gather a confirmation of what we advanced concerning the cause of the advanced price of bullion in the English market.\n\nWhen people buy bullion with current money at a determinate price, that operation, in conjunction with the course of exchange, ought naturally to mark the actual value of the pound sterling with great exactness.\n\nIf therefore the price of standard bullion in the English market, when no demand is found for the exportation of the metals, that is to say, when paper is found for paper upon exchange, and when merchants versed in these matters judge exchange (that is, remittances) to be at par, if then silver bullion cannot be bought at a lower price than 65 pence the ounce, it is evident that this bullion might be bought with 65 pence in shillings, of which 65 might be coined out of the pound troy English standard silver; since 65 per ounce implies 65 shillings for the 12 ounces or pound troy.\n\nThis plainly shows how standard silver bullion should sell for 65 pence the ounce, in a country where the ounce of standard silver in the coin is worth no more than 62½, and were the market price of bullion to stand uniformly at 65 pence per ounce, that would show the value of the pound sterling to be tolerably fixed. All the heavy silver coin is now carried off; because it was intrinsically worth more than the gold it passed for in currency. The silver therefore which remains is worn down to the market proportion of the metals, as has been said; that is to say, 20 shillings in silver currency are worth 113 grains of fine gold, at the proportion of 1 to 14.5 between gold and silver.\n\nNow, as 1 is to 14.5, so is 113 to 1638; so the 20 shillings current weigh but 1638 grains fine silver, instead of 1718.7, which they ought to do according to the standard.\n\nNow let us speak of standard silver, since we are examining how far the English coin must be worn by use.\n\nThe pound troy contains 5760 grains. This, according to the standard, is coined into 62 shillings; consequently, every shilling ought to weigh 92.9 grains. Of such shillings it is impossible that ever standard bullion should fall at above 62 pence per ounce. If therefore such bullion sells for 65 pence, the shillings with which it is bought must weigh no more than 88.64 grains standard silver; that is, they must lose 4.29 grains, and are reduced to ⅓ of a pound troy.\n\nBut it is not necessary that bullion be bought with shillings; no stipulation of price is ever made farther, than at so many pence sterling per ounce. Does not this virtually determine the value of such currency with regard to all the currencies in Europe? Did a Spaniard, a Frenchman, or a Dutchman, know the exact quantity of silver bullion which can be bought in the London market for a pound sterling, would he inform himself any farther as to the intrinsic value of that money unit? Would he not understand the value of it far better from that circumstance than by the course of any exchange, since exchange does not mark the intrinsic value of money, but only the value of that money transported from one place to another?\n\nThe price of bullion, therefore, when it is not influenced by extraordinary demand, (such as for the payment of a balance of trade, or for making an extraordinary\ntraordinary provision of plate), but when it stands at what everybody knows to be meant by the common market price, is a very tolerable measure of the value of the actual money standard in any country.\n\nIf it be therefore true, that a pound sterling cannot purchase above 1638 grains of fine silver bullion, it will require not a little logic to prove that it is really, or has been for these many years, worth any more; notwithstanding that the standard weight of it in England is regulated by the laws of the kingdom at 1718.7 grains of fine silver.\n\nIf to this valuation of the pound sterling drawn from the price of bullion, we add the other drawn from the course of exchange; and by this we find, that when paper is found for paper upon exchange, a pound sterling cannot purchase above 1638 grains of fine silver in any country in Europe; upon these two authorities we may very safely conclude (as to the matter of fact at least) that the pound sterling is not worth more, either in London or in any other trading city; and if this be the case, it is just worth 20 shillings of 6½ to the pound troy.\n\nIf therefore the mint were to coin shillings at that rate, and pay for silver bullion at the market price, that is, at the rate of 6½ pence per ounce in those new coined shillings, they would be in proportion to the gold; silver would be carried to the mint equally with gold, and would be as little subject to be exported or melted down.\n\nIt may be inquired in this place, how far the coining the pound troy into 65 shillings is contrary to the laws of England?\n\nThe moment a state pronounces a certain quantity of gold to be worth a certain quantity of silver, and orders these respective quantities of each metal to be received as equivalents of each other, and as lawful money in payments, that moment gold is made a standard as much as silver. If therefore too small a quantity of gold be ordered or permitted to be considered as an equivalent for the unit, the silver standard is from that moment debased; or indeed, more properly speaking, all silver money is from that moment profligate; for who, from that time, will ever pay in silver, when he can pay cheaper in gold? Gold, therefore, by such a law, is made the standard, and all declarations to the contrary are against the matter of fact.\n\nWere the king, therefore, to coin silver at 65 shillings in the pound, it is demonstration, that by such an act he would commit no adulteration upon the standard; the adulteration is already committed. The standard has descended to where it is, by slow degrees, and by the operation of political causes only; and nothing prevents it from falling lower but the standard of the gold coin. Let guineas be now left to seek their value as they did formerly, and let light silver continue to go by tale, we shall see the guineas up at 30 shillings in 20 years' time, as was the case in 1695.\n\nIt is as absurd to say that the standard of Queen Elizabeth has not been debased by enacting that the English unit shall be acquitted with 113 grains of fine gold, as it would be to affirm that it would not be debased from what it is at present by enacting that a pound of butter should everywhere be received in payment for a pound sterling; although the pound sterling should continue to consist of three ounces, 17 pennyweights, and 10 grains of standard silver, according to the statute of the 43rd of Elizabeth. In that case, most debtors would pay in butter; and silver would, as at present, acquire a conventional value as a metal, but would be looked upon no longer as a standard, or as money.\n\nIf therefore, by the law of England, a pound sterling must consist of 1718.7 grains troy of fine silver; by the law of England also, 113 grains of gold must be of the same value; but no law can establish that proportion; consequently, in which ever way a reformation be brought about, some law must be reversed; consequently, expediency, and not compliance with law, must be the motive in reforming the abuse.\n\nFrom what has been said, it is not at all surprising that the pound sterling should in fact be reduced nearly to the value of the gold. Whether it ought to be kept at that value is another question. All that we here decide is, that coining the pound troy into 65 shillings would restore the proportion of the metals, and render both species common in circulation. But restoring the weight and proportion of the coin is not the difficulty which prevents a reformation of the English coinage.\n\n8. Circumstances to be attended to in a New Regulation of the British Coin.\n\nTo people who do not understand the nature of such operations, it may have an air of justice to support the unit at what is commonly believed to be the standard of Queen Elizabeth, viz. at 1718.7 grains of fine silver.\n\nThe regulating the standard of both silver and gold to ¼ fine, and the pound sterling to four ounces standard silver, as it stood during the reign of Queen Mary I, has also its advantages, as Mr Harris has observed. It makes the crown-piece to weigh just one ounce, the shilling four pennyweights, and the penny eight grains; consequently, were the new statute to bear, that the weight of the coin should regulate its currency upon certain occasions, the having the pieces adjusted to certain aliquot parts of weight would make weighing easy, and would accustom the common people to judge of the value of money by its weight, and not by the stamp.\n\nIn that case, there might be a convenience in striking the gold coins of the same weight with the silver; because the proportion of their values would then constantly be the same with the proportion of the metals. The gold crowns would be worth at present, 3l. 12s. 6d. the half-crowns 1l. 16s. 3d. the gold shillings 14s. 6d. and the half 7s. 3d. This was anciently the practice in the Spanish mints.\n\nThe interests within the state can be nowise perfectly protected, but by permitting conversions of value from the old to the new standard, whatever it be, and by regulating the footing of such conversions by act of parliament, according to circumstances.\n\nFor this purpose, we shall examine those interests which will chiefly merit the attention of government, when they form a regulation for the future of acquiring\nting permanent contracts already entered into. Such as may be contracted afterwards will naturally follow the new standard.\n\nThe landed interest is no doubt the most considerable in the nation. Let us therefore examine, in the first place, what regulations it may be proper to make, in order to do justice to this great class, with respect to the land tax on one hand, and with respect to their lees on the other.\n\nThe valuation of the lands of England was made many years ago, and reasonably ought to be supported at the real value of the pound sterling at that time, according to the principles already laid down. The general valuation, therefore, of the whole kingdom will rise according to this scheme. This will be considered as an injustice; and no doubt it would be so, if for the future, the land tax be imposed as heretofore, without attending to this circumstance; but as that imposition is annual, as it is laid on by the landed interest itself, who compose the parliament, it is to be supposed that this great class will at least take care of their own interest.\n\nWere the valuation of the lands to be stated according to the valuation of the pound sterling of 1718.7 grains of silver, which is commonly supposed to be the standard of Elizabeth, there would be no great injury done; this would raise the valuation only 5 per cent, and the land tax in proportion.\n\nThere is no class of inhabitants in all England so much at their ease, and so free from taxes, as the class of farmers. By living in the country, and by consuming the fruits of the earth without their suffering any alienation, they avoid the effect of many excises, which, by those who live in corporations, are felt upon many articles of their consumption, as well as on those which are immediately loaded with these impositions. For this reason it will not, perhaps, appear unreasonable, if the additional 5 per cent. on the land tax were thrown upon this class, and not upon the landlords.\n\nWith respect to leases, it may be observed, that we have gone upon the supposition that the pound sterling in the year 1728 was worth 1718.7 grains of fine silver, and 113 grains of fine gold.\n\nThere would be no injustice done the lessees of all the lands in the kingdom, were their rents to be fixed at the mean proportion of these values. We have observed how the pound sterling has been gradually diminishing in its worth from that time by the gradual rise of the silver. This mean proportion, therefore, will nearly answer to what the value of the pound sterling was in 1743; supposing the rise of the silver to have been uniform.\n\nIt may be farther alleged in favour of the landlords, that the gradual debasement of the standard has been more prejudicial to their interest in letting their lands, than to the farmers in disposing of the fruits of them. Proprietors cannot so easily raise their rents upon new leases, as farmers can raise the prices of their grain according to the debasement of the value of the currency.\n\nThe pound sterling, thus regulated at the mean proportion of its worth, as it stands at present, and as it stood in 1728, may be realized in 1678.6 grains of fine silver, and 115.76 grains fine gold; which is 2.4 per cent, above the value of the present currency. No injury, therefore, would be done to lessees, and no unreasonable gain would accrue to the landed interest, in appointing conversions of all land rents at 2½ per cent, above the value of the present currency.\n\nWithout a thorough knowledge of every circumstance relating to Great Britain, it is impossible to lay down any plan. It is sufficient here briefly to point out the principles upon which it must be regulated.\n\nThe next interest to be considered is that of the nation's creditors. The right regulation of their concerns will have a considerable influence in establishing public credit upon a solid basis, by making it appear to all the world, that no political operation upon the money of Great Britain can in any respect either benefit or prejudice the interest of those who lend their money upon the faith of the nation. The regulating also the interest of so great a body, will serve as a rule for all creditors who are in the same circumstances, and will upon other accounts be productive of greater advantages to the nation in time coming.\n\nIn 1749, a new regulation was made with the public creditors, when the interest of the whole redeemable national debt was reduced to 3 per cent. This circumstance infinitely facilitates the matter with respect to this class, since, by this innovation of all former contracts, the whole national debt may be considered as contracted at, or posterior to, the 25th December 1749.\n\nWere the state, by an arbitrary operation upon money (which every reformation must be), to diminish the value of the pound sterling in which the parliament at that time bound the nation to acquire those capitals and the interest upon them, would not all Europe say, That the British parliament had defrauded their creditors? If therefore the operation proposed to be performed should have a contrary tendency, viz., to augment the value of the pound sterling with which the parliament at that time bound the nation to acquire those capitals and interests, must not all Europe also agree, That the British parliament had defrauded the nation?\n\nThe convention with the ancient creditors of the state, who, in consequence of the debasement of the standard, might have justly claimed an indemnification, for the loss upon their capitals, lent at a time when the pound sterling was at the value of the heavy silver, removes all causes of complaint from that quarter. There was in the year 1749 an innovation in all their contracts; and they are now to be considered as creditors only from the 25th of December of that year.\n\nLet the value of the pound sterling be inquired into during one year preceding and one posterior to the transaction of the month of December 1749. The great sums borrowed and paid back by the nation during that period, will furnish data sufficient for that calculation. Let this value of the pound be specified in troy grains of fine silver and fine gold bullion, without mentioning any denomination of money according to the exact proportion of the metals at that time. And let this pound be called the pound of national credit.\n\nThis first operation being determined, let it be enacted, that the pound sterling, by which the state is to borrow...\nborrow for the future, and that in which the creditors are to be paid, shall be the exact mean proportion between the quantities of gold and silver above specified, according to the actual proportion of the metals at the time such payments shall be made; or that the sums shall be borrowed or acquitted, one half in gold and one half in silver, at the respective requisitions of the creditors or of the state, when borrowing. All debts contracted posterior to 1749 may be made liable to conversions.\n\nThe consequence of this regulation will be the infensible establishment of a bank money. Nothing would be more difficult to establish, by a positive revolution, than such an invariable measure; and nothing will be found so easy as to let it establish itself by its own advantages. This bank money will be liable to much fewer inconveniences than that of Amsterdam. There the persons transacting must be upon the spot; here, the sterling currency may, every quarter of a year, be adjusted by the exchequer to this invariable standard, for the benefit of all debtors and creditors who incline to profit of the stability of this measure of value.\n\nThis scheme is liable to no inconvenience from the variation of the metals, let them be ever so frequent or hard to be determined; because upon every occasion where there is the smallest doubt as to the actual proportion, the option competent to creditors to be paid half in silver and half in gold will remove.\n\nSuch a regulation will also have this good effect, that it will give the nation more just ideas of the nature of money, and consequently of the influence it ought to have upon prices.\n\nIf the value of the pound sterling shall be found to have been by accident less in December 1749 than it is at present; or if at present the currency be found below what it has commonly been since 1749; in justice to the creditors, and to prevent all complaints, the nation may grant them the mean proportion of the value of the pound sterling from 1749 to 1760, or any other which may to parliament appear reasonable.\n\nThis regulation must appear equitable in the eyes of all Europe; and the strongest proof of it will be, that it will not produce the smallest effect prejudicial to the interest of the foreign creditors. The course of exchange with regard to them will stand precisely as before.\n\nA Dutch, French, or German creditor, will receive the same value for his interest in the English stocks as heretofore. This must silence all clamours at home, being the most convincing proof, that the new regulation of the coin will have made no alteration upon the real value of any man's property, let him be debtor or creditor.\n\nThe interest of every other denomination of creditors, whose contracts are of a fresh date, may be regulated upon the same principles. But where debts are of an old standing, justice demands, that attention be had to the value of money at the time of contracting. Nothing but the stability of the English coin, when compared with that of other nations, can make such a proposal appear extraordinary. Nothing is better known in France than this stipulation added to obligations, Argent au cours de ce jour; that is to say, That the sum shall be repaid in coin of the same intrinsic value with what has been lent. Why should such a clause be thought reasonable for guarding people against arbitrary operations upon the numerary value of the coin, and not be found, just upon every occasion where the numerary value of it is found to be changed, let the cause be what it will?\n\nThe next interest we shall examine is that of trade. When men have attained the age of 21, they have no more occasion for guardians. This may be applied to traders; they can carry with their pen every inconvenience which may result to other people from the changes upon money, provided only the laws permit them to do themselves justice with respect to their engagements. This class demands no more than a right to convert all reciprocal obligations into denominations of coin of the same intrinsic value with those they have contracted in.\n\nThe next interest is that of buyers and sellers; that is, of manufacturers with regard to consumers, and of servants with respect to those who hire their personal service.\n\nThe interest of this class requires a most particular attention. They must, literally speaking, be put to school, and taught the first principles of their trade, which is buying and selling. They must learn to judge of price by the grains of silver and gold they receive; they are children of a mercantile mother, however warlike the father's disposition. If it be the interest of the state that their bodies be rendered robust and active, it is no less the interest of the state that their minds be instructed in the first principles of the trade they exercise.\n\nFor this purpose, tables of conversion from the old standard to the new must be made, and ordered to be put up in every market, in every shop. All duties, all excises, must be converted in the same manner. Uniformity must be made to appear everywhere. The smallest deviation from this will be a stumbling block to the multitude.\n\nNot only the interest of the individuals of the class we are at present considering, demands the nation's care and attention in this particular; but the prosperity of trade, and the wellbeing of the nation, are also deeply interested in the execution.\n\nThe whole delicacy of the intricate combinations of commerce depends upon a just and equable vibration of prices, according as circumstances demand it. The more, therefore, the industrious classes are instructed in the principles which influence prices, the more easily will the machine move. A workman then learns to sink his price without regret, and can raise it without avidity. When principles are not understood, prices cannot gently fall, they must be pulled down; and merchants dare not suffer them to rise, for fear of abuse, even although the perfection of an infant manufacture should require it.\n\nThe last interest is that of the bank of England, which naturally must regulate that of every other.\n\nHad this great company followed the example of other banks, and established a bank-money of an invariable standard as the measure of all their debts and credits, they would not have been liable to any inconvenience upon a variation of the standard.\nThe bank of England was projected about the year 1694, at a time when the current money of the nation was in the greatest disorder, and government in the greatest distress both for money and for credit. Commerce was then at a very low ebb; and the only, or at least the most profitable, trade of any, was jobbing in coin, and carrying backwards and forwards the precious metals from Holland to England. Merchants profited also greatly from the effects which the utter disorder of the coin produced upon the price of merchandise.\n\nAt such a juncture the resolution was taken to make a new coinage; and upon the prospect of this, a company was found, who, for an exclusive charter to hold a bank for 13 years, willingly lent the government upwards of a million sterling at 8 per cent (in light money we suppose), with a prospect of being repaid both interest and capital in heavy. This was not all: part of the money lent was to be applied for the establishment of the bank; and no less than 4000l. a year was allowed to the company, above the full interest, for defraying the charge of the management.\n\nUnder such circumstances the introduction of bank-money was very superfluous, and would have been very impolitic. That invention is calculated against the raising of the standard: but here the bank profited by that rise in its quality of creditor for money lent; and took care not to commence debtor by circulating their paper until the effect of the new regulation took place in 1695; that is, after the general re-coining of all the clipped silver.\n\nFrom that time till now, the bank of England has been the basis of the nation's credit, and with great reason has been constantly under the most intimate protection of every minister.\n\nThe value of the pound sterling, as we have seen, has been declining ever since the year 1601, the standard being fixed to silver during all that century, while the gold was constantly rising. No sooner had the proportion taken another turn, and silver begun to rise, than the government of England threw the standard virtually upon the gold, by regulating the value of the guineas at the exact proportion of the market. By these operations, however, the bank has constantly been a gainer (in its quality of debtor) upon all the paper in circulation; and therefore has lost nothing by not having established a bank-money.\n\nThe interest of this great company being established upon the principles we have endeavoured to explain, it is very evident, that the government of England never will take any step in the reformation of the coin which in its consequences can prove hurtful to the bank. Such a step would be contrary both to justice and to common sense. To make a regulation which, by raising the standard, would prove beneficial to the public creditors, to the prejudice of the bank (which we may call the public debtor), would be an operation upon public credit like that of a person who is at great pains to support his house by props on all sides, and who at the same time blows up the foundation of it with gunpowder.\n\nWe may therefore conclude, that with regard to the bank of England, as well as every other private banker, the notes which are constantly payable upon demand must be made liable to a conversion at the actual value of the pound sterling at the time of the new regulation.\n\nThat the bank will gain by this, is very certain; but the circulation of their notes is so swift, that it would be absurd to allow to the then possessors of them that indemnification which naturally should be shared by all those through whose hands they have passed, in proportion to the debasement of the standard during the time of their respective possession.\n\nBesides these considerations, which are in common to all states, the government of Great Britain has one peculiar to itself. The interest of the bank, and that of the creditors, are diametrically opposite: every thing which raises the standard hurts the bank; every thing which sinks it hurts the creditors: and upon the right management of the one and the other, depends the solidity of public credit. For these reasons, without the most certain prospect of conducting a restitution of the standard to the general advantage as well as approbation of the nation, no minister will probably ever undertake so dangerous an operation.\n\nWe shall now propose an expedient which may remove at least some of the inconveniences which would result from so extensive an undertaking as that of regulating the respective interests in Great Britain by a positive law, upon a change in the value of their money of account.\n\nSuppose then, that, before any change is made in the coin, government should enter into a transaction with the public creditors, to ascertain a permanent value for the pound sterling for the future, specified in a determined proportion of the fine metals in common bullion, without any regard to money of account, or to any coin whatever.\n\nThis preliminary step being taken, let the intended alteration of the standard be proclaimed a certain time before it is to commence. Let the nature of the change be clearly explained, and let all such as are engaged in contracts which are dissolvable at will upon the pretensions stipulated, be acquitted between the parties, or innovated as they shall think proper; with certification, that, posterior to a certain day, the stipulations formerly entered into shall be binding according to the denominations of the money of account in the new standard.\n\nAs to permanent contracts, which cannot at once be fulfilled and dissolved, such as leases, the parliament may either prescribe the methods and terms of conversion; or a liberty may be given to the parties to annul the contract, upon the debtor's refusing to perform his agreement according to the new standard. Contracts, on the other hand, might remain stable, with respect to creditors who would be satisfied with payments made on the footing of the old standard. If the rise intended should not be very considerable, no great injustice can follow such a regulation.\n\nAnnuities are now thoroughly understood, and the value of them is brought to so nice a calculation, that nothing will be easier than to regulate these upon the footing of the value paid for them, or of the subject affected by them. If by the regulation, land rents are made to rise in denomination, the annuities charged upon them ought to rise in proportion; if in intrinsic value, the annuity should remain as it was.\n9. Regulations which the Principles of this Inquiry point out as expedient to be made by a new Statute for regulating the British Coin.\n\nLet us now examine what regulations it may be proper to make by a new statute concerning the coin of Great Britain, in order to preserve always the same exact value of the pound sterling realized in gold and in silver, in spite of all the incapacities inherent in the metals to perform the functions of an invariable scale or measure of value.\n\n1. The first point is to determine the exact number of grains of fine gold and fine silver which are to compose it, according to the then proportion of the metals in the London market.\n\n2. To determine the proportion of these metals with the pound troy; and in regard that the standard of gold and silver is different, let the mint price of both metals be regulated according to the pound troy fine.\n\n3. To fix the mint price within certain limits; that is to say, to leave to the king and council, by proclamation, to carry the mint price of bullion up to the value of the coin, as is the present regulation, or to link it to per cent. below that price, according as government shall incline to impose a duty upon coinage.\n\n4. To order, that silver and gold coin shall be struck of such denominations as the king shall think fit to appoint; in which the proportion of the metals above determined shall be constantly observed through every denomination of the coin, until necessity shall make a new general coinage unavoidable.\n\n5. To have the number of grains of the fine metal in every piece marked upon the reverse, or upon the legend of the coin, in place of some initial letters or titles, which not one person in a thousand can decipher; and to make the coin of as compact a form as possible, diminishing the surface of it as much as is consistent with beauty.\n\n6. That it shall be lawful for all contracting parties to stipulate their payments either in gold or silver coin, or to leave the option of the species to one of the parties.\n\n7. That where no particular stipulation is made, creditors shall have power to demand payment, half in one species, half in the other; and when the sum cannot fall equally into gold and silver coins, the fractions to be paid in silver.\n\n8. That in buying and selling, when no particular species has been stipulated, and when no act in writing has intervened, the option of the species shall be competent to the buyer.\n\n9. That all sums paid or received by the king's receivers, or by bankers, shall be delivered by weight, if demanded.\n\n10. That all money which shall be found under the legal weight, from whatever cause it may proceed, may be rejected in every payment whatsoever; or if offered in payment of a debt above a certain sum, may be taken according to its weight, at the then mint price, in the option of the creditor.\n\n11. That no penalty shall be incurred by those who melt down or export the nation's coin; but that wasting, clipping, or diminishing the weight of any part of it shall be deemed felony, as much as any other theft, if the person so degrading the coin shall afterwards make it circulate for lawful money.\n\nTo prevent the inconveniences proceeding from the variation in the proportion between the metals, it may be provided,\n\n12. That upon every variation of proportion in the market price of the metals, the price of both shall be changed, according to the following rule:\n\nLet the price of the pound troy fine gold in the coin be called $G$.\n\nLet the price of ditto in the silver be called $S$.\n\nLet the new proportion between the market price of the metals be called $P$.\n\nThen state this formula:\n\n$$\\frac{G}{2} + \\frac{S}{2} = \\text{to a pound troy fine silver, in sterling currency.}$$\n\n$$\\frac{S}{2} + \\frac{P}{2} = \\text{to a pound troy fine gold, in sterling currency.}$$\n\nThis will be a rule for the mint to keep the price of the metals constantly at par with the price of the market; and coinage may be imposed, as has been described, by fixing the mint price of them at a certain rate below the value of the fine metals in the coin.\n\n13. As long as the variation of the market-price of the metals shall not carry the price of the rising metal so high as the advanced price of the coin above the bullion, no alteration need be made on the denomination of either species.\n\n14. So soon as the variation of the market price of the metals shall give a value to the rising species, above the difference between the coin and the bullion; then the king shall alter the denominations of all the coin, silver and gold, adding to the coins of the rising metal exactly what is taken from those of the other. An example will make this plain:\n\nLet us suppose that the coinage has been made according to the proportion of 14.5 to 1; that 20 shillings, or 4 crown-pieces, shall contain, in fine silver, 14.5 times as many grains as the guinea, or the gold pound, shall contain grains of fine gold. Let the new proportion of the metals be supposed to be 14 to 1. In that case, the 20 shillings, or the 4 crowns, will contain $\\frac{1}{15}$ more value than the guinea. Now since there is no question of making a new general coinage upon every variation, in order to adjust the proportion of the metals in the weight of the coins, that proportion might be adjusted by changing their respective denominations according to this formula:\n\nLet the 20 shillings, or 4 crowns, in coin, be called $S$. Let the guinea be called $G$. Let the difference between the old proportion and the new, which is $\\frac{1}{15}$, be called $P$. Then say,\n\n$$S - \\frac{P}{2} = \\text{a pound sterling, and } G + \\frac{P}{2} = \\text{a pound sterl.}$$\n\nBy this it appears that all the silver coin must be raised in its denomination $\\frac{1}{15}$, and all the gold coin must be lowered in its denomination $\\frac{1}{15}$; yet still $S + G$ will be equal to two pounds sterling, as before, whether they be considered according to the old or according to the new denominations.\n\nBut it may be observed, that the imposition of coinage rendering the value of the coin greater than the value\nvalue of the bullion, that circumstance gives a certain latitude in fixing the new denominations of the coin, so as to avoid minute fractions. For, providing the deviation from the exact proportion shall fall within the advanced price of the coin, no advantage can be taken by melting down one species preferably to another; since, in either case, the loss incurred by melting the coin must be greater than the profit made upon selling the bullion. The mint price of the metals, however, may be fixed exactly, that is, within the value of a farthing upon a pound of fine silver or gold. This is easily reckoned at the mint; although upon every piece in common circulation the fractions of farthings would be inconvenient.\n\n15. That notwithstanding of the temporary variations made upon the denomination of the gold and silver coins, all contracts formerly entered into, and all stipulations in pounds, shillings, and pence, may continue to be acquitted according to the old denominations of the coins, paying one-half in gold and one-half in silver: unless in the case where a particular species has been stipulated; in which case, the sums must be paid according to the new regulation made upon the denomination of that species, to the end that neither profit or loss may result to any of the parties.\n\n16. That notwithstanding the alterations on the mint price of the metals, and in the denomination of the coins, no change shall be made upon the weight of the particular pieces of the latter, except in the case of a general re-coining of one denomination at least: that is to say, the mint must not coin new guineas, crowns, &c. of a different weight from those already in currency, although by so doing the fractions might be avoided. This would occasion confusion, and the remedy would cease to be of any use upon a new change in the proportion of the metals. But it may be found convenient, for removing the small fractions in shillings and sixpences, to recoin such denominations altogether, and to put them to their integer numbers of twelve and of six pence, without changing in any respect their proportion of value to all other denominations of the coin: this will be no great expense, when the bulk of the silver coin is put into 5 shilling pieces.\n\nBy this method of changing the denominations of the coin, there never can result any alteration in the value of the pound sterling; and although fractions of value may now and then be introduced, in order to prevent the abuses to which the coin would otherwise be exposed by the artifice of those who melt it down, yet still the inconvenience of such fractions may be avoided in paying, according to the old denominations, in both species, by equal parts. This will also prove demonstratively, that no change is thereby made in the true value of the national unit of money.\n\n17. That it be ordered, that shillings and sixpences shall only be current for 20 years; and all other coins, both gold and silver, for 40 years, or more. For ascertaining which term, there may be marked, upon the reverse of the coin, the last year of their currency, in place of the date of their fabrication. This term elapsed, or the date effaced, that they shall have no more currency whatsoever; and, when offered in payment, may be received as bullion at the actual price of the mint, or refused, at the option of the creditor.\n\n18. That no foreign coin shall have any legal currency, except as bullion at the mint price.\n\nBy these and the like regulations may be prevented,\n\n1. The melting or exporting of the coin in general.\n2. The melting or exporting one species, in order to sell it as bullion at an advanced price.\n3. The profit in acquiring obligations preferably in one species to another.\n4. The degradation of the standard, by the wearing of the coin, or by a change in the proportion between the metals.\n5. The circulation of the coin below the legal weight.\n6. The profit that other nations reap by paying their debts more cheaply to Great Britain than Great Britain can pay her's to them.\n\nAnd the great advantage of it is, that it is an uniform plan, and may serve as a perpetual regulation, compatible with all kinds of denominations of coins, variations in the proportion of the metals, and with the imposition of a duty upon coinage, or with the preserving it free; and further, that it may in time be adopted by other nations, who will find the advantage of having their money of account preserved perpetually at the same value, with respect to the denominations of all foreign money of account established on the same principles.—But for a fuller discussion of this subject we must refer our readers to Mr Wheatley's Essay on the Theory of Money and Principles of Commerce, London 1827; and to a Treatise on the Coins of the Realm, in a letter to the king, by the Earl of Liverpool, London 1805.\n### A TABLE OF COINS\n\n**Showing the Quantity of Fine Metal contained in them.**\n\nThe number of grains of fine metal in every coin is sought for in the regulations of the mint of the country where it is coined, and is expressed in the grains in use in that mint. From that weight it is converted into those of other countries according to the following proportions:\n\n- **3840 Troy grams**, 5192.8 Paris grams, 5192.8 Holland aces or grains, and 4649.06 Colonias grams, are supposed to be equal weights; and the coins in the Table are converted according to those proportions.\n\n#### Table of Coins reduced to Grains of fine Metal according to the Troy, Paris, Colonia, and Holland weights.\n\n| Gold Coins | Troy | Paris | Colonia | Holland |\n|------------|------|-------|---------|---------|\n| Troy       | Paris | Colonia | Holland |\n| Troy       | Paris | Colonia | Holland |\n\n#### Silver Coins\n\n| Troy | Paris | Colonia | Holland |\n|------|-------|---------|---------|\n\n---\n\n**Dutch Coins, German Coins.**\n\n| French Coins | English Coins |\n|--------------|---------------|\n| Troy         | Troy          |\n| Paris        | Colonia       |\n| Colonia      | Holland       |\n| Troy         | Troy          |\n| Paris        | Colonia       |\n| Colonia      | Holland       |\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The table provides conversions between different coin systems (Troy, Paris, Colonia, and Holland) for both gold and silver coins.

And this being the case of some very extraordinary persons, their example gave so much reputation to retirement, that the practice was continued when the reason of its commencement ceased. After the empire became Christian, instances of this kind were numerous; and those whose security had obliged them to live separately and apart, became afterwards united into societies. We may also add, that the mystic theology, which gained ground towards the close of the third century, contributed to produce the same effect, and to drive men into solitude for the purposes of enthusiastic devotion.\n\nThe monks, at least the ancient ones, were distinguished into *solitaries*, *cænobites*, and *farabaites*.\n\nThe solitary are those who live alone, in places remote from all towns and habitations of men, as do still some of the hermits. The *cænobites* are those who live in community with several others in the same house, and under the same superiors. The *farabaites* were strolling monks, having no fixed rule or residence.\n\nThe houses of monks again were of two kinds, viz., *monasteries* and *laure*. See Monastery and Laura.\n\nThose we call monks now-a-days are cænobites, who live together in a convent or monastery, who make vows of living according to a certain rule established by the founder, and wear a habit which distinguishes their order.\n\nThose that are endowed, or have a fixed revenue, are most properly called monks, *monachi*; as the Chartreux, Benedictines, Bernardines, &c. The Mendicants, or those that beg, as the Capuchins and Franciscans, are more properly called religious and friars; though the names are frequently confounded.\n\nThe first monks were those of St Anthony; who, towards the close of the fourth century, formed them into a regular body, engaged them to live in society with each other, and prescribed to them fixed rules for the direction of their conduct. These regulations, which Anthony had made in Egypt, were soon introduced into Palestine and Syria by his disciple Hilarius. Almost about the same time, Aones or Eugenius, with their companions Gaddanias and Azyzas, instituted the monastic order in Mesopotamia and the adjacent countries; and their example was followed with such rapid success, that\nthat in a short time the whole east was filled with a lazy set of mortals, who, abandoning all human connexions, advantages, pleasures, and concerns, wore out a languishing and miserable life amidst the hardships of want, and various kinds of suffering, in order to arrive at a more close and rapturous communication with God and angels.\n\nFrom the east this gloomy institution passed into the west, and first into Italy and its neighbouring islands; though it is uncertain who transplanted it thither. St Martin, the celebrated bishop of Tours, erected the first monasteries in Gaul, and recommended this religious solitude with such power and efficacy, both by his instructions and his example, that his funeral is said to have been attended by no less than 2000 monks. From hence the monastic discipline extended gradually its progress through the other provinces and countries of Europe. There were besides the monks of St Basil (called in the East Calogeri, from καλός γέροντος, \"good old man\") and those of St Jerome, the hermits of St Augustine, and afterwards those of St Benedict and St Bernard; at length came those of St Francis and St Dominic, with a legion of others; all which see under their proper heads, BENEDICTINES, &c.\n\nTowards the close of the 5th century, the monks, who had formerly lived only for themselves in solitary retreats, and had never thought of assuming any rank among the sacerdotal order, were now gradually distinguished from the populace, and endowed with such opulence and honourable privileges that they found themselves in a condition to claim an eminent station among the supports and pillars of the Christian community. The fame of their piety and sanctity was so great, that bishops and prelates were often chosen out of their order; and the passion of erecting edifices and convents, in which the monks and holy virgins might serve God in the most commodious manner, was at this time carried beyond all bounds. However their licentiousness, even in this century, was become a proverb; and they are said to have excited the most dreadful tumults and seditions in various places. The monastic orders were at first under the immediate jurisdiction of the bishops, from which they were exempted by the Roman pontiff about the end of the 7th century; and the monks, in return, devoted themselves wholly to advance the interests and to maintain the dignity of the bishop of Rome. This immunity which they obtained was a fruitful source of licentiousness and disorder, and occasioned the greatest part of the vices with which they were afterwards so justly charged. In the 8th century the monastic discipline was extremely relaxed both in the eastern and western provinces, and all efforts to restore it were ineffectual. Nevertheless, this kind of institution was in the highest esteem, and nothing could equal the veneration that was paid about the close of the 9th century to such as devoted themselves to the sacred gloom and indolence of a convent. This veneration induced several kings and emperors to call them to their courts, and to employ them in civil affairs of the greatest moment. Their reformation was attempted by Louis the Meek, but the effect was of short duration. In the 11th century they were exempted by the popes from the authority of their sovereigns, and new orders of monks were continually established; insomuch that in the council of Lateran that was held in the year 1215, a decree was passed, by the advice of Innocent III, to prevent any new monastic institutions; and several were entirely suppressed. In the 15th and 16th centuries, it appears, from the testimonies of the best writers, that the monks were generally lazy, illiterate, profligate, and licentious epicures, whose views in life were confined to opulence, idleness, and pleasure. However, the Reformation had a manifest influence in restraining their excesses, and rendering them more circumspect and cautious in their external conduct.\n\nMonks are distinguished by the colour of their habits into black, white, gray, &c. Among the monks, some are called monks of the choir, others professed monks, and others lay monks; which last are destined for the service of the convent, and have neither clerical nor literature.\n\nCloistered Monks, are those who actually reside in the house; in opposition to extra-monks, who have benefits depending on the monastery.\n\nMonks are also distinguished into reformed, whom the civil and ecclesiastical authority have made masters of ancient convents, and put in their power to retrieve the ancient discipline, which had been relaxed; and ancient, who remain in the convent, to live in it according to its establishment at the time when they made their vows, without obliging themselves to any new reform.\n\nAnciently the monks were all laymen, and were only distinguished from the rest of the people by a particular habit and an extraordinary devotion. Not only the monks were prohibited the priesthood, but even priests were expressly prohibited from becoming monks, as appears from the letters of St Gregory. Pope Syricius was the first who called them to the clericate, on occasion of some great scarcity of priests, that the church was then supposed to labour under; and since that time, the priesthood has been usually united to the monastic profession.\n\nMONK, George, a personage memorable for having been the principal agent in restoring Charles II. to his crown, was descended from a very ancient family, and born in Devonshire in 1633. Being an unprovided younger son, he dedicated himself to arms from his youth, and obtained a pair of colours in the expedition to the Isle of Rhéa; he served afterwards in the Low Countries with reputation, in both King Charles's northern expeditions; and did such service in quelling the Irish rebellion, that he was appointed governor of Dublin, but was supereded by parliamentary authority. Being made major-general of the Irish brigade employed in the siege of Nantwich in Cheshire, he was taken prisoner by Sir Thomas Fairfax, and remained confined in the Tower of London until the year 1649; when, as the means of obtaining liberty, he took the covenant, and accepted a command in the Irish service under the parliament. He obtained the command in chief of all the parliamentary forces in the north of Ireland, where he did signal services, until he was called to account for a treaty made with the Irish rebels; a circumstance which was only obliterated by his future good fortune. He served in Scotland under Oliver Cromwell with such success, that he was left there as commander in chief; and he was one of the commissioners for uniting that kingdom with the new erected commonwealth.\nHe served at sea also against the Dutch; and was treated so kindly on his return, that Oliver is said to have grown jealous of him. He was, however, again sent to Scotland as commander in chief, and continued there five years: when he dissembled so well, and improved circumstances so dexterously, that he aided the desires of a wearied people, and restored the king without any disturbance: for which he was immediately rewarded both with honours and profit: (See BRITAIN, No 194, &c.)—He was created duke of Albemarle, with a grant of 7000l. per annum estate, beside other emoluments; and enjoyed the confidence of his master without forfeiting that of the people. After his death in 1670, there was published a treatise composed by him while he remained prisoner in the Tower, entitled, \"Observations on Military and Political Affairs,\" a small folio.\n\nMONK Fish.

See SIMIA, Mammalia Index.\n\nMONMOUTH, James, Duke of, son to Charles II. by Mrs Lucy Walters, was born at Rotterdam in 1649. Upon the Restoration, he was called over to England, where the king received him with all imaginable joy, created him earl of Orkney (which was changed into that of Monmouth), and he took his seat in the house of peers in the ensuing session of parliament. He married Anne, the heiress of Francis earl of Buccleugh; and hence it came to pass that he had also the title of Buccleugh, and took the surname of Scot, according to the custom of Scotland. In 1668 his father made him captain of his life-guard of horse; and in 1672 he attended the French king in the Netherlands, and gave proofs of bravery and conduct. In 1673 the king of France made him lieutenant-general of his army, with which he came before Maastricht, and behaved himself with incredible gallantry, being the first who entered it himself. He returned to England, was received with all possible respect, and was received chancellor of the university of Cambridge. After this he went to assist the prince of Orange to raise the siege of Mons, and did not a little contribute towards it. He returned to England; and was sent in quality of his father's general, to quell an insurrection in Scotland, which he effected; but soon after he fell into disgrace; for, being a Protestant, he was deluded into ambitious schemes, upon the hopes of the exclusion of the duke of York: he confided against his father and the duke and when the latter came to the throne by the title of James II. he openly appeared in arms, encouraged by the Protestant army; but coming to a decisive battle before he had sufficient forces to oppose the royal army, he was defeated, taken soon after concealed in a ditch, tried for high treason, condemned, and beheaded in 1685, aged 36. See BRITAIN, No 242, 249—265.\n\nMonmouth, the capital of the county of Monmouthshire in England, 129 miles from London.—It has its name from its situation at the conflux of the Monow or Mynwy, and the Wye, over each of which it has a bridge, and a third over the Frothy.—Here was a castle in William the Conqueror's time, which Henry III. took from John baron of Monmouth. It afterwards came to the house of Lancaster, who bestowed many privileges upon the town. Monmouthshire Henry V. fumated of Monmouth, was born. The famous historian Geoffrey was also born at this place. Formerly it gave the title of earl to the family of Carey, and of duke to King Charles the Second's eldest natural son; but now of earl to the Mordaunts, who are also earls of Peterborough. It is a populous and well-built place, and carries on a considerable trade with Bristol by means of the Wye. It has a weekly market, and three fairs.\n\nMonmouthshire, a county of England; anciently reckoned a part of Wales, but in Charles II.'s time taken into the Oxford circuit, and made an English county. It is bounded on the north by Herefordshire, on the east by Gloucestershire, on the south by the river Severn, and on the west by the Welsh counties of Brecknock and Glamorgan. Its extent from north to south is about 30 miles, from east to west 26, and in circumference 110. It is subdivided into six hundreds, and 127 parishes. In 1801, this county contained 8948 houses, and 9903 families. The whole population amounted to 45,182 persons. It sends only three members to parliament, that is, one for Monmouth, and two for the county. The air is temperate and healthy; and the soil fruitful, though mountainous and woody. The hills feed sheep, goats, and horned cattle; and the valleys produce plenty of grass and corn. This county is extremely well watered by several fine rivers; for, besides the Wye, which parts it from Gloucestershire, the Mynow, which runs between it and Herefordshire, and the Runney, which divides it from Glamorganshire, it has, peculiar to itself, the Usk, which enters this county a little above Abergavenny, runs mostly southward, and falls into the Severn by the mouth of the Elbith; which last river runs from north to south, in the western side of the county. All these rivers, especially the Wye and Usk, abound with fish, particularly salmon and trout.\n\nMONOCEROS, Unicorn, in Astronomy, a southern constellation formed by Hevelius, containing in his catalogue 19 stars, and in the Britannic Catalogue 31.\n\nMONOCEROS.

Originally it had, as its name implies, only one string; but it is better constructed with two; for, by means of this additional string, we have an opportunity of judging of the harmony of two tempered notes in every possible variety of temperament.\n\nThe reader who may wish for further information respecting the construction and use of monochords, may consult the appendix to Mr Atwood's Treatise on Reciprocating Motion, and Mr Jones's observations on the scale of music, monochord, &c. in his Physiological Disquisitions.\n\nMonochord is also used for any musical instrument that consists of only one string or chord; in this sense the trumpet marine may properly be called a monochord.\n\nMONOCULUS, a genus of insects of the order of aptera.

The air of this country is very temperate; the land fertile in pastures and all the necessaries of life, being watered by several rivers. The inhabitants are rich in black cattle, which they value more than gold. They have a vast number of elephants, as appears from the great quantity of ivory that is exported from thence. There is also a considerable trade in gold dust.—The inhabitants are lovers of war, which is the employment followed by all those who do not apply themselves to commerce. This country is divided into seven provinces or petty kingdoms, vassals to the king; viz. Monomotapa Proper, Quivievo, Manica, Inhambana, Inhemiri, Sabia, and Sofala.\n\nMONOPETALOUS, in Botany, a term applied to flowers that have only one petal or flower-leaf.\n\nMONOPHYSITES, (from μονος, solus, and φυσις, natura), a general name given to all those sectaries in the Levant who only own one nature in Jesus Christ; and who maintain, that the divine and human nature of Christ were so united as to form only one nature, yet, without any change, confusion, or mixture of the two natures.\n\nThe Monophysites, however, properly so called, are the followers of Severus, a learned monk of Palestine, who was created patriarch of Antioch in 513, and Petrus Fulensis.\n\nThe Monophysites were encouraged by the emperor Anastasius, but deprecated by Justin and succeeding emperors. However, this sect was restored by Jacob Baradaeus an obscure monk, insomuch that when he died bishop of Edessa, A.D. 588, he left it in a most flourishing state in Syria, Melopotamia, Armenia, Egypt, Nubia, Abyssinia, and other countries. The laborious efforts of Jacob were seconded in Egypt and the adjacent countries, by Theodosius bishop of Alexandria; and he became so famous that all the Monophysites of Monophysites, the east considered him as their second parent and founder, and are to this day called Jacobites, in honour of their new chief. The Monophysites are divided into two sects or parties, the one African, the other Asiatic; at the head of the latter is the patriarch of Antioch, who resides for the most part in the monastery of St Ananias, near the city of Merdin: the former are under the jurisdiction of the patriarch of Alexandria, who generally resides at Grand Cairo, and are subdivided into Copts and Abyssinians. From the 15th century downwards, all the patriarchs of the Monophysites have taken the name of Ignatius, in order to show that they are the lineal successors of Ignatius, who was bishop of Antioch in the fifth century, and consequently the lawful patriarch of Antioch. In the 17th century, a small body of the Monophysites in Asia abandoned for some time the doctrine and institution of their ancestors, and embraced the communion of Rome: but the African Monophysites, notwithstanding that poverty and ignorance which exposed them to the seductions of sophistry and gain, stood firm in their principles, and made an obstinate resistance to the promises, pretensions, and attempts employed by the papal missionaries to bring them under the Roman yoke: and in the 18th century, those of Asia and Africa have persisted in their refusal to enter into the communion of the Romish church, notwithstanding the earnest entreaties and alluring offers that have been made from time to time by the pope's legates, to conquer their inflexible constancy. The Monophysites propagate their doctrine in Asia with zeal and assiduity, and have not long ago gained over to their communion a part of the Nestorians, who inhabit the maritime coasts of India.\n\nMONOPOLY, one or more persons making themselves the sole masters of the whole of a commodity, manufacture, and the like, in order to make private advantage of it, by selling it again at a very advanced price. Or it is a license or privilege allowed by the king for the sole buying and selling, making, working, or using anything whatsoever.—Monopolies had been carried to an enormous height during the reign of Queen Elizabeth; and were heavily complained of by Sir Edward Coke, in the beginning of the reign of King James I.; but were in great measure remedied by statute 21 Jac. I. c. 3., which declares such monopolies to be contrary to law, and void; (except as to patents, not exceeding the grant of 14 years, to the authors of new inventions;) and except also patents concerning printing, faltpetre, gunpowder, great ordnance, and hot;) and monopolists are punished with the forfeiture of treble damages and double costs, to those whom they attempt to disturb; and if they procure any action, brought against them for these damages, to be stayed by any extrajudicial order, other than of the court wherein it is brought, they incur the penalties of praemunire. Combinations also among victuallers or artificers, to raise the price of provisions, or any commodities, or the rate of labour, are in many cases severely punished by particular statutes; and, in general, by statute 2 and 3 Edward VI. c. 15., with the forfeiture of 10l. or 20 days imprisonment, with an allowance of only bread and water for the first offence; 20l. or the pillory for the second; and 40l. for the third, or else the pillory, loss of one ear, and perpetual infamy. In Vol. XIV.

They\nallowed of two wills in Christ, considered with regard\nto the two natures; but reduced them to one, by\nreason of the union of the two natures; thinking it ab-\nsurd there should be two free wills in one and the same\nperson. They were condemned by the sixth general\ncouncil in 682, as being supposed to destroy the per-\nfection of the humanity of Jesus Christ, depriving it of\nwill and operation.

See Montreal.\n\nMONRO, Dr Alexander, senior, a celebrated\nphysician and anatomist, was the son of Mr John Mon-\nro who was for some years a surgeon in the army under\nKing William in Flanders, and who afterwards settled\nas a surgeon in Edinburgh. The subject of this bio-\ngraphical sketch was born in London in 1697.\n\nHe showed an early inclination to the study of phy-\nsic; and the father, after giving him the best educa-\ntion that Edinburgh then afforded, sent him successively\nto London, Paris, and Leyden, to improve himself\nfurther in his profession. At London, he attended the\nlectures of Mr Hawksbee and Whiston on experi-\nmental philosophy, and the anatomical demonstrations\nof Mr Cheleden. At Paris, he attended the hospitals,\nand the lectures on the different branches of physic and\nsurgery; and, towards the end of autumn 1718, he\nwent to Leyden, and studied under the great Boer-\nhaave.\n\nOn his return to Edinburgh in autumn 1719,\nMr Drummond and Macgill, who were then con-\njunct nominal professors and demonstrators of anatomy\nto the Surgeons Company, having resigned in his fa-\nvour, his father prevailed on him to read some public\nlectures on anatomy, and to illustrate them by showing\nthe curious anatomical preparations which he had made\nand sent home when abroad. He at the same time per-\nsuaded Dr Alton, then a young man, to give some\npublic lectures on botany. Accordingly, in the begin-\nning of the winter 1720, these two young professors be-\ngan to give regular courses of lectures, the one on the\nmateria medica and botany, the other on anatomy and\nsurgery; which were the first regular courses of lectures\non any of the branches of medicine that had ever been\nread at Edinburgh, and may be looked upon as the\nopening of that medical school which has since acquired\nsuch great reputation all over Europe.\n\nIn summer 1721 and 1722, Dr Monro, by the per-\nsuasion of his father, read some lectures on chirurgical\nsubjects, particularly on wounds and tumors, which he\nnever would publish, having written them in a hurry\nand before he had much experience; but inserted from\ntime to time the improvements he thought might be\nmade in surgery, in the volumes of Medical Essays and\nObservations to be hereafter mentioned.\n\nAbout the year 1720, his father communicated to\nthe physicians and surgeons at Edinburgh, a plan which\nhe had long formed in his own mind, of having the dif-\nferent branches of physic and surgery regularly taught\nat Edinburgh; which was highly approved of by them,\nand by their interest regular professorships of anatomy\nand medicine were instituted in the university. His son,\nDr Monro, was first made university professor of ana-\ntomy; and two or three years afterwards, Dr Sinclair,\nRutherford, Innes, and Plummer, were made professors\nof medicine; the professorship of materia medica and\nbotany, which Dr Alton then held, having been added\nto the university many years before. Immediately after\nthese gentlemen were elected professors, they began to\ndeliver regular courses of lectures on the different\nbranches of medicine, and they and their successors have\nuniformly continued to do every winter.\n\nThe plan for a medical education at Edinburgh was\nstill incomplete without an hospital, where students could\nsee the practice of physic and surgery, as well as hear\nthe lectures of the professors. A scheme was therefore\nproposed by Dr Monro's father, and others, particular-\nly the members of the Royal College of Physicians and\nBoard of Surgeons, for raising by subscription a fund\nfor building and supporting an hospital for the reception\nof diseased poor; and our author published a pamphlet\nsetting forth the advantages that would attend such an\ninstitution. In a short time a considerable sum of money\nwas raised, a small house was fitted up, and patients\nwere admitted into it, and regularly attended by many\nof the physicians and surgeons in town. The fund for\nthis charity increasing very considerably, in a great\nmeasure from the activity and influence of that very\nworthy citizen and magistrate George Drummond, Esq.,\nthe foundation was laid of the present large, commodi-\nous, and useful hospital, the Royal Infirmary; in the\nplanning of which Dr Monro suggested many useful\nhints, and in particular the elegant room for chirurgical\noperations was designed and executed under his direc-\ntion. Provost Drummond and he were nominated the\nbuilding committee; and the fabric was entirely com-\npleted in a short space of time. It has since been so\nlargely endowed, as to be capable of receiving a great\nnumber of diseased poor, whose cases the students of\nphysic and surgery have an opportunity of seeing daily\ntreated with the greatest attention and care by physici-\nans and surgeons eminent in their profession; and a re-\ngister of the particulars of all the cases which have been\nreceived\nreceived into the house since its first opening, has been kept, in books appropriated for that purpose, for the use of the students.\n\nIn order to make the hospital of still farther use to the students, Dr Monro frequently, while he continued professor of anatomy, gave lectures on the chirurgical cases; and Dr Rutherford, then professor of the practice of physic, began, in the year 1748, to deliver clinical lectures, to be continued every winter, on the most remarkable cases in the hospital.\n\nDr Monro, though he was elected professor of anatomy in the year 1721, was not received into the university till the year 1725, when he was induced along with that great mathematician the late Mr Colin MacLaurin, with whom he ever lived in the strictest friendship. From this time he regularly every winter gave a course of lectures on anatomy and surgery, from October to May, upon a most judicious and comprehensive plan: A talk in which he persevered with the greatest assiduity; and without the least interruption, for near 40 years; and so great was the reputation he had acquired, that students flocked to him from the most distant corners of his majesty's dominions.\n\nIn 1759, our professor entirely relinquished the business of the anatomical theatre to his son Dr Alexander, who had returned from abroad, and had assisted him in the course of lectures the preceding year. But after this resignation, he still endeavoured to render his labours useful to mankind, by reading clinical lectures at the hospital for the improvement of the students; of which Dr Duncan, who was one of his pupils, has given the following account. \"There I had myself the happiness of being a pupil, who profited by the judicious conduct of his practice, and was improved by the wisdom and acuteness of his remarks. I have indeed to regret that I attended only the last course of lectures in which he had ever a share, and at a time when he was subjected to a disease which proved at length fatal. Still, however, from what I saw and from what I heard, I can venture to assert, that it is hardly possible to conceive a physician more attentive to practice, or a preceptor more anxious to communicate instructions. His humanity, in the former of these characters, led him to bestow the most anxious care on his patients while they were alive; and his zeal in the latter induced him to make them the subject of useful lessons when they happened to die.—In the different stations of physician, of lecturer, and of manager in the hospital, he took every measure for inquiring into the causes of diseases by dissection.—He personally attended the opening of every body; and he not only dictated to the students an accurate report of the dissection, but with nice discrimination contrasted the diseased and sound state of every organ. Thus, in his own person, he afforded to the students a conspicuous example of the advantages of early anatomical pursuits, as the happiest foundation for a medical superstructure. His being at once engaged in two departments, the anatomical theatre and clinical chair, furnished him with opportunities both on the dead and living body, and placed him in the most favourable situation for the improvement of medicine; and from these opportunities he derived every possible advantage which they could afford.\"\n\nHis father, old Mr Monro, lived to an advanced age; and enjoyed the unspeakable pleasure of beholding a Monro, esteemed and regarded by mankind, the principal actor in the execution of his favourite plan, the great object of his life, the founding a seminary of medical education in his native country: The son, who survived him near 30 years, had the satisfaction to behold this seminary of medical education frequented yearly by 300 or 400 students, many of whom came from the most distant corners of his majesty's dominions, and to see it arrive to a degree of reputation far beyond his most sanguine hopes, being equalled by few, and inferior to none, in Europe.\n\nDr Monro was not only very active in the line of his own profession, but as a citizen and general member of the community; for, after he had resigned the anatomical chair to his son, he executed with the strictest punctuality the duties of several engagements both of a civil and political nature: He was a director of the Bank of Scotland, a justice of the peace, a commissioner of high roads, &c. At length, after a life spent in the most active industry, he became afflicted with a tedious and painful disease, which he bore with equal courage and resignation till his death, which happened on July 12, 1767, in the 70th year of his age.\n\nOf his works, the first in order is his Osteology, which was written for the use of students, but is capable also of affording instruction to the oldest and most experienced practitioner; as, besides a minute description of the parts copied from nature, it everywhere abounds with new and important observations immediately applicable to practice. It has been translated into many different languages; has passed through numerous editions; and has been reprinted in foreign countries in the most superb manner, accompanied with elegant and matterly engravings. His description of the Lacteal Suck and Thoracic Duct contains the most accurate account of that important part of the body which has been yet published; and his Anatomy of the Nerves will transmit to posterity an excellent example of accurate dissection, faithful description, and ingenious reasoning. The six volumes of Medical Essays and Observations, published by a society in Edinburgh, are universally known and esteemed. To that society he was appointed secretary; but, after the publication of the first volume, to which he had largely contributed, the members growing remiss in their attendance, he became the sole collector and publisher of the work: To him we are therefore in a great measure indebted for those numerous and important discoveries with which this publication has enriched every department of medical knowledge. In the two first volumes of the Physical and Literary Essays, published by the physical society of Edinburgh, in which he had the rank of one of the presidents, we find several papers written by him, which are not the least ornaments of that collection. His account of the Success of Inoculation in Scotland may be considered as his last publication: It demonstrates his extensive correspondence and indefatigable industry, and has had great influence in promoting that salutary practice. Besides these, he was also the author of several other elegant and matterly productions, which were either never published, or were published without his knowledge and from incorrect copies. A collection of all his works, properly arranged, corrected, and illustrated with copperplates, has been published by Dr Alexander.\nAlexander Monro, his son and successor in the anatomical chair, in a splendid quarto volume, printed for Elliot, Edinburgh, 1781; to which is prefixed a life of the author, by another of his sons, Dr Donald, physician in London. The observation of an excellent judge, the illustrious Haller, concerning our author's Medical Essays and Observations, which now form a part of this collection, may with no less justice be applied to the whole: \"It is a book which ought to be in the possession of every medical practitioner.\"\n\nMONS, an ancient, large, handsome, rich, and very strong city of the Austrian Netherlands, in Hainault. There is a chapter, consisting of 30 ladies of distinction, who have the liberty of leaving the community when they intend to marry. They have several manufactures, and a good trade. It was taken by the allies in 1709, and by the French in July 1746; but rendered back by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, after the fortifications were demolished. It stands partly on a hill, and partly on a plain in a marshy soil, on the rivers Haine and Trouilli, by which the country about it may be overflowed at pleasure. It was taken by the French in 1794.

In the petitions presented to the sovereign courts, they used the term Meffigneurs.\n\nMonseigneur, absolutely used, was a title restrained to the dauphin of France. This custom was unknown till the time of Louis XIV. before which the dauphin was styled Monfeur le Dauphin.\n\nMONFELEMINES, a people inhabiting that part of Biledulgerid, which borders on the territories of the emperor of Morocco. They are a mixed race, descended from the ancient Arabs and fugitive Moors. Their country extends from about 90 miles beyond Cape Non, to the distance of 60 miles from St Croix. It is mostly fertile; and, with little cultivation, produces the necessaries of life. A number of streams water the plains, which abound with fig, date, palm, and almond trees. The gardens produce excellent grapes, which the Jews convert into brandy after they have been dried by the Arabs.\n\nThe Monfelemine territory is very populous, and would be much more so, were it not for the almost continual wars in which the people are engaged against the emperor of Morocco; for, as this country is the retreat of the rich Moors, who wish to fly from the tyranny of the emperor, they are too well acquainted with the Moorish customs to be surprised by that prince. As soon as a Moorish army takes the field, the inhabitants mount their horses, and occupy the passes of the mountains; while the women and slaves retire to the interior parts of the country, or to the desert, if they are hard pressed. Their horses, which they break in an admirable manner, are said to be the best in the Monfeur world; obedient to the voice of their master, and allowing no stranger to mount them.\n\nThe people derive their name and origin from one Mofeilaama, who was contemporary with Mahomet. They respect the prophet, as do other Mahometans; but neither believe that he was infallible, nor that his descendants are all inspired by God, nor that their will should be a law, nor that such faith is necessary in order to be a good Mahometan. The influence of their high priest is nearly despotic; for though he has no troops, he may command the nation, and peace and war depend upon his will. He has no property, yet every thing is at his disposal; he requires nothing from any, yet all are disposed to give him.\n\nThe Monfelemines, on Friday, meet in their mosques for prayer, and the same is likewise the day of their principal market, when their goods are exposed to sale in the public squares. They never attempt to make proselytes; and they treat their Christian slaves with humanity, which may perhaps be owing to the avarice of their masters. The Jews are allowed among them, the free exercise of their religion. Polygamy is permitted among them; but the situation of the women is more respectable, and they are not so much secluded as among the Moors, mingling more in society, walking at large, and visiting their friends. The Monfelemine children are brought up with great care, and are not obliged to exhibit proofs of their courage till they can be considered as men.\n\nMONSIEUR, in the plural Meffieurs, a term or title of civility, used by the French in speaking to their equals, or those a little below them, answering to Mr or Sir among the English.\n\nMonsieur, absolutely used, was a title or quality appropriated to the second son of France, or the king's brother. The king was also called Monsieur, but that only by the children of France.\n\nMONSONIA, a genus of plants belonging to the polyadelphia clas. See Botany Index.\n\nMONSOON, a regular or periodical wind, in the East Indies, blowing constantly the same way, during six months of the year, and the contrary way the remaining six.\n\nIn the Indian ocean, the winds are partly general, and blow all the year round the same way, as in the Ethiopic ocean; and partly periodical, i.e. half the year blow one way, and the other half year on the opposite points: and those points and times of shifting differ in different parts of this ocean. These latter are what we call monsoons.\n\nThe shifting of these monsoons is not all at once; and in some places the time of the change is attended with calms, in others with variable winds, and particularly those of China, at ceasing to be westerly, are very subject to be tempestuous; and such is their violence, that they seem to be of the nature of the West India hurricanes, and render the navigation of those seas very unsafe at that time of the year. These tempests the seamen call the breaking up of the monsoons.\n\nMonsoons, then, are a species of what we otherwise call trade winds. They take the denomination monsoon from an ancient pilot, who first crossed the Indian sea by means hereof. Though others derive the name from\nMonster from a Portuguese word, signifying motion or change of wind and sea.\n\nLucretius and Apollonius make mention of annual winds which arise every year, *etefia flabria*, which seem to be the same with what in the East Indies we now call monsoons. For the physical cause of these winds, see Meteorology.\n\n**MONSTER**; a birth or production of a living being, degenerating from the proper and usual disposition of parts in the species to which it belongs: As, when there are too many members, or too few; or some of them are extravagantly out of proportion, either on the side of defect or excess. The word comes from the Latin *monstrum*, of *monstrando*, \"showing.\" Whence also the box wherein relics were anciently kept to be shown, was called *monstrum*. Dugdale mentions an inventory of the church of York with this article, *Item unum monstrum cum offibus sancti Petri in beryl, et crucifixo in summitate*.\n\nAristotle defines a monster to be a defect of nature, when, acting towards some end, it cannot attend to it, from some of its principles being corrupted.\n\nMonsters do not propagate their kind; for which reason some rank *mules* among the number of monsters, as also hermaphrodites.\n\nFemales which bring forth twins, are found most liable to produce monsters. The reason, probably, is owing to this; that though the twins are covered with one common chorion, yet they have each their separate amnios, which by their contiguity may chance to grow together, and so occasion a confusion or blending of the parts. Hence so many double creatures.\n\nVarious theories have been proposed by philosophers and physiologists to account for the production of monsters. But after all, it must be confessed, that we are very little acquainted with those deviations from the ordinary course of nature. For each organized being there appears to exist a primitive germ or model of the different species drawn by the Creator, determined by forms and sexes, and realized in the individuals of both sexes, which must unite in order to their reproduction. From this model nature never departs, unless when compelled by circumstances which derange the primitive organization common to the species, and produce what are called monsters.\n\nWith respect to structure, monsters are of various kinds. Some have an excess or defect in certain parts; such as those which are called *acephalons*, or who want the head; those which have two heads, two arms, two legs, and one body, or which have two bodies and one head, or which have three legs; and those which want the arms or the legs. Others err through an extraordinary and deformed conformation, through an unnatural union of certain parts or viscera, through a great derangement in one or more of their members, and through the extraordinary place which these often occupy in consequence of this derangement or transposition. The monster described by Dr Eller of the academy of Berlin was of this kind. It was a fetus of nine months, 28 inches long, with an enormous head and frightful countenance; and in the middle of a broad and vast forehead it had a reddish eye, without either eyebrows or eyelids, and sunk deep into a square hole. Immediately below this eye was an excrescence which strongly resembled a penis with a glans, a prepuce, and an urethra: the part covered with hair was likewise below the nape of the neck. In other monsters we meet with the unnatural union of some parts, which, from their definition and functions, ought always to be separate; and the separation of other parts, which, for the same reasons, ought constantly to be united. The reader may see the different ways in which the formation of monsters takes place, in four memoirs by M. Lemy, inserted in *L'Histoire de l'Academie des Sciences*, 1738 and 1739. M. du Verney has likewise published a memoir on the same subject.\n\nIn the volume published by the Academy of Sciences in 1724, mention is made by M. Geoffroy of a monster born in Barrois 1722. This monstrous production consisted of two children without the inferior extremities, joined together by a common navel; each of them had a nurse, sucked, and eat pay; and the one fucked while the other slept. The reader may likewise consult the second part of Winiford's Memoirs on Monsters, inserted in the volume published by the Academy of Sciences in 1734, where he will find the history of two very extraordinary twin monsters, who evidenced during their life a great difference in their moral and physical qualities. We are obliged simply to refer to these Memoirs, as they are too long for abridgement.\n\nIt is observed by Haller, that in some monsters the natural structure is changed by some shock or passion; in others the structure, independent of any accident is originally monstrous; such as when all the members are reversed from left to right, when the person has six fingers, and in many other instances. M. de Maupeu mentions, that there is at Berlin a family who have had six fingers on each hand for several generations. M. de Riville saw an instance of this at Malta, of which he has given a description. M. Renou, surgeon at Pommerye in Anjou, has published an account of some families with six fingers, which are to be found in several parishes of the Lower Anjou, and which have existed there from time immemorial. This deformity is perpetuated in these families even when they intermarry with persons who are free from it. Whether the propagation of these supernumerary organs, which are not only useless but inconvenient and even disagreeable, be owing to the father or mother, their children of both sexes are subject to it indiscriminately. A father or mother with six fingers frequently have a part, and sometimes the whole, of their children, free from this deformity; but it again makes its appearance, and in a very great degree, in the third generation. From this it appears, that this fault in the conformation is hereditary. M. Reaumur has likewise published the history of a family in the island of Malta, the children of which are born with six fingers and six toes. But it deserves to be inquired, whether these supernumerary fingers are real fingers? The reader may here consult the *Journal de Physique* for November 1774, p. 372. This variety of *sexdigitary* hands and feet is not comprehended in the *Recherches sur quelques conformations monstrueuses des doigts dans l'homme*, which is inserted in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1771. In the *Journal de Physique* for August 1776, we find a description of a double uterus and vagina observed in a woman who died in childbirth, by Dr Purcell of Dublin: and in that for June 1788,\nwe have an account of a man with seven fingers on each hand, by Baron Dietrich.\n\nSeveral monstrous productions are to be seen in the cabinet at Chantilly. 1. Two calves joined together in the body, with each a separate head and neck, and four legs in whole. 2. Two calves united only by the pelvis, with only one anus and one tail; the whole is supported by six legs, four before and two behind. 3. A lamb with six legs, four of which are behind. 4. The skeleton of a ram, which has likewise six legs. 5. A hermaphrodite deer. 6. The head of a foal, which has only one eye in the middle of the forehead. 7. Some leverets with six and eight legs. 8. A puppy, the lips of which are divided fourfold. 9. Some fetuses of a hog which have a kind of tube upon their forehead one or two inches long; and another, the hinder part of which is double in every thing. 10. Two double human fetuses joined by the belly, with four arms and three legs. 11. A young chicken with two bodies and one head. 12. A pigeon and a duck, each with two bills. 13. A duck with two heads. 14. A pigeon with four feet. 15. A capon with three feet; the third being fixed to the anus. 16. Two heads of a calf joined together, each of them with two ears; these two heads were both fixed to one neck. 17. In the Menagerie at Chantilly there was formerly to be seen a cow with five feet, the fifth of which was connected with the dug. 18. A rabbit without ears. 19. Two cats, each having two heads. 20. Two leverets newly brought forth, well shaped in the body and legs, but connected together by means of only one head. 21. Several eggs, in the figure of which there occur some monstrous appearances and extraordinary deformities, sufficient to show that they are contrary to the established form of nature.\n\nMr. Home, surgeon, some time ago presented to Mr. John Hunter, the double skull of a child, born at Calcutta in May 1783 of poor parents aged 30 and 35, and which lived to be nearly two years old. The body of this child was naturally formed; but the head had the phenomenon of appearing double; another head of the same size, and almost equally perfect, being attached to its upper part. In this extraordinary and preternatural head no pulsation could be felt in the arteries of the temples, but the superficial veins were very evident; one of the eyes had been hurt by the fire, upon which the midwife, in her first alarm, threw the child; the other moved readily; but the iris was not affected by the approach of any thing to it. The external ears of this head were very imperfect; the tongue adhered to the lower jaw, except for about half an inch at the lip, which was loose; the jaw was capable of motion, but there were no teeth. The child was shown about the streets of Calcutta for a curiosity; but was rendered unhealthy by confinement, and died at last of a bite of the colra de capelo. It was dug up by the East India Company's agent for salt at Tumlock, and the skull is now in the museum of Mr. Hunter.\n\nAmong the monstrous productions of the animal kingdom, we may rank those individuals which ought only to possess one sex, but in which we observe the union or the appearance of two. See the articles ANDROGYNES and HERMAPHRODITE.\n\nM. Fabri arranges mutilations of the members, distortions, gibbosities, tumors, divisions of the lips or mouth of the palate, compressions of the cranium, and many other deformities of this kind, in the class of morbid monstrosities. In that which he calls connotural (connoturale) monstrosities, are placed the plurality, transposition, and infertion of the parts. To explain these facts, a great many writers have had recourse to the effect of the imagination of pregnant women.\n\nThe causes of the first class of monstrosities are difficultly defined by M. Fabri, who observes, that some of them are internal with regard to the mother, and others external. By an internal cause he here means all those depravations or morbid principles which can affect the fluids, and which vitiate the form and structure of the folds; in particular the uterus, in which such deprivations have often been found to occur. To these he adds violent affections of the mind, spasmodic contractions, hysterical convulsions, and the many inconveniences of this kind to which women are extremely subject. External causes comprehend everything which can act externally upon the fetus contained in the uterus, such as the pressure of the clothes; and in short everything which prevents the free dilatation of the belly in women that are pregnant, violent motions, falls, blows, and all accidents of this kind. These external causes, and especially the first, compels the fetus in the womb, and obliges it to remain in a very confined situation. This according to the observation of Hippocrates, produces those embryos which are born with some entire part wounded. M. Fabri maintains, that all deformities of the fetus proceed from some mechanical and accidental causes.\n\nThe name of monsters is likewise given to animals enormous for bulk; such as the elephant among terrestrial quadrupeds, and the shark and the whale among sea animals; to other animals remarkable for fierceness and cruelty; and to animals of an extraordinary species, which, we are told, arises from the copulation of one animal with another of a different genus. According to the report of travellers, Africa abounds with monsters of this kind; and accounts of the East are full of descriptions of sea monsters, which, however are seldom to be seen, such as sea men, mermaids, &c.\n\nMonsters are more common and more extraordinary in the vegetable than in the animal kingdom, because the different juices are more easily deranged and confounded together. Leaves are often seen, from the internal parts of which other leaves spring forth, and it is not uncommon to see flowers of the ranunculus from the middle of which issues a stalk bearing another flower. M. Bonnet informs us, that in certain warm and rainy years he has frequently met with monsters of this kind in rose trees. This observer saw a rose, from the centre of which issued a square stalk of a whitish colour, tender, and without prickles, which at its top bore two flower buds opposite to each other, and totally destitute of a calyx; a little above the buds issued a petal of a very irregular shape. Upon the prickly stalk which supported the rose, a leaf was observed which had the shape of a trefoil, together with a broad flat pedicle. In the memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1797, p. 448, mention is made of a rose, from the centre of the leaves of which issued a rose branch two or three inches long, and furnished\nMontague with leaves. See the same Memoirs for 1729, p. 44, and for 1724, p. 20. In the Memoirs for 1775, a very singular instance is mentioned of a monstrousity observed by M. Dubanet, in an apple tree ingrafted with clay. At the place of the insertion, there appeared a bud which produced a stalk and some leaves; the stalk and the pedicle of the leaves were of a pulpy substance, and had the most perfect resemblance both in taste and smell to the pulp of a green apple. An extraordinary chamomile is mentioned in the Acta Helvetica. M. Bonnet, in his Recherches sur l'usage des feuilles, mentions likewise some monstrous productions which have been found in fruits with kernels, analogous in their nature to those which occur in the flowers of the ranunculus and of the rose tree. He has seen a pear, from the eye of which issued a tuft of 13 or 14 leaves, very well shaped, and many of them of the natural size. He has seen another pear which gave rise to a ligneous and knotty stalk, on which grew another pear somewhat larger than the first.—The stalk had probably flourished, and the fruit had formed. The lilium album polyanthos, observed some years ago at Breslaw, which bore on its top a bundle of flowers, consisting of 102 lilies all of the common shape, is well known. M. Reynier has mentioned some individuals monstrous with respect to the flower, in the Journal de Physique et d'Histoire Naturelle, for November 1785. He has likewise mentioned a monstrous tulip which is seen in the gardens of some amateurs; juniper berries with horns; a ballamine with three spurs, &c.\n\nThese vegetable productions which are so extraordinary, and so contrary to the common course of things, do nevertheless present deviations subject to particular laws, and reducible to certain principles, by distinguishing such as are perpetuated either by seed or by transplanting, from those which seem to be only accidental. Monstruities which are perpetuated exist in the original organization of the seed of the plant, such as marked or curled leaves, &c. The word monster is more properly applied to those irregularities in plants, which arise from frequent transplantation, and from a particular culture, such as double flowers, &c.; but those monstruities which are not perpetuated, and which arise from accidental and transient causes deranging the primitive organization of the plant when it comes to be unfolded, as is the effect of diseases, of heat or cold, of a superfluity or scarcity of juices, of a deprivation of the vessels contributing to nutrition, of the sting of insects, of contusions and natural grafts, retain also the name of monsters. Of this kind are knobs or swellings, fluting, gall nuts, certain freaks, and other similar defects.\n\nMONT-BLANC. See MONT-BLANC.\n\nMONTAGUE, LADY MARY WORTLEY, accompanied her husband who was sent on an embassy to Constantinople in the beginning of the 18th century. On her return she introduced the practice of inoculation into England, and thence acquired great celebrity. She cultivated the belles lettres; and at one period of her life she was the friend of Pope, and at another his enemy. While they were at enmity with each other, Lady Mary Montague embraced every opportunity of defaming the poet, who well knew how to take revenge. Both of them carried their animosity to so great a height, that they became the subject of public Montague conversation. After a long life, full of singular and romantic adventures, she died about the year 1760. From her we have Letters, written during her travels from the year 1716 to the year 1718. They have been translated into French, and published at Rotterdam 1764, and at Paris 1783, one vol. 12mo. They are composed in a lively, interesting, and agreeable style, and contain many curious facts relating to the manners and government of the Turks, which are nowhere else to be found. The Baron de Tott, who lived many years at Constantinople, attacked them with great severity; but they have been defended with equal zeal by M. Guis of Marseille, who has published a valuable work on Turkey. It need not appear extraordinary, that persons who have visited the same country should not see things in the same light. How few travellers agree in their accounts of the same objects, which they nevertheless pretend to have seen and to have examined with attention.\n\nMONTAGUE, Edward Wortley, son of the former, palled through such variegated scenes, that a bare recital of them would favour of the marvellous. From Weftzeller school, where he was placed for education, he ran away three several times. He exchanged clothes with a chimney-sweeper, and he followed for some time that footy occupation. He next joined himself to a fisherman, and cried flounders in Rotherhithe. He then failed as a cabin boy to Spain; where he had no sooner arrived, than he ran away from the vessel, and hired himself to a driver of mules. After thus vagabondizing it for some time, he was discovered by the consul, who returned him to his friends in England. They received him with a joy equal to that of the father of the prodigal son in the gospel. A private tutor was employed to recover those rudiments of learning which a life of dissipation, of blackguardism, and of vulgarity, might have obliterated. Wortley was sent to the West Indies, where he remained some time; then returned to England, acted according to the dignity of his birth, was chosen a member, and served in two successive parliaments. His expenses exceeding his income, he became involved in debt, quitted his native country, and commenced that wandering traveller he continued to the time of his death. Having visited most of the eastern countries, he contracted a partiality for their manners. He drank little wine, a great deal of coffee; wore a long beard; smoked much; and, even whilst at Venice, he was habited in the eastern style. He sat cross-legged in the Turkish fashion through choice. With the Hebrew, the Arabic, the Chaldaic, and the Persian languages, he was as well acquainted as with his native tongue. He published several pieces. One on the \"Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire.\" Another an exploration of \"The Causes of Earthquakes.\" As this gentleman was remarkable for the uncommon incidents which attended his life, the close of that life was no less marked with singularity. He had been early married to a woman who aspired to no higher a character than that of an industrious washerwoman. As the marriage was solemnized in a frolic, Wortley never deemed her sufficiently the wife of his bosom to cohabit with her. She was allowed a maintenance. She lived contented, and was too submissive to be troublesome.\nMontague troublesome on account of the conjugal rites. Mr Montague, on the other hand, was a perfect patriarch in his manners. He had wives of almost every nation. When he was with Ali Bey in Egypt, he had his household of Egyptian females, each striving who should be the happy she who could gain the greatest ascendancy over this Anglo-Eastern barbaw. At Constantinople, the Grecian women had charms to captivate this unsettled wanderer. In Spain a Spanish brunette, in Italy the olive-complexioned female, were solicited to partake the honours of the bridal bed. It may be asked what became of this group of wives? Mr Montague was continually shifting the place, and consequently varying the scene. Did he travel with his wives as the patriarchs did with their flocks and herds? No such thing. Wortley, considering his wives as bad travelling companions, generally left them behind him. It happened, however, that news reached his ears of the death of the original Mrs Montague the washerwoman. Wortley had no issue by her; and without issue male, a very large estate would revert to the second son of Lord Bute. Wortley, owing the family no obligations, was determined, if possible, to defeat their expectations. He resolved to return to England and marry. He acquainted a friend with his intentions; and he commissioned that friend to advertise for any young decent woman who might be in a pregnant state. Several ladies answered it. One out of the number was selected, as being the most eligible object. She waited with eagerness for the arrival of her expected bridegroom; but, behold, whilst he was on his journey, death very impertinently arrested him in his career.\n\nMontague Island, one of the Hebrides, in the South sea, near Sandwich island. E. Long. 168° 37'. S. Lat. 17° 26'.\n\nMontaigne, Michel de, a French gentleman, was born in Perigord in 1533. His father educated him with great care, and made him learn Latin as other children learn their mother tongue. His tutors were Nicholas Gronchi, who wrote De Comitiis Romanorum; William Guerentz, who wrote on Aristotle; George Buchanan; and M. Anthony Muret. He was also taught Greek by way of recreation; and because some think that starting children out of their sleep spoils their understanding, he was awakened every morning with the sound of music. He was counsellor for a while in the parliament of Bordeaux; afterwards made mayor of Bordeaux. He published his Essays, so much known in the world, in 1580. Montaigne had a great deal of wit and subtlety, but no small share of conceit and vanity. The learned and ingenious are much divided in their opinion about his works. He died in 1592.\n\nMontalcino, a small populous town of Italy, in Tuscany, and in the territory of Sienna, with a bishop's see.

They were so called from their leader, the heresiarch Montanus, a Phrygian by birth; whence they are sometimes styled Phrygians and Cata-phyrgians.\n\nMontanus, it is said, embraced Christianity in hopes of rising to the dignities of the church. He pretended to inspiration; and gave out, that the Holy Ghost had instructed him in several points, which had not been revealed to the apostles. Priscilla and Maximilla, two enthusiastic women of Phrygia, presently became his disciples; and in a short time he had a great number of followers. The bishops of Asia, being assembled together, condemned his prophecies, and excommunicated those who dispersed them. Afterwards they wrote an account of what had passed to the western churches, where the pretended prophecies of Montanus and his followers were likewise condemned.\n\nThe Montanists, finding themselves exposed to the censure of the whole church, formed a schism, and set up a distinct society under the direction of those who called themselves prophets. Montanus, in conjunction with Priscilla and Maximilla, was at the head of the sect.\n\nThese sectaries made no alteration in the creed. They only held, that the Holy Spirit made Montanus his organ for delivering a more perfect form of discipline than what was delivered by the apostles. They refused communion for ever to those who were guilty of notorious crimes, and believed that the bishops had no authority to reconcile them. They held it unlawful to fly in time of persecution. They condemned second marriages, allowed the dissolution of marriage, and observed three lents.\n\nThe Montanists became separated into two branches, one of which were the disciples of Proclus, and the other of Aeschines. The latter are charged with following the heterodoxy of Praxes and Sabellius concerning the Trinity.\n\nMontargis, a considerable town of France, in the Orleanais, and capital of the Gâtinois; seated on the river Loire, 62 miles south of Paris.

The greatest care was taken of his education; and at the age of 20 he had actually prepared materials for his Spirit of Laws, by well digested extracts from those immense volumes of civil law which he had studied, not barely as a civilian, but as a philosopher. He became a counsellor of the parliament of Bordeaux in 1714, and was received president à mortier two years after. In 1721 he published his Persian Letters; in which, under the screen of Oriental manners, he satirized those of France, and treated of several important subjects by delicate transient glances: he did not avow this publication; but was no sooner pointed out as the author, than zeal without knowledge, and envy under the mask of it, united at once against the Persian Letters. He was received into the French academy in 1728; and having previously quitted his civil employments, he entirely devoted himself to his genius, and was no longer a magistrate, but a man of letters. Having thus set himself at liberty, he travelled through Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Holland, and England, in which last country he resided three years, and contracted intimacies with the greatest men then alive; for Locke and Newton were dead. The result of his observations was, \"that Germany was fit to travel in, Italy to sojourn in, England to think in, and France to live in.\" On his return he retired for two years to his estate at La Brede, where he finished his work On the Causes of the Grandeur and Declension of the Romans; which appeared in 1734. The reputation acquired by this last work only cleared the way for his greater undertaking, the Spirit of Laws, which was printed at Geneva in 2 vols. 4to, 1750. This was immediately attacked by the adversaries of his Persian Letters, in a multitude of anonymous pamphlets; containing all the reproaches to which a liberal mind is exposed from craft and ignorance. M. Montesquieu drew up a defence of this work; which for truth, moderation, and delicacy of ridicule, may be regarded as a model in its way. This great man was peaceably enjoying that fulness of esteem which his great merits had procured him, when he fell sick at Paris, and died on the 10th of February 1755.—The following character of this great man is drawn by Lord Chesterfield. \"His virtues did honour to human nature, his writings justice. A friend to mankind, he asserted their undoubted and unalienable rights with freedom, even in his own country; whole prejudices in matters of religion and government he had long lamented, and endeavoured, not without some success, to remove. He well knew, and justly admired, the happy constitution of this country, where fixed and known laws equally restrain monarchy from tyranny, and liberty from licentiousness. His works will illustrate his name, and survive him, as long as right reason, moral obligation, and the true spirit of laws, shall be understood, respected, and maintained.\" As to his personal qualities, we are told by his eulogist, M. d'Alembert, that \"he was of a sweet, gay, and even temper. His conversation was spirited, agreeable, and instructive. Nobody told a story in a more lively manner, or with more grace and less affectation. He had frequent absence of mind; but always awakened from it by some unexpected stroke that re-animated the languishing conversation. Though he lived with the great, he retired whenever he could to his estate in the country, and there met his books, his philosophy, and his repose. Surrounded at his leisure hours with peasants, after having studied man in the commerce of the world, he studied him in those simple\nMontezuma—simple people solely instructed by nature. With them he cheerfully conversed; he endeavoured, like Socrates, to find out their genius, and appeared as happy with them as in the most brilliant assemblies; especially when he reconciled their differences, and by his benevolence relieved them from their difficulties.\n\nBesides the works already mentioned, M. Montefrino wrote several small pieces, as the Temple of Genius, Lyfimachus, and an Essay upon Taste, which is left unfinished. His works have been collected since his death, and printed at Paris in a splendid edition, in quarto. They have likewise all of them been translated into English.\n\n**Montezuma**, or **Monteçuma**, was emperor or king of Mexico when Cortez invaded that country in 1518, invited thither, as he pretended, by the inhabitants, whose children Montezuma, in the blindness of his superstition, had sacrificed to his idols. The warlike animals on which the Spanish officers were mounted, the artificial thunder with which they were armed, the wooden castles on which they had crossed the ocean, the armour with which they were covered, the victories which they gained wherever they went; all these circumstances, added to that foolish disposition to wonder which always characterizes a simple people, so operated upon the minds of the Mexicans, that when Cortez arrived at the city of Mexico, he was received by Montezuma as his master, and by the inhabitants as a god. At first they fell down in the streets when a Spanish valet passed by; but by degrees the court of Montezuma grew familiar with the strangers, and ventured to treat them as men. Montezuma, unable to expel them by force, endeavoured to inspire them with confidence at Mexico by expressions of friendship, while he employed secret means to weaken their power in other quarters. With this view, one of his generals, who had private orders to that purpose, attacked a party of the Spaniards who were stationed at Vera Cruz; and, although his troops were unsuccessful, yet three or four of the Spaniards were killed. The head of one of them was carried to Montezuma. In consequence of this, Cortez did what has been reckoned one of the boldest political strokes that ever was performed. He ran to the palace, followed by fifty of his troops; and, by persuasion and threats, carried the emperor prisoner into the Spanish quarters. He afterwards obliged him to deliver up those who had attacked his troops at Vera Cruz; and, like a general who punishes a common soldier, he loaded Montezuma with chains. He next obliged him to acknowledge himself in public the vassal of Charles V.; and, in name of tribute for this homage, Cortez received 600,000 marks of pure gold. Montezuma soon afterwards fell a sacrifice to his submission to the Spaniards. He and Alvaro, the lieutenant of Cortez, were besieged in the palace by 200,000 Mexicans. The emperor proposed to show himself to his subjects, that he might persuade them to desist from the attack; but the Mexicans no longer considered him in any other light but as the slave of foreign conquerors. In the midst of his speech, he received a blow with a stone which wounded him mortally; and he expired soon after, A.D. 1520.—See Cortez. This unfortunate prince left two sons and three daughters, who embraced the Christian faith. The eldest received baptism, and obtained from Charles V. lands, revenues, and the title of count de Montezuma. He died in 1608; and his family is one of the most powerful in Spain.\n\n**Montferrat**, a province of Italy, with the title of a duchy; bounded on the east by the duchy of Milan, and part of the territory of Genoa; on the north, by the Vercellese and Canavese; on the west, by Piedmont properly so called; and on the south by the territory of Genoa, from whence it is separated by the Apennine mountains. It contains 200 towns and castles; and is very fertile and well cultivated, abounding in corn, wine, oil, and silk. It belongs to the king of Sardinia, and Caila is the capital town.\n\n**Montfort**, a town of France, in Upper Bretagne, seated on the River Men, 12 miles from Rennes. W. Long. 1° 58'. N. Lat. 48° 8'.\n\n**Montfort**, a handsome and strong town of the Netherlands, in the United Provinces, with an ancient castle; seated on the river Yssel, seven miles from Utrecht. E. Long. 5° 0'. N. Lat. 52° 4'.\n\n**Montfort**, a town of Germany, in the circle of Swabia, on the confines of Tirol, 16 miles south of Lindau, and the lake Constance. It is capital of a country of the same name, which has been almost all purchased by the house of Austria. E. Long. 9° 51'. N. Lat. 47° 22'.\n\n**Montfort-de-Lemos**, an ancient town of Spain, in the kingdom of Galicia, with a magnificent castle, where the Comarca of Lemos resides. It is seated in a fertile country, 25 miles north-east of Orensa, and 55 south-east of Compotella. W. Long. 7° 9'. N. Lat. 42° 28'.\n\n**Montfort-l'Amuly**, a town in the Isle of France, with the title of a duchy, 25 miles from Paris. E. Long. 2° 50'. N. Lat. 48° 45'.\n\n**Montgatze**, a town of Lower Hungary, in the county of Peczez, with a strong fortress. It is encompassed with a great morass, and art and nature have rendered it almost impregnable. It was defended by the princess Ragotzky, wife of Count Tekeli, when besieged by an army of the imperialists, who were obliged to raise the siege in 1683. E. Long. 21° 55'. N. Lat. 46° 26'.\n\n**Montgeron**, Louis-Basile-Carré de, was born at Paris in 1646; his father was master of inquests. He was scarcely 25 years of age when he purchased the place of counsellor in parliament, where by his wit and external qualifications he gained considerable reputation. Deeply engaged in all the vices which flow from irreligion, he was converted by an extraordinary circumstance. He went on the 7th of September 1731 to the tomb of Deacon Paris, with an intention to examine, with the rigour of the severest critic, the miracles which were reported to be performed there. But, according to his own account, he felt himself suddenly beat to the earth by innumerable flashes of light with which he was surrounded. His incredulity was converted into flaming zeal, and he became the apostle of the saint whom he formerly ridiculed. From that moment he devoted himself to the fanaticism of conversions, with the same impetuosity of character with which he had run into the most shameful excesses. He had not long been the disciple of Janfeinifl when he suffered persecution. When the chamber of inquests was banished in 1732, he was sent into the mountains of Auvergne; which, instead\nMontgeron stead of cooling, tended rather to inflame his zeal.\n\nDuring his exile, he formed the plan of collecting the proofs of the miracles wrought at the tomb of the abbé Paris, and of composing what he called a Demonstration of them. On his return to Paris, he prepared to execute this plan; and on the 29th of July 1737, he actually presented to the king at Versailles a volume in quarto superbly bound. This work he accompanied with a speech, which is a mixture of zeal and argument in a tolerable style. In consequence of this work, which some consider as a masterpiece of eloquence, and others as a mass of absurdities, he was committed to the Baillée. After a few months confinement, he was sent to an abbey of Benedictine monks in the diocese of Avignon; whence he was, in a short time carried to Viviers. He was afterwards confined in the citadel of Valence, where he died, A.D. 1574, aged 68. The work which he presented to the king was entitled La vérité des Miracles opérés par l'intercession de M. Paris, &c., &c.\n\nThe critics, even to this day, seem to be guided in their opinion concerning this book either by hatred or by enthusiasm. \"It would be extremely rash (says the abbé de St Pierre, in the second volume of his Annales, p. 593.) to maintain with the Molinists, that no miraculous cure was ever performed at the tomb of the abbé Paris; and to say with the Janfeinists, that these cures were performed by a supernatural power, would be the height of fanaticism.\" The truth is (adds the same author), that no miracle appears ever to have been performed at this tomb except in the cure of the human body; in all other cases, there would have been the want of that imagination on which the whole miracle depended.\" Thus, although Montgeron ventured to compare these prodigies with the miracles of Jesus Christ and his apostles, yet we find no person raised from the dead, no multiplication of leaves, no command obeyed by the elements, and no blind or deaf restored to their sight or hearing. It belongs to the Author of nature alone, or to those who have derived power from him, to work such miracles as are recorded by the evangelists, or in the history of the apostles. Montgeron added a second and third volume on the same subject; he left also in manuscript a work which he composed in prison contre les Incrédules. Religion, it must be confessed, has had much more powerful advocates. Fortunately Pascal and Bossuet are among the number; and it could well have wanted both Paris and Montgeron, whatever virtues they might possess in other respects.\n\nMONTGOMERY, the capital of a county of the same name in North Wales, 158 miles from London, took its name from Roger de Montgomery earl of Shrewsbury, who built the castle. It is called by the Welsh Tre Valdwin, that is, Baldwin's town; having been built by Baldwin, lieutenant of the marches of Wales, in the reign of William I. The Welsh, after having put the garrison to the sword, demolished it in 1095; but Henry III. rebuilt it, and granted it the privileges of a free borough, with other liberties. It is a large and tolerably well built town, in a healthful situation and fertile soil.\n\nMONTGOMERYSHIRE, a county of North Wales, 40 miles in length and 37 in breadth; bounded on the north by Merionethshire and Denbighshire, on the north-east and east by Shropshire, on the south by Radnorshire and Cardiganshire, and on the west by the last mentioned county and part of Merionethshire. It is divided into six hundreds; and contains five market towns, 47 parishes, and 47,978 inhabitants. It lies in the three several dioceses of St Asaph, Bangor, and Hereford; but sends only two members to parliament, one for the county, and one for the town of Montgomery. The air is pleasant and salubrious; but this county, being extremely mountainous, is not very fertile, except in the valleys, which afford some corn and plenty of pasture; but the south, south-east, and north-east parts, being more level, are extremely fruitful, especially a pleasant vale, watered by the Severn.\n\nMONTH, the twelfth part of a year. See CHRONOLOGY, No. 17.\n\nMonth, in its proper acceptation, is that space of time which the moon takes up in passing from any certain point to the same again, which is called a periodical month; or it is the space of time between two conjunctions of the moon with the sun, which is called a synodical month. That space of time which the sun takes up in passing through one sign or 1/12th part of the zodiac, is also called (but improperly) a month. So that there are two sorts of months; lunar, which are measured by the moon; and solar, which are measured by the sun. The lunar periodical month consists of 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes 5 seconds: The lunar synodical month is 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes 3 seconds and 11 thirds. A solar month contains, upon a mean calculation, 30 days 10 hours 29 minutes 5 seconds.\n\nThe Jews, Greeks, and Romans, made use of lunar synodical months; but, to avoid fractions, they consisted alternately of 29 and 30 days. The former, the Romans called cavi, and the Greeks χαιροι; the latter were termed pleni and πλησια.\n\n1. The Hebrew months were ranged differently in their sacred and in their civil year.\n\nOrder of the Sacred Year.\n\n| 1 Nisan | March |\n| 2 Iair | April |\n| 3 Sivan | May |\n| 4 Thammuz | June |\n| 5 Ab | July |\n| 6 Elul | August |\n| 7 Tifri | September |\n| 8 Mar schevan | October |\n| 9 Cisleu | November |\n| 10 Thebet | December |\n| 11 Sebat | January |\n| 12 Adar | February |\n\nOrder of the Civil Year.\n\n| 1 Tifri | September |\n| 2 Mar schevan | October |\n| 3 Cisleu | November |\n| 4 Thebet | December |\n| 5 Sebat | January |\n| 6 Adar | February |\n| 7 Nisan | March |\n| 8 Iair | April |\n| 9 Sivan | May |\n| 10 Thammuz | June |\n| 11 Ab | July |\n| 12 Elul | August |\n\nThese\nThese months being lunar cannot exactly answer to our solar months; but every Jewish month must be conceived to answer to two of ours, and partake of both.\n\nAs these 12 lunar months consisted only of 354 days, the Jews, in order to bring it nearer to the true year, took care every three years to intercalate a 13th month into the number, which they called Ve-adar, or the second Adar. The new moon was always the beginning of the month; and it is said the Jews had people posted on elevated places, to give notice to the Sanhedrim as soon as she made her appearance: after this proclamation was made by sound of trumpet, and \"the feast of the new moon, the feast of the new moon,\" resounded amongst the people.\n\nThe ancient Hebrew months were of 30 days each, excepting the last, which consisted of 35; so that the year contained 365 days, with an intercalary month at the end of 120 years, which, by absorbing the odd hours which remained at the conclusion of each year, brought it back nearly to its proper place. This regulation of the year was borrowed from the Egyptians.\n\n2. The months of the Athenian year, as we have before observed, consisted alternately of 29 and 30 days. The first month, according to Meton's reformation of the calendar, began with the first new moon after the summer solstice, and was called Hecatombaion, answering to the latter half of June, and the former half of July. The order of the months, with the number of days in each, are as follow:\n\n| Month          | Days |\n|----------------|------|\n| Hecatombaion   | 30   |\n| Metageitirion  | 29   |\n| Boedromion     | 30   |\n| Menaechterion  | 29   |\n| Panonion       | 30   |\n| Anthesterion   | 29   |\n| Poseideon      | 30   |\n| Gamelion       | 29   |\n| Elephbolion    | 30   |\n| Munichion      | 29   |\n| Thargelion     | 30   |\n| Scirophorion   | 29   |\n\nEach month was divided into three decades of days called ἑκατονταῖς. The first was called ἡμέραι ἀρχῆς or ἐπιφάνειας, or the decade of the beginning of the month; the second was ἡμέραι μέσης, or the decade of the middle; and the third was ἡμέραι τελευταίας, πανορμίας, or ἐπιφάνειας, the decade of the expiring month.\n\nThe first day of the first decade was termed ἐπιφάνεια, because the first month began with the new moon; the second day was ἐπιφάνεια ἐπιφάνειας; the third ἐπιφάνεια ἐπιφάνειας, &c. The first day of the second decade was ἐπιφάνεια ἐπιφάνειας, the second ἐπιφάνεια ἐπιφάνειας, &c.—the days of this decade were also called ἐπιφάνεια ἐπιφάνειας, ἐπιφάνεια ἐπιφάνειας, &c. The first day of the third decade was ἐπιφάνεια ἐπιφάνειας; the second was ἐπιφάνεια ἐπιφάνειας, &c. i.e. the first, second, &c. after 20, because the last decade began on the 20th day. This decade was also counted by inversion thus: ἐπιφάνεια ἐπιφάνειας the 20th, ἐπιφάνεια ἐπιφάνειας the 22d, ἐπιφάνεια ἐπιφάνειας the 23d, and so of the rest to the last day of the month, which was called ἐπιφάνεια ἐπιφάνειας, the old and the new, because one part of that day belonged to the old and the other to the new moon; but after the time of Demetrius, the last day of the month was called from him Δημήτριος; it sometimes was named ἐπιφάνειας.\n\nThe Grecian months, thus consisting of 29 and 30 days alternately, fell short of the solar year 11 days 6 hours. To remedy this defect, the cycle of four months, called ἐπιφάνειας, was invented.—In this cycle, after the first two years, they added an intercalated month called ἐπιφάνειας, consisting of 22 days; and again, after the expiration of two years more, they inserted another month of 23 days, the fourth part of a day having in the space of four years amounted to a whole day. See Year.\n\n3. The Roman year under Romulus consisted of 10 months only, and began with March, which contained 31 days; then followed April which had 30, May 31, June 30, Quintilis 31, Sextilis 30, September 30, October 31, November 30, December 30. These 10 months containing no more than 304 days, this account was in a short time found to be deficient. Numa Pompllius, therefore, took away one day from each of these six months, April, June, Sextilis, September, November, December; and to the six days thus obtained he added 51, which was the number that Romulus's year, in his opinion, wanted to make it perfect. Numa had now 57 days to dispose of; he therefore divided them, and constituted two other months, January and February; the former consisting of 29 and the latter of 28 days. The month of January, which he placed at the winter solstice, he made instead of March to begin the year. Thus Numa's year consisted of 355 days: but this being found 10 days 6 hours short of the solar year, he made use of the intercalation of 90 days at the expiration of eight years perpetually; which number, being made up of the 11 days and a quarter, kept the year pretty well to its place. The beginning of the year in Julius Cæsar's time had anticipated its true place 67 whole days: these he intercalated between November and December: so that the year consisted, for this one time, of 15 months or 445 days. This reformation was called the Julian correction, and this year the year of correction. At the end of 12 years, by the ignorance of priests, who did not understand intercalation, 12 days had been intercalated for nine. This was observed by Augustus Cæsar, and rectified, by ordering 12 years to pass without any intercalary days. The order and succession of months was the same as that of Numa: But January, March, May, Quintilis, Sextilis, October, and December, had each 31 days; April, June, September 30, and February, in common years, 28; but every fourth year or bissextile 29. This, with a very little difference, is the account observed at present. Quintilis, in compliment to Julius Cæsar was called July, because in this month he was born; and Sextilis, in honour of Augustus, was called August; both which names are still continued.—See Year.\n\nEach month by the Romans was divided into kalends, nones, and ides, all of which were reckoned backwards. The kalends were the first day of the month. The nones fell on the seventh, and the ides on the 15th, of March, May, July, October—but in all other months the nones were on the fifth, and the ides on the 13th. For the more easy comprehension of the Roman manner of dating, according to this division of the months, here follows a table.\nN. B. Every leap year, February consisting of 29 days, the 24th and 25th of that month are written sexto Kal. Mart.; hence leap year is called Bifiscitilis.\n\nMONTIA, a genus of plants belonging to the triandra class, and in the natural method ranking with those of which the order is doubtful. See Botany Index.\n\nMONTINIA, a genus of plants belonging to the dioica class. See Botany Index.\n\nMONTMEDIE, a small but strong town of France, in Luxemburg, seated on the river Chire, which divides it into the upper and lower towns. It is 22 miles south-east of Sedan, 27 south-west of Luxemburg, and 135 north-east of Paris. E. Long. 5° 23'. N. Lat. 49° 32'.\n\nMONTMORENCI, François Henry de. See Luxemburg.\n\nMONTMORENCY, a town of France, with the title of a duchy, remarkable for the tombs of the dukes of this name. It is seated on a hill, near a large valley, fertile in fruits, especially excellent cherries. E. Long. 2° 24'. N. Lat. 48° 59'.\n\nMONTPELIER, one of the finest towns of France, and the most considerable in the department of Hérault, excepting Thoulouse, is situated in E. Long. 3° 58'. N. Lat. 43° 37'. This town has been long famous for its salubrious air, and on this account has been the frequent resort of invalids. But the climate, according to some Montpellier travellers, is considerably changed, having at times continual rains for three months together, and often very thick fogs. Its situation, though on an eminence, never could be healthy; for between it and the Mediterranean (which is about three leagues distant) it is one continued marsh, covered with noxious vapours, which, when the sea breeze sets in, blows directly on the town and the country adjacent; of the sad effects of which, its unhealthy inhabitants, with their meagre looks, are the most convincing proofs.\n\nThis city stands upon a rising ground fronting the Mediterranean; on the other side is an agreeable plain, extending about the same distance towards the mountains of the Cevennes. It is reckoned well built, yet the streets are in general narrow and the houses dark. The inhabitants, many of whom are Protestants, are supposed to amount to 40,000, are sociable, gay, and good tempered. The trade of Montpellier is very extensive in wine, cordials, oil, verdigris, and saltpetre; and the manufactures in silk and woollen goods are considerable. The markets are well supplied with fish, poultry, butcher's meat, and game, at reasonable rates. The wine of the country is strong and harsh: Burgundy is dear, and so is sweet wine of Frontignan, though made in the neighbourhood of Cette. Liquors of various sorts are compounded and distilled at Montpelier. The environs are extremely pleasant, having on one side La Place de Peyrou, which forms a fine terrace. From thence on a clear day, may be seen to the eastward the Alps, which form the frontiers of Italy; to the south-west, the Pyrenean mountains, which form those of Spain, both at about 50 leagues distant; and to the northward a most extensive view of the Mediterranean. Not far from thence is a noble aqueduct, with a double tier of arches; by this, water is brought from a mountain at three leagues distance, into two basins in a small elegant temple at the west end of the town. Here also is a royal garden, where on certain days public lectures were formerly held on botany. On the other side of the town is the esplanade, a beautiful walk, bordered on each side by olive trees, from whence there is a pleasing prospect of the sea and the country adjacent to the town. Previous to the revolution, Montpelier had a university, an academy of sciences, and it was the see of a bishop.\n\nMONTREAL, an island of North America, in the river St Lawrence, nine leagues in length, and three leagues broad, and about 60 miles above Quebec. It was taken from the French by generals Amherst and Murray on the 8th of September 1760. The soil of the island is exceedingly rich and good, producing all kinds of European fruits and vegetables in great abundance, with variety of garden fruits. The south side is the most inhabited, and of course best cultivated; and besides the settlements, which are numerous, the island is adorned with villas, for the retirement of the more wealthy merchants during the summer season. Since this place has been in the possession of Britain, it has suffered much by fires, the houses being mostly built of wood.\n\nThe town of Montreal, situated on this island, and formerly called Ville Marie, is the second place in Canada for extent, buildings and strength; and besides possessing the advantage of a less rigorous climate, for delightfulness.\nMontreal delightfulness of situation is infinitely preferable to Quebec. It stands on the side of a hill, sloping to the south, with many agreeable villas upon it, which, with the island of St Helen, and the river (which is here about two miles broad), form a most charming landscape. Though the city is not very broad from north to south, it covers a great length of ground from east to west, and is nearly as large and populous as Quebec. The streets are regular, forming an oblong square; the houses well built, and in particular the public edifices, which far exceed those of the capital in beauty and commodiousness; the residence of the knights hospitaliers being extremely magnificent.—There are several gardens within the walls, in which, however, the proprietors have consulted more than elegance, particularly those the Sisters of the Congregation, the Nunnery Hospital, the Recollets, Jesuit Seminary, and Governor. The number of inhabitants is said to be between 5000 and 6000. By the situation of the place, the inhabitants are well supplied with all kinds of river fish, some of which are unknown to Europeans, being peculiar to the rivers and lakes of this country. They have likewise plenty of black cattle, horses, hogs, and poultry. The neighbouring shores supply them with a great variety of game in the different seasons; and the island abounds with springs of good water and numerous rivulets. The trade in furs is considerable, and vessels of 200 tons can come up to the town.\n\nMontreal, a town of Spain, in the kingdom of Aragon, with a castle, seated on the river Xiloca, 25 miles north-west of Tervilla, and 40 south-east of Calatanda.—W.

N. Lat. 49. 59.\n\nMontrose, a handsome town of North Britain, in the shire of Angus, situated at the mouth of the river Esk, on the German ocean, 46 miles north-east of Edinburgh. The houses are neat, and many of them in the modern taste. The most remarkable public buildings are, the town-house, the church, and an elegant episcopal chapel.—Montrose is a parliament town, and a dukedom in the family of Graham. It stands between two rivers, the south and north Esk, over the latter of which there is a handsome stone bridge, and over the former there is one of wood. The salmon fisheries on these rivers are very extensive, and form a considerable branch of commerce. The harbour is a fine semicircular basin defended by a handsome stone pier. A great number of trading vessels belong to this port. The population of Montrose in 1801 amounted to nearly 8000.—W. Long. 2. 32. N. Lat. 36. 40.\n\nMontrose, Marquis of. See Graham; and Britain, No. 137, 138, 143, 265.\n\nMontserrat, a mountain of Spain, in Catalonia, one of the most singular in the world for situation, shape, and composition. It stands single, towering over a hilly country like a pile of grotto work or Gothic spires; and its height so great, that to a beholder on the top the neighbouring mountains appear to be sunk to a level with the plain. It is composed of steep rocks, Montserrat, which at a distance seem indented; whence it is said to have received the name Montserrat from the Latin word serrae, a \"saw.\" It is impossible to describe the beauty, richness, and variety, of the landscapes discovered from the most elevated point; but the extensiveness of the prospect may be conceived by the reader, upon being told that the islands of Minorca and Majorca, which are at the distance of 60 leagues, are discovered from this elevation.\n\nMontserrat is particularly famous for the adoration that is paid to an image of the Virgin, which according to tradition was found in a cave in this mountain by some shepherds in the year 880. Over this image, Guthred earl of Barcelona caused a monastery and chapel to be erected; but after remaining in this receptacle upwards of 700 years, Philip II. and Philip III., built a magnificent church for its reception. Innumerable and astonishing miracles are ascribed to this holy image. The convent or monastery is situated in a nook of the mountain; it seems as if vast torrents of water, or some violent convulsion of nature, had split the eastern face of Montserrat, and formed in the cleft a sufficient platform to build the monastery upon. The river Llobregat roars at the bottom, and perpendicular walls of rock of prodigious height, rise from the water edge near half way up the mountain. Upon these masses of white stone rests the small piece of level ground which the monks inhabit. Close behind the abbey, and in some parts impending over it, huge cliffs shoot up in a semicircle to a stupendous elevation: their summits are split into sharp cones, pillars, pipes, and other odd shapes, blanched and bare; but the interstices are filled up with forests of evergreen and deciduous trees and plants. Fifteen hermitages are placed among the woods; nay, some of them on the very pinacles of the rocks, and in cavities hewn out of the loftiest of these pyramids.\n\nThe monastery is one of the 45 religious houses of the Spanish congregation of the order of St Benedict; their general chapter is held every fourth year at Valladolid, where the deputies choose abbots and other dignitaries for the ensuing quadrennium. In this monastery, they elect for abbot a Catalan and a Castilian alternately. Their possessions are great, consisting of nine villages lying to the south of the mountain; but the king has lately curtailed their income about 6000 livres a year, by appropriating to his own use the best house in each village, some of which, with their tithes, are worth 200 dollars per annum. Their original foundation, in 866, gave them nothing but the mountain; and to donations and economy they owe the great increase of their landed property. They are bound to feed and harbour for three days all poor pilgrims that come up and pay their homage to the Virgin; and the allowance is a luncheon of bread in the morning, as much more, with broth at noon, and bread again at night. Sometimes, on particular festivals, 7000 persons arrive in one day; but people of condition pay a reasonable price for what they eat.—The number of professed monks, according to Mr Swinburne, is 76 (according to M. Bourgonane 60); of lay brothers, 28; and of singing boys 25; besides physician, surgeon, and servants. The church is a gloomy edifice; and the gilding is much fulfilled with the\nMontserrat, the smoke of 85 lamps of silver, of various forms and sizes, that hang round the cornice of the sanctuary. Funds have been bequeathed by different devotees for furnishing them with oil. The choir above stairs is decorated with the life of Christ, in good wooden carving. A gallery runs on each side of the chancel, for the convenience of the monks. A large iron grate divides the church from the chapel of the Virgin, where the image stands in a niche over the altar, before which burn four tapers in large silver candlesticks, the present of the duke of Medina Celi. In the sacristy, and passages leading to it, are presses and cupboards full of relics and ornaments of gold, silver, and precious stones; they point out, as the most remarkable, two crowns for the virgin and her son, of inestimable value; some large diamond rings; an excellent cameo of Medusa's head; the Roman emperors in alabaster; and the sword of St Ignatius. But as no offerings to this miraculous statue can be rejected or otherwise disposed of, the thieves are crowded with most whimsical ex votos, viz. silver legs, fingers, breasts, ear rings, watches, two wheeled chaises, boats, carts, and such like trumpery.\n\nOn different parts of the mountain, as already noticed, are a number of hermitages. Each of these solitary retreats, which at a distance seem destitute of every thing, has a chapel, a cell, a well in the rock, and a little garden. The inhabitant of one of them, which is dedicated to St Beneto, has the privilege of making an annual entertainment on a certain day; on which day all the other hermits are invited, when they receive the sacrament from the hands of the mountain vicar, and after divine service dine together. They meet also at this hermitage, on the days of the saints to which their several hermitages are dedicated, to say mass and commune with each other. But at other times they live in a very solitary and recluse manner, perform various penances, and adhere to very rigid rules of abstinence; nor do they ever eat flesh; nor are they allowed to keep within their walls either dog, cat, bird, or any living thing, lest their attention should be withdrawn from heavenly to earthly affections. Most of these hermits are said to be persons of fortune and family, disquieted with the world, who have retired thither to devote themselves to meditation, self-denial, and contrition.\n\nMontserrat, one of the Caribbee isles, belonging to Great Britain. It is a very small, but very pleasant island, so called by Columbus from its resemblance to the famous mountain near Barcelona in Catalonia. It lies in W. Long. 6° 10' N. Lat. 16° 50', having Antigua to the north-east, St Christopher's and Nevis to the north-west, and Guadaloupe lying south south-east at the distance of about nine leagues. It is about nine miles in diameter, and is supposed to contain about 40,000 or 50,000 acres. The climate is warm, but less so than in Antigua, and is esteemed very healthy. The surface is mountainous, but with pleasant, rich, and fertile valleys; the hills are covered with cedars and other fine trees. Here are all the animals as well as vegetables and fruits that are to be found in the other islands. The inhabitants raised formerly a considerable quantity of indigo. The produce now is chiefly cotton, rum, and sugar. There is no good harbour, but three tolerable roads, at Plymouth, Old Harbour, and Ker's Bay.\n\nMONUMENT, in architecture, a building destined Monument to preserve the memory, &c. of the person who raised it, or the person for whom it was raised; such are a mausoleum, a triumphal arch, a pyramid, &c.\n\nMOOD, or MODE.

See GRAMMAR.\n\nMOON, (Luna), in astronomy, one of the heavenly bodies, usually ranked among the planets; but with more propriety accounted a satellite, or secondary planet.\n\nAmong the ancients, the moon was an object of prime regard.—By the Hebrews she was more regarded than the sun, and they were more inclined to worship her as a deity. The new moons, or first days of every month, were kept as festivals among them, which were celebrated with sound of trumpets, entertainments, and sacrifices. (See Num. xviii. 11. x. 16. I Sam. xx. 5-18.) People were not obliged on these days to rest. The feasts of new moons were a miniature representation of the feast of trumpets, which was held on the fifth of the month Tishri, which was the beginning of the civil year. The Jews not being acquainted with the physical cause of eclipses, looked upon them, whether of sun or moon, as signs of the divine displeasure. The Grecians looked upon the moon as favourable to marriage; and the full moons, or the times of conjunction of sun and moon, were held the most lucky seasons for celebrating marriages; because they imagined the moon to have great influence over generation. The full moon was held favourable for any undertakings by the Spartans: And no motive could induce them to enter upon an expedition, march an army, or attack an enemy, till the full of the moon. The moon was supposed both by Greeks and Romans to preside over child-birth.—The patricians at Rome wore a crescent on their shoes, to distinguish them from the other orders of men. This crescent was called Lunula. Some say it was of ivory, others that it was worked upon the shoe, and others that it was only a particular kind of fibula or buckle.\n\nFor the astronomical phenomena connected with the moon, see ASTRONOMY Index.\n\nHarvest Moon.—It is remarkable, that the moon, during the week in which she is full in harvest, rises sooner after sunset than she does in any other full moon week in the year. By doing so, she affords an immediate supply of light after sunset, which is very beneficial to the farmers for reaping and gathering in the fruits of the earth; and therefore they distinguish this full moon from all the others in the year, by calling it the harvest moon.\n\nInfluence of the Moon on the Human Body.—The famous Dr Mead was a believer in the influence of the sun and moon on the human body, and published a book to this purpose, entitled De Imperio Solis ac Lune in Corpore humano; but this opinion has been exploded by most philosophers, as equally unreasonable in itself, and contrary to fact. As the most accurate and sensible barometer is not affected by the various positions of the moon, it is not thought likely that the human body should be affected by them. Several learned and ingenious men, however, still consider Dr Mead's doctrine as far from being unfounded.\n\nMoon, Influence of, on the Earth's Atmosphere.—It\nMoon has been the opinion of the vulgar in almost all ages and countries, that the changes which take place in the state of our atmosphere, or the changes of the weather, depend in a great measure on certain situations of the moon. This particular opinion is alluded to by Virgil (a), and is applied in the shepherd of Banbury's rules for judging of the weather (b). We have, under Meteorology, No. 90 to 92, given the result of some observations on the connection between the changes of the moon and those of the weather.\n\nIt can scarcely be doubted that an opinion so generally received must be founded on something more than fancy or prejudice and; indeed the observations of several eminent meteorologists within the last thirty years have contributed materially to favour this opinion. Independent of actual observation, it appears reasonable to infer, that a body so large, and so near the earth, as the moon, whose gravitating influence on the earth's surface in producing the flux and reflux of the sea, cannot be altogether inactive with respect to the air, a fluid much more susceptible of changes than the sea.\n\nWe have already noticed (Meteorology, No. 14.) the theory of Mr Luke Howard, on the moon's influence on the mercury of the barometer, and we are now to give a short account of what has been advanced on her general influence by the philosophers of the continent. Among these, Signor Toaldo may be said to have led the way.\n\nFrom observations made at Padua, during fifty years, on the state of the weather that corresponded to certain changes of the moon, he found that these changes were always accompanied by good or bad weather; and he at length became enabled to foretell with some degree of certainty what would be the state of the atmosphere that should follow any situation of the moon. There are ten situations of the moon, which, according to Toaldo, are capable of producing a sensible effect on the earth's atmosphere. These are the syzygies* or new and full moon; the quadratures; the apsides, or apogee and perigee; the lunifices, or those points when the moon is nearest to our zenith and at the greatest distance from it; and the moon's equinoxes. There are three different relations of the moon's motion producing a corresponding number of revolutions, each having a certain duration, and each corresponding to some of the above ten situations, as it will be seen by the following table.\n\n| Revolutions | Situations |\n|-------------|-----------|\n| 1. Synodical, in regard to the sun; continues 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes. | New moon. First quarter. Full moon. Last quarter. |\n| 2. Anomalistic, in regard to the moon's course; continues 27 days 13 hours 43 minutes. | Apogee. Perigee. |\n\nPeriodically, in regard to the moon's passing the equator; continues 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes.\n\nSig. Toaldo has calculated a series of probabilities that a change of weather will take place on the approach of any one of these ten situations, and these he has expressed in a tabular form as follows.\n\n| That a change will take place at | New moon | First quarter | Full moon | Last quarter | Perigee | Apogee | Ascending equinox | Descending equinox |\n|----------------------------------|----------|--------------|-----------|--------------|--------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|\n|                                  |          |              |           |              |        |        | Northern lunifice | Southern lunifice  |\n|                                  |          |              |           |              |        |        | Descending equinox | Southern lunifice  |\n\nIn general, each of the ten situations changes the weather that prevailed under the preceding situation, and it seldom happens that a change of weather takes place without a corresponding change in the lunar situations. From the inequality of their revolutions, these situations are often combined, and by this union their effect in producing changes of the atmosphere is greatly increased, especially when a union takes place between the syzygies and apsides. Thus,\n\n| That a change will follow | New moon with perigee | Ditto with apogee | Full moon with perigee | Ditto with apogee |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|\n|                           |                       |                   |                       |                   |\n\nThese combined situations are generally accompanied or followed by storms and tempests, especially when they take place near the moon's passage over the equator. This is more particularly the case in the months of March and September, and we find that at the new and full moon in these months, the weather takes a certain character, by which it is distinguished for the succeeding three or six months. The same takes place at the solstices, especially at the winter solstice. The new moon does not always, however, produce a change of weather; and this want of effect is most likely to happen at those new moons which are most distant from the apsides.\n\nThough Toaldo considers it as perfectly ascertained that each succeeding situation of the moon alters that state of the atmosphere which had been produced by the preceding situation; it must, however, be observed that some situations of the moon favour good and others bad weather. Thus the perigee, the new and full moon, the passage over the equator, and the northern lunifice are favourable to bad weather, while the apogee\n\n---\n\n(a) \"lunaeque sequentes Ordine respiciens; nunquam te craftina fallet Hora, neque infidili noctis capiere ferent.\" Georg. I. 424.\n\n(b) 1. Horns of the moon obscure—Rain.\n2. When the moon is red—Wind.\n3. On the fourth day of the new moon, if bright, with sharp horns—No winds nor rain till the month be finished.\nMoon. quadratures, and southern lunisice, are more favourable to good weather.\n\nThe changes produced by the influence of the lunar situations, seldom take place on the exact days on which these situations happen, but either precede or follow them; and Toaldo has found that, in the six winter months, the changes of weather commonly precede the lunar situations, whereas in the six summer months they more commonly follow them.\n\nThere are certain days before and after new and full moon, which deserve particular attention in forming our judgements of the weather, especially the octants or the fourth day before new and full moon, as at these times the weather is inclined to change, and it may be pretty certainly predicted, that a change will follow at the next lunar situation. Virgil has particularly noticed this fourth day as a sure mark of the succeeding weather (c). If the weather continues unchanged on the fourth, fifth, and sixth day of the moon, it proves that the lunar influence is at that time very weak, and we are to expect no change till the full moon, or perhaps till the next new moon.\n\nSig. Toaldo compared a diary which he had kept for many years of the state of the barometer with the ten situations of the moon, and from the comparison deduced the following conclusions, viz.\n\n1. That at the time of the moon's apogee, the mercury rises higher by the sixth part of a line than at the perigee.\n2. That at the time of the quadratures it is higher by the tenth of a line than at the time of the syzygies.\n3. That it is higher by a fourth of a line at the southern than at the northern lunisice. This correspondence of the lunar situations with the ascent of the mercury in the barometer does not hold at the time of the moon's passage through her equinoctial points. The mercury is then higher, especially when she is passing in Libra; and as such situations of the moon generally indicate bad weather, this circumstance is not conformable to meteorological observations.\n\nIn this case Toaldo thinks that we must be guided, in our judgement of the weather, rather by the moon than by the barometer.\n\nThe case is similar during the coincidence of the equinoctial points with the perigee, at which time the mercury is unusually high; but this coincidence is a sign of great irregularity.\n\nAccording to Toaldo, the rising and setting of the moon, as well as its superior and inferior passage of the meridian, all which situations he calls the moon's angles, may serve for foretelling rain. The seasons most exposed to rain, are the rising and setting of the moon; while its passage over the meridian is most favourable to good weather. It has ever been observed that during rainy days, the sky always clears a little while the moon is passing the meridian. An exception to this rule must, however, be made when the moon's angle does not coincide with that of the sun.\n\nVol. XIV. Part I.\n\n(c) Luna revertentes cum primum colligit ignes,\nSi nigrum obfuro comprehenderit aeris cornu;\nMaximus agricolis pelagoque parabitur imber.\nAt, si virgineum suffuderit ore ruborem,\nVentus erit; vento semper rubet aurea Phœbe.\n\nBad years take place when the apsides of the moon fall in the four cardinal points of the zodiac. Their intervals, therefore, are as four to five, eight to nine, &c. or as the intervals of the passage of the apsides through the four cardinal points of the zodiac. Thus the year 1777 was, in general, a bad year; and in that year the apsides of the moon were in the equinoctial signs; and it is probable that the years in which the apsides fall in the signs Taurus, Leo, Virgo and Aquarius, will be good and moderate years, as the year 1776 really was; and in that year the apsides of the moon were in Taurus and Virgo.\n\nEvery 18th year must be similar. We, however, cannot depend upon a return altogether the same, on account of the three different revolutions of the moon; and therefore it may happen, that the epoch of this extraordinary year may be retarded a year or perhaps two. Though approximations only are here given, this does not prevent their being useful to farmers, if they only pay attention to circumstances. Besides, various exceptions must be made for different parts of the earth; and it is difficult to determine these beforehand, as what regards this system is applicable to the whole globe; but when the result of the system has been improved by local observations, the conjectures for each country will be attended with more certainty.\n\nThe 54th year must have a greater similarity to the first than to all the rest; because, at this period, the situations of the moon, in regard to the sun and the earth, are again found in the same points.\n\nThe quantity of the rain which falls in nine successive years, is almost equal to that which falls in the next following nine. But this is not the case when we compare in like manner the quantity of rain which falls in six, eight, or ten years*.\n\nThe observations of M. Lamarck, though they confirm the opinion of the moon's general influence on the atmosphere, do not agree with those of Toaldo, as to the situations of that luminary which correspond to the changes of the weather. He could not find that agreement between the syzygies and quadratures of the moon and a change of weather, which has been so much dwelt on by Toaldo; but he is of opinion, that we are to consider the declination of the moon as the principal cause of her influence on the atmosphere.\n\nLalande had conceived the idea that when the moon entered the northern hemisphere, or had north declination, the weather was most likely to be cold and dry, and that when she passed to the south of the equator, it was likely to be rainy. The observations of Lamarck, however, tend to establish the contrary opinion.\n\nLamarck considers the two following principles as established by his observations; viz.\n\n1. That it is in the elevation of the moon above, and her depression below, the equator that we are to search for those regularly varied effects which she produces on our atmosphere.\n2. That the determinable circumstances, which con-\n\n* See Phil. Mag. vol. iii.\n\nSin ortu in quarto (namque est certissimus auctor)\nPura, neque obtusis per coelum cornibus ibit;\nTotus et ille dies, et qui nascentur ab illo\nExactum ad menem, pluvia ventilique carebunt.\n\nSee Note (B)\n\nGeorg. I 427.\nspire to increase or diminish the moon's influence in her different declinations, are her apogees and perigees, her conjunctions with and oppositions to the sun; and lastly, the solar solstices and equinoxes.\n\nConsidering that every lunar month, or every revolution of the moon in the zodiac, may be divided into two distinct portions, each containing about fourteen days, and each giving occasion to a particular atmospheric constitution, we may assume these as two circumstances of importance in meteorology, and we may call one the boreal or northern constitution, viz. that in which the moon passes through the six northern signs of the zodiac, and the other, the austral or southern constitution, viz. that in which she traverses the six southern signs.\n\nLamarck is convinced by observation, that in these climates, during a boreal constitution, there chiefly prevail southerly, south-westerly, and westerly winds, though sometimes, in the summer, the winds pass to the south-east. In general, during this constitution, the barometer exhibits only moderate elevations of the mercury; most commonly the season is rainy or moist, and the air loaded with clouds. And lastly, it is particularly during this constitution that we observe the effects of storms and tempests, when the causes which occasion them become active.\n\nOn the contrary, during an austral constitution, the winds which chiefly predominate blow from the north and north-west, and in the summer north-east, and even easterly winds. In general during this constitution, the barometer exhibits considerable elevations in the column of mercury, at least if the wind is not very strong; the weather is then most usually clear, cold and dry, and in the summer it is seldom (we might almost say never) during this constitution that storms are formed.\n\nThese atmospheric constitutions are not, however, so permanently characterized as to render it easy to distinguish them at all times by the state of the atmosphere. The atmospheric air is a moveable fluid, and so easily displaced, that it is not surprising that in the temperate zones, where the influence of the heavenly bodies acts less strongly than between the tropics, from various causes, that counteract very often the regular influence of the moon, and tend to mask and even change its effects.\n\nThe perturbations which these variable causes produce on the regular effects of the influence of the moon on the atmosphere, occasion in fact many variations in the two atmospheric constitutions which we have been describing; and this is doubtless the reason why they have been hitherto disregarded. M. Lamarck positively affirms, that these perturbations, though frequent, and sometimes very considerable, do not prevent the character of each of these constitutions from being remarked in the greatest number of cases.\n\nThe probability that he finds, according to his observations, is estimated at five out of eight; that is to say, out of 48 atmospheric constitutions comprehended in the lunar year, he estimates there will be found at least 30 agreeing with the principles pointed out in his memoir; and he adds, that among the disturbing causes which modify the before-mentioned effects, several may be foreseen, and perhaps even appreciated as to their quantity of effect.\n\nHe considers what is here pointed out as a fact; as an order of things which any one may prove by observation.\n\nLamarck has also endeavoured to ascertain what there may be in the periodical return of the variations of the atmosphere at the end of nineteen years; and he has found, by comparing meteorological observations, that this return is far from being so correct as is generally believed.\n\nAstronomers also know well, that the cycle of nineteen years is not exact within an hour and a half; an error which amounts to a whole day in the course of 368 years.\n\nM. Cotte has also bestowed much attention on this subject of the moon's influence; but appears to think that our observations are not sufficiently numerous or accurate, to deduce any thing like a correct theory, and he is not disposed to go so far as M. Lamarck.\n\nM. Cotte agrees in general with Mr Luke Howard's observations on the moon's influence. (See Meteorology.) He noted, during the space of 34 years and five months, (from the 1st of January 1768, to the 22d of May 1802), the ascending and descending direction of the barometer in each of the syzygies and quarters of the moon which have occurred through that period of time. He states the total sum of the elevations and depressions of the mercury at each of the phases as follows.\n\nFor 34½ Years. New Moon. 1st Quar. Full Moon. 2d Quar.\n\nSum of elevations 218 296 199 290 times.\nDepressions 281 229 279 106\n\nDifferences 63 67 80 84\n\nThese results, of nearly 35 years' observations, confirm, as will be seen, the conclusions drawn by Mr Howard, both from his observations for one year at Plaistow, and those made for 10 years in the Royal Society's apartments.\n\nIt is to be remarked, 1st, That the four numbers which express the differences between the elevations and depressions are nearly in an exact proportion, since 63 : 67 :: 80 : 84.\n\n2ndly, That the two latter phases, viz. the full moon and last quarter, have more effect than the two first.\n\n3rdly, He examined what phases of the moon corresponded to the greatest and least height of the mercury for each month during ten years, and obtained the following results.\n\nFor 10 Years.

The useful purposes which may be thereby answered in philosophy, agriculture, and medicine, may be properly urged to observers as the means of\nMoon-Eyes, among horses, when the weakness of the eye increases or decreases according to the course of the moon; so that in the wane of the moon his eyes are muddy and troubled, and at new moon they clear up.

In his Trial of Selim the Persian, he complimented Lord Lyttleton in an elegant kind of panegyric, couched under the appearance of accusation: and his Fables for the Female Sex, for easy verification, poignant satire, and striking morals, approach nearer to the manner of Gay than any other of the numerous imitations of that author. He wrote also three dramatic pieces; The Gameter, a tragedy; The Foundling, and Gil Blas, comedies. The success of these was not such as they merited, the first of them having met with a cold reception, for no other apparent reason but because it too nearly touched a favourite and fashionable vice; and the second having been condemned for its supposed resemblance to Sir Richard Steele's Conscious Lovers, but to which good judges have been inclined to give it greatly the preference. Mr Moore married a lady of the name of Hamilton, daughter to Mr Hamilton table-decker to the princesses, who had herself a very poetical turn, and has been said to have assisted him in the writing of his tragedy. One specimen of her poetry, however, was handed about before their marriage, and has since appeared in print in different collections of songs, particularly in one called the Goldfinch. It was addressed to a daughter of the famous Stephen Duck; and begins with the following stanza:\n\nWould you think it, my Duck? (for the fault I must own),\nYour Jenny at last is quite covetous grown:\nThough millions if Fortune should lavishly pour,\nI still would be wretched if I had not MORE.\n\nAnd after half a dozen stanzas more, in which, with great ingenuity and delicacy, and yet in a manner that expresses a great affection, she has quibbled on our author's name, she concludes with the following lines:\n\nYou may wonder, my girl, who this dear one can be,\nWhose merit can boast such a conquest as me:\nBut you shan't know his name, tho' I told you before,\nIt begins with an M, but I dare not say MORE.\n\nIn the year 1753, Mr Moore commenced a weekly miscellaneous paper, entitled, The World, by Adam Fitz-Adam, in which undertaking he was assisted by Lord Chesterfield with some essays. This paper was collected into volumes, and Mr Moore died soon after.\n\nMOORING, the act of confining and securing a ship in a particular station, by chains or cables, which are either fastened to the adjacent shore, or to anchors in the bottom.\n\nA ship may be either moored by the head, or by the head and stern; that is to say, she may be secured by anchors before her, without any behind; or the may have anchors out, both before and behind her; or her cables may be attached to posts, rings, or moorings, which answer the same purpose.\n\nWhen a ship is moored by the head with her own anchors, they are disposed according to the circumstances of the place where she lies and the time she is to continue therein. Thus, wherever the tide ebbs and flows, it is usual to carry one anchor out towards the flood, and another towards the ebb, particularly where there is little room to range about; and the anchors are laid in the same manner, if the vessel is moored head and stern in the same place. The situation of the anchors, in a road or bay, is usually opposed to the reigning winds, or those which are most dangerous; so that the ship rides therein with the effort of both her cables. Thus if she rides in a bay, or road, which is exposed to a northerly wind and heavy sea from the same quarter, the anchors passing from the opposite bows ought to lie east and west from each other; hence both the cables will retain the ship in her station with equal effort against the action of the wind and sea.\n\nMOORINGS, in sea language, are usually an assemblage of anchors, chains, and bridles, laid athwart the bottom of a river or haven, to ride the shipping contained therein. The anchors employed on this occasion have rarely more than one fluke, which is sunk in the water near low-water mark. Two anchors being fixed in this manner in the opposite side of the river, are furnished with a chain extending across from one to the other. In the middle of the chain is a large square link, whose lower end terminates in a swivel, which turns round in the chain as about an axis, whenever the ship veers about with the change of the tide. To this swivel link are attached the bridles, which are short pieces of cable, well served, whose upper ends are drawn into the ship at the mooring ports, and afterwards fastened to the masts or cable bolts. A great number of moorings of this sort are fixed in the harbours adjacent to the king's dock-yards, as Deptford, Chatham, Portsmouth, Plymouth, &c.\n\nMOORLANDS, a tract so called, in the north part of Staffordshire, where the land rises gradually into small hills, which run through the midst of England in one continued ridge, rising higher and higher to Scotland, and feeding forth many rivers. The soil here is so foul and cold, that the snows lie almost all the year on the tops of the hills; and it is withal very rugged and barren: it, however, yields plenty of coal, lead, copper, rance-marble, and millstones; and some of the limestone hills bear such a sweet though short grass, as is very grateful to the oxen, of which here is\na very good breed. It is observed here, that the west wind always brings rain, and the east and south fair weather; that though this tract is full of bogs, it is as healthy as any other part of the county; and that it produces the same plants as the Peak of Derby.\n\nMOORS.

Particular times are appointed for the arguing moot cases: the place where this exercise is performed was anciently called moot-hall; and there is a bailiff, or surveyor of the moots, annually chosen by the bench to appoint the moot men for the inns of chancery, and to keep an account of the performance of exercises.

He was consulted by Amphimachus, king of Colophon, who wished to know what success would attend his arms in a war which he was going to undertake. He predicted the greatest calamities; but Calchas, who had been a footslayer of the Greeks during the Trojan war, promised the greatest successes. Amphimachus followed the opinion of Calchas; but the prediction of Mopius was fully verified. This had such an effect upon Calchas, that he died soon after. His death is attributed by some to another mortification of the same nature. The two footslayers, jealous of each other's fame, came to a trial of their skill in divination. Calchas first asked his antagonist, how many figs a neighbouring tree bore? 10,000 except one, replied Mopius, and one single vessel can contain them all. The figs were gathered, and his conjectures were true. Mopius now to try his adversary, asked him how many young ones a certain pregnant sow would bring forth? Calchas confessed his ignorance; and Mopius immediately said that the sow would bring forth on the morrow ten young ones, of which only one should be a male, all black, and that the females should all be known by their white streaks. The morrow proved the veracity of his prediction; and Calchas died by excess of the grief which his defeat produced. Mopius after death was ranked among the gods, and had an oracle at Malta, celebrated for the true and decisive answers which it gave.—Another Mopius, son of Ampyx and Chloris, born at Titarella in Thessaly. He was the prophet and footslayer of the Argonauts, and died at his return from Colchis by the bite of a serpent in Libya.

This is a pile of stone raised pyramidically upon an oblong base or square 267 feet long and 87 wide. On each side is a flight of steps; those at the sides being broader than those at the ends; so that it terminated not in a square of the same figure with the base, but in a ridge like the roof of a house. There were 11 of these steps to one of these morais, each of which was 4 feet high, so that the height of the pile was 44 feet; each step was formed of one course of white coral stone, which was neatly squared and polished; the rest of the mass (for there was no hollow within) consisted of round pebbles, which, from the regularity of their figure, seemed to have been wrought. The foundation was of rock stones, which were also squared. In the middle of the top stood an image of a bird carved in wood, and near it lay the broken one of a fish carved in stone. The whole of this pyramid made part of one side of a spacious area or square 360 feet by 354, which was walled in with stone, and paved with flat stones in its whole extent. About 100 yards to the west of this building was another paved area or court, in which were several small stages raised on wooden pillars about seven feet high, which are called by the Indians evatatas, and seem to be a kind of altars, as upon these are placed provisions of all kinds, as offerings to their gods. On some of them were seen whole hogs, and on others the skulls of about 50, besides the skulls of many dogs. The principal object of ambition among the natives is to have a magnificent morai. The male deities (for they have them of both sexes) are worshipped by the men, and the female by the women; and each have morais, to which the other sex is not admitted, though they have also morais common to both.\n\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY, OR MORALS.\n\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY is, \"The science of manners or duty; which it traces from man's nature and condition, and shows to terminate in his happiness.\" In other words, it is, \"The knowledge of our duty and felicity;\" or, \"The art of being virtuous and happy.\"\n\nIt is denominated an art, as it contains a system of rules for becoming virtuous and happy. Whoever practises these rules, attains an habitual power or facility of becoming virtuous and happy. It is likewise called a science, as it deduces those rules from the principles and connexions of our nature, and proves that the observance of them is productive of our happiness.\n\nIt is an art, and a science of the highest dignity, importance, and use. Its object is man's duty, or his conduct\nduct in the several moral capacities and connexions which he sustains. Its office is to direct that conduct; to show whence our obligations arise, and where they terminate. Its use, or end, is the attainment of happiness; and the means it employs are rules for the right conduct of our moral powers.\n\nMoral Philosophy has this in common with Natural Philosophy, that it appeals to nature or fact; depends on observation; and builds its reasonings on plain uncontroverted experiments, or upon the fullest induction of particulars of which the subject will admit. We must observe, in both these sciences, how nature is affected, and what her conduct is in such and such circumstances: Or, in other words, we must collect the appearances of nature in any given instance; trace these to some general principles or laws of operation; and then apply these principles or laws to the explaining of other phenomena.\n\nTherefore Moral Philosophy inquires, not how man might have been, but how he is, constituted; not into what principles or dispositions his actions may be artfully resolved, but from what principles and dispositions they actually flow: not what he may, by education, habit, or foreign influence, come to be or do, but what, by his nature, or original constituent principles, he is formed to be and do. We discover the office, use, or definition of any work, whether natural or artificial, by observing its structure, the parts of which it consists, their connexion or joint action. It is thus we understand the office and use of a watch, a plant, an eye, or hand. It is the same with a living creature of the rational or brute kind. Therefore, to determine the office, duty, or definition of man; or, in other words, what his business is, or what conduct he is obliged to pursue; we must inspect his constitution, take every part to pieces, examine their mutual relations one to the other, and the common effort or tendency of the whole.\n\nIt has not been thus, however, that the science has always been taught. The earliest moralists did not erect systems upon a just analysis of the powers of the human mind; nor have all those who thought such a foundation necessary to be laid, deduced their theories from the very same principles. As moral truths are not capable of rigid demonstration, it appears to us, that we cannot more properly introduce the system which we have adopted, than by giving our readers a short view of the most celebrated systems that have been maintained by others. They will thus have an opportunity of judging for themselves of the respective merits of the different theories, and of adopting that which shall appear to them to place practical virtue on the firmest basis.\n\nHistory of the Science of Morals.\n\nWhilst there has been a remarkable agreement among the writers on morality, as to the particular actions which are virtuous and those which are vicious; and whilst they have uniformly taught, that it is our duty and our interest to perform the one and to avoid the other; they have yet differed exceedingly concerning the test or criterion of virtue, as well as concerning the principle or motive by which men are induced to pursue it. One cause of this difference in opinion respecting matters of such universal importance, may perhaps be traced to the mistakes into which philosophers are apt to fall concerning the original state of man.\n\nIt is very generally taken for granted, that the first Probable men were savages of the lowest rank, and that the race came of this gradually civilized itself during the course of many variety succeeding ages. Without mutual intercourse, the progress of civilization could never have commenced; and as the practice of justice is absolutely necessary to every species of friendly intercourse, those original savages, it is supposed, must have been just in their dealings, and just upon some principle which has its foundation in human nature. But to develop the principle by which savages are influenced in their conduct, so tedious or intricate process of reasoning can be necessary. It must have a place in every mind, and be instantaneous in all its decisions. Hence it has been supposed, that the principle to which modern philosophers have given the name of the moral sense, is instinctive; that it is the sole judge of virtue and vice; and that its admonitions have such authority, as to enforce obedience without regard to the consequences of any action.\n\nOther philosophers, who deny that the moral sense is instinctive, and who yet suppose that the original state of man was savage, are forced to pile hypotheses upon hypotheses, each unnatural in itself, and all contradictory to one another, in order to account for the commencement of civilization and the formation of society. It has been supposed, that the desire of self-preservation and the love of power are the governing principles in human nature; that in the savage state every man had a right to everything which he could seize by fraud or force; that all had an innate propensity to invade each other's property; and that hence war, rapine, and bloodshed, prevailed universally, till the savages discovered the expediency of uniting under some form of government for their mutual protection.\n\nBut before the original state of man had been made the basis of such opposite theories as these, it would surely have been proper to inquire upon what grounds that state has been supposed to be savage. To us these grounds appear to be nothing better than mere imaginations; the dreams of poets, and of such philosophers as bend facts to their own systems. In the authentic history of our species, there is no evidence, indeed there can be no evidence, that the first men were savages; and every thing which we know of human nature leads us to believe, that had they been so, the race could never have been civilized but by the miraculous interposition of some superior being. The only record of the earliest ages of the world to which the smallest credit is due, represents all the nations of the earth as having sprung from one pair, and that pair as having been instructed in their duty by their beneficent Creator. If this be the fact, and no confutation thereof can controvert it, the precepts of morality would be originally conveyed from one generation to another; not in a systematical or scientific form, but as the laws of the Universal Sovereign, whose authority demands communication of implicit obedience. Accordingly we find, that the first teachers of morals were men of superior rank by the ear as well as of eminent talents, who formed collections of maxims derived from their ancestors, \"with the view...\"\nview of perfecting subordination*, polishing manners, and educating youth. Such were the Proverbs of Solomon, the Words of Agur, and the Wisdom of the son of Sirach.\" These instructors did not analyze the human mind into its various faculties, and build a system of morals either upon a particular instinct pointing to the supreme good, or upon the fitness of things discovered by reason. Short isolated sentences were the mode in which they conveyed their precepts; which they prefaced by observing, that \"the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge;\" and enforced by the assurance, that \"length of days, and long life, and peace, should they add to those who obeyed them.\"\n\nThe sayings of the celebrated wise men of Greece were collections of apophthegms, made in the same manner, and delivered with similar views. Thales and Pythagoras†, who founded the one the Ionic and the other the Italic school, made collections of precepts for the conduct as well as of a state as of private life. \"Neither the crimes nor the thoughts of bad men (said Thales) are concealed from the gods. The only method of being just, is to avoid doing that which we blame in others.\" Of Pythagoras it is related by Porphyry and Laertius, that from Samos he repaired to Delos, and after presenting an offering of cakes to Apollo, there received, or pretended to receive, moral dogmas from the priests; which he afterwards delivered to his disciples under the character of divine precepts. Amongst these were the following: That, \"next to gods and demons, the highest reverence is due to parents and legislators; and that the laws and customs of our country are to be religiously observed.\"\n\nTo these maxims or apophthegms, which, for the sake of delighting the ear and aiding the memory, were sometimes delivered in verse, succeeded, as has been supposed, the mode of instruction by fable or allegory. But the truth seems to be, that this method of communicating moral and political wisdom was as ancient as the other; for we have a beautiful specimen of it in the ninth chapter of the book which relates the transactions of the Judges of Israel. The fables of Esop, too, which were written at a very early period, remain lasting modes of this species of art among the Greeks.\n\nWhen the instructors of mankind had proceeded thus far as to give an artificial form to their precepts, they soon advanced a step farther, and reduced their observations into classes or predicaments. Pythagoras, who visited Egypt, has been supposed to have learned from its priests the method of arranging the virtues into distinct classes. But it is the opinion of Mr. Bruce, an excellent writer‡, founded on the previous aspects of ethics, and on the comprehensive talents of the Samian philosopher, that the honour of the invention ought to be ascribed to himself. Be this as it may, it was observed by the inventor, that \"all the maxims of morality might be referred to the duties which men owe to themselves, and the duties which they owe to each other.\" Hence the four cardinal virtues of the ancients, prudence, temperance, fortitude, and justice; of which the first three refer to the individual, and the fourth to society.\n\nHitherto lessons in morality had not taken a systematic form; but they were gradually approaching to it. Socrates was perhaps the first Pagan philosopher who established all his precepts on one sure and steady basis. In his lectures and discourses, he seems to have had one great object in view†, to connect the moral Elements of Ethics, which were fitted to regulate the conduct of mankind, with sublime conceptions reflecting the field's History, &c., first principles of virtuous conduct which are common to all mankind, are, according to this excellent moralist, laws of God; and the conclusive argument by which he supports this opinion is, that no man departs from these principles with impunity. \"It is frequently possible (says he) for men to screen themselves from the penalty of human laws, but no man can be unjust or ungrateful without suffering for his crime; hence I conclude, that these laws must have proceeded from a more excellent legislator than man.\" From this it would appear, that in the opinion of Socrates, conscience, or the moral sense, approving of any action, is the criterion by which it is known to be virtuous, and the will of God that which obliges men to perform it.\n\nSocrates himself left no writings behind him, nor, as Origin as we know, offered any regular and complete theory the Greek of ethics. His disciples, however, who were numerous and distinguished, became the founders of the celebrated Greek sects. Among them the first great question was, \"what are the foundations of virtue?\" and the second, \"what are the distinctions between good and evil, happiness and misery?\" The answers given to these important questions divided the philosophers and their disciples into distinct orders.\n\nIn answer to the former question, Plato taught*, \"Enfield, that 'virtue is to be pursued for its own sake; and that being a divine attainment, it cannot be taught, but is the gift of God.'\" This seems to differ in nothing, but the name, from the doctrine of those moderns who place the sole foundation of virtue in the approval of the moral sense. The founder of the academy indeed has no such phrase as moral sense in any of his writings with which we are acquainted; but if virtue cannot be taught, and if it is to be pursued for its own sake, it must in itself be good, and the object of some feeling, whether called sense, instinct, or passion. His solution of the second question agitated among the sects is not indeed very consistent with this necessary inference from his answer to the first; but for his inconsistencies we are not accountable. \"Our highest good (he says) consists in the contemplation and knowledge of the first good, which is mind or God; and all those things which are called good by men, are in reality such only so far as they are derived from the first and highest good. The only power in human nature which can acquire a resemblance to the supreme good, is reason; and this resemblance consists in prudence, justice, sanctity, and temperance.\"\n\nAristotle, the founder of the Peripatetic school, was of Aristotle, the pupil of Plato; but of the two great moral questions he gives solutions somewhat different from those of his master. \"Virtue (according to him†) is either theoretical or practical. Theoretical virtue consists in the due exercise of the understanding; practical, in the pursuit of what is right and good. Practical virtue is acquired by habit and exercise.\" This theory seems to differ little from that adopted by Cudworth, Clarke, and Price, which shall be considered afterwards.\n\nWith\nWith respect to happiness or good, the doctrine of Aristotle is very rational. \"Pleasures (he says) are essentially different in kind. Disgraceful pleasures are wholly unworthy of the name. The purest and noblest pleasure is that which a good man derives from virtuous actions. Happiness, which consists in a conduct conformable to virtue, is either contemplative or active. Contemplative happiness, which consists in the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, is superior to active happiness, because the understanding is the higher part of human nature, and the objects on which it is employed are of the noblest kind. The happiness which arises from external possessions is inferior to that which arises from virtuous actions; but both are necessary to produce perfect felicity.\"\n\nThe Stoics, another celebrated sect of Greek philosophers, maintained*, that \"nature impels every man to pursue whatever appears to him to be good.\" According to them, \"self-preservation and defense is the first law of animated nature. All animals necessarily derive pleasure from those things which are suited to them; but the first object of pursuit is, not pleasure, but conformity to nature. Every one, therefore, who has a right discernment of what is good, will be chiefly concerned to conform to nature in all his actions and pursuits. This is the origin of moral obligation.\" With respect to happiness or good, the Stoical doctrine was altogether extravagant: They taught, that \"all external things are indifferent, and cannot affect the happiness of man; that pain, which does not belong to the mind, is no evil; and that a wise man will be happy in the midst of torture, because virtue itself is happiness (A).\"\n\nAs the Stoics held that there is but one substance, partly active and partly passive, in the universe (see Metaphysics, No. 261, 262), and as they called the active principle God, their doctrine, which makes virtue consist in a conformity to nature, bears no small resemblance to that of those moderns who felt moral obligation on the Divine will. It was therefore on better grounds than has been sometimes supposed, that Warburton, when characterizing the founders of the three principal sects in Greece, represented Plato as the patron of the moral sense; Aristotle, of the essential differences; and Zeno, of arbitrary will. These principles, when separated from each other, and treated in the manner of the ancients, may not each be able to bear the superstructure which was raised upon it; but the principles of most of the other sects were much less pure, and infinitely more dangerous.\n\nCudworth §, whose testimony when relating the doctrines of antiquity is entitled to the fullest credit, affirms, that Arisippus the founder of the Cyrenaic school, Democritus, and Protagoras, with their followers among the atomists, taught, that \"the distinction between virtue and vice is merely arbitrary; that nothing is just or unjust, sacred or profane, but as it is agreeable or contrary to established laws and customs; that what is just to-day, human authority may make unjust to-morrow; and that present pleasure is the sovereign good of man.\"\n\nWith these impieties, the moral doctrines of Epicurus have very unjustly been confounded. The physical and metaphysical systems of that philosopher are indeed strange compositions of ingenuity and absurdity, truth and falsehood; and the moral precepts of many of his followers were in the highest degree licentious and impure. But his own life was exemplary; and his ethical system, if candidly interpreted, is much more rational than that of the Stoics; though it must be confessed, that no sect produced men of more determined virtue than the school of Zeno. According to Epicurus*, \"the end of living, or the ultimate good which is to be sought for its own sake, is happiness. The happiness which belongs to man, is that state in which he enjoys as many of the good things, and suffers as few of the evils incident to human nature as possible; passing his days in a smooth course of tranquility. Pleasure is in its own nature good, as pain is in its nature evil. The one is therefore to be pursued, and the other to be avoided, for its own sake. Pleasure and pain are not only good and evil in themselves, but they are the measure of what is good or evil in every object of desire and aversion; for the ultimate reason why we pursue one thing and avoid another is, because we expect pleasure from the former, and apprehend pain from the latter.—That pleasure, however, which prevents the enjoyment of a greater pleasure, or produces a greater pain, is to be shunned; and that pain which either removes a greater pain, or procures a greater pleasure, is to be endured.\"\n\nUpon these self-evident maxims, Epicurus builds his system of ethics; and proves, with great force of argument, \"that a steady course of virtue produces the greatest quantity of happiness of which human nature is capable.\" Without a prudent care of the body, and a steady government of the mind, to guard the one from diseases and the other from the clouds of prejudice, happiness is unattainable. By temperance we enjoy pleasure, without suffering any consequent inconvenience. Sobriety enables us to content ourselves with simple and frugal fare. Gentleness, as opposed to an irascible temper, greatly contributes to the tranquility and happiness of life, by preserving the mind from perturbation, and arming it against the assaults of calumny and malice. Fortitude enables us to bear those pains which prudence cannot shun, and banishes fear from the mind; and the practice of justice is absolutely necessary to the existence of society, and by consequence to the happiness of every individual.\" These reasonings come home to every man's bosom; and had not this philosopher, by denying the providence, if not the being, of God, most unhappily excluded from his system the very possibility of a future state of retribution, his moral philosophy would have been the most rational, and of course the most useful, of any\n\n(A) Since this short history was written, a very pleasing view of Stoicism has been given to the public in Ferguson's Principles of Moral and Political Science; a work which the student of ethics will do well to consult. Perhaps the amiable author may unintentionally have softened the austere dogmas of the Porch, by translating into them something of the mild spirit of the gospel; but, if so, he has much improved the system of Zenon.\nthat was taught in the schools of Greece. This enormous defect, however, laid it open to the grossest corruptions; and by his followers it was in fact corrupted so as to countenance the most impure and criminal pleasures of sense.\n\nThese several systems of ethics continued to be cultivated with more or less purity through all the revolutions of the Grecian states, and they were adopted by the Romans after Greece itself became a province of the empire. They had been introduced into Egypt during the reigns of the Ptolemies, and were taught with much celebrity in the schools of Alexandria.—The philosophy which was most cultivated in those schools was that of Plato; but from a desire of uniformity which took possession of the Alexandrian Platonists, many of the dogmas of Aristotle and Zeno, as well as the extravagant fictions of the east, were incorporated with the principles of the old academy.—The patrons of this heterogeneous mass have been called eclectic philosophers, because they professed to select from each system those doctrines which were rational and important, and to reject everything which was false or futile; but they added nothing to the purity of Plato's ethics, and they increased the obscurity and mysticism of his physics and metaphysics.\n\nAfter the subversion of the Roman empire, every species of philosophy, if logical wrangling deserve not that name, was banished for ages from the schools of Europe; and ethics, properly so called, gave place to ecclesiastical casuistry, and to the study of the civil and canon law. When the Greeks, whom the fury and fanaticism of Mahomet II. had driven from Constantinople, introduced into Italy the knowledge of their own language, the cabinets of ancient philosophy were again unlocked; the systems of the different sects were adopted with the utmost avidity; and, without accurate investigation of their respective merits, men became Platonists, Peripatetics, or Stoics, as fancy or caprice prompted them to choose their leaders. The works of Aristotle, in particular, had not less authority over his modern admirers than it had of old in the Lyceum at Athens. At length the spirit of Luther and the genius of Bacon broke these fetters, and taught men to think for themselves as well in science as in religion. In physics, the effects produced by the writings of Bacon were great and rapid; for in physics the ancient theories were totally and radically wrong.—With respect to morals, however, the case was different. Each of the celebrated schools of antiquity was in possession of much moral truth, blended indeed with error; and long after the Stagyrite and his rivals had lost all influence in physical science, philosophers of eminence followed them implicitly in the science of ethics.\n\nAt this day, indeed, there is hardly a theory of morals at all distinguished, to which something very similar may not be found in the writings of the ancients.—Hobbes adopted the principles of Democritus and Protagoras, and taught expressly that \"there is no criterion of justice or injustice, good or evil, besides the laws of each state; and that it is absurd to inquire at any person except the established interpreters of the law, whether an action be right or wrong, good or evil (b).\" These impious absurdities have been often confuted. Cudworth, who composed his True Intellectual System of the Universe, in order to trace the metaphysical atheism of Hobbes to its source, and to expose it to the public in all its weakness, undertook likewise to overthrow his ethical system, in a treatise entitled Of Eternal and Immutable Morality. That work was left unfinished; but the theory of its great author was adopted, illustrated, and very ably supported, by the doctors Clarke and Price.\n\nAccording to these three admirable scholars, \"we feel ourselves irresistibly determined to approve some worth, actions, and to disapprove others. Some actions we Clarke, cannot but conceive of as right, and others as wrong; and Price, and of all actions we are led to form some idea, as either fit to be performed or unfit, or as neither fit nor unfit to be performed, i.e. as indifferent. The power within us which thus perceives and determines, they declare to be the understanding; and they add, that it perceives or determines immediately or by intuition, because right and wrong denote simple ideas. As there are some propositions, which when attended to necessarily determine all minds to believe them, so are there some actions whose natures are such, that when observed, all rational beings immediately and necessarily approve them. He that can impartially attend, it is said, to the nature of his own perceptions, and determine that when he conceives gratitude or beneficence to be right, he perceives nothing true of them, or understands nothing, but only suffers from a sense, has a turn of mind which appears unaccountable: for the more we examine, the more indisputable it will appear to us, that we express necessary truth, when we say of some actions that they are right, and of others that they are wrong.\" It is added, that \"we cannot perceive an action to be right without approving it, or approve it without being conscious of some degree of satisfaction and complacency; that we cannot perceive an action to be wrong without disapproving it, or disapprove it without being displeased with it; and that the first must be liked, the last disliked; the first loved, the last hated.\" By the patrons of this system, obligation to action, and rightness of a action, are held to be coincident or identical. \"Virtue, they affirm, has a real, full, obligatory power, antecedently to all laws, and independently of all will; for obligation is involved in the very nature of it. To affirm that the performance of that which to omit would be wrong is not obligatory, unless conducive to private good, or enjoined by a superior power, is a manifest contradiction.\"\n\nFew men have deserved better of letters and philosophy than Cudworth, Clarke, and Price; and yet their theory of morals appears to us to be contradictory and unintelligible. It is certainly romantic, and founded upon principles which, if they be denied, no man\n\n(b) Doctrinas de justo et injusto, bono et malo, praeter leges in unaquaque civitate constitutas, authenticas esse nullas: et utrum aliqua actio justa vel injusta, bona vel mala futura sit, a nomine inquirendum esse, praeterquam ab illis, quibus legum fuarum interpretationem civitas demandaverit. De Cive, p. 343.\nman by argument can be compelled to grant. There is, say they, an absolute right and wrong, fitness and unfitness, in actions; but if so, the actions which are right and fit must be right and fit for something, because fitness, which respects no end, is wholly inconceivable. To say that any particular action is fit, and yet fit for no particular purpose, is just as absurd as to say that the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle are equal, but neither to one another, nor to any other angles; and we may with no less propriety talk of the relations of equality attaching to a particular angle, and to nothing else with which the angle is equal, than of the absolute fitness or rightness of any action or course of actions. If it be said that such actions are fit and right, because they tend to promote the harmony of the world and the happiness of men, this may be granted; but it overturns the intellectual theory from its very foundation. Actions which are fit and right only for their consequences, are approved and liked for the sake of those consequences; and the happiness of men, among whom the virtuous person himself is certainly to be included, is the motive or ultimate obligation to their performance.\n\nSimilar to this theory, and liable to the same objections, is that which resolves moral approbation into a sense of propriety; for if actions be approved because they are proper, it must be because they are proper for some end or purpose, propriety in the abstract being a word without meaning.\n\nMany philosophers, feeling the force of these and Shaftesbury's similar objections to the intellectual theory of Cudworth, Clarke, and Price, as well as to a sense of propriety in the abstract, have had recourse to another hypothesis, apparently better founded. Observing that all mankind decide on the morality of characters and actions instantaneously, without weighing their consequences in the balance of reason, they suppose that such decisions are made by an instinct of our common nature, implanted in the human breast by the hand that formed it. To this instinct some of them give the name of conscience, and others that of moral sense, in contradiction to external sense the other great and universal inlet of human knowledge. By this moral sense we intuitively discover an essential difference in the quality of all thoughts and actions, and a general distinction of them into good and evil, just as by the tongue and palate we discover an essential difference in the taste of all objects, and a general distinction of them into pleasant and unpleasant. The ablest advocates for this instinctive system agree, that the moral sense is the immediate and involuntary criterion of only a few general truths, which in their joint operation upon the mind, lay the basis of moral obligation. Others have carried it to what we think a very dangerous extreme; as by affirming that we cannot prove, in regard to our moral feelings, that they are conformable to any extrinsic and eternal relations of things, they seem to with that reason were banished from the science of ethics. Were this true, it would in many cases be impossible to distinguish the prejudices of early education from the pure dictates of original instinct, and the most pernicious conduct might be sanctified with the approbation of what would be deemed the ultimate test of virtue and vice.\n\nTo remedy the defects of the intellectual and instinctive theories of morality, Mr Hume blended them together; and, upon the broader basis of reason and internal sense co-operating with each other, he reared a system which, though different from those of all his predecessors, he rendered plausible, and supported with his usual ingenuity.\n\nAccording to him, sentiment and reason concur in almost all moral determinations; and he proves, that Hume, for this purpose, \"there is implanted in the human breast a disinterested principle of benevolence or sympathy which makes men take pleasure in each other's happiness. The merit or demerit of actions consists wholly in their utility or natural tendency to add to the sum of human happiness; and the same he holds to be true of qualities whether bodily or mental. This utility or natural tendency it is the office of reason to discover; for that faculty alone can trace relations and consequences. Such qualities or actions as reason discovers to be useful, either to the individual or society, the instinctive principle of benevolence makes us instantly approve, and this approbation constitutes their morality. Thus, temperance, fortitude, courage, industry, &c. reason discovers to be useful to him who possesses them; and upon this discovery they are approved of by the sentiment of sympathy. They are therefore moral qualities and the sources of the private virtues. In like manner, generosity, cheerfulness of temper, mercy, and justice, are discovered to be useful to society, and are accompanied with the approbation of that sentiment of sympathy which makes every man feel a satisfaction in the felicity of all other men. They therefore constitute the social virtues. Of every quality and every action, the merit or demerit, and of consequence the degree of approbation or disapprobation which is bestowed upon it, is in exact proportion to its utility and the circumstances of the case in which it occurs. The social virtues are therefore greater than those which are private, and one social virtue is greater than another; but every quality and every action which is useful, either to society or to the individual, is more or less virtuous, provided the good of the individual be considered as subordinate to the good of the public.\"\n\nThis theory is ingenious; and in placing the merit of actions in their utility, it furnishes a criterion of virtue which can be employed by reason; but it seems to be wholly free from error, and it is obviously defective. By pretending that the same sentiment of approbation is given to useful actions voluntarily performed and to useful qualities which are merely constitutional, Mr Hume confounds the merit of virtuous habits with the value of natural talents. Yet every man's consciousness will surely tell him, that the feeling or sentiment which attaches to deeds of justice, clemency, and beneficence, is very different from that which attaches to beauty of form, strength of body, vigour of mind, and mere extent of capacity. All these actions and qualities are useful; but when we approve of the former, besides attending to their utility, we consider them as in the man's power, and attribute the merit of them immediately to himself. When we approve, or rather admire, the latter on account of their utility, we know them to be not in the man's power, and we attribute the merit of them immediately to the Author of nature.\n\nBut the defects of this theory are in practice more pernicious\npernicious that its errors. The author well observes, that the end of all moral speculations is to teach us our duty; and by proper representations of the deformity of vice and beauty of virtue, to beget correspondent habits, and engage us to avoid the one and embrace the other; but the theory under review holds out no motive sufficient in all cases for this purpose.\n\nIt is indeed true, as Mr Hume affirms, that the virtues which are immediately useful or agreeable to the person possessed of them, are desirable in a view to self-interest, and that a regard to self-interest ought to engage us in the pursuit. It is likewise true, that the virtues which are useful and agreeable to others, are generally more desirable than the contrary qualities; for as by the constitution of our nature no enjoyment is sincere without some reference to company and society; so no society can be agreeable, or even tolerable, where a man feels his presence unwelcome, and discovers all around him symptoms of disgust and aversion. These considerations he deems sufficient to enforce the duties of humanity, clemency, and beneficence; but he states a case himself, in which they would certainly fail to make a man abstain from his neighbour's property. The greater part of property he considers, and rightly considers, as having its foundation in human laws, which are so calculated as to preserve the peace and promote the general good of the society, at the unavoidable expense sometimes of the individual. Now, in particular incidents, a lenient knave, by secretly purloining from the hoards of a worthless miser might make himself comfortable and independent for life, without causing any breach in the social union, and even without hurting a single individual. What then should hinder him from acting thus? His self-interest would be promoted; and if he possessed a generous spirit, he might gratify his sentiment of benevolence or sympathy by doing good with his money to the poor, which the miser never did. For enforcing the uniform practice of justice in such cases as this, Mr Hume's theory of morals contains no adequate motive; but a very sufficient one is held out by the system which we are now to consider.\n\nThat system, which seems to have been unknown to the ancients, is built upon religion, of which indeed it constitutes a very essential part; and those by whom it has been taught, maintain that no other foundation is sufficient to bear a regular superstructure of practical ethics. The philosophers of this school (D) define virtue to be \"the doing good to mankind, in obedience to the will of God, and for the sake of everlasting happiness.\" So that with them \"the good of mankind\" is the subject, \"the will of God\" the criterion or rule, and \"everlasting happiness\" the motive, of human virtue. The moral sense, supposing it real, they consider as a very inadequate rule of conduct, as being in many cases difficult to be distinguished from prejudice; and many of them confidently deny its existence. The other rules, such as the fitness of things, abstract right, the truth of things, the law of reason, &c., they consider either as unintelligible, or as relative to some end by which the rules must themselves be tried. The two great questions, which in the system of these religious philosophers demand solution, are: 1st, By what means shall a man in every case discover precisely what is the will of God? and, 2ndly, What evidence have we that there will be a future state of retribution and of everlasting happiness?\n\nOf these two questions, the latter belongs wholly to religion; and to solve it they call in the aid of revelation, as well as of that which is called the religion of nature. The former question is in the province of morality; and to find answers to it which will apply to every case, is the whole business of their system.\n\nThe will of God respecting human conduct may be discovered by reasoning a priori from his existence and attributes, or a posteriori from the tendency of his works. Being himself independent and all perfect, it is inconceivable that his view in creating the world could be anything else than to communicate some portion of his own felicity. (See Metaphysics, No. 312.) This conclusion is agreeable to what we perceive of his works, in which there are a thousand contrivances, all tending to give happiness to man, and to all animated nature; and of not one of which the natural tendency is to inflict pain, or prove ultimately injurious. Mankind are linked together by various ties, and made to depend in a great measure upon each other's conduct. That conduct, therefore, which is naturally productive of the greatest sum of human happiness, must be agreeable to the will of God; or, in other words, virtuous conduct. That, of which the natural tendency is the reverse, must be vicious; and that conduct, if there be any such, which tends to produce neither happiness nor misery, must be indifferent, i.e., neither morally good nor morally evil. It is to be observed, however, that as, previous to their own obedience or disobedience, all men stand in the same relation to their Creator, it must be his will that an equal portion of the happiness of which human nature is capable be communicated to all by whom that nature is shared. Whence it follows, that only such conduct as, if universally pursued by all men in the same situation and circumstances, would be productive of the greatest sum of human happiness on the whole, can be agreeable to the will of the Creator; and that, in judging of the morality of actions, we are not to regard their immediate consequences in a particular case, but their natural and ultimate tendency if performed in all cases.\n\nThis is a criterion of virtue which differs widely from the local or occasional utility set up by Mr Hume; for the particular consequences of an action and its general tendency may often be at variance, so that what might in certain circumstances be immediately useful, would yet be highly criminal and ultimately pernicious. The general tendency of actions, too, may be always known, and known with the utmost certainty: the whole of their particular consequences can never be discovered. One thing, however, is evident, that if all men in their respective stations would regulate their conduct by the natural tendency\n\n(D) Gastrell, Cumberland, Puffendorff, Norris, Berkeley, Gay, Law, Rutherforth, Soame Jenyns, Dr Johnson, Mr Paley, and Mr Gibbon, &c.\ndency of every action, the particular and general consequences of their conduct would be the same, and the greatest happiness would result from it of which human nature is in this world capable. And therefore, since it is only through the perversion of some person or persons concerned, that the particular consequences of any action, of which the natural tendency is to produce misery, can ever bring happiness to a single individual; it can no more be the will of God that we make these occasional and distorted consequences the rule of our conduct, than it can be his will that the vices of other men should be the basis of our virtues. According to this scheme of morals, which rests all obligation on private happiness, the whole difference between an act of prudence and an act of duty, is this: That in the former case we consider only what we shall gain or lose in this world; in the latter, what we shall gain or lose in the world to come.\n\nAlthough the patrons of this theory question the reality of the moral sense as an instinct, they allow that a sentiment of approbation or disapprobation of actions, according as they are virtuous or vicious, is generated by the associating principle (see Instinct, and Metaphysics, No. 97); and that this sentiment, though fictitious, operates instantaneously as if it were instinctive. They insist that our earliest actions are the result of imitation; that when we first begin to trace consequences, education and the desire of immediate enjoyment are our only guides; that as our mind expands and our knowledge increases, the hopes and fears of futurity become the motives, and the will of God the rule of our conduct; and that long practice in virtue, upon these principles, produces habits by which we go on with satisfaction in the same course, without looking forward, on every particular occasion, to the ultimate consequences and first motives of our actions. Thus do habits of justice, benevolence, clemency, and moral approbation, spring through a proper course of discipline, out of the selfish principle; and when these habits are completely formed and deeply rooted, man has attained the utmost perfection of which he is capable in this state of probation, and is fitted for another of retribution and happiness.\n\nThat these philosophers have not a just view of human nature, when they deny that there are any innate excellencies or principles of benevolence in man, we shall endeavour to show when we lay the foundation of that theory which we think deserves to be preferred to all others; but we fully agree with a candid and able writer, who seems to consider them as under the same mistake, \"that their theory of morals has no tendency to weaken the foundations of virtue; and that by the account which it gives of the rise of the social affections, it obviates many of the arguments which had formerly been urged against the selfish system.\" Nay, we scruple not to confess, that the mode of investigation which it employs in all cases to discover the will of God, may in some cases be necessary in any system which does not banish the use of reason from the science of ethics. On this account, as well as out of respect to the first moralists of the age, who affirm, that \"it must be embraced by all who are willing to know why they act, or why they forbear, to give any reason of their conduct to themselves or to others,\" we shall apply it to one of those cases of social duty which Mr Hume's principle of utility could not resolve. Such an example will enable the meanest of our readers to decide between the merits of it and of the theory which we shall adopt; or, as we rather hope, it will show them that the two theories lead to the same practical conclusions.\n\nHaving thus given our readers a short view of the most celebrated systems of ethics which have prevailed from the earliest ages of the world to the present day, we now proceed, agreeably to our definition of the science, to trace man's duty from his nature and connexions, and to show that the steady practice of virtue must terminate in his ultimate happiness.\n\nPART I.\n\nCHAP. I. Of Man and his Connexions.\n\nMAN is born a weak, helpless, delicate creature, unprovided with food, clothing, and whatever else is necessary for subsistence or defence. And yet, exposed as the infant is to numberless wants and dangers, he is utterly incapable of supplying the former, or securing himself against the latter. But, though thus feeble and exposed, he finds immediate and sure resources in the affection and care of his parents, who refuse no labours, and forego no dangers, to nurse and rear up the tender babe. By these powerful instincts, as by some mighty chain, does nature link the parent to the child, and form the strongest moral connexion on his part, before the child has the least apprehension of it. Hunger and thirst, with all the sensations that accompany or are connected with them, explain themselves by a language strongly expressive, and irresistibly moving. As the several senses bring in notices and informations of surrounding objects, we may perceive in the young spectator early signs of a growing wonder and admiration. Bright objects and striking sounds are beheld and heard with a sort of commotion and surprize. But, without resting on any, he eagerly passes on from object to object, still pleased with whatever is newest. Thus the love of novelty is formed, and the passion of wonder kept awake. By degrees he becomes acquainted with the most familiar objects, his parents, his brethren, and those of the family who are most conversant with him. He contracts a fondness for them, is uneasy when they are gone, and charmed to see them again. These feelings become the foundation of a moral attachment on his side; and by this reciprocal sympathy he forms the domestic alliance with his parents, brethren, and other members of the family. Hence he becomes interested in their concerns; and feels joy or grief, hope or fear, on their account, as well as his own. As his affections now point beyond himself to others, he is denominated a good or ill creature, as he stands well or ill affected to them. These, then, are the first links of the moral\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nWhen he begins to make excursions from the nursery, and extends his acquaintance abroad, he forms a little circle of companions, engages with them in play, or in quest of adventures; and leads, or is led by them, as his genius is more or less aspiring. Though this is properly the season in which appetite and passion have the ascendant, yet his imagination and intellectual powers open apace; and as the various images of things pass before the mental eye, he forms variety of tastes; relishes some things, and dislikes others, as his parents, companions, and a thousand other circumstances, lead him to combine agreeable or disagreeable sets of ideas, or represent to him objects in alluring or odious lights.\n\nAs his views are enlarged, his active and social powers expand themselves in proportion; the love of action, of imitation, and of praise, emulation, curiosity, docility, a passion for command, and fondness of change.—His passions are quick, variable, and pliant to every impression; his attachments and disgusts quickly succeed each other. He compares things, distinguishes actions, judges of characters, and loves or hates them, as they appear well or ill affected to himself, or to those he holds dear. Meanwhile he soon grows sensible of the consequences of his own actions, as they attract applause, or bring contempt: he triumphs in the former; and is ashamed of the latter, wants to hide them, and blushes when they are discovered. By means of these powers he becomes a fit subject of culture, the moral tie is drawn closer, he feels that he is accountable for his conduct to others as well as to himself, and thus is gradually ripening for society and action.\n\nAs man advances from childhood to youth, his passions as well as perceptions take a more extensive range. New senses of pleasure invite him to new pursuits; he grows sensible to the attractions of beauty, feels a peculiar sympathy with the sex, and forms a more tender kind of attachment than he has yet experienced. This becomes the cement of a new moral relation, and gives a softer turn to his passions and behaviour. In this turbulent period he enters more deeply into a relish of friendship, company, exercise, and diversions; the love of truth, of imitation, and of design, grows upon him; and as his connexions spread among his neighbours, fellow citizens, and countrymen, his thirst of praise, emulation, and social affections grow more intense and active. Meanwhile, it is impossible for him to have lived thus long without having become sensible of those more august signatures of order, wisdom, and goodness, which are stamped on the visible creation; and of those strong suggestions within himself of a parent mind, the source of all intelligence and beauty; an object as well as source of that activity, and those aspirations which sometimes rouse his inmost frame, and carry him out of himself to an almighty and all-governing power: Hence arise those sentiments of reverence, and those affections of gratitude, resignation, and love, which link the soul with the Author of Nature, and form that most sublime and godlike of all connexions.\n\nMan having now reached his prime, either new passions succeed, or the old set are wound up to a higher pitch. For, growing more sensible of his connexions with the public, and that particular community to which he more immediately belongs; and taking withal a larger prospect of human life, and its various wants and enjoyments; he forms more intimate friendship, grasps at power, courts honour, lays down cooler plans of intellect, and becomes more attentive to the concerns of society: he enters into family connexions, and indulges those charities which arise from thence. The reigning passions of this period powerfully prompt him to provide for the decays of life: and in it compassion and gratitude exert their influence in urging the man, now in full vigour, to requite the affection and care of his parents, by supplying their wants and alleviating their infirmities.\n\nAt length human life verges downwards; and old age creeps on apace, with its anxiety, love of ease, interesteds, fearfulness, forgetfulness, and love of offspring.—The experience of the aged is formed to direct, and their coolness to temper, the heat of youth: the former teaches them to look back on past follies; and the latter to look forward into the consequences of things, and provide against the worst. Thus every age has its peculiar genius and set of passions corresponding to that period, and most conducive to the prosperity of the rest. And thus are the wants of one period supplied by the capacities of another, and the weaknesses of one age tally to the passions of another.\n\nBesides these, there are other passions and affections of a less ambulatory nature, not peculiar to one period, but belonging to every age, and acting more or less in every breath throughout life. Such are self-love, benevolence, love of life, honour, shame, hope, fear, desire, aversion, joy, sorrow, anger, and the like. The two first are affections of a cooler strain; one pointing to the good of the individual, the other to that of the species: joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seem to be only modifications, or different exertions, of the same original affections of love and hatred, desire and aversion, arising from the different circumstances or position of the object desired or abhorred, as it is present or absent. From these likewise arise other secondary or occasional passions, which depend, as to their existence and several degrees, upon the original affections being gratified or disappointed; as anger, complacence, confidence, jealousy, love, hatred, dejection, exultation, contentment, disgust, which do not form leading passions, but rather hold of them.\n\nBy these simple but powerful springs, whether periodic or fixed, the life of man, weak and indigent as he is, is preserved and secured, and the creature is prompted to a constant round of action, even to supply his own numerous and ever-returning wants, and to guard against the various dangers and evils to which he is obnoxious. By these links men are connected with each other, formed into families, drawn into particular communities, and all united as by a common league into one system or body, whose members feel and sympathise one with another. By this admirable adjustment of the constitution of man to his state, and the gradual evolution of his powers, order is maintained, society upheld, and human life filled with that variety of passion and action which at once enliven and diversify it.\n\nThis is a short sketch of the principal movements of the directing power.\nthe human mind. Yet these movements are not the whole of man; they impel to action, but do not direct it: they need a regulator to guide their motions, to measure and apply their forces; and accordingly they have one that naturally superintends and directs their actions. We are conscious of a principle within us, which examines, compares, and weighs things; notes the differences, observes the forces, and foresees the consequences, of affections and actions. By this power we look back on past times, and forward into futurity, gather experiences, estimate the real and comparative value of objects, lay out schemes, contrive means to execute them, and settle the whole order and economy of life. This power we commonly distinguish by the name of reason or reflection, the business of which is not to suggest any original notices or sensations, but to canvass, range, and make deductions from them.\n\nWe are intimately conscious of another principle within us, which approves of certain sentiments, passions, and actions, and disapproves of their contraries. In consequence of the decisions of this inward judge, we denominate some actions and principles of conduct right, honest, good; and others wrong, dishonest, ill. The former excite our esteem, moral complacence, and affection, immediately and originally of themselves, without regard to their consequences, and whether they affect our interest or not. The latter do as naturally and necessarily call forth our contempt, scorn, and aversion. That power by which we perceive this difference in affections and actions, and feel a consequent relish or dislike, is commonly called conscience or the moral sense.\n\nThat there is such a power as this in the mind of every man of sound understanding, is a fact which cannot be controverted; but whether it be an instinctive power, or the result of early and deep-rooted associations, has been long and ably debated. The question is of importance in the science of human nature, as well as in ascertaining the standard of practical virtue; but to us it appears that the contending parties have carried their respective opinions to dangerous extremes.\n\nWhen it is affirmed, as it sometimes has been, that reason has nothing to do in ethical science, but that in every possible situation our duty is pointed out and the performance of it enforced by mere sentiment, the consequence seems to be, that virtue and vice are nothing permanent in themselves, but change their nature according to local circumstances. Certain it is, that sentiment has in similar situations approved of very different practices in different ages and different nations. At present this sentiment in Europe approves of the universal practice of justice, and of parents protecting their children, whether well or ill formed, whether strong or weak; but in Sparta we know that theft, if dexterously practised, was approved, and not unfrequently rewarded; and that the exposition of lame and deformed children was not only permitted, but absolutely enjoined. There is nothing which our conscience or moral sense condemns with greater severity, or views as a crime of a deeper dye, than children's unkind treatment of their aged parents; yet there are savages, among whom instincts of all kinds ought to prevail in greater purity than in civilized nations, whose moral sense permits them to put their aged and decrepid parents to death. If this sense be instinctive, and the sole judge of right and wrong, how comes it to decide so differently on the same line of conduct in different ages and distant countries? The instincts of brutes, in similar circumstances, prompt uniformly to similar actions in every age and in every region where the species is found; and the external senses of man afford in all nations the same unvaried evidence concerning their respective objects. To these observations we may add, that instincts must be calculated for the state of nature, whatever that state may be, and therefore cannot be supposed capable of directing our steps through all the labyrinths of civilized society, in which duties are to be performed that in a state of nature would never have been thought of.\n\nBut though for these reasons it is apparent that mere sentiment, whether called conscience or the moral sense, would alone be a very unsafe guide to virtue in every individual case that may occur, we think that those who resolve all such sentiment into habit and the effect of education, without giving any part of it to nature, advance an opinion which is equally ill-founded and not less dangerous. There are, indeed, men who affirm that all benevolence is hypocrisy, friendship a cheat, public spirit a farce, fidelity a snare to procure trust and confidence; and that while all of us at bottom pursue only our private interest, we wear those fair disguises, in order to put those off their guard with whom we have to deal, and to expose them the more to our wiles and machinations. Others again, too virtuous to accuse themselves and all mankind of direct knavery, yet insist, that whatever affection one may feel, or imagine he feels, for others, no pallion is or can be disinterested; that the most generous friendship, however sincere, is only a modification of self-love; and that even unknown to ourselves we seek only our own gratification, while we appear the most deeply engaged in schemes for the liberty and happiness of mankind.\n\nSurely the mildness of these representations is an exaggerated picture of the selfishness of man. Self-love is indeed a very powerful as well as an essential principle in human nature; but that we have likewise an instinctive principle of benevolence, which, without any particular regard to our own interest, makes us feel pleasure in the happiness of other men, is a fact which we think admits of very complete proof. For, as Mr Hume well argues, \"when a man grieves for a friend who could be of no service to him, but on the contrary stood in need of his constant patronage and protection, how is it possible to suppose that such passionate tenderness arises from self-interest, which has no foundation in nature?\" What interest (asks the same examined, deep thinker) can a fond mother have in view, who loses her health by her affluous attendance on her sick child, and afterwards languishes and dies of grief when freed by its death from the slavery of attendance? Have we no satisfaction (continues he) in one man's company above another's, and no desire of the welfare of our friend, even though absence or death should prevent us from all participation in it? Or what is it commonly that gives us any participation in it, even while alive and present, but our affection and regard to him?\" Nor is it to contemporaries and individuals\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nOf Man and his Connexions.\n\nalone, that, independent of all interest, we feel a benevolent attachment. We constantly bestow praise on actions calculated to promote the good of mankind, though performed in ages very distant and in countries most remote; and he who was the author of such actions is the object of our esteem and affection. There is not perhaps a man alive, however selfish in his disposition, who does not applaud the sentiment of that emperor, who, recollecting at supper that he had done nothing in that day for any one, exclaimed with regret, that the day had been lost! yet the utmost facility of imagination can discover no appearance of interest that we can have in the generosity of Titus, or find any connexion of our present happiness with a character removed so far from us both in time and in place. But, as Mr Hume justly observes, if we even feign a character consisting of all the most generous and benevolent qualities, and give instances in which these display themselves, after an eminent and most extraordinary manner, for the good of mankind, we shall instantly engage the esteem and approbation of all our audience, who will never be much as inquire in what age or country the accomplished person lived.\n\nThese are facts which cannot be controverted; and they are wholly unaccountable, if there be not in human nature an instinctive sentiment of benevolence or sympathy which feels a disinterested pleasure in the happiness of mankind. But an end in which we feel pleasure we are naturally prompted to pursue; and therefore the same sentiment impels every man, with greater or less force, to promote the happiness of other men, which by means of it becomes in reality his own good, and is afterwards pursued from the combined motives of benevolence and self-enjoyment. For in obeying this sentiment we all feel an inward complacency, self-approbation, or consciousness of worth or merit; and in disobeying it, which cannot be done but with reluctance, we feel remorse, or a consciousness of unworthiness or demerit. It appears, however, from history, that the sentiment, as it is instinctive, points only to the good of mankind, without informing us how that good is to be promoted. The means proper for this purpose must be discovered by reason; and when they are brought into view, this sentiment, conscience, or moral sense, instantly shows us that it is our duty to pursue them.\n\nHence we see how different lines of conduct may in similar circumstances be approved of as virtuous in different nations. When the Spartan exposed his sickly and deformed child, and when the savage put his aged parents to death, neither of them erred from want of sentiment, or from having sentiments originally different from ours. Their errors resulted from a defect in reasoning. They both imagined that they were obeying the law of benevolence by preventing misery: for a weak and deformed person was very ill qualified to exist with any degree of comfort under the military constitution of Sparta, where all were soldiers, and under the necessity of enduring the greatest hardships; and in a state where the people have no fixed habitations, and where the chase supplies even the necessaries of life, an aged and infirm person is in danger of perishing through hunger, by one of the cruellest and most lingering of deaths. The theft allowed in Sparta, if theft it may be called, was a still less deviation from the instinctive law of benevolence. Boys were taught to slip as cunningly as they could into the gardens and public halls, in order to steal away herbs or meat; and if they were caught in the fact, they were punished for their want of dexterity. This kind of theft, since it was authorized by the law and the consent of the citizens, was no robbery; and the intention of the legislator in allowing it, was to inspire the Spartan youth, who were all designed for war, with the greater boldness, subtlety, and address; to inure them betimes to the life of a soldier; and to teach them to shift for themselves, and to live upon little. That the Spartan legislator did wrong in giving his countrymen a constitution, of which successful war was the ultimate object; and that savages, rather than kill their aged parents, or suffer them to die of hunger, ought to cultivate the ground, and abandon the chase; is readily granted: but the faults of the one as well as of the other arose not from any improper decision of the moral sense, but from a defect in their reasoning powers, which were not able to estimate the advantages and disadvantages of different modes of life. In moral decisions, therefore, conscience and reason are aiding to each other. The former principle, when separated from the latter, is defective, enjoining only the good of mankind, but unable to point out the means by which it can be most effectually promoted; and the latter principle, when separated from the former, only directs a man to do what is most prudent, but cannot give him a conception of duty.\n\nThese two powers of reason and conscience are evidently principles different in nature and kind from the different passions and affections. For the passions are mere force kind from or power, blind impulse, acting violently and without the passions choice, and ultimately tending each to their respective and affecting objects, without regard to the interest of the others, or of the whole system. Whereas the directing and judging powers distinguish and ascertain the different forces, mutual proportions and relations, which the passions bear to each other, and to the whole; recognize their several degrees of merit, and judge of the whole temper and conduct, as they respect either the individual or the species; and are capable of directing or refraining the blind impulses of passion in a due consistency one with the other, and a regular subordination to the whole system.\n\nThis is some account of the constituent principles of Division of our nature, which, according to their different mixtions, patures, degrees, and proportions, mould our character and lay our conduct in life. In reviewing that large train of affections which fill up the different stages of human life, we perceive this obvious distinction among them; that some of them respect the good of the individual, and others carry us beyond ourselves to the good of the species or kind. The former have therefore been called private, and the latter public affections. Of the first sort are love of life, of pleasure, of power, and the like. Of the last are compassion, gratitude, friendship, natural affection, and the like. Of the private passions (D), some respect merely the security and defense, of the creature, such as resentment and fear; whereas others\n\n(D) Here we use passions and affections without distinction. Their difference will be marked afterwards.\nothers aim at some positive advantage or good, as wealth, ease, fame. The former sort, therefore, because of this difference of objects, may be termed defensive passions. These answer to our dangers, and prompt us to avoid them if we can, or boldly to encounter them when we cannot.\n\nThe other class of private passions, which pursue private positive good, may be called appetitive. However, we shall still retain the name of private in contradiction to the defensive passions. Man has a great variety of wants to supply, and is capable of many enjoyments, according to the several periods of his life, and the different situations in which he is placed. To these therefore a suitable train of private passions correspond, which engage him in the pursuit of whatever is necessary for his subsistence or welfare.\n\nOur public or social affections are adapted to the several social connexions and relations which we bear to others, by making us sensible of their dangers, and interesting us in their wants, and so prompting us to secure them against one and supply the other.\n\nThis is the first step then to discover the duty and definition of man, the having analyzed the principles of which he is composed. It is necessary, in the next place, to consider in what order, proportion, and measure, of those inward principles, virtue, or a found moral temper and right conduct, confits; that we may discover whence moral obligation arises.\n\n**CHAP. II. Of Duty, or Moral Obligation.**\n\nIt is by the end or design of any power or movement that we must direct its motions, and estimate the degree of force necessary to its just action. If it want the force requisite for obtaining its end, we reckon it defective; if it has too much, so as to be carried beyond it, we say it is overcharged; and in either case it is imperfect and ill contrived. If it has just enough to reach the scope, we esteem it right and as it should be. Let us apply this reasoning to the passions.\n\nThe defense and security of the individual being the aim of the defensive passions, that security and defense must be the measure of their strength or indulgence. If they are too weak as to prove insufficient for that end, or if they carry us beyond it, i.e., raise unnecessary commotions, or continue longer than is needful, they are unfit to answer their original design, and therefore are in an unfound and unnatural state. The exercise of fear or of resentment has nothing desirable in it, nor can we give way to either without painful sensations. Without a certain degree of them, we are naked and exposed. With too high a proportion of them, we are miserable, and often injurious to others. Thus cowardice or timidity, which is the excess of fear, instead of saving us in danger, gives it too formidable an appearance, makes us incapable of attending to the best means of preservation, and disarms us of courage, our natural armour. Fool-hardiness, which is the want of a due measure of fear, leads us heedlessly into danger, and lulls us into a pernicious security. Revenge, i.e., excessive resentment by the violence of its commotion, robs us of that presence of mind which is often the best guard against injury, and inclines us to pursue the aggressor with more severity than self-defense requires. Puffianimity, or the want of a just indignation against wrong, leaves us quite unguarded, and tends to sink the mind into a passive enervated tameness. Therefore, \"to keep the defensive passions duly proportioned to our dangers, is their natural pitch and tenor.\"\n\nThe private passions lead us to pursue some positive Measure of species of private good: that good therefore which is the private object and end of each must be the measure of their respective force, and direct their operation. If they are too weak or sluggish to engage us in the pursuit of their several objects, they are evidently deficient; but if they defeat their end by their impetuosity, then are they strained beyond the just tone of nature. Thus vanity, or an excessive passion for applause, betrays into such meanness and little arts of popularity, as make us forfeit the honour we so anxiously court. On the other hand, a total indifference about the effect of mankind, removes a strong guard and spur to virtue, and lays the mind open to the most abandoned provocations. Therefore, \"to keep our private passions and desires proportioned to our wants, is the just measure and pitch of this class of affections.\"\n\nThe defensive and private passions do all agree in Comparisons general, in their tendency or conduciveness to the interest or good of the individual. Therefore, when there is a collision of interest, as may sometimes happen, that aggregate of good or happiness, which is composed of the particular goods to which they respectively tend, must be the common standard by which their comparative degrees of strength are to be measured: that is to say, if any of them, in the degree in which they prevail, are incompatible with the greatest aggregate of good or most extensive interest of the individual, then are they unequal and disproportionate. For in judging of a particular system or constitution of powers, we call that the supreme or principal end, in which the aims of the several parts or powers coincide, and to which they are subordinate; and reckon them in due proportion to each other, and right with regard to the whole, when they maintain that subordination of subordination. Therefore, \"to proportion our defensive and private passions in such measure to our dangers and wants as best to secure the individual, and obtain the greatest aggregate of private good or happiness, is their just balance or comparative standard in case of competition.\"\n\nIn like manner as the public or social affections point at the good of others, that good must be the measure of their force. When a particular social affection, as gratitude or friendship, which belongs to a particular social connexion, viz. that of a benefactor or of a friend, is too feeble to make us act the grateful or friendly part, that affection, being insufficient to answer its end, is defective and unsound. If, on the other hand, a particular passion of this class counteract or defeat the interest it is designed to promote, by its violence or disproportion, then is that passion excessive and irregular. Thus natural affection, if it degenerates into a passionate fondness, not only hinders the parents from judging coolly of the interest of their offspring, but often leads them into a most partial and pernicious indulgence.\n\nAs every kind affection points at the good of its particular object, it is possible there may sometimes be a collision of interests or goods. Thus the regard due\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nOf Moral Obligation.\n\nto a friend may interfere with that which we owe to a community. In such a competition of interests, it is evident that the greatest is to be chosen; and that is the greatest interest which contains the greatest sum or aggregate of public good, greatest in quantity as well as duration. This then is the common standard by which the respective forces and subdivisions of the social affections must be adjusted. Therefore we conclude that \"this class of affections are found and regular when they prompt us to pursue the interest of individuals in an entire confidence with the public good,\" or in other words, \"when they are duly proportioned to the dangers and wants of others, and to the various relations in which we stand to individuals or to society.\"\n\nThus we have found, by an induction of particulars, the natural pitch or tenor of the different orders of affection, considered apart by themselves. Now, as the virtue or perfection of every creature lies in following its nature, or acting suitably to the just proportion and harmony of its several powers; therefore, \"the virtue of a creature endowed with such affections as man must consist in observing or acting agreeably to their natural pitch and tenor.\"\n\nBut as there are no independent affections in the fabric of the mind, no passion that stands by itself, without some relation to the rest, we cannot pronounce of any one, considered apart, that it is either too strong or too weak. Its strength and just proportion must be measured not only by its subordination to its own immediate end, but by the respect it bears to the whole system of affections. Therefore we say a passion is too strong, not only when it defeats its own end, but when it impairs the force of other passions, which are equally necessary to form a temper of mind suited to a certain economy or state; and too weak, not merely on account of its insufficiency to answer its end, but because it cannot sustain its part or office in the balance of the whole system. Thus the love of life may be too strong when it takes from the regard due to one's country, and will not allow one bravely to encounter dangers, or even death, on its account. Again, The love of fame may be too weak when it throws down the fences which render virtue more secure, or weakens the incentives which make it more active and public spirited.\n\nIf it be asked, \"How far may the affections towards private good or happiness be indulged?\" One limit was before fixed for the particular indulgence of each, viz. their subordination to the common aggregate of good to the private system. In these therefore a due regard is always supposed to be had to health, reputation, fortune, the freedom of action, the unimpaired exercise of reason, the calm enjoyment of one's self, which are all private goods. Another limit now results from the balance of affection just named, viz. \"The security and happiness of others;\" or, to express it more generally, \"a private affection may be safely indulged, when, by that indulgence, we do not violate the obligations which result from our higher relations or public connexions.\" A just respect therefore being had to these boundaries which nature has fixed in the breast of every man, what should limit our pursuits of private happiness? Is nature fickle and penurious? or, does the God of nature envy the happiness of his offspring?\n\nWhether there is ever a real collision of interests between the public and private system of affections, or collision of the ends which each class has in view, will be afterwards considered; but where there is no collision, there is little or no danger of carrying either, but especially the public affections, to excess, provided both kinds are kept subordinate to a discreet and cool self-love, and to a calm and universal benevolence, which principles stand as guards at the head of each system.\n\nThis then is the conduct of the passions, considered as particular and separate forces, carrying us out to their respective ends; and this is their balance or economy, considered as compound powers, or powers mutually related, acting in conjunction towards a common end, and consequently forming a system or whole.\n\nNow, whatever adjusts or maintains this balance, whatever in the human constitution is formed for direction of recting the passions so as to keep them from defeating their own end or interfering with each other, must be a principle of a superior nature to them, and ought to direct their measures and govern their proportions. But it was found that reason or reflection is such a principle, which points out the tendency of our passions, weighs their influence upon private and public happiness, and shows the best means of attaining either. It having been likewise found that there is another directing or controlling principle, which we call conscience or the moral sense, which, by a native kind of authority, judges of affections and actions, pronouncing some just and good, and others unjust and ill; it follows, that the passions, which are mere impulse or blind forces, are principles inferior and subordinate to this judging faculty. Therefore, if we would follow the order of nature, i.e. observe the mutual respects and the subordination which the different parts of the human constitution bear one to another, the passions ought to be subjected to the direction and authority of the leading or controlling principles.\n\nWe conclude, therefore, from this induction, that in what the constitution or just economy of human nature consists in a regular subordination of the passions and affections to the authority of conscience and the direction of reason.\n\nThat subordination is regular, when the proportion formerly mentioned is maintained; that is to say, \"when the defensive passions are kept proportioned to our dangers; when the private passions are proportioned to our wants; and when the public affections are adapted to our public connexions, and proportioned to the wants and dangers of others.\"\n\nBut the natural state, or the sound and vigorous constitution of any creature, or the just economy of its virtue and powers, we call its health and perfection; and the acting perfection, agreeably to these, its virtue or goodness. Therefore, \"the health and perfection of man must lie in the aforesaid supremacy of conscience and reason, and in the subordination of the passions to their authority and direction. And his virtue or goodness must consist in acting agreeably to that order or economy.\"\n\nThat such an ornament of the mind, and such a how conduct of its powers and passions, will stand the test formidable of reason, cannot admit of any dispute. For, upon a fair\nPart I.\n\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nOf Moral Obligation.\n\nfair examination into the consequences of things, or the relations and aptitudes of means to ends, reason evidently demonstrates, and experience confirms it, that, \"to have our defensive passions duly proportioned to our dangers, is the surest way to avoid or get clear of them, and obtain the security we seek after.—To proportion our private passions to our wants, is the best means to supply them;—and, to adapt our public affections to our social relations, and the good of others, is the most effectual method of fulfilling the one, and procuring the other.\" In this sense, therefore, virtue may be said to be a \"conduct conformable to reason,\" as reason discovers an apparent aptitude, in such an order and economy of powers and passions, to answer the end for which they are naturally formed.\n\nIf the idea of moral obligation is to be deduced merely from this aptitude or connexion between certain passions and ends, or a certain order and balance of passions, and certain ends obtained or to be obtained by them, then is reason or reflection, which perceives that aptitude or connexion, the proper judge of moral obligation; and on this supposition it may be defined, as hath been done by some, the connexion between the affection and the end, or, which is the same thing, between the action and the motive; for the end is the motive or the final cause, and the affection is the action, or its immediate natural cause. A man, from mere self-love, may be induced to fulfil that obligation which is founded on the connexion between the defensive passions and their ends, or the private passions and their ends; because in that case his own interest will prompt him to indulge them in the due proportion required. But if he has no affections which point beyond himself, no principle but self-love, or some subtle modification of it, what shall interest him in the happiness of others, where there is no connexion between it and his own? or what sense can he have of moral obligation to promote it? Upon this scheme, therefore, without public or social affection, there could be no motive, and consequently no moral obligation, to a benevolent disinterested conduct.\n\nBut if the mere connexion between certain passions, or a certain order of passions, and certain ends, is what constitutes or gives us the idea of moral obligation, then why may not the appetites of any temper or conduct, nay, of any piece of machinery, to obtain its end, form an equally strict moral obligation? for the connexion and aptitude are as strong and invariable in the latter instances as in the former. But as this is confounding the most obvious differences of things, we must trace the idea of moral obligation to another and a more natural source.\n\nLet us appeal, therefore, to our inmost sense and experience, \"how we stand affected to those different sets of passions, in the just measure and balance of which we found a right temper to consult.\" For this is entirely a matter of experience, in which we must examine, as in any other natural inquiry, \"what are the genuine feelings and operations of nature, and what affections or symptoms of them appear in the given instance.\"\n\nThe defensive passions, as anger and fear, give us rather pain than pleasure, yet we cannot help feeling them when provoked by injury, or exposed to harm. We account the creature imperfect that wants them, because they are necessary to his defence. Nay, we should in some measure condemn ourselves, did we want the necessary degree of resentment and caution. But if our resentment exceeds the wrong received, or our caution the evil dreaded, we then blame ourselves for having overacted our part. Therefore, while we are in danger, to be totally destitute of them we reckon a blamable defect, and to feel them in a just, i.e. necessary measure, we approve, as suited to the nature and condition of such a creature as man. But our security obtained, to continue to indulge them, we not only disapprove as hurtful, but condemn as unmanly, unbecoming, and mean-spirited: Nor will such a conduct afford any self-approving joy when we coolly reflect upon it.\n\nWith regard to the private passions, such as love of life, pleasure, ease, and the like, as these aim at private, vate good, and are necessary to the perfection and happiness of the individual, we should reckon any creature defective, and even blameworthy, that was destitute of them. Thus, we condemn the man who imprudently ruins his fortune, impairs his health, or exposes his life; we not only pity him as an unfortunate creature, but feel a kind of moral indignation and contempt of him, for having made himself such. On the other hand, though a discreet self-regard does not attract our esteem and veneration, yet we approve of it in some degree, in a higher and different degree from what we would regard a well contrived machine, as necessary to constitute a finished creature, nay, to complete the virtuous character, as exactly suited to our present indigent state. There are some passions respecting private good, towards which we feel higher degrees of approbation, as the love of knowledge, of action, of honour, and the like. We esteem them as marks of an ingenious mind; and cannot help thinking the character in which they are wanting remarkably stupid, and in some degree immoral.\n\nWith regard to the social affections, as compassion, why the natural affection, friendship, benevolence, and the like, public, we approve, admire, and love them in ourselves, and, in all whom we discover them, with an esteem and approbation, if not different in kind, yet surely far superior in degree, to what we feel towards the other passions. These we reckon necessary, just, and excellently fitted to our structure and state; and the creature which wants them we call defective, ill-constituted, a kind of abortion. But the public affections we esteem as self-worthy, originally and eternally amiable.\n\nBut among the social affections we make an obvious distinction and constant distinction, viz. between those particular between passions which urge us with a sudden violence, and uneasy kind of elevation, to pursue the good of their respective objects, as pity, natural affection, and the like; and those calm dispassionate affections and desires which prompt us more steadily and uniformly to promote the happiness of others. The former we generally call passions, to distinguish them from the other sort, which go more commonly by the name of affections, or calm desires. The first kind we approve indeed, and delight in; but we feel still higher degrees of approbation and moral complacence towards the last, and towards all limitation of the particular instincts, by the principle of universal benevolence. The more objects the calm affections take in, and the worthier these are, their dignity\nnity rises in proportion, and with this our approbation keeps in exact pace. A character, on the other hand, which is quite divested of these public affections, which feels no love for the species, but instead of it entertains malice, rancour, and ill will, we reckon totally immoral and unnatural.\n\nSuch then are the sentiments and dispositions we feel when these several orders of affections pass before the mental eye.\n\nTherefore, \"that state in which we feel ourselves moved, in the manner above described, towards those affections and passions, as they come under the mind's review, and in which we are, instantaneously and independently of our choice or volition, prompted to a correspondent conduct, we call a state of moral obligation.\"\n\nLet us suppose, for instance, a parent, a friend, a benefactor, reduced to a condition of the utmost indigence and distress, and that it is in our power to give them immediate relief. To what conduct are we obliged? What duty does nature dictate and require in such a case? Attend to nature, and nature will tell, with a voice irresistibly audible and commanding to the human heart, with an authority which no man can silence without being self-condemned, and which no man can elude but at his peril, \"that immediate relief ought to be given.\" Again, let a friend, a neighbour, or even a stranger, have lodged a deposit in our hands, and after some time reclaim it; no sooner do these ideas of the confidence reposed in us, and of property not transferred, but deposited, occur, than we immediately and unavoidably feel and recognize the obligation to restore it. In both these cases we should condemn and even loathe ourselves if we acted otherwise, as having done, or omitted doing, what we ought not, as having acted beneath the dignity of our nature;—contrary to our most intimate sense of right and wrong,—we should accuse ourselves as guilty of ingratitude, injustice, and humanity,—and be conscious of deserving the censure, and therefore dread the resentment, of all rational beings.\n\nBut in complying with the obligation, we feel joy and self-approbation,—are conscious of an inviolable harmony between our nature and duty, and think ourselves entitled to the applause of every impartial spectator of our conduct.\n\nTo describe, therefore, what we cannot perhaps define, a state of moral obligation is \"that state in which a creature, endued with such senses, powers, and affections as man, would condemn himself, and think he deserved the condemnation of all others, should he refuse to fulfil it; but would approve himself, and expect the approbation of all others, upon complying with it.\"\n\nAnd we call him a moral agent, who is in such a state, or is subject to moral obligation. Therefore, as man's structure and connexions often subject him to such a state of moral obligation, we conclude that he is a moral agent. But as man may sometimes act without knowing what he does, as in cases of frenzy or disease, or in many natural functions; or, knowing what he does, he may act without choice or affection, as in cases of necessity or compulsion; therefore, to denominate an action moral, i.e., approvable, or blameable, it must be done knowingly and willingly, or from affection and choice. \"A morally good action, then, is to fulfil a moral obligation knowingly and willingly.\" And a morally bad action, or an immoral action, is, \"to violate a moral obligation knowingly and willingly.\"\n\nAs not an action, but a series of actions, constitute a character; so not an affection, but a series of affections, constitute a temper; and as we denominate things by nature and the gross, a fortiori, or by the qualities which chiefly temper prevail in them; therefore we call that a \"morally good character,\" in which a series of morally good actions prevail; and that a \"morally good temper,\" in which a series of morally good affections have the ascendant.\n\nA bad character and bad temper are the reverse. But where the above-mentioned order or proportion of passions is maintained, there a series of morally good affections and actions will prevail. Therefore, \"to maintain that order and proportion, is to have a morally good temper and character.\" But a \"morally good temper and character is moral rectitude, integrity, virtue, or the completion of duty.\"\n\nIf it be asked, after all, \"how we come by the idea of moral obligation or duty?\" we may answer, That come by we come by it in the same way as by our other original perceptions. We receive them all from nature, or the great Author of nature. For this idea of moral obligation is not a creature of the mind, or dependent on any previous act of volition; but arises on certain occasions, or when certain other ideas are presented to the mind, as necessarily, instantaneously, and unavoidably, as pain does upon too near an approach to the fire, or pleasure from the fruition of any good. It does not, for instance, depend on our choice, whether we shall feel the obligation to succour a distressed parent, or to restore a deposit intrusted to us when it is recalled. We cannot call this a compound idea made up of one or more simple ideas. We may indeed, nay we must, have some ideas antecedent to it, e.g., that of a parent—in distress—of a child—able to relieve—of the relation of one to the other—of a truth—of right, &c. But none of these ideas constitute the perception of obligation. This is an idea quite distinct from, and something superadded to, the ideas of the correlatives, or the relation subsisting between them. These indeed, by a law of our nature, are the occasion of suggesting it; but they are as totally different from it as colours are from sounds. By sense of reflection we perceive the correlatives; our memory recalls the favours or deposits we received; the various circumstances of the case are matters of fact or experience; but some delicate inward organ or power, or call it what we please, does, by a certain instantaneous sympathy, antecedent to the cool deductions of reason, and independent of previous instruction, or volition, perceive the moral harmony, the living, irresistible charm of moral obligation, which immediately interests the correspondent passions, and prompts us to fulfil its lawful dictates.\n\nWe need not apprehend any danger from the quickness of its decisions, nor be frightened because it looks like instinct, and has been called so. Would we approve one for deliberating long, or reasoning the matter much at leisure, whether he should relieve a distressed parent, feed a starving neighbour, or restore the trust committed to him? should we not suspect the reasoner of knavery, or of very weak affections to virtue? We employ reason, and worthily employ it, in examining the condition, relations, and other circumstances of the agent or patient, or of those with whom\nwhom either of them are connected, or, in other words, the state of the case: and in complicated cases, where the circumstances are many, it may require no small attention to find the true state of the case; but when the relations of the agent or patient, and the circumstances of the action are obvious, or come out such after a fair trial, we should scarcely approve him who demurs on the obligation to that conduct which the case suggests.\n\nFrom what has been said, it is evident, that it is not the pleasure or agreeable sensations which accompany the exercise of the several affections, nor those consequent to the actions, that constitute moral obligation, or excite in us the idea of it. That pleasure is posterior to the idea of obligation; and frequently we are obliged, and acknowledge ourselves under an obligation, to such affections and actions as are attended with pain; as in the trials of virtue, where we are obliged to sacrifice private to public good, or a present pleasure to a future interest. We have pleasure in serving an aged parent, but it is neither the perception nor prospect of that pleasure which gives us the idea of obligation to that conduct.\n\n**CHAP. III. The Final Causes of our moral Faculties of Perception and Affection.**\n\nWe have now taken a general prospect of man and of his moral powers and connexions, and on these erected a scheme of duty, or moral obligation, which seems to be confirmed by experience, conformant to reason, and approved by his most inward and most sacred senses. It may be proper, in the next place, to take a more particular view of the final causes of those delicate springs by which he is impelled to action, and of those clays by which he is restrained from it. By this detail we shall be able to judge of their aptitude to answer their end, in a creature endowed with his capacities, subject to his wants, exposed to his dangers, and susceptible of his enjoyments; and from thence we shall be in a condition to pronounce concerning the end of his whole structure, its harmony with its state, and consequently its subordination to answer the great and benevolent intentions of its Author.\n\nThe supreme Being has seen fit to blend in the whole system of things a prodigious variety of discordant and contrary principles, light and darkness, pleasure and pain, good and evil. There are multifarious natures, higher and lower, and many intermediate ones between the wide-distant extremes. These are differently situated, variously adjusted, and subjected to each other, and all of them subordinate to the order and perfection of the whole. We may suppose man placed as in a centre amidst those innumerable orders of beings, by his outward frame drawing to the material system, and by his inward connected with the intellectual or moral, and of course affected by the laws which govern both, or affected by that good and that ill which result from those laws. In this infinite variety of relations with which he is surrounded, and of contingencies to which he is liable, he feels strong attractions to the good, and violent repulsions or aversions to the ill. But as good and ill are often blended, and wonderfully complicated one with the other; as they sometimes immediately produce and run up into each other, and at other times lie at great distances, yet by means of intervening links introduce one another; and as these effects are often brought about in consequence of hidden relations and general laws, of the energy of which he is an incompetent judge; it is easy for him to mistake good for evil, and evil for good, and consequently he may be frequently attracted by such things as are destructive or repel such as are salutary. Thus, by the tender and complicated frame of his body, he is subjected to a great variety of ills, to sicknesses, cold, heat, fatigue, and innumerable wants. Yet his knowledge is so narrow without, and his reason so weak, that in many cases he cannot judge, in the way of investigation or reasoning, of the connexions of those effects with their respective causes, or of the various latent energies of natural things. He is therefore informed of this connexion by the experience of certain senses or organs of perception, which by a mechanical instantaneous motion, feel the good and the ill, receiving pleasure from one, and pain from the other. By these, without any reasoning, he is taught to attract or choose what tends to his welfare, and to repel and avoid what tends to his ruin. Thus, by his senses of taste and smell, or by the pleasure he receives from certain kinds of food, he is admonished which agree with his constitution; and by an opposite sense of pain he is informed which sort disagree, or are destructive of it; but is not by means of this instructed in the inward natures and constitutions of things.\n\nSome of these senses are armed with strong degrees of uneasiness or pain, in order to urge him to seek after pettites and such objects as are suited to them. And these sensations, except his more immediate and pressing wants; as the sense of hunger, thirst, cold, and the like; which, by their painful importunities, compel him to provide food, drink, raiment, shelter. Those instincts by which we are thus prompted with some kind of commotion or violence to attract and pursue good, or to repel and avoid ill, we call appetites and passions. By our senses then we are informed of what is good or ill to the private system, or the individual; and by our private appetites and passions we are impelled to one, and restrained from the other.\n\nIn consequence of this machinery, and the great man's out-train of wants to which our nature subjects us, we are ward state engaged in a continued series of occupations, which often require much application of thought, or great bodily labour, or both. The necessaries of life, food, clothes, shelter, and the like, must be provided; conveniences must be acquired to render life still more easy and comfortable. In order to obtain these, arts, industry, manufactures, and trade are necessary. And to secure to us the peaceable enjoyment of their fruits, civil government, policy, and laws, must be contrived, and the various business of public life carried on; thus, while man is concerned and busied in making provision, or obtaining security for himself, he is by degrees engaged in connexions with a family, friends, neighbours, a community, or a commonwealth. Hence arise new wants, new interests, new cares, and new employments. The passions of one man interfere with those of another. Interests are opposed. Competitions arise, contrary courses are taken. Disappointments happen, distinctions are made, and parties formed. This opens a vast scene...\nOf Perception and Affection.\n\nScene of distraction and embarrassment, and introduces a mighty train of good and ill, both public and private. Yet amidst all this confusion and hurry, plans of action must be laid, consequences foreseen or guarded against, inconveniences provided for; and frequently particular resolutions must be taken, and schemes executed, without reasoning or delay.\n\nNow what provision has the Author of our nature made for this necessitous condition? how has he fitted the actor, man, for playing his part in this perplexed and busy scene?\n\nOur supreme Parent, watchful for the whole, has not left himself without a witness here neither, and hath made nothing imperfect, but all things are double one against the other. He has not left man to be informed, only by the cool notices of reason, of the good or ill, the happiness or misery of his fellow creatures.—He has made him sensible of their good and happiness, but especially of their ill and misery, by an immediate sympathy, or quick feeling of pleasure and of pain.\n\nThe latter we call pity or compassion. For the former, though every one, who is not quite divested of humanity, feels it in some degree, we have not got a name, unless we call it congratulation or joyful sympathy, or that good humour which arises on seeing others pleased or happy. Both these feelings have been called in general the public or common sense, νοῦς μακρονόμων, by which we feel for others, and are interested in their concerns as really, though perhaps less sensibly, than in our own.\n\nWhen we see our fellow creatures unhappy through the fault or injury of others, we feel resentment or indignation against the unjust causers of that misery.—If we are conscious that it has happened through our fault or injurious conduct, we feel shame; and both these feelings of senses and passions, regarding misery and wrong, are armed with such sharp sensations of pain, as not only prove a powerful guard and security to the species, or public system, against those ills it may, but serve also to lessen or remove those ills it does suffer. Compassion draws us out of ourselves to bear a part of the misfortunes of others, powerfully solicits us in their favour, melts us at the sight of their distresses, and makes us in some degree unhappy till they are relieved from it. It is peculiarly well adapted to the condition of human life, because it is much more and oftener in our power to do mischief than good, and to prevent or lessen misery than to communicate positive happiness; and therefore it is an admirable restraint upon the more selfish passions, or those violent impulses that carry us to the hurt of others.\n\nThere are other particular instincts or passions which interest us in the concerns of others, even while we are most busy about our own, and which are strongly attractive of good, and repulsive of ill to them. Such are natural affection, friendship, love, gratitude, desire of fame, love of society, of one's country, and others that might be named. Now as the private appetites and passions were found to be armed with strong sensations of desire and uneasiness, to prompt man the more effectually to sustain labours, and to encounter dangers in pursuit of those goods that are necessary to the preservation and welfare of the individual, and to avoid those ills which tend to his destruction; in like manner it was necessary, that this other class of desires and affections should be prompted with as quick sensations of pain, not only to counteract the strength of their antagonists, but to engage us in a virtuous activity for our relations, families, friends, neighbours, country. Indeed our sense of right and wrong will admonish us that it is our duty, and reason and experience farther assure us that it is both our interest and best security, to promote the happiness of others; but that senses, that reason, and that experience, would frequently prove but weak and ineffectual prompters to such a conduct, especially in cases of danger and hardship, and amidst all the importunities of nature, and that constant hurry in which the private passions involve us, without the aid of those particular kind affections which mark out to us particular spheres of duty, and with an agreeable violence engage and fix us down to them.\n\nIt is evident, therefore, that those two classes of affection, the private and public, are set one against the other, and designed to control and limit each other's passions, influence, and thereby to produce a just balance in the whole. In general, the violent sensations of pain and uneasiness which accompany hunger, thirst, and the other private appetites, or too great fatigue of mind as well as of body, prevent the individual from running to great excesses in the exercise of the higher functions of the mind, as too intense thought in the search of truth, violent application to business of any kind, and different degrees of romantic heroism. On the other hand, the finer senses of perception, and those generous desires and affections which are connected with them, the love of action, of imitation, of truth, honour, public virtue, and the like, are wisely placed in the opposite scale, in order to prevent us from sinking into the dregs of the animal life, and debauching the dignity of man below the condition of brutes. So that, by the mutual reaction of those opposite powers, the bad effects are prevented that would naturally result from their acting singly and apart, and the good effects are produced which each are severally formed to produce.\n\nThe same wholesome opposition appears likewise in the particular counter-workings of the private and public affections one against the other. Thus compassion is adapted to counterpoise the love of ease, of pleasure, and of life, and to disarm or to let bounds to resentment; and resentment of injury done to ourselves, or to our friends who are dearer than ourselves, prevents an effeminate compassion or conformation, and gives us a noble contempt of labour, pain, and death. Natural affection, friendship, love of one's country, nay, zeal for any particular virtue, are frequently more than a match for the whole train of selfish passions. —On the other hand, without that intimate overruling passion of self-love, and those private desires which are connected with it, the social and tender instincts of the human heart would degenerate into the wildest dotage, the most torturing anxiety, and downright frenzy.\n\nBut not only are the different orders or classes of affection checks one upon another, but passions of the same class are mutual clogs. Thus, how many are the same withheld from the violent outrages of resentment by fear! and how easily is fear controlled in its turn, while mighty wrongs awaken a mighty resentment!\nThe private passions often interfere, and therefore moderate the violence of each other; and a calm self-love is placed at their head, to direct, influence, and control their particular attractions and repulsions. The public affections likewise restrain one another; and all of them are put under the control of a calm dispassionate benevolence, which ought in like manner to direct and limit their particular motions. Thus most part, if not all the passions, have a twofold aspect, and serve a twofold end. In one view they may be considered as powers, impelling mankind to a certain course, with a force proportioned to the apprehended moment of the good they aim at. In another view they appear as weights, balancing the action of the powers, and controlling the violence of their impulses. By means of these powers and weights a natural poise is settled in the human breast by its all-wise Author, by which the creature is kept tolerably steady and regular in his course, amidst that variety of stages through which he must pass.\n\nBut this is not all the provision which God has made perceptions for the hurry and perplexity of the scene in which man is destined to act. Amidst those infinite attractions and repulsions towards private and public good and ill, mankind either cannot often foresee the consequences or tendencies of all their actions towards one or other of these, especially where those tendencies are intricate and point different ways, or those consequences remote and complicated; or though, by careful and cool inquiry, and a due improvement of their rational powers, they might find them out, yet, distracted as they are with busines, amused with trifles, dissipated by pleasure, and disturbed by passion, they either have or can find no leisure to attend to those consequences, or to examine how far this or that conduct is productive of private or public good on the whole. Therefore, were it left entirely to the slow and sober deductions of reason to trace those tendencies, and make out those consequences, it is evident, that in many particular instances the busines of life must stand still, and many important occasions of action be lost, or perhaps the greatest blunders be committed. On this account, the Deity, besides that general approbation which we believe on every degree of kind affection, has moreover implanted in man many particular perceptions or determinations to approve of certain qualities or actions, which, in effect, tend to the advantage of society, and are connected with private good, though he does not always see that tendency, nor mind that connexion. And these perceptions or determinations do, without reasoning, point out, and, antecedent to views of interest, prompt to a conduct beneficial to the public, and useful to the private system. Such is that sense of candour and veracity, that abhorrence of fraud and falsehood, that sense of fidelity, justice, gratitude, greatness of mind, fortitude, clemency, decorum, and that disapprobation of knavery, injustice, ingratitude, meanness of spirit, cowardice, cruelty, and indecorum, which are natural to the human mind. The former of those dispositions, and the actions flowing from them, are approved, and those of the latter kind disapproved by us, even abstracted from the view of their tendency or conduciveness to the happiness or misery of others, or of ourselves. In one we discern a beauty, a superior excellency, a congruity to the dignity of man; in the other a deformity, a littleness, a debasement, of human nature.\n\nThere are other principles also connected with the good of society, or the happiness and perfection of the individual, though that connexion is not immediately apparent, which we behold with real complacency and an inferior approbation, though perhaps inferior in degree, if not in kind, such as gravity, modesty, simplicity of deportment, temperance, prudent economy; and we feel some degree of contempt and dislike where they are wanting, or where the opposite qualities prevail. These and the like perceptions or feelings are either different modifications of the moral sense, or subordinate to it, and plainly serve the same important purpose, being expeditious monitors, in the several emergencies of a various and diversified life, of what is right, what is wrong, what is to be pursued, and what avoided; and, by the pleasant or painful consciousness which attends them, exerting their influence as powerful prompters to a suitable conduct.\n\nFrom a slight inspection of the above-named principles, it is evident they all carry a friendly aspect to rational tendencies and the individual, and have a more immediate or a more remote tendency to promote the perfection or good of both. This tendency cannot be always foreseen, and would be often mistaken or seldom attended to by a weak, busy, short-sighted creature like man, both rash and variable in his opinions, a dupe to his own passions, or to the designs of others, liable to fickleness, to want, and to error. Principles, therefore, which are so nearly linked with private security and public good, by directing him, without operose reasoning, where to find the one, and how to promote the other; and, by prompting him to a conduct conducive to both, are admirably adapted to the exigencies of his present state, and wisely calculated to obtain the ends of universal benevolence.\n\nIt was easy, by considering the subject in another light, to show, in a curious detail of particulars, how led to a wonderfully the inside of man, or that astonishing train state of moral powers and affections with which he is endowed, is fitted to the several stages of that progressive and probationary state through which he is destined to pass. As our faculties are narrow and limited, and rise from very small and imperfect beginnings, they must be improved by exercise, by attention, and repeated trials. And this holds true not only of our intellectual but of our moral and active powers. The former are liable to errors in speculation, the latter to blunders in practice, and both often terminate in misfortunes and pains. And those errors and blunders are generally owing to our passions, or to our too forward and warm admiration of those partial goods they naturally pursue, or to our fear of those partial ills they naturally repel. Those misfortunes, therefore, lead us back to consider where our misconduct lay, and whence our errors flowed; and consequently are salutary pieces of trial, which tend to enlarge our views, to correct and refine our passions, and consequently improve both our intellectual and moral powers. Our passions then are the rude materials of our virtue, which Heaven has given us to work up, to refine and polish into a harmonious and divine piece of workmanship. They furnish out the whole machinery, the calms and storms, the lights and shades of human life. They show mankind in every attitude.\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nOf Duty or attitude and variety of character, and give virtue both its struggles and its triumphs. To conduct them well in every state, is merit; to abuse or misapply them, is demerit.\n\nThe different sets of senses, powers, and passions, which unfold themselves in those successive stages, are both necessary and adapted to that rising and progressive state. Enlarging views and growing connexions require new passions and new habits; and thus the mind, by these continually expanding and finding a progressive exercise, rises to higher improvements, and pushes forward to maturity and perfection.\n\nIn this beautiful economy and harmony of our structure, both outward and inward, with that state, we may at once discern the great lines of our duty traced out in the fairest and brightest characters, and contemplate with admiration a more august and marvellous scene of divine wisdom and goodness laid in the human breast, than we shall perhaps find in the whole compass of nature.\n\nFrom this detail it appears, that man, by his original frame, is made for a temperate, compassionate, benevolent, active, and progressive state. He is strongly attractive of the good, and repulsive of the ill which befall others as well as himself. He feels the highest approbation and moral complacency in those affections, and economy in those actions, which immediately and directly respect the good of others, and the highest disapprobation and abhorrence of the contrary. Besides these, he has many particular perceptions or instincts of approbation, which, though perhaps not of the same kind with the others, yet are accompanied with correspondent degrees of affection, proportioned to their respective tendencies to the public good. Therefore, by acting agreeably to these principles, man acts agreeably to his structure, and fulfils the benevolent intentions of its Author. But we call a thing good when it answers its end, and a creature good, when he acts in conformity to his constitution. Consequently, man must be denominated good or virtuous when he acts suitably to the principles and destination of his nature.\n\nPART II.\n\nCHAP. I. The principal Distinctions of Duty or Virtue.\n\nWE have now considered the constitution and connexions of man, and on those erected a general system of duty or moral obligation, conformant to reason, approved by his most sacred and intimate sense, suitable to his mixed condition, and confirmed by the experience of mankind. We have also traced the final causes of his moral faculties and affections to those noble purposes they answer, with regard both to the private and the public system.\n\nFrom this induction it is evident, that there is one order or class of duties which man owes to himself: another to society: and a third to God.\n\nThe duties he owes to himself are founded chiefly on the defensive and private passions, which prompt him to pursue whatever tends to private good or happiness, and to avoid or ward off whatever tends to private ill or misery. Among the various goods which allure and solicit him, and the various ills which attack or threaten him, \"to be intelligent and accurate in selecting one, and rejecting the other, or in preferring the most excellent goods, and avoiding the most terrible ills, when there is a competition among either, and to be discreet in using the best means to attain the goods and avoid the ills, is what we call prudence.\" This, in our inward frame, corresponds to sagacity, or quickness of sense, in our outward.—\"To proportion our defensive passions to our dangers, we call fortitude; which always implies \"a just mixture of calm resentment and animosity, and well-governed caution.\" And this firmness of mind answers to the strength and musculation of the body. And \"duty to adjust our private passions to our wants, or to the respective moment of the good we affect or pursue, we call temperance;\" which does therefore always imply, in this large sense of the word, \"a just balance or command of the passions,\"\n\nThe second class of duties arises from the public or social affections, \"the just harmony or proportion of society, which to the dangers and wants of others, and to the several relations we bear, commonly goes by the name of justice.\" This includes the whole of our duty to society, to our parents, and the general polity of nature; particularly gratitude, friendship, sincerity, natural affection, benevolence, and the other social virtues: This, being the noblest temper, and fairest complexion of the soul, corresponds to the beauty and fine proportion of the person. The virtues comprehended under the former class, especially prudence and fortitude, may likewise be transferred to this; and according to the various circumstances in which they are placed, and the more confined or more extensive sphere in which they operate, may be denominated private, economical, or civil prudence, fortitude, &c. These direct our conduct with regard to the wants and dangers of those lesser or greater circles with which they are connected.\n\nThe third class of duties respects the Deity, and duties to arise from the public affections, and the several glorious God-relations, which he sustains to us as our Creator, Benefactor, Lawgiver, Judge, &c.\n\nWe choose to consider this set of duties in the last Method place; because, though prior in dignity and excellency, they seem to be lost in order of time, as thinking it the most simple and easy method to follow the gradual progress of nature, as it takes its rise from individuals, and spreads through the social system, and still ascends upwards, till at length it stretches to its almighty Parent and Head, and so terminates in those duties which are highest and best.\n\nThe duties resulting from these relations are, reverence, gratitude, love, resignation, dependence, obedience, worship, praise: which, according to the model of our finite capacities, must maintain some sort of proportion to the grandeur and perfection of the object whom we venerate, love, and obey. \"This proportion or harmony is expressed by the general name of piety or devotion,\"\nPart II.\n\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nOf Man's devotion,\" which is always stronger or weaker according to the greater or less apprehended excellency of its object. This sublime principle of virtue is the enlivening soul which animates the moral system, and that cement which binds and sustains the other duties which man owes to himself or to society.\n\nThis then is the general temper and constitution of virtue, and these are the principal lines or divisions of duty. To those good dispositions which respect the several objects of our duty, and to all actions which flow from such dispositions, the mind gives its sanction or testimony. And this sanction or judgement concerning the moral quality, or the goodness of actions or dispositions, moralists call conscience. When it judges of an action that is to be performed, it is called an antecedent conscience; and when it passes sentence on an action which is performed, it is called a subsequent conscience. The tendency of an action to produce happiness, or its external conformity to a law, is termed its material goodness. But the good dispositions from which an action proceeds, or its conformity to law in every respect, constitutes its formal goodness.\n\nWhen the mind is ignorant or uncertain about the moment of an action or its tendency to private or public good; or when there are several circumstances in the case, some of which, being doubtful, render the mind dubious concerning the morality of the action; that is called a doubtful or scrupulous conscience; if it mistakes concerning these, it is called an erroneous conscience. If the error or ignorance is involuntary or invincible, the action proceeding from that error, or from that ignorance, is reckoned innocent, or not imputable. If the error or ignorance is supine or affected, i.e. the effect of negligence, or of affectation and wilful inadvertence, the conduct flowing from such error, or such ignorance, is criminal and imputable.—Not to follow one's conscience, though erroneous and ill-informed, is criminal, as it is the guide of life; and to counteract it, shows a depraved and incorrigible spirit. Yet to follow an erroneous conscience is likewise criminal, if that error which misled the conscience was the effect of inattention, or any criminal passion.*\n\n* Hutcheson, Mor. Inq. Lib. ii. c. 3.\n\nIf it be asked, \"How an erroneous conscience shall be rectified, since it is supposed to be the only guide of life, and judge of morals?\" we answer, In the very same way that we would rectify reason if at any time it should judge wrong, as it often does, viz. by giving it proper and sufficient materials for judging right, i.e. by inquiring into the whole state of the case, the relations, connexions, and several obligations of the actor, the consequences and other circumstances of the action, or the surpluflage of private or public good which results, or is likely to result, from the action or from the omission of it. If those circumstances are fairly and fully stated, the conscience will be just and impartial in its decision; for, by a necessary law of our nature, it approves and is well affected to the moral form; and if it seems to approve of vice or immorality, it is always under the notion or mark of some virtue. So that, strictly speaking, it is not conscience which errs; for its sentence is always conformable to the view of the case which lies before it; and is just, upon the supposition that the case is truly such as it is represented to it. All the fault is to be imputed to the agent, who neglects to be better informed, or who, through weakness or wickedness, hastes to pass sentence from an imperfect evidence.\n\nCHAP. II. Of Man's Duty to Himself. Of the Nature of Good, and the Chief Good.\n\nEvery creature, by the constitution of his nature, is determined to love himself; to pursue whatever tends good to his preservation and happiness, and to avoid whatever tends to his hurt and misery. Being endowed with senses and perception, he must necessarily receive pleasure from some objects, and pain from others. Those objects which give pleasure are called good; and those which give pain, evil. To the former he feels that attraction or motion we call desire, or love; to the latter, that impulse we call aversion, or hatred.—To objects which suggest neither pleasure nor pain, and are apprehended of no use to procure one or ward off the other, we feel neither desire nor aversion; and such objects are called indifferent. Those objects which do not of themselves produce pleasure or pain, but are the means of procuring either, we call useful or noxious. Towards them we are affected in a subordinate manner, or with an indirect and reflective rather than a direct and immediate affection. All the original and particular affections of our nature lead us out to and ultimately rest in the first kind of objects, viz. those which give immediate pleasure, and which we therefore call good directly so. The calm affection of self-love alone is conversant about such objects as are only consequentially good, or merely useful to ourselves.\n\nBut, besides those sorts of objects which we call Moral good, merely and solely as they give pleasure, or are good means of procuring it, there is a higher and nobler species of good, towards which we feel that peculiar movement we call approbation or moral complacency; and which we therefore denominate moral good. Such are our affections, and the consequent actions to them. The perception of this is, as has been already observed, quite distinct in kind from the perception of other species; and though it may be connected with pleasure or advantage by the benevolent constitution of nature, yet it constitutes a good independent of that pleasure and that advantage, and far superior not in degree only but in dignity to both. The other, viz. the natural good, consists in obtaining those pleasures which are adapted to the peculiar senses and passions susceptible of them, and is as various as are those senses and passions. This, viz. the moral, good, lies in the right conduct of the several senses and passions, or their just proportion and accommodation to their respective objects and relations, and this is of a more simple and invariable kind.\n\nBy our several senses we are capable of a great variety of pleasing sensations. These constitute distinct ends or objects ultimately purifiable for their own sake. To these ends, or ultimate objects, correspond peculiar appetites or affections, which prompt the mind to pursue them. When these ends are attained, there it rests, and looks no farther. Whatever therefore is purifiable, not on its own account, but as subservient or necessary to the attainment of something else that is intrinsically valuable for its own sake, be that value ever so great or ever so small, we call a mean,\nmean, and not an end. So that ends and means constitute the materials or the very essence of our happiness. Consequently happiness, i.e., human happiness, cannot be one simple uniform thing in creatures constituted, as we are, with such various senses of pleasure, or such different capacities of enjoyment. Now the same principle, or law of our nature, which determines us to pursue any one end or species of good, prompts us to pursue every other end or species of good of which we are susceptible, or to which our Maker has adapted an original propensity. But amidst the great multiplicity of ends or goods which form the various ingredients of our happiness, we perceive an evident gradation or subordination suited to that gradation of senses, powers, and passions, which prevails in our mixed and various constitution, and to that ascending series of connexions which open upon us in the different stages of our progressive state.\n\nThus the goods of the body, or of the external senses, seem to hold the lowest rank in this gradation or scale of goods. These we have in common with the brutes; and though many men are brutish enough to pursue the goods of the body with a more than brutal fury, yet, when at any time they come in competition with goods of a higher order, the unanimous verdict of mankind, by giving the last the preference, condemns the first to the meanest place. Goods consisting in exterior social connexions, as fame, fortune, power, civil authority, seem to succeed next, and are chiefly valuable as the means of procuring natural or moral good, but principally the latter. Goods of the intellect are still superior, as taste, knowledge, memory, judgement, &c. The highest are moral goods of the mind, directly and ultimately regarding ourselves, as command of the appetites and passions, prudence, fortitude, benevolence, &c. These are the great objects of our pursuit, and the principal ingredients of our happiness. Let us consider each of them as they rise one above the other in this natural series or scale, and touch briefly on our obligations to pursue them.\n\nThose of the body are health, strength, agility, hardiness, and patience of change, neatness, and decency.\n\nGood health, and a regular easy flow of spirits, are in themselves sweet natural enjoyments, a great fund of pleasure, and indeed the proper seasoning which gives a flavour and poignancy to every other pleasure. The want of health unfit us for most duties of life, and is especially an enemy to the social and humane affections, as it generally renders the unhappy sufferer peevish and sullen, disgusted at the allotments of Providence, and consequently apt to entertain suspicious and gloomy sentiments of its Author. It obstructs the free exercise and full improvement of our reason, makes us a burden to our friends, and useless to society. Whereas the uninterrupted enjoyment of good health is a constant source of good humour, and good humour is a great friend to openness and benignity of heart, enables us to encounter the various ills and disappointments of life with more courage, or to sustain them with more patience; and, in short, conduces much, if we are otherwise duly qualified, to our acting our part in every exigency of life with more firmness, constancy, and dignity. Therefore it imports us much to preserve and improve a habit or enjoyment, without which every other external entertainment is of little avail. And this is best done by a strict temperance in diet and regimen, by regular exercise, and by keeping the mind serene and unruffled by violent passions, and how pre-unsubdued by intense and constant labours, which greatly impair and gradually destroy the strongest constitutions.\n\nStrength, agility, hardiness, and patience of change, suppose health, and are unattainable without it; but agility, &c., they imply something more, and are necessary to guard it, to give us the perfect use of life and limbs, and to secure us against many otherwise unavoidable ills.\n\nThe exercise of the necessary manual, and of most of the elegant arts of life, depends on strength and agility of body; personal dangers, private and public dangers, the demands of our friends, our families, and country, require them; they are necessary in war, and ornamental in peace; fit for the employment of a country and a town life, and they exalt the entertainments and diversions of both. They are chiefly obtained by moderate and regular exercise.\n\nFew are so much raised above want and dependence, or so exempted from burdens and care, as not to be often exposed to inequalities and changes of diet, exercise, air, climate, and other irregularities. Now, what can be so effectual to secure one against the mischiefs arising from such unavoidable alterations, as hardiness, and a certain versatility of constitution which can bear extraordinary labours, and submit to great changes, without any sensible uneasiness or bad consequences.\n\nThis is best attained, not by an over great delicacy and minute attention to forms, or by an invariable regularity in diet, hours, and way of living, but rather by a bold and discreet latitude of regimen. Besides, deviations from established rules and forms of living, if kept within the bounds of sobriety and reason, are friendly to thought and original sentiments, animate the dull scene of ordinary life and burdens, and agreeably stir the passions, which stagnate or breed ill humour in the calms of life.\n\nNeatness, cleanliness, and decency, to which we may add dignity of countenance, and demeanour, seem to have something refined and moral in them: at least we generally esteem them indications of an orderly, genteel, and well governed mind, conscious of an inward worth, or the respect due to one's nature. Whereas negligence, slovenliness, awkwardness, and indecency, are shrewd symptoms of something mean, careless, and deficient, and betray a mind of untaught, illiberal, unconscious of what is due to one's self or to others.\n\nHow much cleanliness conduces to health, needs hardly to be mentioned; and how necessary it is to maintain one's character and rank in life, and to render us agreeable to others as well as to ourselves, is as evident. There are certain motions, airs, and gestures, which become the human countenance and form, in which we perceive a comeliness, openness, simplicity, gracefulness; and there are others, which to our sense of decorum appear uncomely, affected, disingenuous, and awkward, quite unsuitable to the native dignity of our face and form. The first are in themselves the most easily, natural and commodious, give one boldness and presence of mind, a modest assurance, an address both awful and alluring; they help make candour and greatness.\nOf Man's nefs of mind, raise the most agreeable prejudices in one's favour, render society engaging, command respect, and often love, and give weight and authority both in conversation and business; in fine, they are the colouring of virtue, which show it to the greatest advantage in whomsoever it is; and not only imitate, but in some measure supply it where it is wanting. Whereas the last, vice, rudeness, affectation, indecorum, and the like, have all the contrary effects; they are burdensome to one's self, a dishonour to our nature, and a nuisance in society. The former qualities or goods are best attained by a liberal education, by preserving a just sense of the dignity of our nature, by keeping the best and polite company, but, above all, by acquiring those virtuous and ennobling habits of mind which are decency in perfection, which will give an air of unaffected grandeur, and spread a lustre truly engaging over the whole form and deportment.\n\nWe are next to consider those goods which consist in exterior social connexions, as fame, fortune, civil authority, power.\n\nThe first has a twofold aspect, as a good pleasant in itself, or gratifying to an original passion, and then as expedient or useful towards a farther end. Honour from the wife and good, on the account of a virtuous conduct, is regaling to a good man; for then his heart re-echoes to the grateful sound. There are few quite indifferent even to the commendation of the vulgar. Though we cannot approve that conduct which proceeds entirely from this principle, and not from good affection or love of the conduct itself, yet, as it is often a guard and additional motive to virtue in creatures imperfect as we are, and often distracted by interfering passions, it might be dangerous to suppress it altogether, however wise it may be to restrain it within due bounds, and however laudable to use it only as a scaffolding to our virtue, which may be taken down when that glorious structure is finished, but hardly till then. To pursue fame for itself, is innocent; to regard it only as an auxiliary to virtue, is noble; to seek it chiefly as an engine of public usefulness, is still more noble, and highly praiseworthy. For though the opinion and breath of men are transient and fading things, often obtained without merit, and lost without cause; yet as our business is with men, and as our capacity of serving them is generally increased in proportion to their esteem of us, therefore found and well established moral applause may and will be modestly, not ostentatiously, sought after by the good; not indeed as a solitary refined sort of luxury, but as a public and proper instrument to serve and bless mankind. At the same time they will learn to despise that reputation which is founded on rank, fortune, and any other circumstances or accomplishments that are foreign to real merit, or to useful services done to others, and think that praise of little avail which is purchased without desert, and bestowed without judgment.\n\nFortune, power, and civil authority, or whatever is called influence and weight among mankind, are goods of the second division, that is, valuable and purchasable only as they are useful, or as means to a farther end, viz. procuring or preserving the immediate objects of enjoyment or happiness to ourselves or others. Therefore to love such goods on their own account, and to pursue them as ends, not the means of enjoyment, must be highly preposterous and absurd. There can be no measure, no limit, to such pursuit; all must be whim, caprice, extravagance. Accordingly such appetites, unlike all the natural ones, are increased by possession, and whetted by enjoyment. They are always precarious, and never without fears, because the objects lie without one's self; they are seldom without sorrow and vexation, because no accession of wealth or power can satisfy them. But if those goods are confined only as the materials or means of private or public happiness, then the same obligations which bind us to pursue the latter, bind us likewise to pursue the former. We may, and no doubt we ought, to seek such a measure of wealth as is necessary to supply all our real wants, to raise us above servile dependence, and provide us with such conveniences as are suited to our rank and condition in life. To be regardless of this measure of wealth, is to expose ourselves to all the temptations of poverty and corruption; to forfeit our natural independency and freedom; to degrade, and consequently to render the rank we hold, and the character we sustain in society, useless, if not contemptible. When these important ends are secured, we ought not to murmur or repine that we possess no more; yet we are not secluded by any obligation, moral or divine, from seeking more, in order to give us that happiest and most godlike of all powers, the power of doing good. A supine indolence in this respect is both absurd and criminal; absurd, as it robs us of an inexhausted fund of the most refined and durable enjoyments; and criminal, as it renders us so far useless to the society to which we belong. \"That Avarice, pursuit of wealth which goes beyond the former end, viz. the obtaining the necessaries, or such conveniences of life, as, in the estimation of reason, not of vanity or passion, are suited to our rank and condition, and yet is not directed to the latter, viz. the doing good, is what we call avarice.\" And \"that pursuit of power, which, after securing one's self, i.e. having attained the proper independence and liberty of a rational social creature, is not directed to the good of others, is what we call ambition, or the lust of power.\" Ambition:\n\nTo what extent the strict measures of virtue will allow us to pursue either wealth or power, and civil authority, is not perhaps possible precisely to determine. That must be left to prudence, and the peculiar character, condition, and other circumstances of each man. Only thus far a limit may be set, that the pursuit of either must encroach upon no other duty or obligation which we owe to ourselves, to society, or to its parent and head. The same reasoning is to be applied to power as to wealth. It is only valuable as an instrument of our own security, and of the free enjoyment of those original goods it may, and often does, administer to us, and as an engine of more extensive happiness to our friends, our country, and mankind.\n\nNow the best, and indeed the only way to obtain a flowing and lasting fame, is an uniform inflexible course of virtue, the employing one's ability and wealth in supplying the wants, and using one's power in promoting or securing the happiness, the rights and liberties of mankind, joined to an universal affability and politeness of manners. And surely one will not mistake the matter much, who thinks the same course conducive to the acquiring greater accessions both of wealth and\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nOf Man's duty to Himself.\n\nand power; especially if he adds to those qualifications a vigorous industry, a constant attention to the characters and wants of men, to the conjunctures of times, and continually varying genius of affairs; and a steady intrepid honesty, that will neither yield to the allurements, nor be overawed with the terrors, of that corrupt and corrupting scene in which we live. We have sometimes heard, indeed of other ways and means, as fraud, dissimulation, fertility, and prostitution, and the like ignoble arts, by which the men of the world (as they are called, shrewd politicians, and men of address!) amass wealth, and procure power; but as we want rather to form a man of virtue, an honest, contented, happy man, we leave to the men of the world their own ways, and permit them, unenvied and unimitated by us, to reap the fruit of their doings.\n\nThe next species of objects in the scale of good, are the goods of the intellect, as knowledge, memory, judgment, taste, sagacity, docility, and whatever else we call intellectual virtues. Let us consider them a little, and the means as well as obligations to improve them.\n\nAs man is a rational creature, capable of knowing the differences of things and actions—as he not only sees and feels what is present, but remembers what is past, and often foresees what is future—as he advances from small beginnings by slow degrees, and with much labour and difficulty, to knowledge and experience—as his opinions sway his passions,—as his passions influence his conduct,—and as his conduct draws consequences after it, which extend not only to the present but to the future time, and therefore is the principal source of his happiness or misery; it is evident, that he is formed for intellectual improvements, and that it must be of the utmost consequence for him to improve and cultivate his intellectual powers, on which these opinions, these passions, and that conduct depend*.\n\nBut besides the future consequences and moment of improving our intellectual powers, their immediate exercise on their proper objects yields the most rational and refined pleasures. Knowledge, and a right taste in the arts of imitation and design, as poetry, painting, sculpture, music, architecture, afford not only an innocent, but a most sensible and sublime entertainment. By these the understanding is instructed in ancient and modern life, the history of men and things, the energies and effects of the passions, the consequences of virtue and vice; by these the imagination is at once entertained and nourished with the beauties of nature and art, lighted up and spread out with the novelty, grandeur, and harmony of the universe; and, in fine, the passions are agreeably roused, and suitably engaged, by the greatest and most interesting objects that can fill the human mind. He who has a taste formed to those ingenious delights, and plenty of materials to gratify it, can never want the most agreeable exercise and entertainment, nor once have reason to make that fashionable complaint of the tediousness of time. Nor can he want a proper subject for the discipline and improvement of his heart. For, being daily conversant with beauty, order, and design, in inferior subjects, he bids fair for growing in due time an admirer of what is fair and well-proportioned in the conduct of life and the order of society, which is only order and design excited in their highest subject. He will learn to transfer the numbers of poetry to the harmony of the mind and of well-governed passions; and, from admiring the virtues of others in moral paintings, come to approve and imitate them himself. Therefore, to cultivate a true and correct taste must be both our interest and our duty, when the circumstances of our station give leisure and opportunity for it, and when the doing it is not inconsistent with our higher obligations or engagements to society and mankind.\n\nIt is best attained by reading the best books, where good sense has more the ascendant than learning, and taints which pertain more to practice than to speculation; by studying the best models, i.e. those which profess to imitate nature most, and approach the nearest to it, and by conversing with men of the most refined taste, and the greatest experience in life.\n\nAs to the other intellectual goods, what a fund of other entertainments must it be to investigate the truth and intellectual various relations of things, to trace the operations of goods, nature to general laws, to explain by these its manifold phenomena, to understand that order by which the universe is upheld, and that economy by which it is governed! to be acquainted with the human mind, the connexions, subordinations, and uses of its powers, and to mark their energy in life! how agreeable to the ingenious inquirer, to observe the manifold relations and combinations of individual minds in society, to discern the causes why they flourish or decay, and from thence to ascend, through the vast scale of beings, to that general Mind which presides over all; and operates unseen in every system and in every age, through the whole compass and progression of nature! Devoted to such entertainments as these, the contemplative have abandoned every other pleasure, retired from the body, so to speak, and sequestered themselves from social intercourse: for these, the busy have often preferred to the hurry and din of life the calm retreats of contemplation; for these, when once they came to taste them, even the gay and voluptuous have thrown up the lawless pursuits of sense and appetite, and acknowledged these mental enjoyments to be the most refined, and indeed the only luxury. Besides, by a just and large knowledge of nature, we recognize the perfections of its Author; and thus piety, and all those pious affections which depend on just sentiments of his character, are awakened and confirmed; and a thousand superstitious fears, that arise from partial views of his nature and works, will of course be excluded. An extensive prospect of human life, and of the periods and revolutions of human things, will produce much to the giving a certain greatness of mind, and a noble contempt to those little competitions about power, honour, and wealth, which disturb and divide the bulk of mankind; and promote a calm endurance of those inconveniences and ills that are the common appendages of humanity. Add to all, that a just knowledge of human nature, and of those hinges upon which the business and fortunes of men turn, will prevent our thinking either too highly or too meanly of our fellow creatures, give no small scope to the exercise of friendship, confidence, and good will, and at the same time brace the mind with a proper caution and distrust (those nerves of prudence), and give a greater mastery in the conduct of private as well as public life. Therefore, by cultivating our intellectual abilities, we shall best\nOf Man's best promote and secure our interest, and be qualified for acting our part in society with more honour to ourselves, as well as advantage to mankind. Consequently, to improve them to the utmost of our power is our duty; they are talents committed to us by the Almighty Head of society, and we are accountable to him for the use of them.\n\nThe intellectual virtues are best improved by accurate and impartial observation, extensive reading, and unconfined converse with men of all characters, especially with those who, to private study, have joined the widest acquaintance with the world, and greatest practice in affairs; but, above all, by being much in the world, and having large dealings with mankind. Such opportunities contribute much to divest one of prejudices and a servile attachment to crude systems, to open one's views, and to give that experience on which the most useful because the most practical knowledge is built, and from which the surest maxims for the conduct of life are deduced.\n\nThe highest goods which enter into the composition of human happiness are moral goods of the mind, directly and ultimately regarding ourselves; as command of the appetites and passions, prudence and caution, magnanimity, fortitude, humility, love of virtue, love of God, resignation, and the like. These sublime goods are goods by way of eminence, goods recommended and enforced by the most intimate and awful sense and consciousness of our nature; goods that constitute the quintessence, the very temper of happiness, and form that complexion of soul which renders us approveable and lovely in the sight of God; goods, in fine, which are the elements of all our future perfection and felicity.\n\nMost of the other goods we have considered depend partly on ourselves, and partly on accidents which we can neither foresee nor prevent, and result from causes which we cannot influence or alter. They are such goods as we may possess today and lose tomorrow, and which require a felicity of constitution and talents to attain them in full vigour and perfection, and a felicity of conjectures to secure the possession of them. Therefore, did our happiness depend altogether or chiefly on such transitory and precarious possessions, it were itself most precarious, and the highest folly to be anxious about it. But though creatures, constituted as we are, cannot be indifferent about such goods, and must suffer in some degree, and consequently have our happiness incomplete without them, yet they weigh but little in the scale when compared with moral goods. By the benevolent constitution of our nature, these are placed within the sphere of our activity, so that no man can be destitute of them unless he is first wanting to himself. Some of the wisest and best of mankind have wanted most of the former goods, and all the external kind, and felt most of the opposite ills, such at least as arise from without; yet by possessing the latter, viz. the moral goods, have declared they were happy; and to the conviction of the most impartial observers have appeared happy. The worst of men have been surrounded with every outward good and advantage of fortune, and have possessed great parts; yet for want of moral rectitude, have been, and have confessed themselves, notoriously and exquisitely miserable. The exercise of virtue has supported its votaries, and made them exult in the midst of tortures almost intolerable; nay, how often has some false form or shadow of it sustained even the greatest (E) villains and bigots under the same preludes! But no external goods, no goods of fortune, have been able to alleviate the agonies or expel the fears of a guilty mind, conscious of the deserved hatred and reproach of mankind, and the just displeasure of Almighty God.\n\nAs the present condition of human life is wonderfully chequered with good and ill, and as no height of condition, no influence of fortune, can absolutely ensure human life requires the good, or secure against the ill, it is evident that a particular great part of the comfort and serenity of life must lie virtues in having our minds duly affected with regard to both, i.e. rightly attempered to the lots of one and the sufferance of the other. For it is certain that outward calamities derive their chief malignity and pressure from the inward dispositions with which we receive them. By managing these right, we may greatly abate that malignity and pressure, and consequently diminish the number, and weaken the force, of the ills of life, if we should not have it in our power to obtain a large share of its goods. There are particularly three virtues which go to the forming this right temper towards ill, and which are of singular efficacy, if not totally to remove, yet wonderfully to alleviate, the calamities of life. These are fortitude or patience, humility, and resignation.\n\nFortitude is that calm and steady habit of mind which either moderates our fears, and enables us bravely to encounter the prospect of ill, or renders the mind serene and invincible under its immediate pressure. It lies equally distant from rashness and cowardice: and though it does not hinder us from feeling, yet prevents our complaining or shrinking under the stroke. It always includes a generous contempt of, or at least a noble superiority to, those precarious goods of which we can ensure neither the possession nor continuance. The man therefore who possesses this virtue in this ample sense of it, stands upon an eminence, and sees human things below him; the tempest indeed may reach him, but he stands secure and collected against it upon the basis of conscious virtue, which the severest storms can seldom shake, and never overthrow.\n\nHumility is another virtue of high rank and dignity, though often mistaken by proud mortals for meanness and pusillanimity. It is opposed to pride, which commonly includes in it a false or overrated estimation of our own merit, an ascription of it to ourselves as its only and original cause, an undue comparison of ourselves with others, and in consequence of that supposed superiority, an arrogant preference of ourselves, and a supercilious contempt of them. Humility, on the other hand, seems to denote that modest and ingenuous temper of mind, which arises from a just and equal estimate\n\n(E) As Ravallac, who assassinated Henry IV. of France; and Balthasar Geraerd, who murdered William I. prince of Orange.\nestimate of our own advantages compared with those of others, and from a sense of our deriving all originally from the Author of our being. Its ordinary attendants are mildness, a gentle forbearance, and an easy unassuming humanity with regard to the imperfections and faults of others; virtues rare indeed, but of the fairest complexion, the proper offspring of so lovely a parent, the best ornaments of such imperfect creatures as we are, precious in the sight of God, and which sweetly allure the hearts of men.\n\nReformation is that mild and heroic temper of mind which arises from a sense of an infinitely wise and good providence, and enables one to acquiesce with a cordial affection in its just appointments. This virtue has something very particular in its nature, and sublime in its efficacy. For it teaches us to bear ill, not only with patience, and as being unavoidable, but it transforms, as it were, ill into good, by leading us to consider it, and every event that has the least appearance of ill, as a divine dispensation, a wise and benevolent temperament of things, subversive to universal good, and of course including that of every individual, especially of such as calmly stoop to it. In this light, the administration itself, nay every act of it, becomes an object of affection, the evil disappears, or is converted into a balm which both heals and nourishes the mind. For though the first unexpected access of ill may surprise the soul into grief, yet that grief, when the mind calmly reviews its object, changes into contentment, and is by degrees exalted into veneration and a divine composure. Our private will is lost in that of the Almighty, and our security against every real ill rests on the same bottom as the throne of him who lives and reigns for ever.\n\nBefore we finish this section, it may be fit to observe, that as the Deity is the supreme and inexhausted source of good, on whom the happiness of the whole creation depends; as he is the highest object in nature, and the only object who is fully proportioned to the intellectual and moral powers of the mind, in whom they ultimately rest, and find their most perfect chief good and completion; he is therefore termed the Chief good of man, objectively considered. And virtue, or the proportioned and vigorous exercise of the several powers and affections on their respective objects, as above described, is, in the schools, termed the chief good, formally considered, or its formal idea, being the inward temper and native constitution of human happiness.\n\nFrom the detail we have gone through, the following corollaries may be deduced.\n\n1. It is evident, that the happiness of such a progressive creature as man can never be at a stand, or continue a fixed invariable thing. His finite nature, let it rise ever so high, admits still higher degrees of improvement and perfection. And his progression in improvement or virtue always makes way for a progression in happiness. So that no possible point can be assigned in any period of his existence in which he is perfectly happy, that is, so happy as to exclude higher degrees of happiness. All his perfection is only comparative. 2. It appears that many things must concur to complete the happiness of so various a creature as man, subject to so many wants, and susceptible of such different pleasures. 3. As his capacities of pleasure cannot be all gratified at the same time, and must often interfere with each other in such a precarious and fleeting state as human life, or be frequently disappointed, perfect happiness, i.e. the undisturbed enjoyment of the several pleasures of which we are capable, is unattainable in our present state. 4. That state is most to be sought after, in which the fewest competitions and disappointments can happen, which least of all impairs any sense of pleasure, and opens an inexhausted source of the most refined and lasting enjoyments. 5. That state which is attended with all those advantages, is a state or course of virtue. 6. Therefore, a state of virtue, in which the moral goods of the mind are attained, is the happiest state.\n\nCHAP. III. Duties of Society.\n\nSECT. I. Filial and Fraternal Duty.\n\nAs we have followed the order of nature in tracing the history of man, and those duties which he owes to himself, it seems reasonable to take the same method with those he owes to society, which constitute the second class of his obligations.\n\nHis parents are among the earliest objects of his attention; he becomes soonest acquainted with them, repoles a peculiar confidence in them, and seems to regard them with a fond affection, the early prognostics of his future piety and gratitude. Thus does nature dictate the first lines of filial duty, even before a just sense of the connexion is formed. But when the child is grown up, and has attained to such a degree of understanding, as to comprehend the moral tie, and be sensible of the obligations he is under to his parents; when he looks back on their tender and disinterested affection, their incessant cares and labours in nursing, educating, and providing for him, during that state in which he had neither prudence nor strength to care and provide for himself, he must be conscious that he owes to them these peculiar duties.\n\n1. To reverence and honour them, as the instruments of nature in introducing him to life, and to that state of comfort and happiness which he enjoys; and therefore to esteem and imitate their good qualities, to alleviate and bear with, and spread, as much as possible, a decent veil over their faults and weaknesses.\n\n2. To be highly grateful to them, for those favours which it can hardly ever be in his power fully to repay; to show this gratitude by a strict attention to their wants, and a solicitous care to supply them; by a submissive deference to their authority and advice, especially by paying great regard to it in the choice of a wife, and of an occupation; by yielding to, rather than peevishly contending with, their humours, as remembering how oft they have been persecuted by his; and, in fine, by soothing their cares, lightening their sorrows, supporting the infirmities of age, and making the remainder of their life as comfortable and joyful as possible.\n\nAs his brethren and sisters are the next with whom the creature forms a social and moral connexion, to them he owes a fraternal regard; and with them ought he to enter into a strict league of friendship, mutual sympathy, advice, assistance, and a generous intercourse of kind offices, remembering their relation\nPart II.\n\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nDuties of Society.\n\nto common parents, and that brotherhood of nature which unites them into a closer community of interest and affection.\n\nSect. II. Concerning Marriage.\n\nWhen man arrives to a certain age, he becomes sensible of a peculiar sympathy and tendernels towards the other sex; the charms of beauty engage his attention, and call forth new and softer dispositions than he has yet felt. The many amiable qualities exhibited by a fair outside, or by the mild allurement of female manners, or which the prejudiced spectator without much reasoning supposes those to include, with several other circumstances both natural and accidental, point his view and affection to a particular object, and of course contract that general rambling regard, which was lost and useless among the undistinguished crowd, into a peculiar and permanent attachment to one woman, which ordinarily terminates in the most important, venerable, and delightful connection in life.\n\nThe state of the brute creation is very different from that of human creatures. The former are clothed and generally armed by their structure, easily find what is necessary to their subsistence, and soon attain their vigour and maturity; so that they need the care and aid of their parents but for a short while; and therefore we see that nature has assigned to them vagrant and transient amours. The connexion being purely natural, and merely for propagating and rearing their offspring, no sooner is that end answered, than the connexion dissolves of course. But the human race are of a more tender and defenceless constitution; their infancy and non-age continue longer; they advance slowly to strength of body and maturity of reason; they need constant attention, and a long series of cares and labours, to train them up to decency, virtue, and the various arts of life. Nature has therefore provided them with the most affectionate and anxious tutors, to aid their weakness, to supply their wants, and to accomplish them in those necessary arts, even their own parents, on whom she has devolved this mighty charge, rendered agreeable by the most alluring and powerful of all ties, parental affection. But unless both concur in this grateful task, and continue their joint labours, till they have reared up and planted out their young colony, it must become a prey to every rude invader, and the purpose of nature in the original union of the human pair be defeated. Therefore our structure as well as condition is an evident indication, that the human sexes are destined for a more intimate, for a moral and lasting union. It appears likewise, that the principal end of marriage is not to propagate and nurse up an offspring, but to educate and form minds for the great duties and extensive destinations of life. Society must be supplied from this original nursery with useful members, and its fairest ornaments and supports.\n\nThe mind is apt to be dissipated in its views and acts of friendship and humanity; unless the former be directed to a particular object, and the latter employed in a particular province. When men once indulge in this dissipation, there is no stopping their career; they grow insensible to moral attractions; and, by obstructing or impairing the decent and regular exercise of the tender and generous feelings of the human heart, they in time become unqualified for, or adverse to, the forming a moral union of souls, which is the cement of society, and the source of the purest domestic joys. Whereas a rational, undefaced love, and its fair companion, marriage, collect a man's views, guide his heart to its proper object, and, by confining his affection to that object, do really enlarge its influence and use. Besides, it is but too evident from the conduct of mankind, that the common ties of humanity are too feeble to engage and interest the passions of the generality in the affairs of society. The connexions of neighbourhood, acquaintance, and general intercourse, are too wide a field of action for many, and those of a public or community are too far more; and in which they either care not or know not how to exert themselves. Therefore nature, ever wise and benevolent, by implanting that strong sympathy which reigns between the individuals of each sex, and by urging them to form a particular moral connexion, the spring of many domestic endearments, has measured out to each pair a particular sphere of action, proportioned to their views, and adapted to their respective capacities. Besides, by interesting them deeply in the concerns of their own little circle, she has connected them more closely with society, which is composed of particular families, and bound them down to their good behaviour in that particular community to which they belong. This moral connexion is marriage, and this sphere of action is a family.\n\nOf the conjugal alliance the following are the natural laws:\n\n1. Mutual fidelity to the marriage bed. Marriage dilates the very end of marriage; dilutes the natural cement of the relation; weakens the moral tie, the chief strength of which lies in the reciprocation of affection; and by making the offspring uncertain, diminishes the care and attachment necessary to their education.\n\n2. A conspiration of counsels and endeavours to promote the common interest of the family, and to educate their common offspring. In order to observe these laws, it is necessary to cultivate, both before and during the married state, the strictest decency and chastity of manners, and a just sense of what becomes their respective characters.\n\n3. The union must be inviolable, and for life. The nature of friendship, and particularly of this species of it, the education of their offspring, and the order of society and of successions, which would otherwise be extremely perplexed, do all seem to require it. To preserve this union, and render the matrimonial state more harmonious and comfortable, a mutual esteem and tenderness, a mutual deference and forbearance, a communication of advice, and affluence and authority, are absolutely necessary. If either party keep within their proper departments, there need be no disputes about power or superiority, and there will be none. They have no opposite no separate interests, and therefore there can be no just ground for opposition of conduct.\n\nFrom this detail, and the present state of things, in Polygamy, which there is pretty near a parity of numbers of both sexes, it is evident that polygamy is an unnatural state; and though it should be granted to be more fruitful of\nDuties of children, which however it is not found to be, yet it is by no means so fit for rearing minds, which seems to be as much, if not more, the intention of nature than the propagation of bodies.\n\nSect. III. Of Parental Duty.\n\nThe connexion of parents with their children is a natural consequence of the matrimonial connexion; and the duties which they owe them result as naturally from that connexion. The feeble state of children, subject to so many wants and dangers, requires their incessant care and attention; their ignorant and uncultivated minds demand their continual instruction and culture. Had human creatures come into the world with the full strength of men, and the weakness of reason and vehemence of passions which prevail in children, they would have been too strong or too stubborn to have submitted to the government and instruction of their parents. But as they were designed for a progression in knowledge and virtue, it was proper that the growth of their bodies should keep pace with that of their minds, lest the purposes of that progression should have been defeated. Among other admirable purposes which this gradual expansion of their outward as well as inward structure serves, this is one, that it affords ample scope to the exercise of many tender and generous affections, which fill up the domestic life with a beautiful variety of duties and enjoyments; and are of course a noble discipline for the heart, and a hardy kind of education for the more honourable and important duties of public life.\n\nThe above mentioned weak and ignorant state of children seems plainly to invest their parents with such authority and power as is necessary to their support, protection, and education; but that authority and power can be construed to extend no farther than is necessary to answer those ends, and to last no longer than that weakness and ignorance continue; wherefore, the foundation or reason of the authority and power ceasing, they cease of course. Whatever power or authority then it may be necessary or lawful for parents to exercise during the non-age of their children, to assume or usurp the same when they have attained the maturity or full exercise of their strength and reason would be tyrannical and unjust. From hence it is evident, that parents have no right to punish the persons of their children more severely than the nature of their wardship requires, much less to invade their lives, to encroach upon their liberty, or transfer them as their property to any master whatsoever.\n\nThe first class of duties which parents owe their children respect their natural life; and these comprehend protection, nurture, provision, introducing them into the world in a manner suitable to their rank and fortune, and the like.\n\nThe second order of duties regards the intellectual and moral life of their children, or their education in such arts and accomplishments as are necessary to qualify them for performing the duties they owe to themselves and to others. As this was found to be the principal design of the matrimonial alliance, so the fulfilling that design is the most important and dignified of all the parental duties. In order therefore to fit the child for acting his part wisely and worthily as a man, as a citizen, and a creature of God, both parents ought to combine their joint wisdom, authority, and power, and each apart to employ those talents which are the peculiar excellency and ornament of their respective sex. The father ought to lay out and superintend their education, the mother to execute and manage the detail of which she is capable. The former should direct the manly exertion of the intellectual and moral powers of his child. His imagination, and the manner of those exertions, are the peculiar province of the latter. The former should advise, protect, command, and, by his experience, masculine vigour, and that superior authority which is commonly ascribed to his sex, brace and strengthen his pupil for active life, for gravity, integrity, and firmness in suffering. The business of the latter is to bend and soften her male pupil, by the charms of her conversation, and the softness and decency of her manners, for social life, for politeness of taste, and the elegant decorums and enjoyments of humanity; and to improve and refine the tenderness and modesty of her female pupil, and form her to all those mild domestic virtues which are the peculiar characteristics and ornaments of her sex: To conduct the opening minds of their sweet charge through the several periods of their progress, to assist them in each period, in throwing out the latent seeds of reason and ingenuity, and in gaining fresh accretions of light and virtue; and at length, with all these advantages, to produce the young adventurers upon the great theatre of human life, to play their several parts in the fight of their friends, of society, and mankind.\n\nSect. IV. Herile and Servile Duty.\n\nIn the natural course of human affairs, it must necessarily happen that some of mankind will live in plenty and opulence, and others be reduced to a state of indigence and poverty. The former need the labours of the latter, and the latter provision and support of the former. This mutual necessity is the foundation of that connexion, whether we call it moral or civil, which subsists between masters and servants. He who feeds another has a right to some equivalent, the labour of him whom he maintains, and the fruits of it. And he who labours for another has a right to expect that vice, he should support him. But as the labours of a man of ordinary strength are certainly of greater value than mere food and clothing; because they would actually produce more, even the maintenance of a family, were the labourer to employ them in his own behalf; therefore he has an undoubted right to rate and dispose of his service for certain wages above mere maintenance; and if he has inadvertently disposed of it for the latter only, yet the contract being of the onerous kind, he may equitably claim a supply of that deficiency. If the service be specified, the servant is bound to that only; if not, then he is to be construed as bound only to such services as are consistent with the laws of justice and humanity. By the voluntary servitude to which he subjects himself, he forfeits no rights but such as are necessarily included in that servitude, and is obnoxious to no punishment but such as a voluntary failure in the service may be supposed reasonably to require. The offspring of such servants have a right to\nPart II.\n\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nDuties of Society.\n\nThat liberty which neither they nor their parents have forfeited.\n\nAs to those who, because of some heinous offence, the case of or for some notorious damage, for which they cannot great often otherwise compensate, are condemned to perpetual service, they do not, on that account, forfeit all the rights of men; but those, the loss of which is necessary to secure security against the like offences for the future, or to repair the damage they have done.\n\nWith regard to captives taken in war, it is barbarous and inhuman to make perpetual slaves of them, unless some peculiar and aggravated circumstances of guilt have attended their hostility. The bulk of the subjects of any government engaged in war may be fairly deemed innocent enemies; and therefore they have a right to that clemency which is consistent with the common safety of mankind, and the particular security of that society against which they are engaged. Though ordinary captives have a grant of their lives, yet to pay their liberty as an equivalent is much too high a price. There are other ways of acknowledging or returning the favour, than by surrendering what is far dearer than life itself*. To those who, under pretext of the necessities of commerce, drive the unnatural trade of bargaining for human flesh, and confining their innocent but unfortunate fellow creatures to eternal servitude and misery, we may address the words of a fine writer; \"Let avarice defend it as it will, there is an honest reluctance in humanity against buying and selling, and regarding those of our own species as our wealth and possessions.\"\n\nSect. V. Social Duties of the private Kind.\n\nHitherto we have considered only the domestic economical duties, because these are first in the progress of nature. But as man passes beyond the little circle of a family, he forms connexions with relations, friends, neighbours, and others; from whence results a new train of duties of the more private social kind, as \"friendship, chastity, courtesy, good neighbourhood, charity, forgiveness, hospitality.\"\n\nMan is admirably formed for particular social attachments and duties. There is a peculiar and strong propensity in his nature to be affected with the sentiments and dispositions of others. Men, like certain musical instruments, are set to each other, so that the vibrations or notes excited in one raise correspondent notes and vibrations in the others. The impulses of pleasure or pain, joy or sorrow, made on one mind, are by an instantaneous sympathy of nature communicated in some degree to all; especially when hearts are (as a humane writer expresses it) in union of kindness; the joy that vibrates in one communicates to the other also. We may add, that though joy thus imparted swells the harmony, yet grief vibrated to the heart of a friend, and rebounding from thence in sympathetic notes, melts as it were, and almost dies away. All the passions, but especially those of the social kind, are contagious; and when the passions of one man mingle with those of another, they increase and multiply prodigiously. There is a most moving eloquence in the human countenance, air, voice, and gesture, wonderfully expressive of the most latent feelings and passions of the soul, which darts them like a subtle flame into the hearts of others, and raises corresponding feelings there; friendship, love, good humour, joy, spread through every feature, and particularly shoot from the eyes their softer and fiercer fires with an irresistible energy. And in like manner the opposite passions of hatred, enmity, ill humour, melancholy, diffuse a sultry and faddening air over the face, and, flashing from eye to eye, kindle a train of similar passions. By these, and other admirable pieces of machinery, men are formed for society and the delightful interchange of friendly sentiments and duties, to increase the happiness of others by participation, and their own by rebound; and to diminish, by dividing, the common stock of their misery.\n\nThe first emanations of the social principle beyond the bounds of a family lead us to form a nearer conjunction of friendship or good will with those who are anywhere connected with us by blood or domestic alliance. To them our affection does commonly exert itself in a greater or less degree, according to the nearness or distance of the relation. And this proportion is admirably suited to the extent of our powers and the indigence of our state; for it is only within those lesser circles of consanguinity or alliance that the generality of mankind are able to display their abilities or benevolence, and consequently to uphold their connexion with society, and subversion to a public interest. Therefore it is our duty to regard these closer connexions as the next department to that of a family, in which nature has marked out for us a sphere of activity and usefulness; and to cultivate the kind affections which are the cement of these endearing alliances.\n\nFrequently the view of distinguishing moral qualities in some of our acquaintance may give birth to friendships that more noble connexion we call friendship, which is far superior to the alliances of consanguinity. For these are of a superficial, and often of a transitory nature, of which as they hold more of instinct than of reason, we cannot give such a rational account. But friendship derives all its strength and beauty, and the only existence which is durable, from the qualities of the heart, or from virtuous and lovely dispositions. Or, should these be wanting, they or some shadow of them must be supposed present.—Therefore friendship may be described to be, \"The union of two souls by means of virtue, the common object and cement of their mutual affection.\" Without virtue, or the supposition of it, friendship is only a mercenary league, an alliance of interest, which must dissolve at once when that interest decays or subsists no longer. It is not so much any particular passion, as a composition of some of the noblest feelings and passions of the mind. Good sense, a just taste and love of virtue, a thorough candour and benignity of heart, or what we usually call a good temper, and a generous sympathy of sentiments and affections, are the necessary ingredients of this virtuous connection. When it is grafted on esteem, strengthened by habit, and mellowed by time, it yields infinite pleasure, ever new and ever growing; is a noble support amidst the various trials and vicissitudes of life, and a high seasoning to most of our other enjoyments. To form and cultivate virtuous friendship, must be very improving to the temper, as its principal object is virtue, let off with all the allurement of countenance, air,\nDuties of air, and manners, shining forth in the native graces of manly honest sentiments and affections, and rendered visible as it were to the friendly spectator in a conduct unaffectedly great and good; and as its principal exercises are the very energies of virtue, or its effect and emanations. So that wherever this amiable attachment prevails, it will exalt our admiration and attachment to virtue, and unless impeded in its course by unnatural prejudices, run out into a friendship to the human race. For as no one can merit, and none ought to usurp, the sacred name of friend, who hates mankind; so whoever truly loves them, possesses the most essential quality of a true friend.\n\nThe duties of friendship are a mutual esteem of each other, unbridled by interest, and independent of it; a generous confidence, as far distant from suspicion as from reserve; an inviolable harmony of sentiments and dispositions, of designs and interests; a fidelity unshaken by the changes of fortune; a constancy unalterable by distance of time or place; a resignation of one's personal interest to those of one's friend, and a reciprocal, unenvious, unrevealed exchange of kind offices.—But, amidst all the exertions of this moral connexion, humane and generous as it is, we must remember that it operates within a narrow sphere, and its immediate operations respect only the individual; and therefore its particular impulse must still be subordinate to a more public interest, or be always directed and controlled by the more extensive connexions of our nature.\n\nWhen our friendship terminates on any of the other sex, in whom beauty or agreeableness of person and external gracefulness of manners conspire to express and heighten the moral charm of a tender honest heart, and sweet, ingenuous, modest temper, lighted up by good sense; it generally grows into a more soft and endearing attachment. When this attachment is improved by a growing acquaintance with the worth of its object, is conducted by discretion, and issues at length, as it ought to do, in the moral connexion formerly mentioned, it becomes the source of many amiable duties, of a communication of passions and interests, of the most refined decencies, and of a thousand nameless deep-seated joys of reciprocal tenderness and love, flowing from every look, word, and action. Here friendship acts with double energy, and the natural conspires with the moral charms to strengthen and secure the love of virtue. As the delicate nature of female honour and decorum, and the inexplicable grace of a chaste and modest behaviour, are the surest and indeed the only means of kindling at first, and ever after of keeping alive, this tender and elegant flame, and of accomplishing the excellent ends designed by it; to attempt by fraud to violate one, or, under pretence of passion, to fully and corrupt the other, and, by so doing, to expose the too often credulous and unguarded object, with a wanton cruelty, to the hatred of her own sex and the scorn of ours, and to the lowest infamy of both, is a conduct not only base and criminal, but inconsistent with that truly rational and refined enjoyment, the spirit and quintessence of which are derived from the balsam and sacred charms of virtue kept untainted and therefore ever alluring to the lover's heart.\n\nCourteous, good neighbourhood, affability, and the like duties, which are founded on our private social connexions, are no less necessary and obligatory to creatures united to society, and supporting and supported by each other in a chain of mutual want and dependence. They do not consist in a smooth address, neighbourliness, an artificial or obsequious air, fawning adulations, or a polite servility of manners; but in a just and modest sense of our own dignity and that of others, and of the reverence due to mankind, especially to those who hold the higher links of the social chain; in a discreet and manly accommodation of ourselves to the foibles and humours of others; in a strict observance of the rules of decorum and civility; but, above all, in a frank obliging carriage, and generous interchange of good deeds rather than words. Such a conduct is of great use and advantage, as it is an excellent security against injury, and the best claim and recommendation to the esteem, civility, and universal respect of mankind. This inferior order of virtues unites the particular members of society more closely, and forms the lesser pillars of the civil fabric; which, in many instances, supply the unavoidable defects of laws, and maintain the harmony and decorum of social intercourse, where the more important and essential lines of virtue are wanting.\n\nCharity and forgiveness are truly amiable and useful duties of the social kind. There is a twofold distinction of rights commonly taken notice of by moral writers, viz. perfect and imperfect. To fulfill the former, is necessary to the being and support of society; to fulfill the latter, is a duty equally sacred and obligatory, and tends to the improvement and prosperity of society; but as the violation of them is not equally prejudicial to the public good, the fulfilling them is not subjected to the cognizance of law, but left to the candour, humanity, and gratitude of individuals. And by this means ample scope is given to exercise all the generosity, and display the genuine merit and lustre, of virtue. Thus the wants and misfortunes of others call for our charitable assistance and reasonable supplies. And the good man, unconstrained by law, and uncontrolled by human authority, will cheerfully acknowledge and generously satisfy this mournful and moving claim; a claim supported by the sanction of heaven, of whose bounties he is honoured to be the grateful trustee. If his own perfect rights are invaded by the injustice of others, he will not therefore reject their imperfect right to pity and forgiveness, unless his grant of these should be inconsistent with the more extensive rights of society, or the public good. In that case he will have recourse to public justice and the laws, and even then he will prosecute the injury with no unnecessary severity, but rather with mildness and humanity. When the injury is merely personal, and of such a nature as to admit of alleviations, and the forgiveness of which would be attended with no worse consequences, especially of a public kind, the good man will generously forgive his offending brother. And it is his duty to do so, and not to take private revenge, or retaliate evil for evil. For though resentment of injury is a natural passion, and implanted, as was observed above, for wife and good ends; yet, considering the manifold partialities which men have for themselves, was every one to act as judge and iv.\nDuties of Society.\n\nDuties of his own cause, and to execute the sentence dictated by his own resentment, it is but too evident that mankind would pass all bounds in their fury, and the last sufferer be provoked in his turn to make full reprisals. So that evil, thus encountering with evil, would produce one continued series of violence and misery, and render society intolerable, if not impracticable. Therefore, where the security of the individual, or the good of the public, does not require a proportionable retaliation, it is agreeable to the general law of benevolence, and to the particular end of the passion (which is to prevent injury and the misery occasioned by it), to forgive personal injuries, or not to return evil for evil. This duty is one of the noble refinements which Christianity has made upon the general maxims and practice of mankind, and enforced, with a peculiar strength and beauty, by sanctions no less alluring than awful. And indeed the practice of it is generally its own reward; by expelling from the mind the most dreadful intruders upon its repose, those rancorous passions which are begot and nursed by resentment, and by disarming and even subduing every enemy one has, except such as have nothing left of men but the outward form.\n\nThe most enlarged and humane connexion of the private kind seems to be the hospitable alliance, from which flow the amiable and disinterested duties we owe to strangers. If the exercise of passions of the most private and instinctive kind is beheld with moral approbation and delight, how lovely and venerable must those appear which result from a calm philanthropy, are founded in the common rights and connexions of society, and embrace men, not of a particular sect, party, or nation, but all in general without distinction, and without any of the little partialities of self-love.\n\nSect. VI. Social Duties of the Commercial Kind.\n\nThe next order of connexions are those which arise from the wants and weaknesses of mankind, and from the various circumstances in which their different situations place them. These we may call commercial connexions, and the duties which result from them commercial duties, as justice, fair-dealing, sincerity, fidelity to compacts, and the like.\n\nThough nature is perfect in all her works, yet she has observed a manifest and eminent distinction among them. To all such as lie beyond the reach of human skill and power, and are proper to her own department, she has given the finishing hand. These man may design after and imitate, but he can never rival them, nor add to their beauty or perfection. Such are the forms and structure of vegetables, animals, and many of their productions, as the honeycomb, the spider's web, and the like. There are others of her works which she has of design left unfinished, as it were, in order to exercise the ingenuity and power of man. She has presented to him a rich profusion of materials of every kind for his convenience and use; but they are rude and unpolished, or not to be come at without art and labour. These therefore he must apply, in order to adapt them to his use, and to enjoy them in perfection. Thus nature hath given him an infinite variety of herbs, grains, fossils, minerals, woods, water, earth, air, and a thousand other crude materials, to supply his numerous wants. But he must sow, plant, dig, refine, polish, build, and, in short, manufacture the various produce of nature, in order to obtain even the necessaries, and much more the conveniences and elegancies of life. These then are the price of his labour and industry, and, without that, nature will sell him nothing. But as the wants of mankind are many, and the single strength of individuals small, they could hardly find the necessaries, and much less the conveniences of life, without uniting their ingenuity and strength in acquiring these, and without a mutual intercourse of good offices. Some men are better formed for some kinds of ingenuity and labour, and others for other kinds; and different soils and climates are enriched with different productions; so that men, by exchanging the produce of their respective labours, and supplying the wants of one country with the superfluities of another, do in effect diminish the labours of each, and increase the abundance of all. This is the foundation of all commerce, or exchange of commodities and goods, one with another; in order to facilitate which, men have contrived different species of coin, or money, as a common standard by which to estimate the comparative values of their respective goods. But to render commerce sure and effectual, justice, fair-dealing, sincerity, and fidelity to compacts, are absolutely necessary.\n\nJustice or fair-dealing, or, in other words, a disposition to treat others as we would be treated by them, is a virtue of the first importance, and inseparable from the virtuous character. It is the cement of society, or that pervading spirit which connects its members, inspires its various relations, and maintains the order and subordination of each part of the whole. Without it, society would become a den of thieves and banditti, hating and hated, devouring and devoured, by one another.\n\nAnd here it may be proper to take a view of Mr Hume's supposed case of the sensible knave and the worthless miser (No. 16), and consider what would be the duty of the former according to the theory of those moralists who hold the will of God to be the criterion or rule, and everlasting happiness the motive of human virtue.\n\nIt has been already observed, and the truth of the observation cannot be controverted, that, by secretly a duty on purloining from the coffers of a miser, part of that principal gold which there lies useless, a man might in particular circumstances promote the good of society, who hold without doing any injury to a single individual: and God to be it was hence inferred, that, in such circumstances, if the criterion would be no duty to abstain from theft, were local utility arising from particular consequences the real criterion or standard of justice. Very different, however, is the conclusion which must be drawn by those who consider the natural tendency of actions, if universally performed, as the criterion of their merit or demerit, in the sight of God. Such philosophers attend, not to the particular consequences of a single action in any given case, but to the general consequences of the principle from which it flows, if that principle were universally adopted. You cannot (say they) permit one action and forbid another, without showing a difference...\nDuties of Society.\n\nThe same sort of actions, therefore, must be generally permitted or generally forbidden. But were every man allowed to ascertain for himself the circumstances in which the good of society would be promoted, by secretly abstracting the superfluous wealth of a worthless miser, it is plain that no property could be secure; that all incitements to industry would be at once removed; and that, whatever might be the immediate consequences of any particular theft, the general and necessary consequences of the principle by which it was authorized must soon prove fatal. Were one man to purloin part of the riches of a real miser, and to consider his conduct as vindicated by his intention to employ those riches in acts of generosity, another might by the same sort of casualty think himself authorized to appropriate to himself part of his wealth; and thus theft would spread through all orders of men, till society were dissolved into separate, hostile, and savage families, mutually dreading and shunning each other. The general consequences, therefore, of encroaching upon private property tend evidently and violently to universal misery.\n\nOn the other hand, indeed, the particular and immediate consequences of that principle which considers every man's property as sacred, may in some cases, such as that supposed, be in a small degree injurious to a few families in the neighbourhood of the miser and the knave. But that injury can never be of long duration; and it is infinitely more than counterbalanced by the general good consequences of the principle from which it accidentally results; for these consequences extend to all nations and to all ages. Without a sacred regard to property, there could neither be arts nor industry nor confidence among men, and happiness would be forever banished from this world. But the communication of happiness being the end which God had in view when he created the world, and all men standing in the same relation to him, it is impossible to suppose that he does not approve, and will not ultimately reward, those voluntary actions of which the natural tendency is to increase the sum of human happiness; or that he does not disapprove, and will not ultimately punish, those which naturally tend to aggravate human misery. The conclusion is, that a strict adherence to the principle of justice is universally, and in all possible circumstances, a duty from which we cannot deviate without offending our Creator, and ultimately bringing misery upon ourselves.\n\nSincerity, or veracity, in our words and actions, is another virtue or duty of great importance to society, being one of the great bands of mutual intercourse, and the foundation of mutual trust. Without it, society would be the dominion of mistrust, jealousy, and fraud, and conversation a traffic of lies and dissimulation. It includes in it a conformity of our words with our sentiments, a correspondence between our actions and dispositions, a strict regard to truth, and an irreconcilable abhorrence of falsehood. It does not indeed require, that we expose our sentiments indirectly, or tell all the truth in every case; but certainly it does not and cannot admit the least violation of truth or contradiction to our sentiments. For if these bounds are once passed, no possible limit can be assigned where the violation shall stop, and no pretence of private or public good can possibly counterbalance the ill consequences of such a violation.\n\nFidelity to promises, contracts, and engagements, is likewise a duty of such importance to the security of fidelity to commerce and interchange of benevolence among promises, mankind, that society would soon grow intolerable without the strict observance of it. Hobbes, and others who follow the same track, have taken a wonderful deal of pains to puzzle this subject, and to make all the virtues of this sort merely artificial, and not at all obligatory, antecedent to human conventions. No doubt compacts suppose people who make them; and promises persons to whom they are made; and therefore both suppose some society, more or less, between those who enter into these mutual engagements. But is not a compact or promise binding, till men have agreed that they shall be binding? or are they only binding, because it is our interest to be bound by them, or to fulfill them? Do not we highly approve the man who fulfils them, even though they should prove to be against his interest? and do not we condemn him as a knave who violates them on that account? A promise is a voluntary declaration by words, or by an action equally significant, of our resolution to do something in behalf of another, or for his service. When it is made, the person who makes it is by all supposed under an obligation to perform it. And he to whom it is made may demand the performance as his right. That perception of obligation is a simple idea, and is on the same footing as our other moral perceptions, which may be described by instances, but cannot be defined. Whether we have a perception of such obligation quite distinct from the interest, either public or private, that may accompany the fulfillment of it, must be referred to the conscience of every individual. And whether the mere sense of that obligation, apart from its concomitants, is not a sufficient inducement or motive to keep one's promise, without having recourse to any selfish principle of our nature, must be likewise appealed to the conscience of every honest man.\n\nIt may, however, be not improper to remark, that shown to in this, as in all other instances, our chief good is the duties combined with our duty. \"Men act from expectation-independance. Expectation is in most cases determined by the authority of assurances and engagements which we receive from the others. If no dependence could be placed upon these assurances, it would be impossible to know what judgment to form of many future events, or how to regulate our conduct with respect to them. Confidence, therefore, in promises, is essential to the intercourse of human life, because without it the greatest part of our conduct would proceed upon chance. But there could be no confidence in promises, if men were not obliged to perform them. Those, therefore, who allow not to the perceptions of the moral sense all that authority which we attribute to them, must still admit the obligation to perform promises; because such performance may be shown to be agreeable to the will of God, in the very same manner in which, upon their principles, we have shown the uniform practice of justice to be so.\n\nFair dealing and fidelity to compacts require that we take no advantage of the ignorance, passion, or incapacity of others, from whatever cause that incapacity arises;\nDuties of Society.\n\n—That we be explicit and candid in making bargains, just and faithful in fulfilling our part of them. And if the other party violates his engagements, redress is to be sought from the laws, or from those who are intrusted with the execution of them. In fine, the commercial virtues and duties require that we not only do not invade, but maintain the rights of others;—that we be fair and impartial in transferring, bartering, or exchanging property, whether in goods or service; and be inviolably faithful to our word and our engagements, where the matter of them is not criminal, and where they are not extorted by force. See Promise.\n\nSect. VII. Social Duties of the Political Kind.\n\nWe are now arrived at the last and highest order of duties respecting society, which result from the exercise of the most generous and heroic affections, and are founded on our most enlarged connexions.\n\nThe social principle in man is of such an expansive nature, that it cannot be confined within the circuit of a family, or a neighbourhood; it spreads into wider systems, and draws men into larger confederacies, communities, and commonwealths. It is in those only that the higher powers of our nature attain the highest improvement and perfection of which they are capable. These principles hardly find objects in the solitary state of nature. There the principle of action rises no higher at farthest than natural affection towards one's offspring. There personal or family wants entirely engross the creature's attention and labour, and allow no leisure, or, if they did, no exercise for views and affections of a more enlarged kind.\n\nIn solitude all are employed in the same way, in providing for the animal life. And even after their utmost labour and care, fingle and unaided by the industry of others, they find but a sorry supply of their wants, and a feeble precarious security against dangers from wild beasts; from inclement skies and seasons; from the mistakes or petulant passions of their fellow creatures; from their preference of themselves to their neighbours; and from all the little exorbitancies of self-love. But in society, the mutual aids which men give and receive shorten the labours of each, and the combined strength and reason of individuals give security and protection to the whole body.\n\nThere is both a variety and subordination of genius among mankind. Some are formed to lead and direct others, to contrive plans of happiness for individuals and of government for communities, to take in a public interest, invent laws and arts, and superintend their execution, and, in short, to refine and civilize human life. Others, who have not such good heads, may have as honest hearts, a truly public spirit, love of liberty, hatred of corruption and tyranny, a generous submission to laws, order, and public institutions, and an extensive philanthropy. And others, who have none of those capacities either of heart or head, may be well formed for manual exercises and bodily labour. The former of these principles have no scope in solitude, where a man's thoughts and concerns do all either centre in himself or extend no farther than a family; into which little circle all the duty and virtue of the solitary mortal is crowded. But society finds proper objects and exercises for every genius, and the noblest objects and exercises for the noblest geniuses, and for the highest principles in the human constitution; particularly for that warmest and most divine passion which God hath kindled in our bosoms, the inclination of doing good, and reverencing our nature; which may find here both employment and the most exquisite satisfaction. In society, a man has not only more leisure, but better opportunities, of applying his talents with much greater perfection and success, especially as he is furnished with the joint advice and assistance of his fellow creatures, who are now more closely united one with the other, and sustain a common relation to the same moral system or community. This then is an object proportioned to his most enlarged social affections; and in serving it he finds scope for the exercise and refinement of his highest intellectual and moral powers. Therefore society, or a state of civil government, rests on these two principal pillars, \"That in it we find security against those evils which are unavoidable in solitude,—and obtain those goods, some of which cannot be obtained at all, and others not so well, in that state where men depend solely on their individual sagacity and industry.\"\n\nFrom this short detail it appears, that man is a social creature, and formed for a social state; and that society, being adapted to the higher principles and definitions of his nature, must of necessity be his natural state.\n\nThe duties suited to that state, and resulting from political those principles and destinations, or, in other words, duties from our social passions and social connexions, or relation to a public system, are, love of our country, resignation, and obedience to the laws, public spirit, love of liberty, sacrifice of life and all to the public, and the like.\n\nLove of our country, is one of the noblest passions that can warm and animate the human breast. It includes all the limited and particular affections to our parents, friends, neighbours, fellow citizens, countrymen. It ought to direct and limit their more confused and partial actions within their proper and natural bounds, and never let them encroach on those sacred and first regards we owe to the great public to which we belong. Were we solitary creatures, detached from the rest of mankind, and without any capacity of comprehending a public interest, or without affections leading us to desire and pursue it, it would not be our duty to mind it, nor criminal to neglect it. But as we are parts of the public system, and are not only capable of taking in large views of its interests, but by the strongest affections connected with it, and prompted to take a share of its concerns, we are under the most sacred ties to prosecute its security and welfare with the utmost ardour, especially in times of public trial. This love of our country does not import an attachment to any particular soil, climate, or spot of earth, where perhaps we first drew our breath, though those natural ideas are often associated with the moral ones, and, like external signs or symbols, help to ascertain and bind them; but it imports an affection to that moral system, or community, which is governed by the same laws and magistrates, and whose several parts are variously connected one with the other, and\nDuties of Society.\n\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nPart II.\n\nDuties of Society.\n\nperhaps indeed every member of the community cannot comprehend so large an object, especially if it extends through large provinces, and over vast tracts of land; and still less can he form such an idea, if there is no public, i.e., if all are subject to the caprice and unlimited will of one man; but the preference the generality show to their native country, the concern and longing after it which they express when they have been long absent from it; the labours they undertake and sufferings they endure to save or serve it, and the peculiar attachment they have to their countrymen, evidently demonstrate that the passion is natural, and never fails to exert itself when it is fairly engaged from foreign clogs, and is directed to its proper object. Wherever it prevails in its genuine vigour and extent, it swallows up all sordid and selfish regards; it conquers the love of ease, power, pleasure, and wealth; nay, when the amiable partialities of friendship, gratitude, private affection, or regards to a family, come in competition with it, it will teach us bravely to sacrifice all, in order to maintain the rights, and promote or defend the honour and happiness of our country.\n\nResignation and obedience to the laws and orders of the society to which we belong, are political duties necessary to its very being and security, without which it must soon degenerate into a state of licentiousness and anarchy. The welfare, nay, the nature of civil society, requires, that there should be a subordination of orders, or diversity of ranks and conditions in it;—that certain men, or orders of men, be appointed to superintend and manage such affairs as concern the public safety and happiness;—that all have their particular provinces assigned them;—that such a subordination be settled among them as none of them may interfere with another; and finally, that certain rules or common measures of action be agreed on, by which each is to discharge his respective duty to govern or be governed, and all may concur in securing the order, and promoting the felicity, of the whole political body. Those rules of action are the laws of the community; and those different orders are the several officers or magistrates appointed by the public to explain them, and superintend or assist in their execution. In consequence of this settlement of things, it is the duty of each individual to obey the laws enacted; to submit to the executors of them with all due deference and homage, according to their respective ranks and dignity, as to the keepers of the public peace, and the guardians of public liberty; to maintain his own rank, and perform the functions of his own station, with diligence, fidelity, and incorruption. The superiority of the higher orders, or the authority with which the state has invested them, entitle them, especially if they employ their authority well, to the obedience and submission of the lower, and to a proportionable honour and respect from all. The subordination of the lower ranks claims protection, defence, and security from the higher. And the laws, being superior to all, require the obedience and submission of all, being the last resort, beyond which there is no decision or appeal.\n\nPublic spirit, heroic zeal, love of liberty, and the other political duties, do, above all others, recommend those who practise them to the admiration and homage of mankind; because, as they are the offspring of the noblest minds, so are they the parents of the greatest blessings to society. Yet, exalted as they are, it is only in equal and free governments where they can be exercised and have their due effect; for there, liberty only does a true public spirit prevail, and there only is the public good made the standard of the civil constitution. As the end of society is the common interest and welfare of the people assembled, this end must necessarily be the supreme law, or common standard, by which the particular rules of action of the several members of the society towards each other are to be regulated. But a common interest can be no other than that which is the result of the common reason or common feelings of all. Private men, or a particular order of men, have interests and feelings peculiar to themselves, and of which they may be good judges; but these may be separate from, and often contrary to, the interests and feelings of the rest of the society; and therefore they can have no right to make, and much less to impose, laws on their fellow citizens, inconsistent with, and opposite to, those interests and those feelings. Therefore, a society, a government, or real public, truly worthy the name, and not a confederacy of banditti, a clan of lawless savages, or a band of slaves under the whip of a master, must be such a one as consists of freemen, choosing or consenting to laws themselves; or, since it often happens that they cannot assemble and act in a collective body, delegating a sufficient number of representatives, i.e., such a number as shall most fully comprehend, and most equally represent, their common feelings and common interests, to digest and vote laws for the conduct and control of the whole body, the most agreeable to those common feelings and common interests.\n\nA society thus constituted by common reason, and formed on the plan of a common interest, becomes immediately an object of public attention, public veneration, every citizen; public obedience, a public and inviolable attachment, which ought neither to be seduced by bribes, nor awed by terrors; an object, in fine, of all those extensive and important duties which arise from so glorious a confederacy. To watch over such a system; to contribute all he can to promote its good by his reason, his ingenuity, his strength, and every other ability, whether natural or acquired; to resist, and, to the utmost of his power, defeat every encroachment upon it, whether carried on by a secret corruption or open violence; and to sacrifice his ease, his wealth, his power, nay life itself, and, what is dearer still, his family and friends, to defend or save it, is the duty, the honour, the interest, and the happiness of every citizen; it will make him venerable and beloved while he lives, be lamented and honoured if he falls in so glorious a cause, and transmit his name with immortal renown to the latest posterity.\n\nAs the people are the fountain of power and authority, the original seat of majesty, the authors of laws, and the creators of officers to execute them; if they shall find the power they have conferred abused by their trustees, their majesty violated by tyranny or by usurpation, their authority prostituted to support violence or foreign corruption, the laws grown pernicious through accidents unforeseen or unavoidable, or rendered\nrendered ineffectual through the infidelity and corruption of the executors of them; then it is their right, and what is their right is their duty, to repute that delegated power, and call their trustees to an account; to resist the usurpation, and extirpate the tyranny; to retrace their fulfilled majesty and prostituted authority; to suspend, alter, or abrogate those laws, and punish their unfaithful and corrupt officers. Nor is it the duty only of the united body; but every member of it ought, according to his respective rank, power, and weight in the community, to concur in advancing and supporting these glorious designs.\n\nResistance, therefore, being undoubtedly lawful in extraordinary emergencies, the question, among good reasoners, can only be with regard to the degree of necessity which can justify resistance, and render it expedient or commendable. And here we must acknowledge, that, with Mr Hume *, \"we shall always incline to their side that draw the bond of allegiance very close, and who consider an infringement of it as the last refuge in desperate cases, when the public is in the highest danger from violence and tyranny. For besides the mischiefs of a civil war, which commonly attends insurrection, it is certain, that where a disposition to rebellion appears among any people, it is one chief cause of tyranny in the rulers, and forces them into many violent measures, which, had every one been inclined to submission and obedience, they would never have embraced. Thus the tyrannicide, or allaffination approved of by ancient maxims, instead of keeping tyrants and usurpers in awe, made them ten times more fierce and unrelenting; and is now justly abolished on that account by the laws of nations, and universally condemned, as a base and treacherous method of bringing to justice those disturbers of society.\"\n\n**CHAP. IV. Duty to God.**\n\nOf all the relations which the human mind sustains, that which subsists between the Creator and his creatures, the supreme Lawgiver and his subjects, is the highest and the best. This relation arises from the nature of a creature in general, and the constitution of the human mind in particular; the noblest powers and affections of which point to an universal Mind, and would be imperfect and abortive without such a direction. How lame then must that system of morals be, which leaves a Deity out of the question! How disconsolate, and how defective of its firmest support!\n\nIt does not appear, from any true history or experience of the mind's progress, that any man, by any formal deduction of his discursive power, ever reasoned himself into the belief of a God. Whether such a belief is only some natural anticipation of soul, or is derived from father to son, and from one man to another, in the way of tradition, or is suggested to us in consequence of an immutable law of our nature, on beholding the august aspect and beautiful order of the universe, we will not pretend to determine. What seems most agreeable to experience is, that a sense of its beauty and grandeur, and the admirable fitness of one thing to another in its vast apparatus, leads the mind necessarily and unavoidably to a perception of a design, or of a designing cause, the origin of all, by a progress as simple and natural as that by which a beautiful picture or a fine building suggests to us the idea of an excellent artist. For it seems to hold universally true, that wherever we discern a tendency or co-operation of things towards a certain end, or producing a common effect, there, by a necessary law of association, we apprehend design, a designing energy or cause. No matter whether the objects are natural or artificial, still that suggestion is unavoidable, and the connexion between the effect and its adequate cause obtrudes itself on the mind, and it requires no nice search or elaborate deduction of reason to trace or prove that connexion. We are particularly satisfied of its truth in the subject before us by a kind of direct intuition; and we do not seem to attend to the maxim we learn in schools, \"That there cannot be an infinite series of causes and effects producing and produced by one another.\" That maxim is familiar only to metaphysicians; but all men of sound understanding are led to believe the existence of a God. We are conscious of our existence, of thought, sentiment, and passion, and sensible within that these came not of ourselves; therefore we immediately recognize a parent mind, an original intelligence, from whom we borrowed those little portions of thought and activity. And while we not only feel kind affections in ourselves, and discover them in others, but likewise behold round us such a number and variety of creatures, endowed with natures nicely adjusted to their several stations and economies, supporting and supported by each other, and all sustained by a common order of things, and differing different degrees of happiness according to their respective capacities, we are naturally and necessarily led up to the Father of such a numerous offspring, the fountain of such wide-spread happiness. As we conceive this Being before all, above all, and greater than all, we naturally, and without reasoning, ascribe to him every kind of perfection, wisdom, power, and goodness without bounds, existing through all time, and pervading all space. We apply to him those glorious epithets of our Creator, Preserver, Benefactor, the supreme Lord and Lawgiver of the whole society of rational and intelligent creatures. Not only the imperfections and wants of our being and condition, but some of the noblest instincts and affections of our minds, connect us with this great and universal nature. The mind, in its progress from object to object, from one character and prospect of beauty to another, finds some blemish or deficiency in each, and soon exhausts or grows weary and dissatisfied with its subject; it sees no character of excellency among men equal to that pitch of esteem which it is capable of exerting; no object within the compass of human things adequate to the strength of its affection: nor can it stay anywhere in this self expansive progress, or find repose after its highest flights, till it arrives at a Being of unbounded greatness and worth, on whom it may employ its sublime powers without exhausting the subject, and give scope to the utmost force and fulness of its love without satiety or disgust. So that the nature of this Being corresponds to the nature of man; nor can his intelligent and moral powers obtain their entire end, but on the supposition of such a Being, and without a real sympathy and communication with him. The native propensity of the mind to reverence whatever is great and wonderful in nature, finds a proper object of homage in him who spread out the heavens and...\nand the earth, and who sustains and governs the whole of things. The admiration of beauty, the love of order, and the complacency we feel in goodness, must rise to the highest pitch, and attain the full vigour and joy of their operations, when they unite in him who is the sum and source of all perfection.\n\nIt is evident from the slightest survey of morals, that how punctual soever one may be in performing the duties which result from our relations to mankind, yet to be quite deficient in performing those which arise from our relation to the Almighty, must argue a strange perversion of reason or depravity of heart. If imperfect degrees of worth attract our veneration, and if the want of it would imply an infidelity, or, which is worse, an aversion to merit, what lameness of affection or immorality of character must it be to be unaffected with, and much more to be ill-affected to, a Being of superlative worth! To love society, or particular members of it, and yet to have no sense of our connexion with its Head, no affection to our common Parent and Benefactor; to be concerned about the approbation or censure of our fellow creatures, and yet to feel nothing of this kind towards him who sees and weighs our actions with unerring wisdom and justice, and can fully reward or punish them, betrays equal madness and partiality of mind. It is plain, therefore, beyond all doubt, that some regards are due to the great Father of all, in whom every lovely and adorable quality combines to inspire veneration and homage.\n\nAs it has been observed already, that our affections depend on our opinions of their objects, and generally keep pace with them, it must be of the highest importance, and seems to be among the first duties we owe to the Author of our being, \"to form the least imperfect, since we cannot form perfect, conceptions of his character and administration.\" For such conceptions, thoroughly imbibed, will render our religion rational, and our dispositions refined. If our opinions are diminutive and distorted, our religion will be superstitious, and our temper absurd. Thus, if we ascribe to the Deity that false majesty which consists in the unbenevolent and fulsome exercise of mere will or power, or suppose him to delight in the prostrations of servile fear, or as servile praise, he will be worshipped with mean adulation and a profusion of compliments. Further, if he be looked upon as a stern and implacable Being, delighting in vengeance, he will be adored with pompous offerings, sacrifices, or whatever else may be thought proper to soothe and mollify him. But if we believe perfect goodness to be the character of the supreme Being, and that he loves those most who resemble him most, the worship paid him will be rational and sublime, and his worshippers will seek to please him by imitating that goodness which they adore. The foundation then of all true religion is a rational faith. And of a rational faith these seem to be the chief articles, to believe, \"that an infinite all-perfect Mind exists, who has no opposite nor any separate interest from that of his creatures: that he superintends and governs all creatures, and things;—that his goodness extends to all his creatures, in different degrees indeed, according to their respective natures, but without any partiality or envy;—that he does every thing for the best, or in a subserviency to the perfection and happiness of the whole; particularly that he directs and governs the affairs of men, inspects their actions, distinguishes the good from the bad, loves and befriends the former, is displeased with and pities the latter in this world, and will according to their respective defects reward one and punish the other in the next;—that, in fine, he is always carrying on a scheme of virtue and happiness through an unlimited duration; and is ever guiding the universe, through its successive stages and periods, to higher degrees of perfection and felicity.\" This is true Theism, the glorious scheme of divine faith; a scheme exhibited in all the works of God, and executed through his whole administration.\n\nThis faith, well founded and deeply felt, is nearly connected with a true moral taste, and hath a powerful effect on the temper and manners of the theft. He who admires goodness in others, and delights in the practice of it, must be conscious of a reigning order within, a rectitude and candour of heart, which disposes him to entertain favourable apprehensions of men, and, from an impartial survey of things, to presume that good order and good meaning prevail in the universe; and if good meaning and good order, then an ordering, an intending mind, who is no enemy, no tyrant to his creatures, but a friend, a benefactor, an indulgent sovereign. On the other hand, a bad man, having no morality thing godly or generous to contemplate within, no right of atheism, intentions, nor honesty of heart, suspects every person and everything; and, beholding nature through the gloom of a selfish and guilty mind, is either averse to the belief of a reigning order, or, if he cannot suppress the unconquerable anticipations of a governing mind, he is prone to tarnish the beauty of nature, and to impute malevolence, or blindness and impotence at least, to the Sovereign Ruler. He turns the universe into a forlorn and horrid waste, and transfers his own character to the Deity, by ascribing to him that uncommunicative grandeur, that arbitrary or revengeful spirit, which he affects or admires in himself. As such a temper of mind naturally leads to atheism, or to a superstition fully as bad; therefore, as far as that temper depends on the unhappy creature on whom it prevails, the propensity to atheism or superstition consequent thereto must be immoral. Farther, if it be true that the belief or sense of a Deity is natural to the mind, and the evidence of his existence reflected from his works so full as to strike even the most superficial observer with conviction, then the supplanting or corrupting that sense, or the want of due attention to that evidence, and, in consequence of both, a supine ignorance or affected unbelief of a Deity, must argue a bad temper or an immoral turn of mind. In the case of invincible ignorance, or a very bad education, though nothing can be concluded directly against the character; yet whenever ill passions and habits pervert the judgement, and by perverting the judgement terminate in atheism, then the case becomes plainly criminal.\n\nBut let cautions determine this as they will, a true Theism in the divine character and administration is generally the consequence of a virtuous state of mind. The man who is truly and habitually good, feels the love of order, of beauty, and goodness, in the strongest degree; and therefore cannot be insensible to those emanations of them which appear in all the works of God, nor\nDuty to God.\n\nnor help loving their supreme source and model. He cannot but think, that he who has poured such beauty and goodness over all his works, must himself delight in beauty and goodness, and what he delights in must be both amiable and happy. Some indeed there are, and it is pity there should be any such, who, through the unhappy influence of a wrong education, have entertained dark and unfriendly thoughts of the Deity and his administration, though otherwise of a virtuous temper themselves. However, it must be acknowledged, that such sentiments have, for the most part, a bad effect on the temper; and when they have not, it is because the undepraved affections of an honest heart are more powerful in their operation than the speculative opinions of an ill-informed head.\n\nBut wherever right conceptions of the Deity and his providence prevail, when he is considered as the inexhausted source of light, and love, and joy, as acting in the joint character of a Father and Governor, imparting an endless variety of capacities to his creatures, and supplying them with every thing necessary to their full completion and happiness; what veneration and gratitude must such conceptions, thoroughly believed, excite in the mind? How natural and delightful must it be to one whose heart is open to the perception of truth, and of everything fair, great, and wonderful in nature, to contemplate and adore him who is the first fair, the first great, and first wonderful; in whom wisdom, power, and goodness, dwell vitally, essentially, originally, and act in perfect concert? What grandeur is here to fill the most enlarged capacity, what beauty to engage the most ardent love, what a mass of wonders in such exuberance of perfection to astonish and delight the human mind through an unfailing duration?\n\nIf the Deity is considered as our supreme Guardian and Benefactor, as the Father of Mercies, who loves his creatures with infinite tenderness, and, in a particular manner all good men, nay all who delight in goodness, even in its most imperfect degrees; what religion, what dependence, what generous confidence, what hope in God and his all-wise providence, must arise in the soul that is possessed of such amiable views of him! All those exercises of piety, and above all a superlative esteem and love, are directed to God as to their natural, their ultimate, and indeed their only adequate object; and though the immense obligations we have received from him may excite in us more lively feelings of divine goodness than a general and abstracted contemplation of it, yet the affections of gratitude and love are of themselves the generous disinterested kind, not the result of self-interest, or views of reward. A perfect character, in which we always suppose infinite goodness, guided by unerring wisdom, and supported by almighty power, is the proper object of perfect love; which, as such, we are forcibly drawn to pursue and to aspire after. In the contemplation of the divine nature and attributes, we find at last what the ancient philosophers sought in vain, the supreme and sovereign good; from which all other goods arise, and in which they are all contained. The Deity therefore challenges our supreme and sovereign love, a sentiment which, whoever indulges, must be confirmed in the love of virtue, in a desire to imitate its all-perfect pattern, and in a cheerful security that all his great concerns, those of his friends and of the universe, shall be absolutely safe under the conduct of unerring wisdom and unbounded goodness. It is in his care and providence alone that the good man, who is anxious for the happiness of all, finds perfect serenity; a serenity neither ruffled by partial ill nor fouled by private disappointment.\n\nWhen we consider the unstained purity and absolute perfection of the divine nature, and reflect withal on the imperfection and various blemishes of our own, we must sink, or be convinced we ought to sink, into the deepest humility and prostration of soul before him who is so wonderfully great and holy. When, further, we call to mind what low and languid feelings we have of the divine presence and majesty, what infidelity of his fatherly and universal goodness, nay, what ungrateful returns we have made to it, how far we come short of the perfection of his law and the dignity of our own nature, how much we have indulged the selfish passions, and how little we have cherished the benevolent ones; we must be conscious that it is our duty to repent of a temper and conduct so unworthy our nature and unbecoming our obligations to its Author, and to resolve and endeavour to act a wiser and better part for the future.\n\nNevertheless, from the character which his works exhibit of him, from those delays or alleviations of punishment which offenders often experience, and from the merciful tenor of his administration in many other instances, the sincere penitent may entertain good hopes that his Parent and Judge will not be strict to mark iniquity, but will be propitious and favourable to him, if he honestly endeavours to avoid his former practices, and subdue his former habits, and to live in a greater conformity to the divine will for the future. If any doubts or fears should still remain, how far it may be consistent with the rectitude and equity of the divine government to let his iniquities pass unpunished, yet he cannot think it unfitting to his paternal clemency and wisdom to contrive a method of retrieving the penitent offender, that shall unite and reconcile the majesty and mercy of his government. If reason cannot of itself suggest such a scheme, it gives at least some ground to expect it. But though natural religion cannot let in moral light and assurance on so interesting a subject, yet it will teach the humble thief to wait with great submission for any farther intimations it may please the supreme Governor to give of his will; to examine with candour and impartiality whatever evidence shall be proposed to him of a divine revelation, whether that evidence is natural or supernatural; to embrace it with veneration and cheerfulness, if the evidence is clear and convincing; and, finally, if it bring to light any new relations or connexions, natural religion will persuade its sincere votary faithfully to comply with the obligations, and perform the duties which result from those relations and connexions. This is the sin, piety, the completion of morality!\n\nWe must farther observe, that all those affections which we supposed to regard the Deity as their immediate and primary object, are vital energies of the soul, thanksgiving, and consequently exert themselves into acts, and, like all other energies, gain strength or greater activity by that exercise. It is therefore our duty as well as highest interest, often at stated times, and by decent and formal\nDuty to learn acts, to contemplate and adore the great Original of our existence, the Parent of all beauty and of all good; to express our veneration and love by an awful and devout recognition of his perfections; and to evidence our gratitude by celebrating his goodness, and thankfully acknowledging all his benefits. It is likewise our duty, by proper exercises of sorrow and humiliation, to confess our ingratitude and folly; to signify our dependence on God, and our confidence in his goodness, by imploring his blessing and gracious concurrence in afflicting the weaknesses and curing the corruptions of our nature; and, finally, to testify our sense of his authority, and our faith in his government, by devoting ourselves to do his will, and resigning ourselves to his disposal. These duties are not therefore obligatory, because the Deity needs or can be profited by them; but as they are apparently decent and moral, suitable to the relations he sustains of our Creator, Benefactor, Lawgiver, and Judge; expressive of our state and obligations; and improving to our tempers, by making us more rational, social, god-like, and consequently more happy.\n\nWe have now considered Internal piety, or the worship of the mind, that which is in spirit and in truth; we shall conclude the section with a short account of that which is External. External worship is founded on the same principles as internal, and of a similar moral obligation. It is either private or public. Devotion that is inward, or purely intellectual, is too spiritual and abstracted an operation for the bulk of mankind. The operations of their minds, such especially as are employed on the most sublime, immaterial objects, must be assisted by their outward organs, or by some help from the imagination; otherwise they will soon be diffused by sensible impressions, or grow tiresome if too long continued. Ideas are such fleeting things, that they must be fixed; and so subtle, that they must be expressed and delineated, as it were, by sensible marks and images; otherwise we cannot attend to them, nor be much affected by them. Therefore, verbal adoration, prayer, praise, thanksgiving, and confession, are admirable aids to inward devotion, fix our attention, compose and enliven our thoughts, impress us more deeply with a sense of the awful presence in which we are, and, by a natural and mechanical sort of influence, tend to heighten those devout feelings and affections which we ought to entertain, and after this manner reduce into formal and explicit act.\n\nThis holds true in a higher degree in the case of public worship, where the presence of our fellow-creatures, and the powerful contagion of the social affections, conspire to kindle and spread the devout flame with greater warmth and energy. To conclude: As God is the parent and head of the social system, as he has formed us for a social state, as by one we find the best security against the ills of life, and in the other enjoy its greatest comforts, and as, by means of both, our nature attains its highest improvement and perfection; and moreover, as there are public blessings and crimes in which we all share in some degree, and public wants and dangers to which all are exposed—it is therefore evident, that the various and solemn offices of public religion are duties of indissoluble moral obligation, among the best cements of society, the firmest prop of government, and the fairest ornament of both.\n\nPART III.\n\nCHAP. I. Of Practical Ethics, or the Culture of the Mind.\n\nWE have now gone through a particular detail of the several duties we owe to Ourselves, to Society, and to God. In considering the first order of duties, we just touched on the methods of acquiring the different kinds of goods which we are led by nature to pursue; only we left the consideration of the method of acquiring the moral goods of the mind to a chapter by itself, because of its singular importance. This chapter then will contain a brief enumeration of the arts of acquiring virtuous habits, and of eradicating vicious ones, as far as is consistent with the brevity of such a work: a subject of the utmost difficulty as well as importance in morals; to which, nevertheless, the least attention has been generally given by moral writers. This will properly follow a detail of duty, as it will direct us to such means or helps as are most necessary and conducive to the practice of it.\n\nIn the first part of this inquiry we traced the order in which the passions shoot up in the different periods of human life. That order is not accidental, or dependent on the caprice of man, or the influence of custom and education, but arises from the original constitution and laws of our nature; of which this is one, viz.\n\n\"That sensible objects make the first and strongest impressions on the mind.\" These, by means of our outward organs, being conveyed to the mind, become objects of its attention, on which it reflects when the outward objects are no longer present, or, in other words, when the impressions upon the outward organs cease. These objects of the mind's reflection are called ideas or notions. Towards these, by another law of our nature, we are not altogether indifferent; but correspondent movements of desire or aversion, love or hatred, arise, according as the objects which they denote make an agreeable or disagreeable impression on our organs. Those ideas and affections which we experience in the first period of life, we refer to the body, or to sense; and the taste, which is formed towards them, we call a sensible, or a merely natural taste; and the objects corresponding to them we in general call good or pleasant.\n\nBut as the mind moves forward in its course, it extends its views, and receives a new and more complex beauty and set of ideas, in which it observes uniformity, variety, fineness, symmetry of parts, reference to an end, novelty, grandeur. These compose a vast train and diversity of imagery, which the mind compounds, divides, and moulds into a thousand forms, in the absence of those objects which first introduced it. And this more complicated imagery suggests a new train of desires and affections,\nCulture of affections, full as rightly and engaging as any which have yet appeared. This whole class of perceptions or impressions is referred to the imagination, and forms a higher taste than the sensible, and which has an immediate and mighty influence on the finer passions of our nature, and is commonly termed a fine taste.\n\nThe objects which correspond to this taste we use to call beautiful, great, harmonious, or wonderful, or in general by the name of beauty.\n\nThe mind, still pushing onwards and increasing its stock of ideas, ascends from those to a higher species of objects, viz. the order and mutual relations of minds to each other, their reciprocal affections, characters, actions, and various aspects. In these it discovers a beauty, a grandeur, a decorum, more interesting and alluring than in any of the former kinds. These objects, or the notions of them, passing in review before the mind, do, by a necessary law of our nature, call forth another and nobler set of affections, as admiration, esteem, love, honour, gratitude, benevolence, and others of the like tribe. This class of perfections, and their correspondent affections, we refer, because of their objects (manners), to a moral sense, and call the taste or temper they excite, moral. And the objects which are agreeable to this taste or temper we denominate by the general name of moral beauty, in order to distinguish it from the other, which is termed natural.\n\nThese different sets of ideas or notions are the materials about which the mind employs itself, which it blends, ranges, and diversifies ten thousand different ways. It feels a strong propensity to connect and associate those ideas among which it observes any similarity or any aptitude, whether original and natural, or customary and artificial, to suggest each other. See Metaphysics.\n\nBut whatever the reasons are, whether similarity, coexistence, causality, or any other aptitude or relation, why any two or more ideas are connected by the mind at first, it is an established law of our nature, \"that when two or more ideas have often started in company, they form so strong an union, that it is very difficult ever after to separate them.\" Thus the lover cannot separate the idea of merit from his mistress; the courtier that of dignity from his title or ribbon; the miser that of happiness from his bag. It is these associations of worth or happiness with any of the different sets of objects or images before specified that form our taste or complex idea of good. By another law of our nature, \"our affections follow and are governed by this taste. And to these affections our character and conduct are similar and proportioned on the general tenor of which our happiness principally depends.\"\n\nAs all our leading passions then depend on the direction which our taste takes, and as it is always of the same strain with our leading affections, it is worth while to inquire a little more particularly how these are formed, in order to detect the secret sources from whence our passions derive their principal strength, their various rises and falls. For this will give us the true key to their management, and let us into the right method of correcting the bad and improving the good.\n\nNo kind of objects make so powerful an impression on us as those which are immediately impressed on our senses, or strongly painted on our imaginations. Whatever is purely intellectual, as abstracted or scientific truths, the subtle relations and differences of things, has a fainter sort of existence in the mind; and though it may exercise and whet the memory, the judgement, or the reasoning power, gives hardly any impulse at all to the active powers, the passions, which are the main springs of motion. On the other hand, were the mind entirely under the direction of sense, and impresible only by such objects as are present, and strike some of the outward organs, we should then be precisely in the state of the brute creation, and be governed solely by instinct or appetite, and have no power to control whatever impressions are made upon us: Nature has therefore endued us with a middle faculty, wonderfully adapted to our mixed state, which holds partly of sense and partly of reason, being strongly allied to the former, and the common receptacle in which all the notices that come from that quarter are treasured up; and yet greatly subservient and ministerial to the latter, by giving a body, a coherence, and beauty to its conceptions. This middle faculty is called the imagination, one of the most busy and fruitful powers of the mind. Into this common storehouse are likewise carried all those moral forms which are derived from our moral faculties of perception; and there they often undergo new changes and appearances, by being mixed and wrought up with the ideas and forms of sensible or natural things. By this coalition of imagery, natural beauty is dignified and heightened by moral qualities and perfections, and moral qualities are at once exhibited and set off by natural beauty. The sensible beauty, or good, is refined from its dross by partaking of the moral; and the moral receives a stamp, a visible character and currency, from the sensible.\n\nAs we are first of all accustomed to sensible impressions and sensible enjoyments, we contract early a sensual relish or love of pleasure, in the lower sense of the word, heightening it becomes open to higher perceptions of beauty and pleasures; good, borrows from thence a noble set of images, as fine taste, generosity, social affections, friendship, good fellowship, and the like; and, by dressing out the old pursuits with these new ornaments, gives them an additional dignity and lustre. By these ways the desire of a table, love of finery, intrigue and pleasure, are vastly increased beyond their natural pitch, having an impulse combined of the force of the natural appetites, and of the superadded strength of those passions which tend to the moral species. When the mind becomes more sensible to those objects or appearances in which it perceives beauty, uniformity, grandeur, and harmony, as fine clothes, elegant furniture, plate, pictures, gardens, houses, equipage, the beauty of animals, and particularly the attractions of the sex; to these objects the mind is led by nature or taught by custom, the opinion and example of others, to annex certain ideas of moral character, dignity, decorum, honour, liberality, tenderness, and active or social enjoyment. The consequence of this association is, that the objects to which these are annexed must rise in their value, and be pursued with proportionable ardour. The enjoyment of them is often attended with pleasure; and the mere possession of them, where that is wanting, frequently draws respect from one's fellow-creatures: This respect is, by many, thought equivalent to the pleasure of enjoyment. Hence\nCulture of the mind happens that the idea of happiness is connected with the mere passion, which is therefore eagerly sought after without any regard to the generous life or honourable enjoyment. Thus the passion, setting on the means, not the end, i.e., losing sight of its natural object, becomes wild and extravagant.\n\nIn fine, any object, or external denomination, a staff, a garland, a cup, a crown, a title, may become a moral badge or emblem of merit, magnificence, or honour, according as these have been found or thought, by the possessors or admirers of them, to accompany them; yet, by the deception formerly mentioned, the merit or the conduct which entitled, or should entitle, to those marks of distinction, shall be forgot or neglected, and the badges themselves be passionately affected or pursued, as including every excellency. If these are attained by any means, all the concomitants which nature, custom, or accidents have joined to them, will be supposed to follow of course. Thus, moral ends with which the unhappy admiring is apt to colour over his passion and views will, in his opinion, justify the most immoral means, as prostitution, adulation, fraud, treachery, and every species of knavery, whether more open or more disguised.\n\nWhen men are once engaged in active life, and find that wealth and power, generally called interest, are the great avenues to every kind of enjoyment, they are apt to throw in many engaging moral forms to the object of their pursuit, in order to justify their passion, and varnish over the measures they take to gratify it, as independency on the vices or passions of others, provision and security to themselves and friends, prudent economy or well-placed charity, social communication, superiority to their enemies, who are all villains, honourable service, and many other ingredients of merit. To attain such capacities of usefulness or enjoyment, what arts, nay what meanest, can be thought blameable by those cool pursuers of interest?—Nor have they whom the gay world is pleased to indulge with the title of men of pleasure, their imaginations less pregnant with moral images, with which they never fail to ennoble, or, if they cannot do that, to palliate their grots pursuits. Thus admiration of wit, of sentiments and merit, friendship, love, generous sympathy, mutual confidence, giving and receiving pleasure, are the ordinary ingredients with which they leaven their gallantry and pleasurable entertainments; and by which they impose on themselves, and endeavour to impose on others, that their amours are the joint issue of good sense and virtue.\n\nThese affections, variously combined and proportioned by the imagination, form the chief private passions, which govern the lives of the generality, as the love of action, of pleasure, power, wealth, and fame; they influence the defensive, and affect the public passions, and raise joy or sorrow as they are gratified or disappointed. So that in effect these affections of good and evil, beauty and deformity, and the passions they raise, are the main hinges of life and manners, and the great sources of our happiness or misery. It is evident, therefore, that the whole of moral culture must depend on giving a right direction to the leading passions, and duly proportioning them to the value of the objects or goods pursued, under what name soever they may appear.\n\nNow, in order to give them this right direction and due proportion, it appears, from the foregoing detail, that these affections of ideas, upon which the passions depend, must be duly regulated; that is to say, as an exorbitant passion for wealth, pleasure, or power, flows from an association or opinion, that more beauty and sire, by good, whether natural or moral, enters into the enjoyment or possession of them, than really belongs to either; therefore, in restoring these passions to their just proportions, we must begin with correcting the opinion, or breaking the false association, or, in other words, we must decompose the complex phantom of happiness or good, which we fondly admire, disunite those ideas that have no natural alliance; and separate the original idea of wealth, power, or pleasure, from the foreign mixtures incorporated with it, which enhance its value, or give it its chief power to enchant and seduce the mind. For instance, let it be considered how poor and inconsiderable a thing wealth is, if it be disjointed from real use, or from ideas of capacity in the possessor to do good, from independence, generosity, provision for a family or friends, and social communication with others. By this standard let its true value be fixed; let its misapplication, or benevolent enjoyment, be accounted formal and infamous; and nothing worthy or estimable be ascribed to the mere possession of it, which is not borrowed from its generous life.\n\nIf that complex form of good which is called pleasure by self-deceivers engage us, let it be analyzed into its constituent principal, and its principles, or those allurements it draws from the heart; counteract and extinguish, in order to heighten the low part of process; the indulgence; let the separate and comparative moment of each be distinctly ascertained and deduced from that gro's part, and this remainder of the accumulated enjoyment will dwindle down into a poor, insipid, transitory thing. In proportion as the opinion of the good pursued abates, the admiration must decay, and the passions lose strength of course. One effectual way to lower the opinion, and consequently to weaken the basis founded upon it, is to practice lesser pieces of self-denial, or to abstain, to a certain pitch, from the pursuit or enjoyment of the favourite object; and, that this may be the more easily accomplished, one must avoid those occasions, that company, those places, and the other circumstances, that inflamed one and endeared the other. And, as a counter-process, let higher or even different enjoyments be brought in view, other passions played upon the former, different places frequented, other exercises tried, company kept with persons of a different or more correct way of thinking both in natural and moral subjects.\n\nAs much depends on our setting out well in life, let by a sound education, the youthful fancy, which is apt to be very florid and luxuriant, be early accustomed by instruction, example, and significant moral exercises, nay, by looks, gestures, and every other testimony of just approbation or blame, to annex ideas of merit, honour, and happiness, not to birth, dress, rank, beauty, fortune, power, popularity, and the like outward things, but to moral and truly virtuous qualities, and to those enjoyments which spring from a well-informed judgement and a regular conduct of the affections, especially those of the social and disinterested kind. Such dignified forms of beauty and good, often suggested, and, by moving pictures and examples warmly recommended to the imagination, enforced by the authority of conscience, and demonstrated by reason to be the\nPart III.\n\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nCulture of the surest means of enjoyment, and the only independent, undefeatable, and durable goods, will be the best counterbalance to meaner passions, and the firmest foundation and security of virtue.\n\nIt is of great importance to the forming a just taste, or pure and large conceptions of happiness, to study and understand human nature well, to remember what a complicated system it is, particularly to have deeply imprinted on our mind that GRADATION OF SENSES, FACULTIES, and POWERS OF ENJOYMENT formerly mentioned, and the SUBORDINATION OF GOODS resulting from thence, which nature points out, and the experience of mankind confirms. Who, when they think seriously, and are not under the immediate influence of some violent prejudice or passion, prefer not the pleasures of action, contemplation, society, and most exercises and joys of the moral kind, as friendship, natural affection, and the like, to all sensual gratifications whatsoever? Where the different species of pleasure are blended into one complex form, let them be accurately distinguished, and be referred each to its proper faculty and sense, and examined apart what they have peculiar, what common with others, and what foreign and adventitious. Let wealth, grandeur, luxury, love, fame, and the like, be tried by this test, and their true alloy will be found out. Let it be further considered, whether the mind may not be easy and enjoy itself greatly, though it want many of those elegancies and superfluities of life which some possess, or that load of wealth and power which others eagerly pursue, and under which they groan. Let the difficulty of attaining, the precariousness of possessing, and the many abatements in enjoying overgrown wealth and envied greatness, of which the weary possessors so frequently complain, as the hurry of business, the burden of company, of paying attendance to the few, and giving it to many, the cares of keeping, the tears of losing, and the desires of increasing what they have, and the other troubles which accompany this pitiful drudgery and pompous servitude; let these and the like circumstances be often considered, that are conducive to the removing or lessening the opinion of such goods, and the attendant passion or set of passions will decay of course.\n\nLet the peculiar bent of our nature and character be observed, whether we are most inclined to form associations and relish objects of the sensual, intellectual, or moral kind. Let that which has the ascendant be particularly watched; let it be directed to right objects, be improved by proportioned exercises, and guarded by proper checks from an opposite quarter. Thus the feeble turn may be exalted by the intellectual, and a taste for the beauty of the fine arts, and both may be made subservient to convey and rivet sentiments highly moral and public spirited. This inward survey must extend to the strength and weaknesses of one's nature, one's conditions, connexions, habits, fortunes, studies, acquaintance, and the other circumstances of one's life, from which every man will form the fullest estimate of his own dispositions and character, and the best rules for correcting and improving them. And in order to do this with more advantage, let those times or critical seasons be watched when the mind is best disposed towards a change; and let them be improved by rigorous resolutions, promises, or whatever else will engage the mind to persevere in virtue. Let the conduct, in fine, be often reviewed, and the causes of its corruption or improvement be carefully observed.\n\nIt will greatly conduce to refine the moral taste and frequently strengthen the virtuous temper, to accustom the mind to moral exercises, the frequent exercise of moral sentiments and determinations, by reading history, poetry, particularly of the picturesque and dramatic kind, the study of the fine arts; by conversing with the most eminent for good sense and virtue; but above all, by frequent and repeated acts of humanity, compassion, friendship, politeness, and hospitality. It is exercise that gives health and strength. He that reasons most frequently becomes the wisest, and most enjoys the pleasures of wisdom. He who is most often affected by objects of compassion in poetry, history, or real life, will have his soul most open to pity, and its delightful pains and duties. So he also who practices most diligently the offices of kindness and charity, will by it cultivate that disposition from whence all his pretensions to personal merit must arise, his present and his future happiness.\n\nAn useful and honourable employment in life will administer a thousand opportunities of this kind, and greatly strengthen a sense of virtue and good affections, which must be nourished by right training, as well as our understandings. For such an employment, by enlarging one's experience, giving a habit of attention and caution, or obliging one, from necessity or interest, to keep a guard over the passions, and study the outward decencies and appearances of virtue, will by degrees produce good habit, and at length infuse the love of virtue and honesty for its own sake.\n\nIt is a great inducement to the exercise of benevolence to view human nature in a favourable light, to men and observe the characters and circumstances of mankind in a fair light; on the fairest sides, to put the best constructions on their actions they will bear, and to consider them as the result of partial and mistaken rather than ill affections, or, at worst, as the excesses of a pardonable fellow, seldom or never the effect of pure malice.\n\nAbove all, the nature and consequences of virtue and vice, their consequences being the law of our nature and will of heaven; the light in which they appear to our supreme Parent and Lawgiver, and the reception they will meet with from him, must be often attended to. The exercises of piety, as adoration and praise of the divine excellency, invocation of and dependence on his aid, confession, thanksgiving, and resignation, are habitually to be indulged, and frequently performed, not only as medicinal, but highly improving to the temper.\n\nTo conclude: It will be of admirable efficacy to by just wards eradicating bad habits, and implanting good views of ones, frequently to contemplate human life as the great nursery of our future and immortal existence, as that state of probation in which we are to be educated for a divine with a future; to remember, that our virtues or vices will be immortal as ourselves, and influence our future as well as our present happiness—and therefore, that every disposition and action is to be regarded as pointing beyond the present to an immortal duration.—An habitual attention to this wide and important connexion will give a vast compats and dignity to our sentiments and actions, a noble\nMotives to Virtue from Personal Happiness.\n\nWe have already considered our obligations to the practice of virtue arising from the constitution of our nature, by which we are led to approve a certain order and economy of affections, and a certain course of action correspondent to it*. But, besides this, there are several motives which strengthen and secure virtue, though not themselves of a moral kind. These are, its tendency to personal happiness, and the contrary tendency of vice. \"Personal happiness arises either from the state of a man's own mind, or from the state and disposition of external causes towards him.\"\n\nWe shall first examine the \"tendency of virtue to happiness with respect to the state of a man's own mind.\" This is a point of the utmost consequence in morals, because, unless we can convince ourselves, or show to others, that, by doing our duty, or fulfilling our moral obligations, we consult the greatest satisfaction of our own mind, or our highest interest on the whole, it will raise strong and often unsurmountable prejudices against the practice of virtue, especially whenever there arise any appearances of opposition between our duty and our satisfaction or interest. To creatures so devious of happiness, and averse to misery, as we are, and often so oddly situated amidst contending passions and interests, it is necessary that virtue appear not only an honourable but a pleasing and beneficent form. And in order to justify our choice to ourselves as well as before others, we must ourselves feel and be able to avow in the face of the whole world, that her ways are ways of pleasantness, and her paths the paths of peace. This will show, beyond all contradiction, that we not only approve, but can give a sufficient reason for what we do.\n\nLet any man in a cool hour, when he is disengaged from business, and undisturbed by passion (as such cool hours will sometimes happen), sit down, and ferociously reflect with himself what state or temper of mind he would choose to feel and indulge, in order to be easy and to enjoy himself. Would he choose, for that purpose, to be in a constant dilatation and hurry of thought; to be disturbed in the exercise of his reason; to have various and often interfering phantoms of good playing before his imagination, soliciting and distracting him by turns, now soothing him with amusing hopes, then torturing him with anxious fears; and to approve this minute what he shall condemn the next? Would he choose to have a strong and painful sense of every petty injury; quick apprehensions of every impending evil; incessant and insatiable desires of power, wealth, honour, pleasure; an irreconcilable antipathy against all competitors and rivals; insolent and tyrannical dispositions to all below him; fawning, and at the same time envious, dispositions to all above him; with dark suspicions and jealousies of every mortal? Would he choose neither to love nor be beloved of any; to have no friend in whom to confide, or with whom to interchange his sentiments or designs; no favourite, on whom to bestow his kindness, or vent his passions; in fine, to be conscious of no merit from mankind, no esteem from any creature, no good affection to his Maker, no concern for, nor hopes of, his approbation; but, instead of all these, to hate, and know that he is hated, to condemn, and know that he is condemned by all; by the good, because he is unlike; and by the bad because he is so like themselves; to hate or to dread the very Being that made him; and, in short, to have his breast the seat of pride and passion, petulance and revenge, deep melancholy, cool malignity, and all the other furies that ever poiseled and tortured mankind?—Would our calm inquirer after happiness pitch on such a state, and such a temper of mind, as the most likely means to put him in possession of his desired ease and self-enjoyment?\n\nOr would he rather choose a serene and easy flow of thought; a reason clear and composed; a judgement unbiassed by prejudice, and undistracted by passion; a sober and well-governed fancy, which presents the images of things true, and unmixed with delusive and unnatural charms, and therefore administers no improper or dangerous fuel to the passions, but leaves the mind free to choose or reject, as becomes a reasonable creature; a sweet and sedate temper, not easily ruffled by hopes or fears, prone neither to suspicion nor revenge, apt to view men and things in the fairest lights, and to bend gently to the humours of others rather than obstinately to contend with them? Would he choose such moderation and continence of mind, as neither to be ambitious of power, fond of honour, covetous of wealth, nor a slave to pleasure; a mind of course neither elated with success, nor depressed with disappointment; such a modest and noble spirit as supports power without insolence, wears honour without pride, uses wealth without profusion or parsimony; and rejoices more in giving than in receiving pleasure; such fortitude and equanimity as rises above misfortunes, or turns them into blessings; such integrity and greatness of mind, as neither flatters the princes, nor triumphs over the follies of men; as equally spurns servitude and tyranny, and will neither engage in low dignities, nor abet them in others? Would he choose, in fine, such mildness and benignity of heart as takes part in all the joys, and refuses none of the sorrows, of others; stands well affected to all mankind; is conscious of meriting the esteem of all, and of being beloved by the best; a mind which delights in doing good without any show, and yet arrogates nothing on that account; rejoices in loving and being beloved by its Maker, acts ever under his eye, resigns itself to his providence, and triumphs in his approbation? Which of these dispositions would be his choice in order to be contented, serene, and happy? The former temper is vice, the latter virtue. Where one prevails, there misery prevails, and by the generality is acknowledged to prevail. Where the other reigns, there happiness reigns, and by the confession of mankind is acknowledged to reign. The perfection of either temper is misery or happiness in perfection.—Therefore, every approach to either extreme is an approach to misery or to happiness; i.e., every degree of vice or virtue is accompanied with a proportional degree of misery or happiness.\n\nThe principal alleviations of a virtuous man's calamities are these:—That though some of them may occasion his ills,\nMotives to have been the effect of his imprudence or weakness, yet few of them are sharpened by a sense of guilt, and none of them by a consciousness of wickedness, which surely is their keenest sting—that they are common to him with the best of men—that they seldom or never attack him quite unprepared, but rather guarded with a consciousness of his own sincerity and virtue, with a faith and trust in Providence, and a firm resignation to its perfect orders—that they may be improved as means of correction, or materials to give scope and stability to his virtues—and, to name no more, they are considerably lessened, and often sweetened to him, by the general sympathy of the wife and good.\n\nHis enjoyments are more numerous, or, if less numerous, yet more intense than those of the bad man: for he shares in the joys of others by rebound; and every increase of general or particular happiness is a real addition to his own. It is true, his friendly sympathy with others subjects him to some pains which the hard-hearted wretch does not feel; yet to give a loo to it, is a kind of agreeable discharge. It is such a sorrow as he loves to indulge; a sort of pleasing anguish that sweetly melts the mind, and terminates in a self-approving joy. Though the good man may want means to execute, or be disappointed in the success of his benevolent purposes; yet, as was formerly observed, he is full conscious of good affection, and that consciousness is an enjoyment of a more delightful favour than the greatest triumphs of successful vice. If the ambitious, covetous, or voluptuous, are disappointed, their passions recoil upon them with a fury proportioned to their opinion of the value of what they pursue, and their hope of success; while they have nothing within to balance the disappointment, unless it is an useless fund of pride, which, however, frequently turns mere accidents into mortifying affronts, and exalts grief into rage and frenzy. Whereas the meek, humble, and benevolent temper, is its own reward, is satisfied from within; and, as it magnifies greatly the pleasure of success, so it wonderfully alleviates, and in a manner annihilates, all pain for the want of it.\n\nAs the good man is conscious of loving and willing well to all mankind, he must be sensible of his deserving the esteem and good-will of all; and this supposed reciprocation of social feelings is, by the very frame of our nature, made a source of very intense and enlivening joys. By this sympathy of affections and interests, he feels himself intimately united with the human race; and, being sensibly alive over the whole system, his heart receives and becomes responsive to every touch given to any part. So that, as an eminent philosopher* finely expresses it, he gathers contentment and delight from the pleased and happy states of those around him, from accounts and relations of such happiness, from the very countenances, gestures, voices, and sounds, even of creatures foreign to our kind, whose signs of joy and contentment he can any way discern.\n\nNor do those generous affections stop any other natural source of joy whatever, or deaden his sense of any innocent gratification. They rather keep the several senses and powers of enjoyment open and engaged, intense and uncorrupted by riot or abuse; as is evident to any one who considers the dissipated, un-\n\n*Vide Shaftesb. Inq. into Virtue. Book II.\n\nDo not interfere with other joys.\n\nfeeling state of men of pleasure, ambition, or interest, From Happ. and compares it with the serene and gentle state of a pinces mind at peace with itself, and friendly to all mankind, unruffled by any violent emotion, and sensible to every good-natured and alluring joy.\n\nIt was easy, by going through the different sets of the private affections mentioned formerly, to show, that it is only by maintaining the proportion settled there, that the chap. i. ii.\n\nmind arrives at true repose and satisfaction. If fear exceeds that proportion, it sinks into melancholy and dejection. If anger passes just bounds, it ferments into rage and revenge, or subsides into a sullen corroding gloom, which embitters every good, and renders one exquisitely sensible to every ill. The private passions, the love of honour especially, whose impulses are more generous, as its effects are more diffusive, are instruments of private pleasure; but if they are disproportioned to our wants, or to the value of their several objects, or to the balance of other passions equally necessary and amiable, they become instruments of intense pain and misery. For, being now destitute of that counterpoise which held them at a due pitch, they grow turbulent, peevish, and revengeful, the cause of constant reflections and torment, sometimes flying out into a wild delirious joy, at other times settling in a deep sanguine grief. The concert between reason and passion is then broke: all is dissonance and distraction within. The mind is out of frame, and feels an agony proportioned to the violence of the reigning passion.\n\nThe case is much the same, or rather worse, when in any of the particular kind affections are out of their natural order and proportion; as happens in the case of effeminacy, pity, exorbitant love, parental dotage, or any party passion, where the just regards to society are supplanted. The more social and disinterested the passion is, it breaks out into the wilder excesses, and makes the more dreadful havoc both within and abroad; as is but too apparent in those cases where a false species of religion, honour, zeal, or party-rage, has seized on the natural enthusiasm of the mind, and worked it up to madness. It breaks through all ties natural and civil, disregards the most sacred and solemn obligations, silences every other affection whether public or private, and transforms the most gentle natures into the most savage and inhuman.\n\nWhereas, the man who keeps the balance of affections even, is easy and serene in his motions; mild, and yet portioned affectionate; uniform and consistent with himself; is not liable to disagreeable collisions of interests and passions; gives always place to the most friendly and humane affections, and never to dispositions or acts of resentment, but on high occasions, when the security of the private, or welfare of the public system, or the great interests of mankind, necessarily require a noble indignation; and even then he observes a just measure in wrath; and last of all, he proportions every passion to the value of the object he affects, or to the importance of the end he pursues.\n\nTo sum up this part of the argument, the hon. Sum of the good man has eminently the advantage of the knav. arguments a/b and self/b wretch in every respect. The pleasures which the last enjoys flow chiefly from external advantages and gratifications; are superficial and transitory; dashed with long intervals of satiety, and fre-\nMoral Philosophy.\n\nPart III.\n\nHe may have equal abilities, equal industry, equal attention to business; and in other respects he has greatly the advantage of him. People love better to deal with him; they can trust him more; they know he will not impose on them, nor take advantage of them, and can depend more on his word than on the oath or strongest securities of others. Whereas what is commonly called cunning, which is the offspring of ignorance, and constant companion of knavery, is not only a mean-minded, but a very short-sighted talent, and a fundamental obstacle in the road of business. It may indeed procure immediate and petty gains; but it is attended with dreadful abatements, which do more than overbalance them, both as it sinks a man's credit when discovered, and cramps that largeness of mind which extends to the remotest as well as the nearest interest, and takes in the most durable equally with the most transient gains. It is therefore easy to see how much a man's credit and reputation, and consequently his success, depend on his honesty and virtue.\n\nWith regard to security and peace with his neighbours, it may be thought, perhaps, that the man of a peace and quiet forgiving temper, and a flowing benevolence and courtesy, is much exposed to injury and affronts from every proud or peevish mortal, who has the power or will to do mischief. If we suppose, indeed, this quietness and gentleness of nature accompanied with cowardice and philianimity, this may often be the case; but in reality the good man is bold as a lion, and so much the bolder for being the calmer. Such a person will hardly be a butt to mankind. The ill natured will be afraid to provoke him, and the good natured will not incline to do it. Besides, true virtue, which is conducted by reason, and exerted gracefully and without parade, is a most infatuating and commanding thing; if it cannot disarm malice and resentment at once, it will wear them out by degrees, and subdue them at length. How many have, by favours and prudently yielding, triumphed over an enemy, who would have been inflamed into tenfold rage by the fiercest opposition! In fine, goodness is the most universally popular thing that can be.\n\nTo conclude: the good man may have some enemies, but he will have more friends; and, having given family, so many marks of private friendship or public virtue, he can hardly be destitute of a patron to protect, or a sanctuary to entertain him, or to protect or entertain his children when he is gone. Though he should have little else to leave them, he bequeaths them the fairest, and generally the most unenvied, inheritance of a good name, which, like good seed sown in the field of futurity, will often raise up unsolicited friends, and yield a benevolent harvest of unexpected charities. But should the fragrance of the parent's virtue prove offensive to a perverse or envious age, or even draw persecution on the friendless orphans, there is one in heaven who will be more than a father to them, and recompense their parent's virtues by showering down blessings on them.\n\nChap. III. Motives to Virtue from the Being and Providence of God.\n\nBesides the interesting motive mentioned in the last Chapter, there are two great motives of virtue, strictly to virtue.\nPart III.\n\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY.\n\nMotives strictly connected with human life, and resulting from the very constitution of the human mind. The first is the Being and Providence of God; the second is the Immortality of the Soul, with future rewards and punishments.\n\nIt appears from Chap IV. of Part II. that man, by the constitution of his nature, is designed to be a Religious Creature. He is intimately connected with the Deity, and necessarily dependent on him. From that connexion and necessary dependence result various obligations and duties, without fulfilling which, some of his sublimest powers and affections would be incomplete and abortive. If he be likewise an Immortal creature, and if his present conduct shall affect his future happiness in another state as well as in the present, it is evident that we take only a partial view of the creature, if we leave out this important property of his nature; and make a partial estimate of human life, if we strike out of the account, or overlook, that part of his duration which runs out into eternity.\n\nIt is evident from the above-mentioned Chapter, that \"to have a respect to the Deity in our temper and conduct, to reverence and love his character, to adore his goodness, to depend upon and resign ourselves to his providence, to seek his approbation, and act under a sense of his authority, is a fundamental part of moral virtue, and the completion of the highest definition of our nature.\"\n\nBut as piety is an essential part of virtue, so likewise it is a great support and encouragement to the practice of it. To contemplate and admire a Being of such transcendent dignity and perfection as God, must naturally and necessarily open and enlarge the mind, give a freedom and ampleness to its powers, and a grandeur and elevation to its aims. For, as an excellent divine observes, \"the greatness of an object, and the excellency of the act of any agent about a transcendent object, doth mightily tend to the enlargement and improvement of his faculties.\" Little objects, mean company, mean cares, and mean busines, cramp the mind, contract its views, and give it a creeping air and deportment. But when it soars above mortal cares and mortal pursuits into the regions of divinity, and converses with the greatest and best of Beings, it spreads itself into a wider compass, takes higher flights in reason and goodness, becomes godlike in its air and manners. Virtue is, if one may say so, both the effect and cause of largeness of mind. It requires that one think freely, and act nobly. Now what can conduce more to freedom of thought and dignity of action, than to conceive worthily of God, to reverence and adore his unrivalled excellency, to imitate and transfer that excellency into our own nature, to remember our relation to him, and that we are the images and representatives of his glory to the rest of the creation? Such feelings and exercises must and will make us scorn all actions that are base, unhandsome, or unworthy our state; and the relation we stand in to God will irradiate the mind with the light of wisdom, and ennoble it with the liberty and dominion of virtue.\n\nThe influence and efficacy of religion may be considered in another light. We all know that the presence of a friend, a neighbour, or any number of spectators, but especially an august assembly of them, puts to be a considerable check upon the conduct of one from the who is not lost to all sense of honour and shame, and contributes to restrain many irregular fallies of passion. In the same manner we may imagine, that the awe of some superior mind, who is supposed privy to our secret conduct, and armed with full power to reward or punish it, will impose a restraint on us in such actions as fall not under the control or animadversion of others. If we go still higher, and suppose our immortal thoughts and darkest designs, as well as our most secret actions, to lie open to the notice of the supreme and universal Mind, who is both the spectator and judge of human actions, it is evident that the belief of so awful a presence, and such awful inspection, must carry a restraint and weight with it proportioned to the strength of that belief, and be an additional motive to the practice of many duties which would not have been performed without it.\n\nIt may be observed farther, that \"to live under an habitual sense of the Deity and his great administration, is to be conveyant with wisdom, order, and beauty, in the highest subjects, and to receive the delightful reflections and benign feelings which these excite while they irradiate upon him from every scene of nature and providence.\" How improving must such views be to the mind, in dilating and exalting it above those puny interests and competitions which agitate and inflame the bulk of mankind against each other!\n\nCHAP. IV. Motive to Virtue from the Immortality of the Soul, &c.\n\nThe other motive mentioned was the immortality of the soul, with future rewards and punishments. The metaphysical proofs of the soul's immortality are commonly drawn from—its simple, uncompounded, and indivisible nature; from whence it is concluded, that it cannot be corrupted or extinguished by a dissolution or destruction of its parts;—from its having a beginning of motion within itself; whence it is inferred, that it cannot discontinue and lose its motion;—from the different properties of matter and mind, the flabbiness and inactivity of the one, and the immense activity of the other; its prodigious flight of thoughts and imaginations; its penetration, memory, foresight, and anticipations of futurity; from whence it is concluded, that a being of so divine a nature cannot be extinguished. But as these metaphysical proofs depend on intricate reasonings concerning the nature, properties, and distinctions of body and mind, with which we are not very well acquainted, they are not obvious to ordinary understandings, and are seldom so convincing even to those of higher reach, as not to leave some doubts behind them. Therefore perhaps it is not so safe to rely the proof of such an important article on what many may call the subtleties of school learning. Those proofs which are brought from analogy, from the moral constitution and phenomena of the human mind, the moral attributes of God, and the present course of things, and which therefore are called the moral arguments, are the plainest and generally the most satisfying. We shall select only one or two from the rest.\n\nIn tracing the nature and definition of any being, Mor. I. we form the initial judgment from his powers of action, proof from and the scope and limits of these, compared with his analogy.\nMoral Philosophy.\n\nVirtue, or with that field in which they are exercised. If this being passes through different states, or fields of action, and we find a succession of powers adapted to the different periods of his progress, we conclude that he was destined for those successive states, and reckon his nature progressive. If, besides the immediate set of powers which fit him for action in his present state, we observe another set which appear superfluous if he were to be confined to it, and which point to another or higher one, we naturally conclude, that he is not designed to remain in his present state, but to advance to that for which those supernumerary powers are adapted. Thus we argue, that the fetus, which has wings forming or formed, and all the apparatus proper for flight, is not destined always to creep on the ground, or to continue in the torpid state of adhering to a wall, but is destined in its season to take its flight in air. Without this farther definition, the admirable mechanism of wings and the other apparatus would be useless and absurd. The same kind of reasoning may be applied to man, while he lives only a sort of vegetative life in the womb. He is furnished even there with a beautiful apparatus of organs, eyes, ears, and other delicate senses; which receive nourishment indeed, but are in a manner folded up, and have no proper exercise or use in their present confinement*. Let us suppose some intelligent spectator, who never had any connexion with man, nor the least acquaintance with human affairs, to see this odd phenomenon, a creature formed after such a manner, and placed in a situation apparently unsuitable to such various machinery: must he not be strangely puzzled about the use of his complicated structure, and reckon such a profusion of art and admirable workmanship lost on the subject? or reason by way of anticipation, that a creature endowed with such various yet unexerted capacities, was destined for a more enlarged sphere of action, in which those latent capacities shall have full play? The vast variety and yet beautiful symmetry and proportions of the several parts and organs with which the creature is endowed, and their apt cohesion with, and dependence on, the curious receptacle of their life and nourishment, would forbid his concluding the whole to be the birth of chance, or the bungling effort of an unskilful artist; at least would make him demur a while at so harsh a sentence. But if, while he is in this state of uncertainty, we suppose him to see the babe, after a few successful struggles, throwing off his fetters, breaking loose from his little dark prison, and emerging into open day, then unfolding his recluse and dormant powers, breathing in air, gazing at light, admiring colours, sounds, and all the fair variety of nature, immediately his doubts clear up, the propriety and excellency of the workmanship dawn upon him with full lustre, and the whole mystery of the first period is unravelled by the opening of this new scene. Though in this second period the creature lives chiefly a kind of animal life, i.e. of sense and appetite, yet by various trials and observations he gains experience, and by the gradual evolution of the powers of imagination he ripens space for a higher life, for exercising the arts of design and imitation, and of those in which strength or dexterity are more requisite than acuteness or reach of judgement. In the succeeding rational or intellectual period, his understanding, which formerly crept in a lower, mounts into a higher sphere, canvasses the natures, judges of the relations of things, forms schemes, deduces consequences from what is past, and from present as well as past collects future events. By this succession of states, and of correspondent culture, he grows up at length into a moral, a social, and a political creature. This is the last period at which we perceive him to arrive in this his mortal career. Each period is introductory to the next succeeding one; each life is a field of exercise and improvement for the next higher one; the life of the fetus for that of the infant, the life of the infant for that of the child, and all the lower for the highest and best.—But is this the last period of nature's progression? Is this the utmost extent of her Butler's plot, where she winds up the drama, and dismisses the actor into eternal oblivion? Or does he appear to be invested with supernumerary powers, which have not full exercise and scope even in the last scene, and reach not that maturity or perfection of which they are capable; and therefore point to some higher scene where he is to sustain another and more important character than he has yet sustained? If any such there are, may we not conclude by analogy, or in the same way of anticipation as before, that he is destined for that after part, and is to be produced upon a more august and solemn stage, where his sublimer powers shall have proportioned action, and his nature attain its completion.\n\nIf we attend to that curiosity, or prodigious thirst of Powers in knowledge, which is natural to the mind in every person which riod of its progress, and consider withal the endless pain to a round of business and care, and the various hardships to after-life, which the bulk of mankind are chained down; it is Intellect-evident, that in this present state it is impossible to ex-tual-pect the gratification of an appetite at once so infatiable and so noble. Our senses, the ordinary organs by which knowledge is let into the mind, are always imperfect, and often fallacious; the advantages of afflicting or correcting them are possessed by few; the difficulties of finding out truth amidst the various and contradictory opinions, interests, and passions of mankind, are many; and the wants of the creature, and of those with whom he is connected, numerous and urgent: so that it may be said of most men, that their intellectual organs are as much shut up and secluded from proper nourishment and exercise in that little circle to which they are confined, as the bodily organs are in the womb. Nay, those who to an aspiring genius have added all the affinities of art, leisure, and the most liberal education, what narrow prospects can even they take of this unbounded scene of things from that little eminence on which they stand? and how eagerly do they still grasp at new discoveries, without any satisfaction or limit to their ambition?\n\nBut should it be said, that man is made for action, Moral and not for speculation, or fruitless searches after knowledge, we ask, For what kind of action? Is it only for bodily exercises, or for moral, political, and religious ones? Of all these he is capable; yet, by the unavoidable circumstances of his lot, he is tied down to the former, and has hardly any leisure to think of the latter; or, if he has, wants the proper instrument of exerting them. The love of virtue, of one's friends and country, the generous sympathy with mankind, and heroic zeal of doing good, which are all so natural to great and good\n"}
