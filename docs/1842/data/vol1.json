[{"h":"ADAM SMITH","t":"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Smith rests upon the Enquiry into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> and Causes of the Wealth of Nations; perhaps the only book which produced an immediate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, and irrevocable change in some of the most important parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a> of all civilized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a>. The works of Grotius, of Locke, and of Montesquieu, which bear a resemblance to it in character, and had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> inconsiderable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of their popular influence, were productive only of a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMENDMENT\">amendment</a>, not so conspicuous in particular instances, as discoverable, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, in the improved condition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> affairs. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of Smith, as it touched those matters which may be numbered, and measured, and weighed, bore more visible and palpable fruit. In a few years it began to alter laws and treaties, and has made its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, throughout the convulsions of revolution and conquest, to a due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASCENDANT\">ascendant</a> over the minds of men, with far less than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> obstructions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> and clamour, which choke the channels through which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> flows into practice. The most eminent of those who have since cultivated and improved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be the foremost to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>,\n\nTenebris tantis tam clarum extollere lumen\nQui primus potuisti, INLUSTRANS COMMODA VIT\u00c6,\nTe sequor! (Lucret. lib. iii.)\n\nIn a science more difficult, because both ascending to more simple general principles, and running <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> through more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> applications, though the success of Smith has been less complete, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> is not less conspicuous. Perhaps there is no ethical work since Cicero's Offices, of which an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> enables the reader so inadequately to estimate the merit, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a> of Moral Sentiments. This is not chiefly owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of diction, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of Cicero; but to the variety of explanations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and manners which embellish the book often more than they illuminate the theory. Yet, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ON\">on</a> the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, it must be owned that, for purely philosophical purposes, few books more need abridgement: for the most careful reader frequently loses sight of principles buried under illustrations. The naturally copious and flowing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of the author is generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REDUNDANT\">redundant</a>, and the repetition of certain formularies of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> is, in the later editions, so frequent as to be wearisome, and sometimes ludicrous. Perhaps Smith and Hobbes may be considered as forming the two extremes of good style in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>; the first of graceful fulness falling into flaccidity; while the masterly concision of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> is oftener tainted by dictatorial dryness. Hume and Berkeley, though they are nearer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> of abundance, are probably the least distant from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>.\n\nThat mankind are so constituted as to sympathize with each other's feelings, and to feel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in the accordance of these feelings, are the only facts required by Dr Smith, and they certainly must be granted to him. To adopt the feelings of another, is to approve them. When the sentiments of another are such as would be excited in us by the same objects, we approve them as morally proper. To obtain this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a>, it becomes necessary for him who enjoys <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> suffers, to lower his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of feeling to the point to which the by-stander can raise his fellow-feelings; on which are founded all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> virtues of self-denial and self-command; and it is equally necessary for the by-stander to raise his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a> as near as he can to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> feeling. In all unsocial passions, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>, we have a divided sympathy between him who feels them and those who are the\n\n1 Born in 1723; died in 1790.\n2 Notes and Illustrations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> S.\n3 This remark is chiefly applicable to Hume's Essays. His Treatise of Human Nature is more Hobbian in its general tenor, though it has Ciceronian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>.\nobjects of them. Hence the propriety of extremely moderating them. Pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MALICE\">malice</a> is always to be concealed or disguised, because all sympathy is arrayed against it. In the private passions, where there is only a simple sympathy\u2014that with the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>\u2014the expression has more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. The benevolent affections, where there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> sympathy\u2014with those who feel them, and those who are their objects\u2014are the most agreeable, and may be indulged with the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of finding no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ECHO\">echo</a> in other breasts. Sympathy with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> of those who are benefited by good actions, prompts us to consider them as deserving of reward, and forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of merit; as fellow-feeling with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a> of those who are injured by crimes leads us to look on them as worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, and constitutes the sense of demerit. These sentiments require not only beneficial actions, but benevolent motives for them; being compounded, in the case of merit, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> sympathy with the good disposition of the benefactor, and an indirect sympathy with the persons benefited; in the opposite case, with precisely opposite sympathies. He who does an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of wrong to another to gratify his own passions, must not expect that the spectators, who have none of his undue partiality to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, will enter into his feelings. In such a case, he knows that they will pity the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> wronged, and be full of indignation against him. When he is cooled, he adopts the sentiments of others on his own crime, feels shame at the impropriety of his former passion, pity for those who have suffered by him, and a dread of punishment from general and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> resentment. Such are the constituent parts of remorse.\n\nOur moral sentiments respecting ourselves arise from those which others feel concerning us. We feel a self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> whenever we believe that the general feeling of mankind coincides with that state of mind in which we ourselves were at a given time. \"We suppose ourselves the spectators of our own behaviour, and endeavour to imagine what effect it would in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> produce in us.\" We must view our own conduct with the eyes of others before we can judge it. The sense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> arises from putting ourselves in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of others, and adopting their sentiments respecting our own conduct. In utter solitude there could have been no self-approbation. The rules of morality are a summary of those sentiments; and often beneficially stand in their stead when the self-delusions of passion would otherwise hide from us the non-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> of our state of mind with that which, in the circumstances, can be entered into and approved by impartial bystanders. It is hence that we learn to raise our mind above local or temporary clamour, and to fix our eyes on the surest indications of the general and lasting sentiments of human nature:\n\n\"When we approve of any character or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, our sentiments are derived from four sources: first, we sympathize with the motives of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>; secondly, we enter into the gratitude of those who have been benefited by his actions; thirdly, we observe that his conduct has been agreeable to the general rules by which those two sympathies generally act; and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> of all, when we consider such actions as forming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a system of behaviour which tends to promote the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> either of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, they appear to derive a beauty from this utility, not unlike that which we ascribe to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-contrived machine.\"","sp":584,"ep":585},{"h":"CUDWORTH","t":"Cudworth, one of the eminent men educated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> promoted in the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">Universities</a> during the Puritan rule, was one of the most distinguished of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LATITUDINARIAN\">Latitudinarian</a> or Arminian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> who came forth at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESTORATION\">Restoration</a>, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> imbibed from their Calvinistic masters, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as from the writings of antiquity, yet tempered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of their own agitated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; and with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TOLERATION\">toleration</a> more impartial and mature, though less systematic and professedly comprehensive, than that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INDEPENDENTS\">Independents</a>, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> who preached that doctrine.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> was placed in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> by the revolution, and their influence was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> among its rulers and luminaries. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> of their scholars turned their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> too much from the cultivation of the heart to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> government of outward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>; and in succeeding times the tolerant spirit, not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to an establishment, was with difficulty kept up by a government whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> depended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ON\">on</a> discouraging intolerant pretensions. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> sooner had the first sketch of the Hobbian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> been privately circulated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, than Cudworth seized the earliest opportunity of sounding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> against the most justly odious of the modes of thinking which it cultivates, or forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> which it would introduce; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRELUDE\">prelude</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAR\">war</a> which occupied the remaining forty years of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. The Intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">System</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> production, is directed against the atheistical opinions of Hobbes; it touches ethical questions but occasionally and incidentally. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of stupendous erudition, of much more acuteness than at first appears, of frequent mastery over diction and illustration on subjects where it is most rare; and it is distinguished, perhaps beyond any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of controversy, by that best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the deepest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s principles, a fearless statement of the most formidable objections to them; a fairness rarely practised but by him who is conscious of his power to answer them. In all his writings, it must be owned, that his learning obscures his reasonings, and seems even to oppress his powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>. It is an unfortunate effect of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REDUNDANT\">redundant</a> fulness of his mind, that it overflows in endless digressions, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of argument, and turn aside the thoughts of the reader from the main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>. He was educated before usage had limited the naturalization of new words from the learned languages; before the failure of those great men, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>, who laboured to follow a Latin order in their sentences,\u2014and the success of those men of inferior powers, from Cowley to Addison, who were content with the order, as well as the words, of pure and elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>,\u2014had, as it were, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of experiments, ascertained that the involutions and inversions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> languages are seldom reconcilable with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of ours; and, unless skilfully, as well as sparingly introduced, are at variance with the natural beauties of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>.

The earliest account of them is in a curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> pamphlet, entitled, An Account of the new Sect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">Latitude</a>-men at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, republished in the collection of tracts entitled, Phoenix Britanicus. Jeremy Taylor deserves the highest and perhaps the earliest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> among them. But Cudworth's excellent sermon before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons (31st <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1647) in the year of the publication of Taylor's Liberty of Prophecying, may be compared even to Taylor in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, and the most liberal toleration.\n3 De Cive, 1642.\n4 Datur boni et malii rationes externae et indispensabilis. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THESIS\">Thesis</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of B.D. at Cambridge in 1644.

One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a> volume on morals was published by Dr Chandler, bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>, entitled, *A Treatise concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality*. But there is the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to regret (as far as relates to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>) that the larger treatises are still unpublished, because the above volume is not so much an ethical treatise as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> to one. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROTAGORAS\">Protagoras</a> of old, and Hobbes then alive, having concluded that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and wrong were unreal, because they were not perceived by the senses, and because all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> knowledge consists only in such perception, Cudworth endeavours to refute them, by disproving that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a> which forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a>-stated proposition. The mind has many conceptions (\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9) which are not cognizable by the senses; and though they are occasioned by sensible objects, yet could not be formed but by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> superior to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>. The conceptions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> he places among them. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of right from wrong is discerned by reason; and as soon as these words are defined, it becomes evident that it would be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> in terms to affirm that any power, human or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a>, could change their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; or, in other words, make the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and unjust at the same time. They had existed eternally, in the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which truths can be said to be eternal, in the Eternal Mind; and they were indestructible and unchangeable like that Supreme Intelligence.\n\nWhatever judgment may be formed of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>, it is manifest that it relates merely to the philosophy of the understanding, and does not attempt any explanation of what constitutes the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a> of morality, its relation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a>. That we perceive a distinction between right and wrong as much as between a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, is indeed true; and may possibly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to an explanation of the reason why men should adhere to the one and avoid the other. But it is not that reason. A command or a precept is not a proposition. It cannot be said that either is true or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>. Cudworth, as well as many who succeeded him, confounded the mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> by the understanding that right is different from wrong, with the practical authority of these important conceptions, exercised over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> actions, in a totally distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>.\n\nThough his life was devoted to the assertion of divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>, and though his philosophy was imbued with the religious spirit of Platonism, yet he had placed Christianity too purely in the love of God and man to be considered as having much regard for those controversies about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> and opinions with which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-ZEALOTS\">zealots</a> disturb the world. They represented him as having fallen into the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> with Milton and with Clarke; and some of them even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> him with atheism, for no other reason than that he was not afraid to state the atheistic difficulties in their fullest force. As <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> heaps inconsistent accusations on each other, they called him at least \"an Arian, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOCINIAN\">Socinian</a>, or a Deist.\" The courtiers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II., who were delighted with every part of Hobbes but his in-\n\n---\n\n1 A curious account of the history of these MSS. by Dr Kippis, is to be found in the *Biographia Britannica*, IV. 549.\n2 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, 1731, &c.\n3 \"There are many objects of our mind which we can neither see, hear, feel, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and which did never enter into it by any sense; and therefore we can have no sensible pictures or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of them, drawn by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> of that inward linner or painter which borrows all his colours from sense, which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALL\">call</a> Fancy: and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we reflect on our own cogitations of these things, we shall sensibly perceive that they are not phantastical, but acematical: as, for example, justice, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a>, duty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a>, cognition, opinion, intellect, volition, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, verity, falsity, cause, effect, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, nullity, contingency, possibility, impossibility, and innumerable others.\" (*Eternal and Immutable Morality*, p. 140.)

E.

Thither, it must be owned, their philosophy pointed, and thither their followers proceeded. Hartley and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BONNET\">Bonnet</a>, still more than Condillac, suffered themselves, like most of their contemporaries, to overlook the important truth, that all the changes in the organs which can be likened to other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> phenomena, are nothing more than antecedents and prerequisites of perception, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> not the faintest likeness to it; as much outward in relation to the thinking principle, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they occurred in any other part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>; and of which the entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a>, if it were attained, would not bring us a step nearer to the nature of thought. They who would have been the first to exclaim against the mistake of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, fell into the more unspeakable error of confounding the perception of objects, as outward, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of our own mental operations. Locke's doctrine, that Reflection was a separate source of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, left room for this greatest of all distinctions,\u2014though with much unhappiness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, and with no little variance from the course of his own speculations. Hartley, Condillac, and Bonnet, in hewing away this seeming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a> from the system of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, unwittingly struck off the part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> which, however unsightly, gave it the power of yielding some shelter and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> to truths, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> rendered it utterly untenable. They became consistent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOMINALISTS\">Nominalists</a>; a controversy on which Locke expresses himself with confusion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>; but on this subject they added nothing to what had been taught by Hobbes and Berkeley. Both Hartley and Condillac have the merit of having been unseated by the temptations either of scepticism or of useless idealism; which, even if Berkeley and Hume could have been unknown to them, must have been within sight. Both agree in referring all the intellectual operations to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> of ideas, and in representing that association as reducible to the single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, that ideas which enter the mind at the same time, acquire a tendency to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALL\">call</a> up each other, which is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the frequency of their having entered together. In this important part of their doctrine they seem, whether unconsciously or otherwise, to have only repeated, and very much expanded, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of Hobbes. In its simplicity it is more agreeable than the system of Mr Hume, who admitted five independent laws of association; and it is in comprehension far superior to the views of the same subject by Mr Locke, whose ill-chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a> still retains its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOMENCLATURE\">nomenclature</a>, but who only appeals to the principle as explaining some fancies and whimsies of the human mind. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> fault of Hartley is that of a rash generalization, which may prove <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>, and which is at least premature. All attempts to explain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a> by this principle have hitherto been unavailing. Many of the most important processes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> have not hitherto been accounted for by it. It would appear by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, that even this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, simple as it appears, presupposes many facts relating to the mind, of which its authors\n\n1 Born in 1715; died in 1780.\n2 Trait\u00e9 sur l'Origine des Connaissances Humaines, 1746; Trait\u00e9 des Syst\u00e8mes, 1749; Trait\u00e9 des Sensations, 1754. Foreign books were then little and slowly known in England. Hartley's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, except on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>, seems confined to the physical and mathematical sciences; and his whole manner of thinking and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> is so different from that of Condillac, that there is not the least reason to suppose the work of the one to have been known to the other.\n3 The work of Hartley, as we learn from the sketch of his life by his son, prefixed to the edition of 1791, was begun in 1730, and finished in 1746.\n4 Born in 1729; died in 1793.\n5 The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> of Condillac will show how much he differed from Hartley in his mode of considering the Newtonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> of vibrations, and how far he was in that respect superior to him. \"Je suppose ici et ailleurs que les perceptions de l'\u00e2me ont pour cause physique l'\u00c9branlement des fibres du cerveau; non que je regarde <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CETTE\">cette</a> hypoth\u00e8se comme d\u00e9montr\u00e9e, mais parcequ'elle est la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PLUS\">plus</a> commode pour expliquer ma pens\u00e9e.\" (Oeuvres de Condillac, I. 60. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, 1793.)\n6 Human Nature, chap. iv. v. vi.

How many ultimate facts of that nature, for example, are contained and involved in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>'s celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the mind in its first state to a sheet of unwritten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>! The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> of the paper, even its colour, the sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> fit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on it, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> to receive and to retain impressions, all its differences, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WATER\">water</a> on the other, certainly presuppose some facts, and may imply many, without a distinct statement of which, the nature of writing could not be explained to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> wholly ignorant of it. How many more, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as greater laws, may be necessary to enable mind to perceive outward objects! If the power of perception may be thus dependent, why may not what is called the association of ideas, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> between thoughts, the power of one to suggest another, be affected by mental laws hitherto unexplored, perhaps unobserved?\n\nBut to return from digression into the intellectual part of man: It becomes proper to say, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between Hartley and Condillac, and the immeasurable superiority of the former, are chiefly to be found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> which Hartley first made of the law of association to that other unnamed portion of our nature with which morality more immediately deals; that which feels pain and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, is influenced by appetites and loathings, by desires and aversions, by affections and repugnances. Condillac's Treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SENSATION\">Sensation</a>, published five years after the work of Hartley, reproduces the doctrine of Hobbes with its root, namely, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> are but transformed sensations; by which he means perceptions of the senses; and its wide-spread branches, consisting in desires and passions, which are only modifications of self-love. \"The words goodness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>,\" says he, almost in the very words of Hobbes, \"express those qualities of things by which they contribute to our pleasures?\" In the whole of his philosophical works, we find no trace of any desire produced by association, of any disinterested principle, or indeed of any distinction between the percipient and what, perhaps, we may now venture to call the emotive or the pathematic part of human nature, until some more convenient and agreeable name shall be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> on by some luckier or more skilful adventurer, in such new terms as seem to be absolutely necessary.\n\nTo the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a>, humble, and anxiously conscientious character of Hartley, we owe the knowledge that, about the year 1730, he was informed that the Rev. Mr Gay of Sidney <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, then living in the west of England, asserted the possibility of deducing all our intellectual pleasures and pains from association; that this led him (Hartley) to consider the power of association; and that about that time Mr Gay published his sentiments on this matter in a dissertation prefixed to Bishop Law's Translation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s Origin of Evil. No writer deserves more the praise of abundant fairness than Hartley in this avowal. The dissertation of which he speaks is mentioned by no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> but himself. It suggested nothing apparently to any other reader. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> texture of it is that of homespun selfishness. The writer had the merit to see and to own that Hutcheson had established as a fact the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> of moral sentiments and disinterested affections. He blames, perhaps justly, that most ingenious man, for assuming that these sentiments and affections are implanted, and partake of the nature of instincts. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his dissertation is to reconcile the mental appearances described by Hutcheson with the\n\n---\n\n1 See Notes and Illustrations, note U.\n2 Condillac III. 21; more especially Trait\u00e9 des Sensations, part ii. chap. vii.\n3 Its love for outward objects is only an effect of love for itself.\n4 Trait\u00e9 des Sensations, part iv. chap. iii.\n5 Hartley's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">Preface</a> to the Observations on Man. The word intellectual is too narrow. Even mental would be of very doubtful propriety. The theory in its full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> requires a word such as imagistic, (if no better can be discovered) extending to all gratification, not distinctly referred to some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> organ, or at least to some assignable part of the bodily frame.\n6 It has not been mentioned in its proper place, that Hutcheson appears nowhere to greater advantage than in Letters on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FABLE\">Fable</a> of the Bees, published when he was very young, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, in a publication called Hibernia. \"Private vices public benefits,\" says he, \"may signify any one of these five distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>: 1. They are in themselves public benefits; or, 2. They naturally produce public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>; or, 3. They may be made to produce it; or, 4. They may naturally flow from it; or, 5. At least they may probably flow from it in our infirm nature.\" (See a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> containing Thoughts on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAUGHTER\">Laughter</a>, and Observations on the Fable of the Bees, Glasgow, 1786, in which these letters are republished.)\nfirst principle of the selfish system, that \"the true principle of all our actions is our own happiness.\" Moral feelings and social affections are, according to him, \"resolvable into reason, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> out our private happiness; and wherever this end is not perceived, they are to be accounted for from the association of ideas.\" Even in the single passage in which he shows a glimpse of the truth, he begins with confusion, advances with hesitation, and after holding in his grasp for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> the principle which sheds so strong a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> around it, suddenly drops it from his hand. Instead of receiving the statements of Hutcheson (his silence relating to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a> is unaccountable) as enlargements of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of man, he deals with them merely as difficulties to be reconciled with the received system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> selfishness. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> of his fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, he well exemplifies the power of association in forming the love of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, of power, &c.; but he still treats these effects of association as aberrations and infirmities, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of our forgetfulness and shortsightedness, and not at all as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> employed to sow and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REAR\">rear</a> the most important principles of a social and moral nature.\n\nThis precious mine may therefore be truly said to have been opened by Hartley; for he who did such superabundant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to the hints of Gay, would assuredly not have withheld the like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> from Hutcheson, had he observed the happy expression of \"secondary passions,\" which ought to have led that philosopher himself farther than he ventured to advance. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> value of this part of Hartley's system has been hidden by various causes, which have also enabled writers who borrow from it to decry it. The influence of his medical habits renders many of his examples displeasing, and sometimes disgusting. He has none of that knowledge of the world, of that familiarity with literature, of that delicate perception of the beauties of nature and art, which not only supply the most agreeable illustrations of mental philosophy, but afford the most obvious and striking instances of its happy application to subjects generally interesting. His particular applications of the general law are often mistaken, and seldom more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> notes and hasty suggestions; the germs of theories which, while some might adopt them without detection, others might discover without being aware that they were anticipated. To which it may be added, that in spite of the imposing forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, the work is not really distinguished by good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>, or even uniform adherence to that which had been chosen. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> is entitled to no praise but that of clearness, and a simplicity of diction, through which is visible a singular simplicity of mind. No book perhaps exists which, with so few of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> allurements, comes at last so much to please by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> it presents of the writer's character,\u2014a character which kept him pure from the pursuit, often from the consciousness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, and rendered him a discoverer in spite of his own modesty. In those singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> in which, amidst the profound internal tranquillity of all the European nations, he foretells <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> convulsions, to be followed by the overthrow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a> and churches, his quiet and gentle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>, elsewhere almost ready to inculcate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> obedience for the sake of peace, is supported under its awful forebodings by the hope of that general progress in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and happiness which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> through the preparatory confusion. A meek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, inclining towards mysticism, and sometimes indulging in visions which borrow a lustre from his fervid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, was beautifully, and perhaps singularly, blended in him with zeal for the most unbounded freedom of inquiry, flowing both from his own conscientious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> and his unmingled love of truth. Whoever can so far subdue his repugnance to petty or secondary faults as to bestow a careful perusal on the work, must be unfortunate if he does not see, feel, and own, that the writer was a great philosopher and a good man.\n\nTo those who thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the work, it will be apparent that Hartley, like other philosophers, either overlooked, or failed explicitly to announce, that distinction between perception and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a>, without which no system of mental philosophy is complete. Hence arose the partial and incomplete view of truth conveyed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> \"association of ideas.\" If the word association, which rather indicates the connection between separate things, than the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> and fusion which occur in many operations of the mind, must, notwithstanding its inadequacy, still be retained, the phrase ought at least to be \"association of thoughts with emotions, as well as with each other.\" With that enlargement an objection to the Hartleian doctrine would have been avoided, and its originality, as well as superiority over that of Condillac, would have appeared indisputable. The examples of avarice and other factious passions are very well chosen; first, because few will be found to suppose that they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> principles of human nature; secondly, because the process by which they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a>, being subsequent to the age of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>, may be brought home to the understanding of all men; and, thirdly, because they afford the most striking instance of secondary passions, which not only become independent of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> principles from which they are derived, but hostile to them, and so superior in strength as to be capable of overpowering their parents. As soon as the mind becomes familiar with the frequent case of the man who first pursued money to purchase pleasure, but at last, when he becomes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MISER\">miser</a>, loves his hoard better than all that it could purchase, and sacrifices all pleasures for its increase, we are prepared to admit that, by a like process, the affections, when they are fixed on the happiness of others as their ultimate object, without any reflection on self, may not only be perfectly detached from self-regard or private desires, but may subdue these, and every other antagonist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> which can stand in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAY\">way</a>. As the miser loves money for its own sake, so may the benevolent man delight in the wellbeing of his fellows. His good-will becomes as disinterested as if it had been implanted and underived. The like process applied to what is called self-love, or the desire of permanent wellbeing, clearly explains the mode in which that principle is gradually formed from the separate appetites, without whose previous existence no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of wellbeing could be obtained. In like manner, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a>, perhaps itself the result of a transfer of our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> feelings by association to other sentient beings, and of a subsequent transfer of their feelings to our own minds, engenders the various social affections, which at last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> in most minds some regard to the wellbeing of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, of mankind, of all creatures capable of pleasure. Rational self-love controls and guides those far keener self-regarding passions of which it is the child, in the same manner as general benevolence balances and governs the variety of much warmer social affections from which it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>.\n\nIt is an ancient and obstinate error of philosophers to represent these two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> principles as being the source of the impelling passions and affections, instead of being among the last results of them. Each of them exercises a sort of authority in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, but the dominion of neither is co-existent with the whole nature of man. Though they have the power to quicken and check, they are both too feeble to impel; and if the primary principles were extinguished, they would both perish from want of nourishment. If indeed all appetites and desires were destroyed, no subject would exist on which either of these general principles could act.\n\nThe affections, desires, and emotions, having for their ultimate object the dispositions and actions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> agents, which alone, from the nature of their object, are co-extensive with the whole of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> nature, are, according to the same philosophy, necessarily formed in every human mind by the transfer of feeling which is effected by the principle of association. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">Gratitude</a>, pity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>, and shame, seem to be the simplest, the most active, and the most uniform elements in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>.\n\nIt is easy to perceive how the complacency inspired by a benefit may be transferred to a benefactor, thence to all beneficent beings and acts. The well-chosen instance of the nurse familiarly exemplifies the manner in which the child transfers his complacency from the gratification of his senses to the cause of it, and thus learns an affection for her who is the source of\n\n---\n\n1 A very ingenious man, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Kames, whose works had a great effect in rousing the mind of his contemporaries and countrymen, has indeed fancied that there is \"a hoarding instinct\" in man and other animals. But such conclusions are not so much objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a>, as ludicrous proofs of the absurdity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a> which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to them.\nhis enjoyment. With this simple process concur, in the case of a tender nurse, and far more of a mother, a thousand acts of relief and endearment, of which the complacency is fixed on the person from whom they flow, and in some degree extended by association to all who resemble that person. So much of the pleasure of early life depends on others, that the like process is almost constantly repeated. Hence the origin of benevolence may be understood, and the disposition to approve all benevolent, and disapprove all malevolent acts. Hence also the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> and disapprobation are extended to all acts which we clearly perceive to promote or obstruct the happiness of men.\n\nWhen the complacency is extended to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, benevolence may be said to be transformed into a part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>. The rise of sympathy may probably be explained by the process of association, which transfers the feelings of others to ourselves, and ascribes our own feelings to others;\u2014at first, and in some degree, always in proportion as the resemblance of ourselves to others is complete. The likeness in the outward signs of emotion is one of the widest channels in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of hearts. Pity thereby becomes one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> sources of benevolence, and perhaps contributes more largely than gratitude. It is indeed one of the first motives to the conferring of those benefits which inspire grateful affection. Sympathy with the sufferer, therefore, is also transformed into a real sentiment, directly approving benevolent actions and dispositions, and more remotely all actions that promote happiness. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> of the sufferer, first against all causes of pain, afterwards against all intentional agents who produce it, and finally against all those in whom the infliction of pain proceeds from a mischievous disposition, when it is communicated to others by sympathy, and is so far purified by gradual separation from selfish and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> as to be equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> against all wrong-doers, whether the wrong be done against ourselves, our friends, or our enemies, is the root out of which springs that\n\nwhich is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> and well called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">Sense</a> of Justice\u2014the most indispensable, perhaps, of all the component parts of the moral faculties. It is the main guard against wrong. It relates to that portion of morality where many of the outward acts are capable of being reduced under certain rules, of which the violations, wherever the rule is sufficiently precise, and the mischief sufficiently great, may be guarded against by the terror of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of the rules of justice consists <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>; breaches of them we denominate crimes. An abhorrence of crimes, especially of those which indicate the absence of benevolence, as well as of regard to justice, is peculiarly strong; because well-framed penal laws, being the lasting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of the moral indignation of many generations of mankind, exceedingly strengthen the same feeling in every individual, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as they remain in unison with the sentiments of the age and country for which they are destined, and, indeed, wherever the laws do not so much deviate from the habitual feelings as to produce a struggle between law and sentiment, in which it is hard to say on which side success is most deplorable. A man who performs his duties may be esteemed, but is not admired; because it requires no more than ordinary virtue to act well where it is shameful and dangerous to do otherwise. The righteousness of those who act solely from such inferior motives, is little better than that \"of the Scribes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHARISEES\">Pharisees</a>.\" Those only are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> in the eye of the moralist who act justly from a constant disposition to render to every man his own. Acts of kindness, of generosity, of pity, of placability, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, when they are long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, can hardly fail mainly to flow from the pure fountain of an excellent nature. They are not reducible to rules; and the attempt to enforce them by punishment would destroy them. They are virtues of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a> consists in a good disposition of mind. As we gradually transfer our desire from praise to praiseworthiness, this principle also is adopted into consciousness. On the other hand,\n\n---\n\n1 \"Justitia est constans et perpetua voluntas suum cuique tribuendi;\" an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> in the mouth of the Stoical moralists, from whom it is borrowed, but altogether misplaced by the Roman Jurists in a body of laws which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> only with outward acts in their relation to the order and interest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>.\nwhen we are led by association to feel a painful contempt for those feelings and actions of our past self which we despise in others, there is developed in our hearts another element of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>. It is a remarkable instance of the power of the law of association, that the contempt or abhorrence which we feel for the bad actions of others may be transferred by it, in any degree of strength, to our own past actions of the like kind. And as the hatred of bad actions is transferred to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>, the same transfer may occur in our own case in a manner perfectly similar to that of which we are conscious in our feelings towards our fellow-creatures. There are many causes which render it generally feebler; but it is perfectly evident that it requires no more than a sufficient strength of moral feeling to make it equal; and that the most apparently hyperbolical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> used by penitents, in describing their remorse, may be justified by the principle of association.\n\nAt this step in our progress, it is proper to observe, that a most important consideration has escaped Hartley, as well as every other philosopher. The language of all mankind implies that the moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>, whatever it may be, and from what origin soever it may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, is intelligibly and properly spoken of as One. It is as common in mind as in matter for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> to have properties not to be found in any of its constituent parts. The truth of this proposition is as certain in the human feelings as in any material combination. It is therefore easily understood, that originally separate feelings may be so perfectly blended by a process performed in every mind, that they can no longer be disjoined from each other, but must always co-operate, and thus reach the only union which we can conceive. The sentiment of Moral Approbation, formed by association out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANTECEDENT\">antecedent</a> affections, may become so perfectly independent of them, that we are no longer conscious of the means by which it was formed, and never can in practice repeat; though we may in theory perceive, the process by which it was generated. It is in that mature and sound state of our nature that our emotions at the view of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">Right</a> and Wrong are ascribed to Conscience. But why, it may be asked, do these feelings, rather than others, run into each other, and constitute Conscience? The answer seems to be what has already been intimated, in the observations on Butler. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> between these feelings consists in this, that while all other feelings relate to outward objects, they alone contemplate exclusively the dispositions and actions of voluntary agents. When they are completely transferred from objects, and even persons, to dispositions and actions, they are fitted, by the perfect coincidence of their aim, for combining to form that one faculty which is directed only to that aim.\n\nThe words Duty and Virtue, and the word Ought, which most perfectly denotes Duty, but is also connected with Virtue, in every well-constituted mind, in this state become the fit language of the acquired, perhaps, but universally and necessarily acquired, faculty of Conscience. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of its peculiar nature has been attempted in the remarks on Butler;\u2014for others a fitter occasion will occur hereafter. Some light may however now be thrown on the subject by a short statement of the hitherto unobserved distinction between the moral sentiments and another class of feelings with which they have some qualities in common. The pleasures (so called) of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">Imagination</a> appear, at least in most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, to originate in association. But it is not till the original cause of the gratification is obliterated from the mind, that they acquire their proper character. Order and proportion may be at first chosen for their convenience; it is not until they are admired for their own sake that they become objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. Though all the proportions for which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> is valued may be indications of speed, safety, strength, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, it is not the less true that they only can be said to admire the animal for his beauty, who leave such considerations out of the account while they admire. The pleasure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> in these particulars of nature and art becomes universal and immediate, being entirely detached from all regard to individual beings. It contemplates neither use nor interest.\n\nSee supra, section on Butler.\nIn this important particular the pleasures of imagination agree with the moral sentiments. Hence the application of the same language to both in ancient and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times. Hence also it arises that they may contemplate the very same qualities and objects. There is certainly much beauty in the softer virtues\u2014much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HERO\">Hero</a> or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MARTYR\">Martyr</a>. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> distinction still remains. The purest moral taste contemplates these qualities only with quiescent delight or reverence. It has no further view\u2014it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> towards no action. Conscience, on the contrary, containing in it a pleasure in the prospect of doing right, and an ardent desire to act well, having for its sole object the dispositions and acts of voluntary agents, is not, like moral taste, satisfied with passive contemplation, but constantly tends to act on the will and conduct of the man. Moral taste may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> it, may be absorbed into it, and usually contributes its part to the formation of the moral faculty; but it is distinct from that faculty, and may be disproportioned to it. Conscience, being by its nature confined to mental dispositions and voluntary acts, is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> excluded from the ordinary consideration of all things antecedent to these dispositions. The circumstances from which such states of mind may arise, are most important objects of consideration for the understanding; but they are without the sphere of conscience, which never ascends beyond the heart of the man. It is thus that in the eye of conscience man becomes amenable to its authority for all his inclinations as well as deeds; that some of them are approved, loved, and revered; and that all the outward effects of disesteem, contempt, or moral anger, are felt to be the just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> of others.\n\nBut, to return to Hartley, from this perhaps intrusive statement of what does not properly belong to him: He represents all the social affections of gratitude, veneration, and love, inspired by the virtues of our fellow-men, as capable of being transferred by association to the transcendent and unmingled goodness of the Ruler of the world, and thus to give rise to piety, to which he gives the name of the theopatheic affection. This principle, like all the former in the mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, is gradually detached from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> on which it grew: it takes separate root, and may altogether overshadow the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> stock. As such a being cannot be conceived without the most perfect and constant reference to his goodness, so piety may not only become a part of conscience, but its governing and animating principle, which, after long lending its own energy and authority to every other, is at last described by our philosopher as swallowing up all of them in order to perform the same functions more infallibly.\n\nIn every stage of this progress we are taught by Dr Hartley that a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> appears, which becomes perfectly distinct from the elements which formed it, which may be utterly dissimilar to them, and may attain any degree of vigour, however superior to theirs. Thus the objects of the private desires disappear when we are employed in the pursuit of our lasting welfare; that which was first sought only as a means, may come to be pursued as an end, and preferred to the original end; the good opinion of our fellows becomes more valued than the benefits for which it was at first courted; a man is ready to sacrifice his life for him who has shown generosity, even to others; and persons otherwise of common character are capable of cheerfully marching in a forlorn hope, or of almost instinctively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAPING\">leaping</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the life of an entire stranger. These last acts, often of almost unconscious virtue, so familiar to the soldier and the sailor, so unaccountable on certain systems of philosophy, often occur without a thought of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> and reward; too quickly for the thought of the latter, too obscurely for the hope of the former; and they are of such a nature that no man could be impelled to them by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of either.\n\nThe gratitude, sympathy, resentment, and shame, which are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> constituent parts of the Moral Sense, thus lose their separate agency, and constitute an entirely new faculty, co-extensive with all the dispositions and actions of voluntary agents; though some of them are more predominant in particular cases of moral sentiment than others, and though the aid of all continues to be necessary in their original character, as subordinate but distinct motives of action. Nothing more evidently points out the\ndistinction of the Hartleian system from all systems called selfish, not to say its superiority in respect to disinterestedness over all moral systems before Butler and Hutcheson, than that excellent part of it which relates to the Rule of Life. The various principles of human action rise in value according to the order in which they spring up after each other. We can then only be in a state of as much enjoyment as we are evidently capable of attaining, when we prefer interest to the original gratifications\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to interest\u2014the pleasures of imagination to those of sense\u2014the dictates of conscience to pleasure, interest, and reputation\u2014the well-being of fellow-creatures to our own indulgences; in a word, when we pursue moral good and social happiness chiefly and for their own sake.\n\n\"With self-interest,\" says Hartley, somewhat inaccurately in language, \"man must begin. He may end in self-annihilation. Theopathy, or piety, although the last result of the purified and exalted sentiments, may at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> swallow up every other principle, and absorb the whole man.\" Even if this last doctrine should be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAGGERATION\">exaggeration</a> unsuited to our present condition, it will the more strongly illustrate the compatibility, or rather the necessary connection, of this theory with the existence and power of perfectly disinterested principles of human action.\n\nIt is needless to remark on the secondary and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AUXILIARY\">auxiliary</a> causes which contribute to the formation of moral sentiment; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>, general opinion, laws and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. They all presuppose the moral faculty: in an improved state of society they contribute powerfully to strengthen it, and on some occasions they enfeeble, distort, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAIM\">maim</a> it; but in all cases they must themselves be tried by the test of an ethical standard.\n\nThe value of this doctrine will not be essentially affected by supposing a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of original principles than those assumed by Dr Hartley. The principle of association applies as much to a greater as to a smaller number. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> common to it with all theories, that the more simplicity it reaches consistently with truth, the more perfect it becomes. Causes are not to be multiplied without necessity. If by a considerable multiplication of primary desires the law of association were lowered nearly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of an auxiliary agent, the philosophy of human nature would still be under indelible obligations to the philosopher who, by his fortunate error, rendered the importance of that great principle obvious and conspicuous.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABRAHAM\">ABRAHAM</a> TUCKER\n\nIt has been the remarkable fortune of this writer to have been more prized by the cultivators of the same subjects, and more disregarded by the generality even of those who read books on such matters, than perhaps any other philosopher. He had many of the qualities which might be expected in an affluent country <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, living in a privacy undisturbed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> zeal, and with a leisure unbroken by the calls of a profession, at a time when England had not entirely renounced her old taste for metaphysical speculation. He was naturally endowed, not indeed with more than ordinary acuteness or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, nor with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of reach and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of mind, but with a singular capacity for careful observation and original reflection, and with a fancy perhaps unmatched in producing various and happy illustration. The most observable of his moral qualities appear to have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and cheerfulness, good-nature and easy temper. The influence of his situation and character is visible in his writings. Indulging his own tastes and fancies, like most English squires of his time, he became, like\n\n---\n\n1 Born in 1705; died in 1774.\n2 \"I have found in this writer more original thinking and observation upon the several subjects that he has taken in hand than in any other, not to say than in all others put together. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> also for illustration is unrivalled.\" (Paley, Preface to Moral and Political Philosophy.) See the excellent preface to an abridgement, by Mr Hazlitt, of Tucker's work, published in London in 1807. May I venture to refer also to my own discourse on the Law of Nature and Nations, London, 1799. Mr Stewart treats Tucker and Hartley with unwonted harshness.\nmany of them, a sort of humourist. Hence much of his originality and independence; hence the boldness with which he openly employs illustrations from homely objects. He wrote to please himself more than the public. He had too little regard for readers, either to sacrifice his sincerity to them, or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CURB\">curb</a> his own prolixity, repetition, and egotism, from the fear of fatiguing them. Hence he became as loose, as rambling, and as much an egotist as Montaigne; but not so agreeably so, notwithstanding a considerable resemblance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>; because he wrote on subjects where disorder and egotism are unseasonable, and for readers whom they disturb instead of amusing. His prolixity at last increased itself, when his work became so long, that repetition in the latter parts partly arose from forgetfulness of the former; and though his freedom from slavish deference to general opinion is very commendable, it must be owned, that his want of a wholesome fear of the public renders the perusal of a work which is extremely interesting, and even amusing in most of its parts, on the whole a laborious task. He was by early education a believer in Christianity, if not by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> character <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>. His calm good sense and accommodating temper led him rather to explain established doctrines in a manner agreeable to his philosophy, than to assail them. Hence he was represented as a time-server by free-thinkers, and as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HERETIC\">heretic</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORTHODOX\">orthodox</a>.\n\nLiving in a country where the secure tranquillity flowing from the Revolution was gradually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> forth all mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> towards practical pursuits and outward objects, he hastened from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of mental and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a>, to those branches of it which touch the business of men. Had he recast without changing his thoughts,\u2014had he detached those ethical observations for which he had so peculiar a vocation, from the disputes of his country and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>,\u2014he might have thrown many of his chapters into their proper form of essays, which might have been compared, though not likened, to those of Hume. But the country gentleman, philosophic as he was, had too much fondness for his own humours to engage in a course of drudgery and deference. It may, however, be confidently added, on the authority of all those who have fairly made the experiment, that whoever, unfettered by a previous system, undertakes the labour necessary to discover and relish the high excellencies of this metaphysical Montaigne, will find his toil lightened as he proceeds, by a growing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>, if not partiality, for the foibles of the humourist; and at last rewarded, in a greater degree perhaps than by any other writer on mixed and applied philosophy, by being led to commanding stations and new points of view, whence the mind of a moralist can hardly fail to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> some fresh prospects of nature and duty.\n\nIt is in mixed, not in pure philosophy, that his superiority consists. In the part of his work which relates to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>, he has adopted much from Hartley, hiding but aggravating the offence by a change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> terms; and he was ungrateful enough to countenance the vulgar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SNEER\">sneer</a> which involves the mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of that philosopher in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> to which his physiological hypothesis is liable. Thus, for the Hartleian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Association he substitutes that of Translation, when he adopts the same theory of the principles which move the mind to action. In the practical and applicable part of that inquiry he indeed far surpasses Hartley; and it is little to add, that he unspeakably exceeds that bare and naked thinker in the useful as well as admirable faculty of illustration. In the strictly theoretical\n\n---\n\n1 This disposition to compromise and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>, which is discoverable in Paley, was carried to its utmost length by Mr Hey, a man of much acuteness, Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIVINITY\">Divinity</a> at Cambridge.\n\n2 Perhaps no philosopher ever stated more justly, more naturally, or more modestly than Tucker, the ruling maxim of his life. \"My thoughts,\" says he, \"have taken a turn from my earliest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> towards searching into the foundations and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of right and wrong; my love for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a> has furnished me with continual leisure; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of my reason has been my daily employment.\"\n\n3 Light of Nature, I. c. xviii., of which the conclusion may be pointed out as a specimen of perhaps unmatched fruitfulness, vivacity, and felicity of illustration. The admirable sense of the conclusion of chap. xxv. seems to have suggested Paley's good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> on Happiness. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>'s comparison of reason to a charioteer, and the passions to the horses, in chap. xxvi. is of characteristic and transcendent excellence.\npart his exposition is considerably fuller; but the defect of his genius becomes conspicuous when he handles a very general principle. The very term Translation ought to have kept up in his mind a steady <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> that the secondary motives to action become as independent, and seek their own objects as exclusively, as the primary principles. His own examples are rich in proofs of this important truth. But there is a slippery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> in the Theory of Human Nature, by which he, like most of his forerunners, slid unawares into selfishness. He was not preserved from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> by seeing that all the deliberate principles which have self for their object are themselves of secondary formation; and he was led to the general error by the notion that Pleasure, or, as he calls it, Satisfaction, was the original and sole object of all appetites and desires; confounding this with the true but very different proposition, that the attainment of all the objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPETITE\">appetite</a> and desire is productive of pleasure. He did not see that, without presupposing Desires, the word Pleasure would have no signification; and that the representations by which he was seduced would leave only one appetite or desire in human nature. He had no adequate and constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, that the translation of Desire from the end to the means occasioned the formation of a new passion, which is perfectly distinct from, and altogether independent of, the original desire. Too frequently (for he was neither obstinate nor uniform in error) he considered these translations as accidental defects in human nature, not as the appointed means of supplying it with its variety of active principles. He was too apt to speak as if the selfish elements were not destroyed in the new combination, but remained still capable of being recalled, when convenient, like the links in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of reasoning, which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> over from forgetfulness, or for brevity. Take him all in all, however, the neglect of his writings is the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the disinclination of the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, for the last half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, to Metaphysical Philosophy.","sp":588,"ep":598},{"h":"DAVID HUME","t":"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">Life</a> of Mr Hume, written by himself, is remarkable above most, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not all writings of that sort, for hitting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> between coldness and egotism which becomes a modest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in speaking of his private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. Few writers, whose opinions were so obnoxious, have more perfectly escaped every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPUTATION\">imputation</a>. Very few men of so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> a character have been so warmly beloved. That he approached to the character of a perfectly good and wise man, is an affectionate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAGGERATION\">exaggeration</a>, for which his friend Dr Smith, in the first moments of his sorrow, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WELL\">well</a> be excused. But such a praise can never be earned without passing through either of the extremes of fortune; without standing the test of temptations, dangers, and sacrifices. It may be said with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that the private character of Mr Hume exhibited all the virtues which a man of reputable station, under a mild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, in the quiet times of a civilized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, has often the opportunity to practise. He showed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> want of the qualities which fit men for more severe trials. Though others had warmer affections, no man was a kinder relation, a more unwearied friend, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> more free from meanness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MALICE\">malice</a>. His character was so simple, that he did not even affect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>; but neither his friendships nor his deportment were changed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> which filled all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. His good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> manners, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> kindness, procured him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> the enviable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> not so alive to goodness, as without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> it at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the qualities of a celebrated man. His whole character is faithfully and touchingly represented in the story of La Roche, where Mr Mackenzie, without concealing Mr Hume's opinions, brings him into contact with scenes of tender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, and yet preserves the interest inspired by genuine and unalloyed, though moderated feelings and affections. The amiable and venerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> of Scottish Literature was averse from the opinions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ON\">on</a> whom he has composed this best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a>. He tells us that he read the manuscript to Dr Smith, \"who declared he did not find a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to, but added, with his characteristic absence of mind, that he was surprised he had never heard of the anecdote before.\" So lively was the delineation thus sanctioned by the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> of all testimonies. Mr Mackenzie indulges his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> feelings by modestly intimating, that Dr Smith's answer seemed to justify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> words of the tale, \"that there were moments when the philosopher recalled to his mind the venerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the good La Roche, and wished that he had never doubted.\" To those who are strangers to the seductions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a>, to the intoxication of fame, and to the bewitchment of prohibited opinions, it must be unaccountable, that he who revered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> should, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> regret, cease to see it on the Throne of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSE\">Universe</a>. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of wonder that his habitual esteem for every fragment and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> of moral excellence should not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> him to envy those who contemplated its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> in that living and paternal character which gives it a power over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> heart.\n\nOn the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, if we had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>\n\n---\n\n1 Born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> in 1711; died there in 1776.\n2 Dr Smith's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LETTER\">Letter</a> to Mr Strahan, annexed to the Life of Hume.\n3 See Notes and Illustrations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> P.\n4 Mirror, Nos. 42, 43, 44.\n5 Mackenzie's Life of John Home, p. 21.\nof the power of opposite opinions in producing irreconcilable animosities, we might have hoped that those who retained such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> privileges would have looked with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPASSION\">compassion</a> than dislike on a virtuous man who had lost them. In such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> it is too little remembered, that repugnance to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOCRISY\">hypocrisy</a>, and impatience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> concealment, are the qualities of the best formed minds; and that, if the publication of some doctrines proves often painful and mischievous, the habitual suppression of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is injurious to reason, and very dangerous to sincerity. Practical questions thus arise, so difficult and perplexing, that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> generally depends on the boldness or timidity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>,\u2014on his tenderness for the feelings of the good, or his greater reverence for the free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of reason. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a> is not yet come when the noble maxim of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, \"that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> is unwillingly deprived of truth,\" <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be practically and heartily applied by men to the honest opponents who differ from them most widely.\n\nIn his twenty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> year he published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> the Treatise of Human Nature, the first systematic attack on all the principles of knowledge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, and the most formidable, if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> scepticism could ever be more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> exercise of ingenuity.\u00b9 This memorable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> was reviewed in a Journal of that time,\u00b2 in a criticism not distinguished by ability, which affects to represent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of a very clear writer as unintelligible\u2014sometimes from a purpose to insult, but oftener from sheer dulness\u2014which is unaccountably silent respecting the consequences of a sceptical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>; and which concludes with a prophecy so much at variance with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> of the article, that it would seem to be added by a different hand. \"It bears incontestable marks of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, of a soaring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, but young, and not yet thoroughly practised. Time and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a> these qualities in the author, and we shall probably have reason to consider this, compared with his later productions, in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> as we view the juvenile works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>, or the first manner of Raphael.\"\n\nThe great speculator did not, in this work, amuse himself, like Bayle, with dialectical exercises, which only inspire a disposition towards doubt, by showing in detail the uncertainty of most opinions. He aimed at proving, not that nothing was known, but that nothing could be known;\u2014from the structure of the understanding to demonstrate, that we are doomed for ever to dwell in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> and universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>. It is true that such a system of universal scepticism never can be more than an intellectual amusement, an exercise of subtlety; of which the only use is to check dogmatism, but which perhaps oftener provokes and produces that much more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> evil. As those dictates of experience which regulate conduct must be the objects of belief, all objections which attack them in common with the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> must be utterly ineffectual. Whatever attacks every principle of belief can destroy none. As long as the foundations of knowledge are allowed to remain on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> (be it called of certainty or uncertainty) with the maxims of life, the whole system of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> must continue undisturbed. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCEPTIC\">sceptic</a> boasts of having involved the results of experience and the elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> in the same ruin with the doctrines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, he may be answered, That no dogmatist ever claimed more than the same degree of certainty for these various convictions and opinions; and that his scepticism, therefore, leaves them in the relative condition in which it found them. \"No man knew better, or owned more frankly than Mr Hume, that to\n\n\u00b9 Sextus, a physician of the empirical, i.e. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANTI\">anti</a>-theoretical school, who lived at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANTONINUS_PIUS\">Antoninus Pius</a>, has preserved the reasonings of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Sceptics as they were to be found in their most improved state, in the writings of \u00c6neidemus, a Cretan, who was a Professor in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, soon after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> into a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>. The greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the grounds of doubt are very shallow and popular. There are, among them, intimations of the argument against a necessary connection of causes with effects, afterwards better presented by Glanville in his Sceptis Scientifica. See Notes and Illustrations, note Q.\n\n\u00b2 History of the Works of the Learned, November and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1739, p. 353\u2013404. This Review is attributed by some (Chalmers, Biographical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>) to Warburton, but certainly without foundation.\nthis answer there is no serious reply. Universal scepticism involves a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> in terms. It is a belief that there can be no belief. It is an attempt of the mind to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> without its structure, and by other laws than those to which its nature has subjected its operations. To reason without assenting to the principles on which reasoning is founded, is not unlike an effort to feel without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>, or to move without muscles. No man can be allowed to be an opponent in reasoning, who does not set out with admitting all the principles, without the admission of which it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to reason. It is indeed a puerile, nay, in the eye of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, a childish play, to attempt either to establish or to confute principles by argument, which every step of that argument must presuppose. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the two cases is, that he who tries to prove them can do so only by first taking them for granted; and that he who attempts to impugn them falls at the very first step into a contradiction, from which he never can rise.\n\nIt must, however, be allowed, that universal scepticism has practical consequences of a very mischievous nature. This is because its universality is not steadily kept in view, and constantly borne in mind. If it were, the above short and plain remark would be an effectual antidote to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>. But in practice, it is an armory from which weapons are taken to be employed against some opinions, while it is hidden from notice that the same weapon would equally cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> every other conviction. It is thus that Mr Hume's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAUSATION\">causation</a> is used as an answer to arguments for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, without warning the reader that it would equally lead him not to expect that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> will rise to-morrow. It must also be added, that those who are early accustomed to dispute first principles are never likely to acquire, in a sufficient degree, that earnestness and that sincerity, that strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of truth, and that conscientious solicitude for the formation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> opinions, which are not the least virtues of men, but of which the cultivation is the more especial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> of all who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALL\">call</a> themselves philosophers.\n\nIt is not an uninteresting fact, that Mr Hume having been introduced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Kames (then Mr Henry Home) to Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>, sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of his Treatise to that philosopher at the moment of his preferment to the bishopric of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>; and that the perusal of it did not deter the philosophic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRELATE\">prelate</a> from \"everywhere recommending Mr Hume's Moral and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> Essays,\" published two years afterwards;\u2014Essays which it would indeed have been unworthy of such a man not to have liberally commended, for they, and those which followed them, whatever may be thought of the contents of some of them, must be ever regarded as the best models in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, of the short but full, of the clear and agreeable, though deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of difficult questions.\n\nMr Hume considered his Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals as the best of his writings. It is very creditable to his character, that he should have looked back with most complacency on a Tract the least distinguished by originality, and the least tainted with paradox, among his philosophical works; but deserving of all commendation for the elegant perspicuity of the style, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> of illustration and inference with which he unfolded to general readers a doctrine too simple, too certain, and too important, to remain till his time undiscovered among philosophers. His diction has, indeed, neither the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> of Berkeley nor the strength of Hobbes; but it is without the verbosity of the former, or the rugged sternness of the latter. His manner is more lively, more easy, more ingratiating, and, if the word may\n\n---\n\n1 This maxim, which contains a sufficient answer to all universal scepticism, or, in other words, to all scepticism properly so called, is significantly conveyed in the quaint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of an old and rare book, entitled, Scivi, sive Sceptici et Scepticorum Juris Disputatios Exclusio, by Thomas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WHITE\">White</a>, the metaphysician of the English Catholics in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times.\u2014\"Fortunately,\" says the illustrious sceptic himself, \"since Reason is incapable of dispelling these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, Nature herself suffices for that purpose, and cures me of this philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DELIRIUM\">delirium</a>\" (Treatise of Human Nature, I. 467); almost in the sublime and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> words of Pascal: La Raison confond les Dogmatistes, et la Nature les Sceptiques.\n\n2 It would be an act of injustice to those readers who are not acquainted with that valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> entitled, Essays on the Formation of Opinions, not to refer them to it as enforcing that neglected part of morality.

If he must be supposed to have had an eye on any French writer, it would be a more plausible guess, that he sometimes copied, with a temperate hand, the unexpected thoughts and familiar expressions of Fontenelle. Though he carefully weeded his writings in their successive editions, yet they still contain Scotticisms and Gallicisms enough to employ the successors of such critics as those who exulted over the Pata- vinity of the Roman Historian. His own great and modest mind would have been satisfied with the praise which cannot be withheld from him, that there is no writer in our language who, through long works, is more agreeable; and it is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEROGATION\">derogation</a> from him, that, as a Scotsman, he did not reach those native and secret beauties, characteristic of a language, which are never attained, in elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, but by a very small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of those who familiarly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> in it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>.\n\nThe Enquiry affords perhaps the best specimen of his style. In substance, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> merit is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, from an abundant enumeration of particulars, that all the qualities and actions of the mind which are generally approved by mankind agree in the circumstance of being useful to society. In the proof, (scarcely necessary) that benevolent affections and actions have that tendency, he asserts the real existence of these affections with unusual warmth; and he well abridges some of the most forcible arguments of Butler, whom it is remarkable that he does not mention. To show the importance of his principles, he very unnecessarily distinguishes the comprehensive duty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, from other parts of morality, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, for which our respect is solely derived from notions of utility. If all things were in such plenty that there could never be a want, or if men were so benevolent as to provide for the wants of others as much as for their own, there would, says he, in neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> be any justice, because there would be no need for it. But it is evident that the same reasoning is applicable to every good affection and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. None of them could exist if there were no scope for their exercise. If there were no suffering, there could be no pity and no relief. If there were no offences, there could be no placability. If there were no crimes, there could be no mercy. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">Temperance</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>, are qualities of which the value depends on the evils by which they are respectively exercised.\n\nOn purity of manners, it must be owned that Mr Hume, though he controverts no rule, yet treats vice with too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>. It was his general disposition to distrust virtues which are liable to exaggeration, and may be easily counterfeited. The ascetic pursuit of purity, and hypocritical pretences to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a>, had too much withdrawn the respect of his equally calm and sincere nature from these excellent virtues; more especially as severity in both these respects was often at apparent variance with affection, which can neither be long assumed, nor ever overvalued. Yet it was singular that he who, in his Essay on Polygamy and Divorce, had so\n\n---\n\n1 These commendations are so far from being at variance with the remarks of the late most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> Dr Thomas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>, on Mr Hume's \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>,\" (Enquiry into the Relation of Cause and Effect, 3d ed. 327) that they may rather be regarded as descriptive of those excellencies of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> produced the faults of Mr Hume as a mere searcher and teacher; justly, though perhaps severely, animadverted on by Dr Brown.\n\n2 Enquiry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. ii. part i., especially the concluding paragraphs; those which precede being more his own.\n\n3 Si nobis, cum eum vitae migraverimus in locum sumum insulis, ut fabulas fertur, immortale sevum degere licet, quid opus esset eloquentia, cum judicia nulla fuerint? aut ipsas etiam virtutes? Nec enim fortitudinis indigentem, nullo proposito laboris aut periculis; nec prudentiae, quem esset nihil quod spectaretur alieni; nec temperantiae, quem regeret cas quem nullae essent illudiones; nec prudentiae quemdam sermocinis, nullo proposito delectu bonorum et malorum. Una igitur eassemus beatissimae cognitionis rerum et scientiae.\" (Prag. Ctc. Hortensia, apud Augustin. de Trinitate.) Cicero is more extensive, and therefore more consistent, than Hume; but his Enquiry errs both by excess and defect. He supposes knowledge to render beings happy in this imaginary state, without stooping to inquire how. He omits a virtue which might well exist in it, though we cannot conceive its formation in such a state\u2014the delight in each other's wellbeing; and he omits a conceivable though unknown vice, that of unmixed ill-will, which would render such a state a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HELL\">hell</a> to the wretch who harboured the malevolence.\n\n4 Essays and Treatises, vol. I.\nwell shown the connection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> ties with the outward order of society, should not have perceived their deeper and closer relation to all the social feelings of human nature. It cannot be enough regretted, that, in an Enquiry written with a very moral purpose, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of making truth attractive, by throwing over her the dress of paradox, should have given him for a moment the appearance of weighing the mere amusements of society and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> against domestic fidelity, which is the preserver of domestic affection, the source of parental fondness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> regard, and, indirectly, of all the kindness which exists between human beings. That families are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> heart learns to love, and that pure manners are the cement which alone holds these schools together, are truths so certain, that it is wonderful he should not have betrayed a stronger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of their importance. No one could so well have proved that all the virtues of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, in their various orders and degrees, minister to the benevolent affections; and that every act which separates the senses from the affections tends, in some degree, to deprive kindness of its natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AUXILIARY\">auxiliary</a>, and to lessen its prevalence in the world. It did not require his sagacity to discover that the gentlest and tenderest feelings flourish only under the stern guardianship of these severe virtues. Perhaps his philosophy was loosened, though his life was untainted, by that universal and undistinguishing profligacy which prevailed on the Continent, from the regency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a> to the French revolution; the most dissolute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of European history, at least since the Roman emperors. At Rome, indeed, the connection of licentiousness with cruelty, which, though scarcely traceable in individuals, is generally very observable in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> masses, bore a fearful testimony to the value of austere purity. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> of these remote vices seemed to be broken in the time of Mr Hume. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">Pleasure</a>, in a more improved state of society, seemed to return to her more natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> with kindness and tenderness, as well as with refinement and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a>. Had he lived fourteen years longer, however, he would have seen, that the virtues which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the natural seminaries of the affections are their only true and lasting friends. The demand of all well-informed men for the improvement of civil institutions\u2014the demand of classes of men growing in intelligence, to be delivered from a degrading inferiority, and admitted to a share of political power proportioned to their new importance, being feebly yet violently resisted by those ruling Castes who neither knew how to yield nor how to withstand\u2014being also attended by very erroneous principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a>, having suddenly broken down the barriers (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> as these were) of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> and government, led to popular excesses, desolating wars, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> dictatorship, which for a long time threatened to defeat the reformation, and to disappoint the hopes of mankind. This tremendous convulsion threw a fearful light on the ferocity which lies hid under the arts and pleasures of corrupted nations; as earthquakes and volcanoes disclose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> which compose the deeper parts of our planet, beneath a fertile and flowery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a>. A part of this dreadful result may be ascribed, not improbably, to that relaxation of domestic ties, unhappily natural to the populace of vast capitals, and at that time countenanced and aggravated by the example of their superiors. Another part doubtless arose from the barbarizing power of absolute government, or, in other words, of injustice in high places. A very large portion attests, as strongly as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMAN_HISTORY\">Roman history</a>, though in a somewhat different manner, the humanizing efficacy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> virtues, by the consequences of the want of them in the higher classes, whose profuse and ostentatious sensuality inspired the laborious and suffering portion of mankind with contempt, disgust, envy, and hatred.\n\nThe Enquiry is disfigured by another speck of more frivolous paradox. It consists in the attempt to give the name of virtue to qualities of the understanding; and it would not have deserved the single remark about to be made on it, had it been the paradox of an inferior man. He has altogether omitted the circumstance on which depends the difference of our sentiments regarding moral and intellectual qualities. We\n\n---\n\n1 See Notes and Illustrations, note R.\nadmire intellectual excellence, but we bestow no moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> on it. Such approbation has no tendency directly to increase it, because it is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a>. We cultivate our natural disposition to esteem and love benevolence and justice, because these moral sentiments, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of them, directly and materially dispose others, as well as ourselves, to cultivate these two virtues. We cultivate a natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> against oppression, which guards ourselves against the practice of that vice, and because the manifestation of it deters others from its exercise. The first rude <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a> of a child is against every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of hurt. We confine it to intentional hurt, when we are taught by experience that it prevents only that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of hurt; and at last it is still further limited to wrong done to ourselves or others, and in that case becomes a purely moral sentiment. We morally approve industry, desire of knowledge, love of truth, and all the habits by which the understanding is strengthened and rectified, because their formation is subject to the will. But we do not feel a moral anger against folly or ignorance, because they are involuntary. No one but the religious persecutor, a mischievous and overgrown child, wreaks his vengeance on involuntary, inevitable, compulsory acts or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the understanding, which are no more affected by blame than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> which the foolish child beats for hurting him. Reasonable men apply to every thing which they wish to move, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> which is capable of moving it;\u2014force to outward substances, arguments to the understanding, and blame, together with all other motives, whether moral or personal, to the will alone. It is as absurd to entertain an abhorrence of intellectual inferiority or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, however extensive or mischievous, as it would be to cherish a warm indignation against earthquakes or hurricanes. It is singular that a philosopher who needed the most liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TOLERATION\">toleration</a> should, by representing states of the understanding as moral or immoral, have offered the most philosophical apology for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>.\n\nThat general utility constitutes a uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> of moral distinctions, is a part of Mr Hume's ethical theory which never can be impugned, until some example can be produced of a virtue generally pernicious, or of a vice generally beneficial. The religious philosopher who, with Butler, holds that benevolence must be the actuating principle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">Divine</a> mind, will, with Berkeley, maintain that pure benevolence can prescribe no rules of human conduct but such as are beneficial to men; thus bestowing on the theory of Moral Distinctions the certainty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> in the eyes of all who believe in God.\n\nThe other question of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a> which relates to the theory of Moral Approbation, has been by no means so distinctly and satisfactorily handled by Mr Hume. His general doctrine is, that an interest in the wellbeing of others, implanted by nature, which he calls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYMPATHY\">Sympathy</a> in his Treatise of Human Nature, and much less happily Benevolence in his subsequent Enquiry, prompts us to be pleased with all generally beneficial actions. In this respect his doctrine nearly resembles that of Hutcheson. He does not trace his principle through the variety of forms which our moral sentiments assume. There are very important parts of them, of which it affords no solution. For example, though he truly represents our approbation, in others, of qualities useful to the individual, as a proof of benevolence, he makes no attempt to explain our moral approbation of such virtues as temperance and fortitude in ourselves. He entirely overlooks that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of the rightful supremacy of the moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> over every other principle of human action, without an explanation of which, ethical theory is wanting in one of its vital organs.\n\nNotwithstanding these considerable defects, his proof from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> of the beneficial tendency of virtue, his conclusive arguments for human disinterestedness, and his decisive observations on the respective provinces of reason and sentiment in morals, concur in ranking the\n\n---\n\n1 \"In hac questione primas tenet Voluntas, qua, ut ait Augustinus, peccator, et recte visitar.\" (Hyperaspistes; Districte adversus Servum Arbitrium Martini Lutheri, per Desiderium Erasmus Rotterdamensem.)\n\n2 Essays and Treatises, vol.

As there are too many who seem more wise than they are, so it was the more uncommon fault of Reid to appear less a philosopher than he really was. Indeed his temporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of Berkeleanism is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of an unprejudiced and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> mind.

The short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of this excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> is worthy of serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>, by those who, in circumstances like his, enter on the slippery path of public affairs. Without the aids of birth or fortune, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> where aristocratical propensities prevail,\u2014by his understanding, industry, pure taste, and useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>,\u2014still more by modest independence, steadiness and sincerity, joined to moderation,\u2014by the stamp of unbending integrity, and by the conscientious considerateness which breathed through his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>,\u2014he raised himself, at the early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of thirty-six, to a moral authority which, without these qualities, no brilliancy of talents or power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> could have acquired. No eminent speaker in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> owed so much of his success to his moral character. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> was therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> to his audience and to his country. Regret for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> was expressed with touching unanimity from every part of a divided assembly, unused to manifestations of sensibility, abhorrent from theatrical display, and whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> on such an occasion derived its peculiar value from their general coldness and sluggishness. The tears of those to whom he was unknown were shed over him; and, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of Chose by whom he was \"praised, wept, and honoured,\" was one, whose commendation would have been more enhanced in the eye of Mr Horner, by his discernment and veracity, than by the signal proof of the concurrence of all orders, as well as parties, which was afforded by the name of Howard.\n\n2 Those who may doubt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> do well to weigh the words of the most competent of judges, who, though candid and even indulgent, was not prodigal of praise. \"It is certainly very rare that a piece so deeply philosophical is wrote with so much spirit, and affords so much entertainment to the reader.

No man, if he had been in search of improper words, could have discovered any more unfit than these two, for denoting that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, or state, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of mind, which compels us to acknowledge certain simple and very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> truths, not being identical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> at the foundation of all reasoning, and to be the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> of all belief.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">Long</a> after the death of Dr Reid, his philosophy was taught at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> by M. Royer Collard, who, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> of free debate, became the most philosophical orator of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, and now fills, with impartiality and dignity, the chair of the Chamber of Deputies. His ingenious and eloquent scholar, Professor Cousin, dissatisfied with what he calls \"the sage and timid\" doctrines of Edinburgh, which he considered as only a vigorous protest, on behalf of common sense, against the scepticism of Hume, sought in Germany for a philosophy of \"such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASCULINE\">masculine</a> and brilliant character as might command the attention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and be able to struggle with success on a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, against the genius of the adverse school.\" It may be questioned whether he found in Kant more than the same vigorous protest, under a more systematic form, with an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOMENCLATURE\">nomenclature</a>, and constituting a philosophical edifice of equal symmetry and vastness. The preference of the more boastful system, over a philosophy thus chiefly blamed for its modest pretensions, does not seem to be entirely justified by its permanent authority in the country which gave it birth; where, however powerful its influence still continues to be, its doctrines do not appear to have now many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a>: and, indeed, the accomplished Professor himself rapidly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> through Kantianism, and now appears to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> or to stop at the doctrines of Schelling and Hegel, at a point so high, that it is hard to desery from it any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> between objects,\u2014even that indispensable distinction between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REALITY\">Reality</a> and Illusion. As the works of Reid, and those of Kant, otherwise so different, appear to be simultaneous efforts of the conservative power of philosophy to expel the mortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> of scepticism, so the exertions of M. Royer Collard and M. Cousin, however at variance in metaphysical principles, seem to have been chiefly roused by the desire of delivering Ethics from that fatal taint of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a>, and, indeed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, which that science had received in France from the followers of Condillac, especially Helvetius, St Lambert, and Cabanis. The success of these attempts to render <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">Speculative</a> Philosophy once more popular in the country of Descartes, has already been considerable. The French youth, whose desire of knowledge and love of liberty afford an auspicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> of the succeeding age, have eagerly received doctrines, of which the moral part is so much more agreeable to their liberal spirit, than the selfish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in the stagnation of a corrupt, cruel, and dissolute tyranny.\n\nThese agreeable prospects bring us easily back to our subject; for though the restoration of Speculative Philosophy in the country of Descartes is due to the precise statement and vigorous logic of M. Royer Collard, the modifications introduced by him into the doctrine of Reid coincide with those of Mr Stewart, and would have appeared to agree more exactly, if the forms of the French philosopher had not been more dialectical, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of Mr Stewart had retained less of that oratorical character, which belonged to a justly celebrated speaker. Amidst excellencies of the highest order, his writings, it must be confessed, leave some room for criticism. He took precautions against offence to the feelings of his contemporaries, more anxious and frequent than the impatient searcher for truth may deem necessary. For the sake of promoting the favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-\n\n---\n\n1 Fragments of his lectures have been recently published in a French translation of Dr Reid, by M. Jonnroy: \u0152uvres Compl\u00e8tes de Thomas Reid, vol. IV. Paris, 1823.\n2 Cours de Philosophie, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAR\">par</a> M. Cousin, le\u00e7on xii. Paris, 1823.\nception of philosophy itself, he studies perhaps too visibly to avoid whatever might raise up prejudices against it. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> and native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> dictated a superabundant care in softening and excusing his dissent from those who had been his own instructors, or who were the objects of general reverence. Exposed by his station, both to the assaults of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> prejudice, and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> animosities of a country where a few sceptics attacked the slumbering zeal of a Calvinistic people, it would have been wonderful if he had not betrayed more wariness than would have been necessary or becoming in a very different position. The fulness of his literature seduced him too much into multiplied illustrations. Too many of the expedients happily used to allure the young may unnecessarily swell his volumes. Perhaps a successive publication in separate parts made him more voluminous than he would have been if the whole had been at once before his eyes.\n\nA peculiar susceptibility and delicacy of taste produced forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, in themselves extremely beautiful, but of which the habitual use is not easily reconcilable with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a> desirable in works necessarily so extensive. If, however, it must be owned that the caution <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INCIDENT\">incident</a> to his temper, his feelings, his philosophy, and his station, has somewhat lengthened his composition, it is not less true, that some of the same circumstances have contributed towards those peculiar beauties which place him at the head of the most adorned writers on philosophy in our language.\n\nFew writers rise with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> groundwork, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> which require greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a> or embellishment. He gives to narrative, according to the precept of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, by a selection of happy expressions from original writers. Among the secret arts by which he diffuses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> over his diction, may be remarked the skill which, by deepening or brightening a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> in a secondary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, by opening partial or preparatory glimpses of a thought to be afterwards unfolded, unobservedly heightens the import of a word, and gives it a new meaning, without any offence against old use. It is in this manner that philosophical originality may be reconciled to purity and stability of speech,\u2014that we may avoid new terms, which are the easy resource of the unskilful or the indolent, and often a characteristic mark of writers who love their language too little to feel its peculiar excellencies, or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the art of calling forth its powers.\n\nHe reminds us not unfrequently of the character given by Cicero to one of his contemporaries, \"who expressed refined and abstruse thought in soft and transparent diction.\" His writings are a proof that the mild sentiments have their eloquence as well as the vehement passions. It would be difficult to name works in which so much refined philosophy is joined with so fine a fancy,\u2014so much elegant literature, with such a delicate perception of the distinguishing excellencies of great writers, and with an estimate in general so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> of the services rendered to knowledge by a succession of philosophers. They are pervaded by a philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, which keeps up the ardour of his genius, without disturbing the serenity of his mind,\u2014which is felt in his reverence for knowledge, in the generosity of his praise, and in the tenderness of his censure. It is still more sensible in the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> with which he relates the successful progress of the human understanding, among many formidable enemies. Those readers are not to be envied who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> their admiration to particular parts, or to excellencies merely literary; without being warmed by the glow of that honest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> in the advancement of knowledge, and of that assured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> prevalence of truth and justice, which breathe through every page of them, and give the unity and dignity of a moral purpose to the whole of these classical works.\n\nHe has often quoted poetical passages, of which some throw much light on our mental operations. If he sometimes prized the moral common-places of Thomson and the speculative fancy of Akenside more highly than the higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> of their betters, it was not to be wondered at that the metaphysician and the moralist should sometimes prevail over the lover of poetry. His natural sensibility was perhaps occasionally cramped by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> criticism of an unpoetical age; and some of his remarks may be thought to indicate a more constant and exclusive regard\nto diction than is agreeable to the men of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> who have been trained by tremendous events to a passion for daring inventions, and to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> enthusiasm, impatient of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> elegancies and refinement. Many of those beauties which his generous criticism delighted to magnify in the works of his contemporaries, have already faded under the scorching rays of a fiercer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>.\n\nMr Stewart employed more skill in contriving, and more care in concealing, his very important reforms of Reid's doctrines, than others exert to maintain their claims to originality. Had his well-chosen language of \"laws of human thought or belief\" been at first adopted in that school, instead of \"instinct\" and \"common sense,\" it would have escaped much of the reproach (which Dr Reid himself did not merit) of shallowness and popularity. Expressions so exact, employed in the opening, could not have failed to influence the whole system, and to have given it, not only in the general estimation, but in the minds of its framers, a more scientific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>. In those parts of Mr Stewart's speculations in which he most departed from his general principles, he seems sometimes, as it were, to be suddenly driven back by what he unconsciously shrinks from as ungrateful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APOSTASY\">apostasy</a>; and to be desirous of making amends to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, by more harshness, than is otherwise natural to him, towards the writers whom he has insensibly approached. Hence perhaps the unwonted severity of his language towards Tucker and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a>. It is thus at the very time when he largely adopts the Principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">Association</a> in his excellent Essay on the Beautiful,\u00b9 that he treats most rigidly the latter of these writers, to whom, though neither the discoverer nor the sole advocate of that principle, it surely owes the greatest illustration and support.\n\nIn matters of far other importance, causes perhaps somewhat similar may have led to the like mistake. When he absolutely contradicts Dr Reid, by truly stating that \"it is more philosophical to resolve the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> into the association of ideas, than to resolve the association of ideas into habit,\"\u00b2 he, in the sequel of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>,\u00b3 refuses to go farther than to own, that \"the theory of Hartley concerning the origin of our affections, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>, is a most ingenious refinement on the selfish system, and that by means of it the force of many of the common reasonings against that system is eluded;\" though he somewhat inconsistently allows, that \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> principles which, arising from circumstances in which all the situations of mankind must agree, are therefore common to the whole species, at whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of life they may appear, are to be regarded as a part of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, no less than the instinct of suction; in the same manner as the acquired perception of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, by the eye, is to be ranked among the perceptive powers of man, no less than the original perceptions of the other senses.\"\u2074 In another place also he makes a remark on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> beauty, which might have led him to a more just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> respecting the theory of the origin of the affections and the moral sense: \"It is scarcely necessary for me to observe, that, in those instances where association operates in heightening (or he might have said creates) the pleasures we receive from sight, the pleasing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a> continues still to appear, to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a>, simple and uncompounded.\"\u2075 To this remark he might have added, that until all the separate pleasures be melted into one,\u2014as long as any of them are discerned and felt as distinct from each other,\u2014the associations are incomplete, and the qualities which gratify are not called by the name of beauty. In like manner, as has been repeatedly observed, it is only when all the separate feelings, pleasurable and painful, excited by the contemplation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, are lost in the general sentiments of ap-\n\n\u00b9 Stewart's Philosophical Essays, part ii. essay i. especially chap. vi.

The theory which thus ascribes the uniform formation of the moral faculty to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> and paramount laws, is not a refinement of the selfish system, nor is it any modification of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>. The partisans of selfishness maintain, that in acts of will the agent must have a view to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> or happiness which he hopes to reap from it. The philosophers who regard the social affections and the moral sentiments as formed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of association, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, contend that these affections and sentiments must work themselves clear from every particle of self-regard, before they deserve the names of benevolence and of conscience. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> state of human motives, the two systems are not to be likened, but to be contrasted to each other. It is remarkable that Mr Stewart, who admits the \"question respecting the origin of the affections to be rather curious than important,\" should have held a directly contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> respecting the moral sense; to which these words, in his sense of them, seem to be equally applicable. His meaning in the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> is, that if the affections be acquired, yet they are justly called natural; and if their origin be personal, yet their nature may and does become disinterested. What circumstance distinguishes the former from the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>? With respect to the origin of the affections, it must not be overlooked that his language is somewhat contradictory. For if the theory on that subject from which he dissents were merely \"a refinement on the selfish system,\" its truth or falsehood could not be represented as subordinate, since the controversy would continue to relate to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of disinterested motives of human conduct. It may also be observed, that he uniformly represents his opponents as deriving the affections from self-love, which, in its proper sense, is not the source to which they refer even avarice; and which is itself derived from other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANTECEDENT\">antecedent</a> principles, some of which are inherent, and some acquired. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of this theory of the rise of the most important feelings of human nature were, as our philosopher supposes, \"to elude objections against the selfish system,\" it would be at best worthless. Its positive merits are several. It affirms the actual disinterestedness of human motives, as strongly as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a> himself. The explanation of the mental law, of which benevolence and conscience are formed habitually, when it is contemplated deeply, impresses on the mind the truth that they not only are but must be disinterested. It confirms, as it were, the testimony of consciousness, by exhibiting to the understanding the means employed to insure the production of disinterestedness. It affords the only effectual answer to the prejudice against the disinterested theory, from the multiplication of ultimate facts and implanted principles, which, under all its other forms, it seems to require. No room is left for this prejudice by a representation of disinterestedness, which ultimately traces its formation to principles almost as simple as those of Hobbes himself. Lastly, every step in just generalization is an advance in philosophy. No one has yet shown, either that man is not actually disinterested, or that he may not have been destined to become so by such a process as has been described\u2014the cause to which the effects are ascribed is a real agent, which seems adequate to the appearance; and if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> observation should be found to require that the theory shall be confined within narrower limits, such a limitation will not destroy its value.\n\nThe acquiescence of Mr Stewart in Dr Reid's general representation of our mental constitu-\n\n---\n\n1 Outlines of Moral Philosophy, p. 93.\n2 Outlines, p. 117. \"This is the most important question that can be stated with respect to the Theory of Morals.\"\n3 In the Philosophy of the Active and Moral Powers of Man (vol. I, p. 164) Mr Stewart has done more manifest injustice to the Hartleian theory, by calling it \"a doctrine fundamentally the same\" with the selfish system, and especially by representing Hartley, who ought to be rather classed with Butler and Hume, as agreeing with Gay, Tucker, and Paley.\ntion, led him to indulge more freely the natural bent of his understanding, by applying it to theories of character and manners, of life and literature, of taste and the arts, more than to the consideration of those more simple principles which rule over human nature under every form. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> work, as he frankly owns, is indeed rather a collection of such theories, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> toward the common end of throwing light on the structure and functions of the mind, than a systematic treatise, such as might be expected from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of \"Elements.\" It is in essays of this kind that he has most surpassed other cultivators of mental philosophy. His remarks on the effects of casual associations may be quoted as a specimen of the most original and just thoughts, conveyed in the best manner. In this beautiful passage, he proceeds from their power of confusing speculation, to that of disturbing experience and of misleading practice; and ends with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> effect in bestowing on trivial, and even ludicrous circumstances, some portion of the dignity and sanctity of those sublime principles with which they are associated. The style, at first only clear, afterwards admitting the ornaments of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> elegance, at last rising to as high a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a> as philosophy will endure, and of which all the parts (various as their nature is) are held together by an invisible thread of gentle transition, affords a specimen of adaptation of manner to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which it will be hard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> in any philosophical writer.\n\nAnother very fine remark, which seems to be as original as it is just, may be quoted as a sample of those beauties with which his writings abound. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> coldness and selfishness of mankind may be traced, in a great measure, to a want of attention and a want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>. In the case of those misfortunes which happen to ourselves or our near connections, neither of these powers is necessary to make us acquainted with our situation. But without an uncommon degree of both, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> for any man to comprehend completely the situation of his neighbour, or to have an idea of the greater part of the distress which exists in the world. If we feel more for ourselves than for others, in the former case the facts are more fully before us than they can be in the latter.\"\n\nYet several parts of his writings afford the most satisfactory proof, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> from what is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called metaphysical speculation, arose from no inability to pursue it with signal success. As examples, his observations on General Terms, and on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAUSATION\">Causation</a>, may be appealed to with perfect confidence. In the first two Dissertations of the volume <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the title of Philosophical Essays, he with equal boldness and acuteness grapples with the most extensive and abstruse questions of mental philosophy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out both the sources and the uttermost boundaries of human knowledge with a Verulamian hand. In another part of his writings, he calls what are denominated first principles of experience, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> laws of human belief, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> elements of human reason;\" which last form of expression has so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> a resemblance to the language of Kant, that it should have protected the latter from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPUTATION\">imputation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> jargon.\n\nMr Stewart's excellent volume entitled Outlines of Moral Philosophy, though composed only as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXT\">text</a>-book for the use of his hearers, is one of the most decisive proofs that he was perfectly qualified to unite precision with ease, to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> with the utmost clearness, and to write with becoming elegance in a style where the meaning is not overloaded by ornaments. This volume contains his properly Ethical Theory, which is much expanded, but not substantially altered, in his Philosophy of the Active and Moral Powers,\u2014a work almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a>, and composed under circumstances which give it a deeper interest than can be inspired by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> in science. Though with his usual modesty, he manifests an anxiety to fasten his ethical theory to the kindred speculations of other philosophers of the Intellectual School, especially to those of Cudworth, recently clothed in more modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASEOLOGY\">phraseology</a> by Price, yet he still shows that independence and origin-\n\n---\n\n1 Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, vol.

Edinburgh, 1826.\nality which all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a> from parade could not entirely conceal. *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">Right</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>, virtue, moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a>,* and the like or the opposite forms of expression, represent, according to him, certain thoughts, which arise necessarily and instantaneously in the mind (or in the reason, if we take that word in the large sense in which it denotes all that is not emotive) at the contemplation of actions, and which are utterly incapable of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, consequently of all explanation, and which can be known only by being experienced. These thoughts or ideas, or by whatever other name they may be called, are followed as inexplicably, but as inevitably, by pleasurable and painful emotions, which suggest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of *moral beauty*; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of human actions distinct from their adherence to or deviation from rectitude, though generally coinciding with it. The question which a reflecting reader will here put is, whether any purpose is served by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of the intermediate mental process between the particular thoughts and the moral emotions. How would the view be darkened or confused, or indeed in any degree changed, by withdrawing that process, or erasing the words which attempt to express it? No advocate of the *intellectual origin of the moral faculty* has yet stated a case in which a mere operation of reason or judgment, unattended by emotion, could, consistently with the universal opinion of mankind, as it is exhibited by the structure of language, be said to have the nature or to produce the effects of Conscience. Such an example would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to an *experimentum crucis* on the side of that celebrated theory. The failure to produce it, after long challenge, is at least a presumption against it, nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> to that sort of decisively discriminative experiment. It would be vain to restate what has already been too often repeated, that all the objections to the selfish philosophy turn upon the actual nature, not upon the original source of our principles of action; and that it is by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> of these very distinct questions alone that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a> of Hobbes can be made apparently to involve Hartley. Mr Stewart appears, like most other metaphysicians, to have blended the inquiry into the nature of our moral sentiments with that other which only seeks a criterion to distinguish moral from immoral habits of feeling and action; for he considers the appearance of moral sentiment at an early age, before the general tendency of actions could be ascertained, as a decisive objection to the origin of these sentiments in association,\u2014an objection which assumes that, if utility be the criterion of morality, associations with utility must be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> by which the moral sentiments are formed, which no skilful advocate of the theory of association will ever allow. That the main, if not sole object of conscience is to govern our voluntary exertions, is manifest. But how could it perform this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> if it did not impel the will? and how could it have the latter effect as a mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of reason, or indeed in any respect otherwise than as it is made up of emotions, by which alone its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> aim could in any degree be attained? Judgment and reason are therefore preparatory to conscience, not properly a part of it. That the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of reason reduces virtue to be a relative quality, is another instance of the confusion of the two questions in moral theory; for though a fitness to excite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> may be only a relation of objects to our susceptibility, yet the proposition that all virtuous actions are beneficial, is a proposition as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> as any other within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of our understanding.\n\nA delicate state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, and an ardent desire to devote himself exclusively to study and composition, induced Mr Stewart, while in the full blaze of his reputation as a lecturer, to retire, in 1810, from the labour of public instruction. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a>, as he himself describes it, was that of a quiet but active life. Three quarto and two octavo volumes, besides the magnificent Dissertations prefixed to this Encyclopedia, were among its happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>. These Dissertations are, perhaps, the most profusely ornamented of any of his compositions; a peculiarity which must in part have arisen from a principle of taste, which regarded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECORATION\">decoration</a> as more suitable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of philosophy than to philosophy itself. But the memorable instances of Cicero, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>, and still more those of Dryden and Burke, seem to show that there is some natural tendency in the fire of genius to burn more brightly or to blaze more fiercely in\nthe evening than in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of human life. Probably the materials which long experience supplies to the imagination, the boldness with which a more established reputation arms the mind, and the silence of the low but formidable rivals of the higher principles, may concur in producing this unexpected and little observed effect.\n\nIt was in the last years of his life, when suffering under the effects of a severe attack of palsy, with which he had been afflicted in 1822, that Mr Stewart most plentifully reaped the fruits of long virtue and a well-ordered mind. Happily for him, his own cultivation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of every kindly affection had laid up for him a store of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> consolation which none who deserve it ever want, and for the loss of which, nothing beyond the threshold can make amends. The same philosophy which he had cultivated from his youth upward employed his dying hand. Aspirations after higher and brighter scenes of excellence, always blended with his elevated morality, became more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> and deeper as worldly passions died away, and earthly objects vanished from his sight.","sp":612,"ep":620},{"h":"JEREMY BENTHAM","t":"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> scheme of this Dissertation would be a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for omitting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of a living writer. The devoted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> and invincible repugnance which an impartial estimate of Mr Bentham has to encounter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ON\">on</a> either side, are a strong inducement not to deviate from that scheme in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. But the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> sketch of ethical controversy in England would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> without it; and perhaps the utter hopelessness of any expedient for satisfying his followers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> softening his opponents, may enable a writer to look steadily and solely at what he believes to be the dictates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. He who has spoken of former philosophers with unreserved freedom, ought perhaps to subject his courage and honesty to the severest test by an attempt to characterize such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a>.

They are in general men of competent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, of superior understanding, who voluntarily embrace the laborious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of useful and noble sciences; who derive their opinions not so much from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> perusal of his writings, as from familiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> from whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIPS\">lips</a> these opinions are recommended by simplicity, disinterestedness, originality, and vivacity; aided rather than impeded by foibles not unamiable, enforced of late by the growing authority of years and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, and at all times strengthened by that undoubting reliance on his own judgment which mightily increases the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASCENDANT\">ascendant</a> of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> over those who approach him. As he and they deserve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of braving vulgar prejudices, so they must be content to incur the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPUTATION\">imputation</a> of falling into the neighbouring vices of seeking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> by singularity; of clinging to opinions because they are obnoxious; of wantonly wounding the most respectable feelings of mankind; of regarding an immense display of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOMENCLATURE\">nomenclature</a> as a sure token of a corresponding increase of knowledge; and of considering them-\nselves as a chosen few, whom an initiation into the most secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> entitles to look <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with pity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not contempt, on the profane multitude. Viewed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a> or dread by the public, they become more bound to each other and to their master; while they are provoked into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> which more and more exasperates opposition to them.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HERMIT\">hermit</a> in the greatest of cities, seeing only his disciples, and indignant that systems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> which he believes to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> are disregarded at once by the many and the powerful, Mr Bentham has at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> been betrayed into the most unphilosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, that all the ruling bodies who guide the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> have conspired to stifle and defeat his discoveries. He is too little acquainted with doubts to believe the honest doubts of others, and he is too angry to make allowance for their prejudices and habits. He has embraced the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> in practical politics; manifesting more dislike and contempt towards those who are more moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a> of popular principles than towards their most inflexible opponents. To the unpopularity of his philosophical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> doctrines he has added the more general and lasting obloquy which arises from an unseemly treatment of doctrines and principles which, if there were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other motives for reverential deference, even a regard to the feelings of the best men requires to be approached with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECORUM\">decorum</a> and respect.\n\nFifty-three years have passed since the publication of Mr Bentham's first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, *A Fragment on Government*,\u2014a considerable octavo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a> of Blackstone,\u2014unmatched in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> hypercriticism, but conducted with a severity which leads to an unjust estimate of the writer criticised, till the like experiment be repeated on other writings. It was a waste of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> power to employ it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> out flaws and patches in the robe occasionally stolen from the philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, which hung loosely and unbecomingly on the elegant commentator. This volume, and especially the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a>, abounds in fine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>; it contains the germs of most of his subsequent productions, and it is an early example of that disregard for the method, proportions, and occasion of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> which, with all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> readers, deeply affects its power of interesting or instructing. Two years after, he published a most excellent tract on *The Hard Labour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BILL\">Bill</a>*, which, concurring with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> excited by Howard's inquiries, laid the foundation of just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> on Reformatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">Punishment</a>. The *Letters on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-USURY\">Usury</a>* are perhaps the best specimen of the exhaustive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of a moral or political question, leaving no objection, however feeble, unanswered, and no difficulty, however small, unexplained; remarkable also for the clearness and spirit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, for the full exposition which suits them to all intelligent readers, for the tender and skilful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> with which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> is touched, and for the urbanity of his admirable apology for projectors, addressed to Dr Smith, whose temper and manner he seems for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to have imbibed. The *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">Introduction</a> to the Principles of Morals and Politics*, printed before the *Letters*, but published after them, was the first sketch of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, and is still the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of it by himself.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> merit of this work, and of his other writings in relation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">Jurisprudence</a> properly so called, is not within our present scope. To the Roman jurists belongs the praise of having allotted a separate portion of their Digest to the signification of the words of most frequent use.\n\n---\n\nThey were addressed to Mr George Wilson, who retired from the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> in 1816; an early friend of Mr Bentham, and afterwards an intimate friend of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Ellenborough, Sir Vicary Gibbs, and of all the most eminent of his professional contemporaries. The rectitude of judgment, purity of heart, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, the sternness only in integrity, the scorn of baseness, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> towards weakness, which were joined in him with a gravity exclusive neither of feeling nor of plenantry, contributed still more than his abilities and attainments of various sorts, to a moral authority with his friends, and in his profession, which few men more amply possessed, or more usefully exercised. The same character, somewhat softened, and the same influence, distinguished his closest friend, the late Mr Legs. Both were inflexible and incorruptible friends of civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, and both knew how to reconcile warmest zeal for that sacred cause, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> towards their opponents, which rarely was often more delicate than steady, treated as lukewarm. The present writer hopes that the good-natured reader will excuse him for having thus, perhaps unseasonably, bestowed heartfelt commendation on those who were above the pursuit of praise, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of whose good opinion and good-will help to support him under a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of faults and vices.\n\nDISS. II.\nin law and legal discussion. Bentham not only first perceived and taught the great value of an introductory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, composed of definitions of general terms, as subservient to brevity and precision in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CODE\">code</a>, but he also discovered the unspeakable importance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> arrangement in jurisprudence, by rendering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of a proposed law in such an arrangement a short and easy test of the fitness of the proposal. But here he does not distinguish between the value of arrangement as scaffolding, and the inferior convenience of its being the very frame-work of the structure. Mr Bentham, indeed, is much more remarkable for laying down desirable rules for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a>, and the punishment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WRONGS\">wrongs</a>, in general, than for weighing the various circumstances which require them to be modified in different countries and times in order to render them either more useful, more easily introduced, more generally respected, or more certainly executed. The art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a> consists in thus applying the principles of jurisprudence to the situation, wants, interests, feelings, opinions, and habits, of each distinct community at any given time. It bears the same relation to jurisprudence which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> arts bear to pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a>. Many of these considerations serve to show, that the sudden establishment of new codes can seldom be practicable or effectual for their purpose; and that reformations, though founded on the principles of jurisprudence, ought to be not only adapted to the peculiar interests of a people, but engrafted on their previous usages, and brought into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> with those national dispositions on which the execution of laws depends. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JUSTINIAN\">Justinian</a>, adopted at least the true principle, if they did not apply it with sufficient freedom and boldness. They considered the multitude of occasional laws, and the still greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of usages, opinions, and determinations, as the materials of legislation, not precluding, but demanding a systematic arrangement of the whole by the supreme authority. Had the arrangement been more scientific, had there been a bolder examination and a more free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> of many particular branches, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> would have been offered for liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> by modern lawgivers. It cannot be denied, without injustice and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a>, that Mr Bentham has done more than any other writer to rouse the spirit of juridical reformation, which is now gradually examining every part of law, and, when further progress is facilitated by digesting the present laws, will doubtless proceed to the improvement of all. Greater praise it is given to few to earn. It ought to satisfy Mr Bentham, for the disappointment of hopes which were not reasonable, that Russia should receive a code from him, or that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> could be brought to renounce the variety of her laws and institutions, on the single authority of a foreign philosopher, whose opinions had not worked their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAY\">way</a> either into legislation or into general reception in his own country. It ought also to dispose his followers to do fuller justice to the Romillys and Broughams, without whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and energy, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as reason and eloquence, the best plans of reformation must have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> a dead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>,\u2014for whose sake it might have been fit to reconsider the obloquy heaped on their profession, and to show more general indulgence to all those whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> offence seems to consist in their doubts whether sudden changes, almost always imposed by violence on a community, be the surest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to lasting improvement.\n\nIt is unfortunate that Ethical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a>, with\n\n---\n\n1 Digest lib. i. tit. 16.

It need no longer be concealed that it was contributed by Sir Samuel Romilly. The steadiness with which he held the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> in weighing the merits of his friend against his unfortunate defects, is an example of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of the most commanding moral principle with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> so warm, that, if it had been released from that stern authority, it would not so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> have endured the coarseness and roughness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> concerns. From the tenderness of his feelings, and from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> never roused but by cruelty and baseness, as much as from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> and his pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, sprung that original and characteristic eloquence, which was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> of the afflicted as well as the terror of the oppressor. If his oratory had not flowed so largely from this moral source, which years do not dry up, he would not perhaps have been the only example of an orator who, after the age of sixty, daily increased in polish, in vigour, and in splendour.\n3 An excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> between those who absolutely require new codes, and those who obstinately adhere to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> usages, has been pointed out by M. Meyer, in his most justly celebrated work, Institutions Judiciaires des Principaux Pays de l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, tome I. Introduction, p. 8, 9. La Haye et Amst. 1819-23, 6 vols. 8vo.\nwhich we are now chiefly concerned, is not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> in which Mr Bentham has reached the most desirable distinction. It may be remarked, both in ancient and in modern times, that whatever modifications prudent followers may introduce into the system of an innovator, the principles of the Master continue to mould the habitual dispositions, and to influence the practical tendency of the School. Mr Bentham preaches the principle of utility with the zeal of a discoverer. Occupied more in reflection than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, he knew not, or forgot, how often it had been the basis, and how generally an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> part, of moral systems. That in which he really differs from others, is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> which he teaches, and the example which he sets, of constantly bringing that principle before us. This peculiarity appears to us to be his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RADICAL\">radical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. In an attempt, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> forbids the success, he seems to us to have been led into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> errors in moral theory, and to have given to his practical doctrine a dangerous taint.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> of moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> with the moral qualities which are its objects, common to Mr Bentham with many other philosophers, is much more uniform and prominent in him than in most others. This general error, already mentioned at the opening of this Dissertation, has led him more than others to assume, that because the principle of utility forms a necessary part of every moral theory, it ought therefore to be the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> of human conduct. Now it is evident that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a>, rather tacitly than avowedly made, is wholly gratuitous. No practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> can be deduced from the principle, but that we ought to cultivate those habitual dispositions which are the most effectual motives to useful actions. But before a regard to our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, or a desire to promote the welfare of men in general, be allowed to be the exclusive, or even the chief regulators of human conduct, it must be shown that they are the most effectual motives to such useful actions. It is demonstrated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> that they are not. It is even owned by the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> writers of Mr Bentham's school, that desires which are pointed to general and distant objects, although they have their proper place and their due value, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> very faint and ineffectual inducements to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. A theory founded on utility, therefore, requires that we should cultivate, as excitements to practice, those other habitual dispositions which we know by experience to be generally the source of actions beneficial to ourselves and our fellows; habits of feeling productive of habits of virtuous conduct, and in their turn strengthened by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-action of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a>.\n\nWhat is the result of experience on the choice of the objects of moral culture? Beyond all dispute, that we should labour to attain that state of mind in which all the social affections are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> with the utmost warmth, giving birth to more comprehensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, but not supplanted by it; when the moral sentiments most strongly approve what is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and good, without being perplexed by a calculation of consequences, though not incapable of being gradually rectified by reason, whenever they are decisively proved by experience not to correspond in some of their parts to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> and perpetual effects of conduct. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> representation of human nature to affirm that \"courage\" is only \"prudence.\" They coincide in their effects, and it is always prudent to be courageous. But a man who fights because he thinks it more hazardous to yield, is not brave. He does not become brave till he feels cowardice to be base and painful, and till he is no longer in need of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> from prudence. Even if it were the interest of every man to be bold, it is clear that so cold a consideration cannot prevail over the fear of danger. Where it seems to do so, it must be by the unseen power either of the fear of shame, or of some other powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, to which it lends its name. It was long ago with striking\n\n---\n\n1 See Notes and Illustrations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> V.\n2 Mr Mill's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">Analysis</a> of the Human Mind, vol. II. p. 237. It would be unjust not to say that this book, partly perhaps from a larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a>, holds out fairer opportunities of negotiation with natural feelings and the doctrines of former philosophers, than any other production of the same school. But this very assertion about courage clearly shows at least a forgetfulness that courage, even if it were the offspring of prudence, would not for that reason be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of it.\njustice observed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, that he who abstains from present gratification, under a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of its painful consequences, is only prudent, and that he must acquire a disrelish for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> on its own account, before he deserves the name of a temperate man. It is only when the means are firmly and unalterably converted into ends, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of forming the mind is completed. Courage may then seek, instead of avoiding danger. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">Temperance</a> may prefer abstemiousness to indulgence. Prudence itself may choose an orderly government of conduct, according to certain rules, without regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> in which it promotes welfare. Benevolence must desire the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of others, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of the consideration how far it is connected with that of the benevolent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>; and those alone can be accounted just who obey the dictates of justice from having thoroughly learned an habitual veneration for its strict rules and for its larger precepts. In that complete state the mind possesses no power of dissolving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of thought and feeling which impel it to action. Nothing in this argument turns on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between implanted and acquired principles. As no man can cease, by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of his, to see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, though the power of seeing it be universally acknowledged to be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a>, so no man has the power to extinguish the affections and the moral sentiments, however much they may be thought to be acquired, any more than that of eradicating the bodily appetites. The best writers of Mr Bentham's school overlook the indissolubility of these associations, and appear not to bear in mind that their strength and rapid action constitute the perfect state of a moral agent.\n\nThe pursuit of our own general welfare, or of that of mankind at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, though from their vagueness and coldness they are unfit habitual motives and unsafe ordinary guides of conduct, yet perform functions of essential importance in the moral system. The former, which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALL\">call</a> self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, preserves the balance of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> principles which regard ourselves ultimately, and contributes to subject them to the authority of the moral principles. The latter, which is general benevolence, regulates in like manner the equipoise of the narrower affections; quickens the languid, and checks the encroaching; borrows strength from pity, and even from indignation; receives some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPENSATION\">compensation</a>, as it enlarges, in the addition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, for the weakness which arises from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a>; enables us to look on all men as brethren, and overflows on every sentient being. The general interest of mankind, in truth, almost solely affects us through the affections of benevolence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a>; for the coincidence of general with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> interest, even where it is certain, is too dimly seen to produce any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a> which can impel to, or restrain from action. As a general truth, its value consists in its completing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> of morality, by demonstrating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> impossibility of forming any theory of human nature which does not preserve the superiority of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> over vice; a great, though not a directly practical advantage.\n\nThe followers of Mr Bentham have carried to an unusual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> the prevalent fault of the more modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> of utility, who have dwelt so exclusively on the outward advantages of virtue as to have lost sight of the delight which is a part of virtuous feeling, and of the beneficial influence of good actions upon the frame of the mind. \"Benevolence towards others,\" says Mr Mill, \"produces a return of benevolence from them.\" The fact is true, and ought to be stated. But how unimportant is it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with that which is passed over in silence, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of the affection itself, which, if it could become lasting and intense, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the heart into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>! No one who has ever felt kindness, if he could accurately recall his feelings, could hesitate about their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> superiority. The cause of the general neglect of this consideration is, that it is only when a gratification is something distinct from a state of mind, that we can easily learn to consider it as a pleasure. Hence the great error respecting the affections, where the inherent delight is not duly estimated, on account of that very peculiarity of being a part of a state of mind,\n\n---\n\n*See Notes and Illustrations, note W.*\n\n*Analysis of the Human Mind, vol. II.*\nwhich renders it unspeakably more valuable as independent of every thing without. The social affections are the only principles of human nature which have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> pains. To have any of these desires is to be in a state of happiness. The malevolent passions have properly no pleasures; for that attainment of their purpose which is improperly so called, consists only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEALING\">healing</a> or assuaging the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TORTURE\">torture</a> which envy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MALICE\">malice</a>, inflict on the malignant mind. It might with as much propriety be said that the toothache and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> have pleasures, because their removal is followed by an agreeable feeling. These bodily disorders, indeed, are often cured by the process which removes the suffering; but the mental distempers of envy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> are nourished by every act of odious indulgence which for a moment suspends their pain.\n\nThe same observation is applicable to every virtuous disposition, though not so obviously as to the benevolent affections. That a brave man is, on the whole, far less exposed to danger than a coward, is not the chief advantage of a courageous temper. Great dangers are rare; but the constant absence of such painful and mortifying sensations as those of fear, and the steady <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of superiority to what subdues ordinary men, are a perpetual source of inward enjoyment. No man who has ever been visited by a gleam of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a> can place any outward advantage of fortitude in comparison with the feeling of being always able fearlessly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> a righteous cause. Even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-HUMILITY\">Humility</a>, in spite of first appearances, is a remarkable example. It has of late been unwarrantably used to signify that painful consciousness of inferiority which is the first stage of envy. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> consecrated in Christian ethics to denote that disposition which, by inclining towards a modest estimate of our qualities, corrects the prevalent tendency of human nature to overvalue our merits and to overrate our claims. What can be a less doubtful or a much more considerable blessing than this constant sedative, which soothes and composes the irritable passions of vanity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>? What is more conducive to lasting peace of mind than the consciousness of proficiency in that most delicate species of equity which, in the secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>, labours to be impartial in the comparison of ourselves with others? What can so perfectly assure us of the purity of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of contemplating, not that excellence which we have reached, but that which is still to be pursued; of not considering how far we may outrun others, but how far we are from the goal?\n\nVirtue has often outward advantages, and always inward delights; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, though constant, strong, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a>, and inviolable, are not easily considered by the common observer as apart from the virtue with which they are blended. They are so subtile and evanescent as to escape the distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of all but the very few who meditate on the acts of mind. The outward advantages, on the other hand, cold, uncertain, dependent, and precarious as they are, yet stand out to the sense and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, may be handled and counted, and are perfectly on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the general apprehension. Hence they have become the almost exclusive theme of all moralists who profess to follow reason. There is room for suspecting that a very general illusion prevails on this subject. Probably the smallest part of the pleasure of virtue, because it is the most palpable, has become the sign and mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REPRESENTATIVE\">representative</a> of the whole. The outward and visible sign suggests insensibly the inward and mental delight. Those who display the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> benefits of magnanimity and kindness, would speak with far less fervour, and perhaps less confidence, if their feelings were not unconsciously affected by the mental state which they overlook in their statements, though they feel some part of it when they write or speak on it. When they speak of\n\n---\n\n1 According to Cicero's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of fortitude, \"Virtus pugnans pro aquitato.\" The remains of the original sense of Virtus, Manhood, give a beauty and force to these expressions, which cannot be preserved in our language. The Greek \u0391\u03b3\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, and the German Tugend, originally denoted Strength, afterwards Courage, and at last Virtue. But the happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DERIVATION\">derivation</a> of Virtus from Vir gives an energy to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> of Cicero, which illustrates the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of a skilful writer.\n\n2 Mr Mill's Analysis of the Human Mind, vol. II. p. 222.\n\n3 For a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of vanity, by a great orator, see the Rev. R. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>'s Sermon on Modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFIDELITY\">Infidelity</a>.\nwhat is without, they feel what was within, and their words excite the same feeling in others.\n\nIs it not probable that much of our love of praise may be thus ascribed to humane and sociable pleasure in the sympathy of others with us? Praise is the symbol which represents sympathy, and which the mind insensibly substitutes for it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> and in language. Does not the desire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a> fame, in like manner, manifest an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> for the fellow-feeling of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, when it is perfectly unproductive of any advantage to ourselves? In this point of view, it may be considered as the passion of which the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> proves the mighty power of disinterested desire. Every other pleasure from sympathy is confined to the men who are now alive. The love of fame alone seeks the sympathy of unborn generations, and stretches the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> which binds the race of man together, to an extent to which hope sets no bounds. There is a noble, even if unconscious, union of morality with genius in the mind of him who sympathizes with the masters who lived twenty centuries before him, in order that he may learn to command the sympathies of the countless generations who are to come.\n\nIn the most familiar, as well as in the highest instances, it would seem, that the inmost thoughts and sentiments of men are more pure than their language. Those who speak of \"a regard to character,\" if they be serious, generally infuse into that word, unawares, a large portion of that sense in which it denotes the frame of the mind. Those who speak of \"honour\" very often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> a more refined and delicate sort of conscience, which ought to render the more educated classes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> alive to such smaller wrongs as the laborious and the ignorant can scarcely feel. What heart does not warm at the noble exclamation of the ancient poet: \"Who is pleased by false honour, or frightened by lying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFAMY\">infamy</a>, but he who is false and depraved?\" Every uncorrupted mind feels unmerited praise as a bitter reproach, and regards a consciousness of demerit as a drop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> in the cup of honour. How different is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> which truly delights us all, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the consciences of others are in harmony with our own! \"What,\" says Cicero, \"is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> but the concurring praise of the good, the unbought approbation of those who judge aright of excellent virtue?\" A far greater than Cicero rises from the purest praise of man, to more sublime contemplations.\n\nFame is no plant that grows on mortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>,\nBut lives and spreads aloft, by those pure eyes\nAnd perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a> of all-judging Jove.\n\nThose who have most inculcated the doctrine of utility have given another notable example of the very vulgar prejudice which treats the unseen as insignificant. Tucker is the only one of them who occasionally considers that most important effect of human conduct which consists in its action on the frame of the mind, by fitting its faculties and sensibilities for their appointed purpose. A razor or a penknife would well enough cut cloth or meat; but if they were often so used, they would be entirely spoiled. The same sort of observation is much more strongly applicable to habitual dispositions, which, if they be spoiled, we have no certain means of replacing or mending. Whatever act, therefore, decomposes the moral machinery of mind, is more injurious to the welfare of the agent than most disasters from without can be; for the latter are commonly limited and temporary; the evil of the former spreads through the whole of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">Health</a> of mind, as well as of body, is not only productive in itself of a greater sum of enjoyment than arises from other sources, but is the only condition of our frame in which we are capable of receiving pleasure from without. Hence it appears how incredibly absurd it is to prefer, on grounds of calculation, a present interest to the preservation of those mental habits on which our wellbeing depends. When they are most moral, they may often prevent us from obtaining advantages. It would be as absurd to desire to lower them for that reason, as it would be to weaken the body, lest its strength should render it more liable to contagious disorders of rare occurrence.\n\nIt is, on the other hand, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to combine the benefit of the general habit with the advantages of occasional deviation; for every such deviation either produces remorse, or weakens the habit, and prepares the way for its gradual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>. He who obtains a fortune by the undetected forgery of a will, may indeed be\nhonest in his other acts; but if he had such a scorn of fraud before as he must himself allow to be generally useful, he must suffer a severe punishment from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTRITION\">contrition</a>; and he will be haunted with the fears of one who has lost his own security for his good conduct. In all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, if they be well examined, his loss by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a> of his mental frame will outweigh the profits of his vice.\n\nBy repeating the like observation on similar occasions, it will be manifest that the infirmity of recollection, aggravated by the defects of language, gives an appearance of more selfishness to man than truly belongs to his nature; and that the effect of active agents upon the habitual state of mind, one of the considerations to which the epithet \"sentimental\" has of late been applied in derision, is really among the most serious and reasonable objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a>. When the internal pleasures and pains which accompany good and bad feelings, or rather form a part of them, and the internal advantages and disadvantages which follow good and bad actions, are sufficiently considered, the comparative importance of outward consequences will be more and more narrowed; so that the Stoical philosopher may be thought almost excusable for rejecting it altogether, were it not an indispensably necessary consideration for those in whom right habits of feeling are not sufficiently strong. They alone are happy, or even truly virtuous, who have little need of it.\n\nThe later moralists who adopt the principle of utility, have so misplaced it, that in their hands it has as great a tendency as any theoretical error can have, to lessen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> pleasure of virtue, and to unfit our habitual feelings for being the most effectual inducements to good conduct. This is the natural tendency of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> which brings utility too closely and frequently into contact with action. By this habit, in its best state, an essentially weaker motive is gradually substituted for others which must always be of more force. The frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to utility as the standard of action tends to introduce an uncertainty with respect to the conduct of other men, which would render all intercourse insupportable. It affords also so fair a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> for selfish and malignant passions, as often to hide their nature from him who is their prey. Some taint of these mean and evil principles will at least creep in, and by their venom give an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a> not its own to the cold desire of utility. The moralists who take an active part in those affairs which often call out unamiable passions, ought to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> with peculiar watchfulness against such self-delusions. The sin that must most easily beset them, is that of sliding from general to particular consequences,\u2014that of trying single actions, instead of dispositions, habits, and rules, by the standard of utility,\u2014that of authorizing too great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> and policy in moral conduct,\u2014that of readily allowing exceptions to the most important rules,\u2014that of too lenient a censure of the use of doubtful means when the end seems to them good,\u2014and that of believing unphilosophically, as well as dangerously, that there can be any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> or scheme so useful to the world as the existence of men who would not do a base thing for any public advantage. It was said of Andrew Fletcher, \"he would lose his life to serve his country, but would not do a base thing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> it.\" Let those preachers of utility who suppose that such a man sacrifices ends to means, consider whether the scorn of baseness be not akin to the contempt of danger, and whether a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> composed of such men would not be invincible. But theoretical principles are counteracted by a thousand causes, which confine their mischief as well as circumscribe their benefits. Men are never so good or so bad as their opinions. All that can be with reason apprehended is, that they may always produce some part of their natural evil, and that the mischief will be greatest among the many who seek excuses for these passions. Aristippus found in the Socratic representation of the union of virtue and happiness a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> for sensuality; and many Epicureans became voluptuaries in spite of the example of their master; easily dropping by degrees the limitations by which he guarded his doctrines. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as a man accustoms himself to be influenced by the utility of particular acts, without regard to rules, he approaches to the casuistry of the Jesuits, and to the practical maxims of Caesar Borgia.\n\nInjury on this as on other occasions has been\nsuffered by Ethics, from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to Jurisprudence. The true and eminent merit of Mr Bentham is that of a reformer of jurisprudence. He is only a moralist with a view to being a jurist; and he sometimes becomes for a few hurried moments a metaphysician with a view to laying the foundation of both the moral sciences. Both he and his followers have treated Ethics too juridically. They do not seem to be aware, or at least they do not bear constantly in mind, that there is an essential difference in the subjects of these two sciences.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of law is the prevention of actions injurious to the community. It considers the dispositions from which they flow only indirectly, to ascertain the likelihood of their recurrence, and thus to determine the necessity and the means of preventing them. The direct object of Ethics is only mental disposition. It considers actions indirectly as the signs by which such dispositions are manifested. If it were possible for the mere moralist to see that a moral and amiable temper was the mental source of a bad action, he could not cease to approve and love the temper, as we sometimes presume to suppose may be true of the judgments of the Searcher of Hearts. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RELIGION\">Religion</a> necessarily coincides with morality in this respect; and it is the peculiar distinction of Christianity that it places the seat of virtue in the heart. Law and Ethics are necessarily so much blended, that in many intricate combinations the distinction becomes obscure. But in all strong cases the difference is evident. Thus, law punishes the most sincerely repentant; but wherever the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> of the penitent can be thought to be thoroughly purified, religion and morality receive him with open arms.\n\nIt is needless, after these remarks, to observe, that those whose habitual contemplation is directed to the rules of action, are likely to underrate the importance of feeling and disposition; an error of very unfortunate consequences, since the far greater part of human actions flow from these neglected sources; while the law interposes only in cases which may be called exceptions, which are now rare, and ought to be less frequent.\n\nThe coincidence of Mr Bentham's school with the ancient Epicureans in the disregard of the pleasures of taste and of the arts dependent on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, is a proof both of the inevitable adherence of much of the popular sense of the words \"interest\" and \"pleasure,\" to the same words in their philosophical acceptation, and of the pernicious influence of narrowing \"utility\" to mere visible and tangible objects, to the exclusion of those which form the larger part of human enjoyment.\n\nThe mechanical philosophers who, under Descartes and Gassendi, began to reform Physics in the seventeenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, attempted to explain all the appearances of nature by an immediate reference to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of particles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> impelling each other in various directions, and with unequal force, but in all other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> alike. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> by impulse they conceived to be perfectly simple and intelligible. It never occurred to them, that the movement of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> when another is driven against it, is a fact of which no explanation can be given which will amount to more than a statement of its constant occurrence. That no body can act where it is not, appeared to them as self-evident as that the whole is equal to all the parts. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a> they understood that no body moves another without touching it. They did not perceive, that it was only self-evident where it means that no body can act where it has not the power of acting; and that if it be understood more largely, it is a mere assumption of the proposition on which their whole system rested.\n\nSir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton reformed Physics, not by simplifying that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, but by rendering it much more complicated. He introduced into it the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a>, of which he ascertained many laws, but which even he did not dare to represent as being as intelligible and as conceivably ultimate as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPULSION\">impulsion</a> itself. It was necessary for Laplace to introduce intermediate laws, and to calculate disturbing forces, before the phenomena of the heavenly bodies could be reconciled even to Newton's more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> theory. In the present state of physical and chemical knowledge, a man who should attempt to refer all the immense variety of facts to the simple impulse of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CARTESIANS\">Cartesians</a>, would have no chance of serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of laws augments with the progress of knowledge. The\nspeculations of the followers of Mr Bentham are not unlike the unsuccessful attempt of the Cartesians. Mr Mill, for example, derives the whole theory of Government from the single fact, that every man pursues his interest when he knows it; which he assumes to be a sort of self-evident practical principle, if such a phrase be not contradictory. That a man's pursuing the interest of another, or indeed any other object in nature, is just as conceivable as that he should pursue his own interest, is a proposition which seems never to have occurred to this acute and ingenious writer. Nothing, however, can be more certain than its truth, if the term \"interest\" be employed in its proper sense of general wellbeing, which is the only acceptation in which it can serve the purpose of his arguments. If, indeed, the term be employed to denote the gratification of a predominant desire, his proposition is self-evident, but wholly unserviceable in his argument; for it is clear that individuals and multitudes often desire what they know to be most inconsistent with their general welfare. A nation, as much as an individual, and sometimes more, may not only mistake its interest, but, perceiving it clearly, may prefer the gratification of a strong passion to it. The whole fabric of his political reasoning seems to be overthrown by this single observation; and instead of attempting to explain the immense variety of political facts by the simple principle of a contest of interests, we are reduced to the necessity of once more referring them to that variety of passions, habits, opinions, and prejudices, which we discover only by experience. Mr Mill's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">Education</a> affords another example of the inconvenience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAPING\">leaping</a> at once from the most general laws, to a multiplicity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> appearances. Having assumed, or at least inferred from insufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a>, that the intellectual and moral character is entirely formed by circumstances, he proceeds, in the latter part of the essay, as if it were a necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of that doctrine that we might easily acquire the power of combining and directing circumstances in such a manner as to produce the best possible character. Without disputing for the present the theoretical proposition, let us consider what would be the reasonableness of similar expectations in a more easily intelligible case. The general theory of the winds is pretty well understood; we know that they proceed from the rushing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> from those portions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> which are more condensed, into those which are more rarefied; but how great a chasm is there between that simple law and the great variety of facts which experience teaches us respecting winds! The constant winds between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-TROPICS\">tropics</a> are large and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> enough to be in some measure capable of explanation; but who can tell why, in variable climates, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blows to-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, to-morrow from the west? Who can foretell what its shifting and variations are to be? Who can account for a tempest on one day, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> on another? Even if we could foretell the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and infinite variations, how far might we not still be from the power of combining and guiding their causes? No man but the lunatic in the story of Rasselas ever dreamt that he could command the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. The difficulty plainly consists in the multiplicity and minuteness of the circumstances which act on the atmosphere. Are those which influence the formation of the human character likely to be less minute and multiplied?\n\nThe style of Mr Bentham underwent a more remarkable revolution than perhaps befell that of any other celebrated writer. In his early works, it was clear, free, spirited, often and seasonably eloquent. Many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of his later writings retain the inimitable stamp of genius; but he seems to have been oppressed by the vastness of his projected works,\u2014to have thought that he had no longer more than leisure to preserve the heads of them,\u2014to have been impelled by a fruitful mind to new plans before he had completed the old. In this state of things, he\n\n---\n\n1 Essay on Government, originally printed in the Supplement to the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n2 The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of reasoning has been adopted by the writer of a late criticism on Mr Mill's Essay. See Edinburgh Review, No. 97, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1829.\n3 In the Supplement to the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\ngradually ceased to use words for conveying his thoughts to others, but merely employed them as a short-hand to preserve his meaning for his own purpose. It was no wonder that his language should thus become obscure and repulsive. Though many of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> terms are in themselves exact and pithy, yet the overflow of his vast nomenclature was enough to darken his whole diction.\n\nIt was at this critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> that the arrangement and translation of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> were undertaken by M. Dumont, a generous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a>, who devoted a genius formed for original and lasting works, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> the principles and promote the fame of his master. He whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> Mirabeau did not disdain to borrow,\u2014who, in the same school with Romilly, had studiously pursued the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> as well as the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>,\u2014was perfectly qualified to strip of its uncouthness a philosophy which he understood and admired. As he wrote in a general language, he propagated its doctrines throughout Europe, where they were beneficial to jurisprudence, but perhaps injurious to the cause of reformation in government. That they became more popular abroad than at home, is partly to be ascribed to the taste and skill of M. Dumont; partly to that tendency towards free speculation and bold reform which was more prevalent among nations newly freed, or impatiently aspiring to freedom, than in a people long satisfied with the possession of a system of government like that which others were struggling to obtain, and not yet aware of the imperfections and abuses in their laws, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMENDMENT\">amendment</a> of which a cautious consideration of Mr Bentham's works will undoubtedly most materially contribute.","sp":602,"ep":612},{"h":"JONATHAN EDWARDS","t":"This remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, the metaphysician of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, was formed among the Calvinists of New England, when their stern doctrine retained its rigorous authority.

He can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> only from regard to himself, and his end in creation can only be to manifest his whole nature, which is called acting for his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>.\n\nAs far as Edwards confines himself to created beings, and while his theory is perfectly intelligible, it coincides with that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> benevolence, hereafter to be considered. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> being is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> encumbrance, which serves indeed to give it a mysterious outside, but brings with it from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> nothing except their obscurity. He was betrayed into it by the cloak which it threw over his really unmeaning assertion or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a>, that there are degrees of existence; without which that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> which relates to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a> would have appeared to be as baseless as it really is. When we try such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> by applying it to matters within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, we see that it means nothing but degrees of certain faculties and powers. But the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of the term being to all things, shows that the least perfect has as much being as the most perfect; or rather that there can be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, so far as that word is concerned, between two things to which it is alike applicable. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> proportion on which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> virtue is made to depend, is capable of being tried by an easy test. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> we suppose the greatest of evil spirits to have a hundred times the bad passions of Marcus Aurelius, and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a> a hundred times his faculties, or, in Edwards's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, a hundred times his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of being, it follows from this moral theory, that we ought to esteem and love the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a> exactly in the same degree as we esteem and love Marcus Aurelius.\n\nThe chief circumstance which justifies so much being said on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> two writers, is their concurrence in a point towards which Ethical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a> had been slowly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a>, from the time of the controversies raised up by Hobbes. They both indicate the increase of this tendency, by introducing an element into their theory, foreign from those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> systems of ethical abstraction, with which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in other respects to have much in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>. Malebranche makes virtue consist in the love of order, Edwards in the love of being. In this language we perceive a step beyond the representation of Clarke, which made it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> to the relations of things; but a step which cannot be made without passing into a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>;\u2014without confessing, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the word love, that not only perception and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a> and sentiment, are among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> principles of morals.

I extract also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of the manner in which an historian may state a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> dispute which has influenced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> affairs; but far more because it is an unparalleled example of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a> and forbearance in the narrative of a contest of which the historian was himself a victim.\n\n\"Habuit hic annus (1608) haud spernendi quoque mali semina, vix ut arma desierant, exorto publice religionis dissidio, latentibus initis, sed ut paulatim in majus crumeret. Lugduni sacras literas docebat viri eruditione prestantes Gomarus et Arminius, quorum ille \u00e6terna Dei lege fixum memorabat, cui hominum salus destinaretur, quis in exitium tenderet; inde alios ad pietatem trahi, et tractos custodiri ne elabantur; reliqui alios communi humanitatis vitio et suis crimibus involutos: hic vero <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CONTRA\">contra</a> integram judicem, sed eundem optimum patrem, id reorum fecisse discrimen, ut peccandi pert\u00e6sis fiduciamque in Christum reponentibus veniam ac vitam daret, contumacibus poenam; Deoque gratum, ut omnes resipiscant, ac meliora edocti retineant; sed cogi neminem. Accusatabantque invicem; Arminius Gomaram, quod peccandi causas Deo ascriberet, ac fati persuasione teneret immobiles animos; Gomarus Arminium, quod longius ipsis Romanensium scitis hominem arrogantia impleret, nec patetur soli Deo acceptam ferri, rem maximam, bonam mentem. Constat his quies cura legere veterum libros, antiquos Christianorum tribuisse hominum voluntati vim liberam, tam in acceptanda, quam in retinenda disciplina; unde sua praemiis ac suppliciis aquitas. Neque idem tamen omisere cuncta divinam ad bonitatem referre, cujus munere salutare semen ad nos pervenisset, ac cujus singulari auxilio pericula nostra indigerent. Primus omnium Augustinus, ex quo ipsi cum Pelagio et eum secutis certamen (nam <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANTE\">ante</a> aliter et ipse senserat), acer disputandi, ita libertatis vocem reliquere, ut ei decreta quedam Dei praeponeret, quae vim ipsam destruere videbantur. At per Graeciam quidem Asiamque retenta vetus illa ae simplicior sententia. Per occidentem magnum Augustini nomen multos traxit in consensum, repertis tamen per Galliam et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALIBI\">alibi</a> qui se opponerent. Posterioribus s\u00e6cu-\nlis, cum schola non alio magis quam Augustino doctore uteretur, quis ipsi sensus, quis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEXTER\">dexter</a> pugnare visa conciliandi modus, diu inter Francisci et Dominici familiae disputato, doctissimi Jesuitarum, cum exactiori subtilitate nodum solvere laborassent, Romae accusati regre damnationem effugerent. At Protestantium princeps, Lutherus, egressus monasterio quod Augustini ut nomen, ita sensus sequebatur, parte Augustini arrepta, id quod est reliquerat, libertatis nomen, coepit excendere; quod tam <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> Erasmo visum, ut cum cetera ipsius aut probaret aut silentio transmitteret, hic objicat sese: cujus argumentis motus Philippus Melanchthon, Lutheri adjutor, quae prius scripserat immutavit, auctorique fuit Luthero, quod multi volunt, certe quod constat Lutheranis, deserendi decreta rigida et conditionem respuentia; sic tamen ut libertatis vocabulum quam rem magis perhorrescere. At in altera Protestantium parte dux Calvinus, primis Lutheri dictis in hac controversia inhaerescens, novis ea fulsit praesidiis, addiditique intactum Augustino, veram ae salutarem fidem rem esse perpetuam et amitti nesciam: cujus proinde qui sibi essent consci, eos aeternae felicitatis jam nunc certos esse, quos <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTERIM\">interim</a> in crimina, quantumvis gravis, prolabi posse non diffitebatur. Auxit sententiae rigorem Genevae Beza, per Germaniam Zanchius, Ursinus, Piscator, saepe eo usque provecti, ut, quod alii anxie vitaverant, apertius nonnunquam tradere, etiam peccandi necessitatem a prima causa pendere: quae ampla Lutheranis criminandi materia.\u201d (H. Grotti Hist. lib. xvii. p. 552.)\n\nNote C, p. 309.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALVINISM\">Calvinism</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> rather Augustinianism, of Aquinas, is placed beyond all doubt by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>:\u2014\u201cPr\u00e6destinatio est causa gratiae et gloriae.\u201d (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OPERA\">Opera</a>, VII. 356, edit. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. 1664.)\n\u201cNumerus pr\u00e6destinatorum certus est.\u201d (Ibid. 363.)\n\u201cPr\u00e6scientia meritorum nullo modo est causa pr\u00e6destinationis divinis.\u201d (Ibid. 370.)\n\u201cLiberrum arbitrium est facultas qua bonum eligitur, gratia assistente, vel malum, eadem desistente.\u201d (Ibid. VIII. 222.)\n\n\u201cDeus inclinat ad bonum administrando virtutem agendi et monendo ad bonum. Sed ad malum dicitur inclinare in quantum gratiam non praebet, per quam aliquis a malo retrahere tur.\u201d (Ibid. 364.)\n\nOn the other side:\n\u201cAccipitur <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FIDES\">fides</a> pro eo quo creditur, et est virtus, et pro eo quo creditur, et non est virtus. Fides qua creditur, si cum caritate sit, virtus est.\u201d (Ibid. IX. 236.)\n\n\u201cDivina bonitas est primum principium communicationis totius quam Deus creaturis largitur.\u201d\n\u201cQuamvis omne quod Deus vult justum sit, non tamen ex hoc justum dicitur quod Deus illud vult.\u201d (Ibid. 697.)\n\nNote D, p. 309.\n\nThe Augustinian doctrine is, with some hesitation and reluctance, acquiesced in by Scotus, in that milder form which ascribes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> to an express <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a>, and considers the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of mankind as only left to the deserved penalties of their transgressions. \u201cIn hujus questionis solutione mallem alios audire quam docere.\u201d (Scotii Opera, V. 1329. Lugd. 1639.) This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> is foreign from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DOGMATICAL\">dogmatical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of a Schoolman; and these qualities are still more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> in the very remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> which he applies to the tremendous doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REPROBATION\">reprobation</a>. \u201cEorum autem non miseretur (sic. Deus) quibus gratiam non praebendam esse aquilate occultissima et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> humanis sensibus remotissima judicat.\u201d (Ibid. 1329.) In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> on Scotus which follows, it appears that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> Ockham disputed very freely against the opinions of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>. \u201cMala fieri bonum est\u201d is a startling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a>, quoted by Scotus from Augustin. (Ibid. 1381.) It appears that Ockham <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between election and reprobation, and considered those who embraced only the former as at variance with themselves. (Ibid. 1313.)\n\nScotus, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, contends that our thoughts (consequently our opinions) are not subject to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a>. (VI. 1054\u20131056.) One step more would have led him to acknowledge that all erroneous judgment is involuntary, and there-\nfore inculpable and unpunishable, however pernicious.\n\nHis attempt to reconcile foreknowledge with contingency (V. 1309\u20131327), is a remarkable example of the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> subtlety to keep up the appearance of a struggle where it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to make one real effort.\n\nBut the most dangerous of all the deviations of Scotus from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of Aquinas is, that he opened the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and wrong depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> will of the Eternal Mind. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> power of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, according to him, extends to all but contradictions. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> power (ordinata) is exercised conformably to an order established by himself; \"si placet voluntati, sub qua <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIBERA\">libera</a> est, recta est lex.\" (Scot. V. 1368, et seq.)\n\nNote E, p. 309.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> is quoted on this subject by Marcus Aurelius, in a manner which shows, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> there had been any doubt, the meaning to be, that all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> is involuntary.\n\nAugustin closes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> line of ancient testimony to the involuntary character of error: \"Quis est qui velit decipi? Fallere nolunt boni; falli autem nec boni volunt nec mali.\" (Aug. Serm. de Verbo.)\n\nNote F, p. 310.\n\nFrom a long, able, and instructive dissertation by the commentator on Scotus, it appears that this immoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOGMA\">dogma</a> was propounded in terms more bold and startling by Ockham, who openly affirmed, that \"moral evil was only evil because it was prohibited.\" \"Ockhamus, qui putat quod nihil posset esse malum sine voluntate prohibitive Dei, haneque voluntatem esse liberam; sic ut posset eam non habere, et consequenter ut posset fieri quod nul-\n\nla prorsus essent mala.\" (Scot. VII. p. 859.)\n\nBut, says the commentator, \"Dico primo legem naturalem non consistere in jussione ulla que sit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTUS\">actus</a> voluntatis Dei. Haec est communissima theologorum sententia.\" (Scot. VII. p. 858.)\n\nAnd indeed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> urged against Ockham completely justifies this approach to unanimity. \"For,\" he asks, \"why is it right to obey the will of God? Is it because our moral faculties perceive it to be right? But they equally perceive and feel the authority of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> principles of morality; and if this answer be made, it is obvious that those who make it do in effect admit the independence of moral distinctions on the will of God.\"\n\n\"If God,\" said Ockham, \"had commanded his creatures to hate himself, hatred of God would have been praiseworthy.\" (Domin. Soto de Justitia et Jure, lib. ii. quest. 3, \"Utrum precepta Decalogi sint dispensabilia;\" a book dedicated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Carlos, the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> II.) Suarez, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCHOLASTIC\">scholastic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, rejected the Ockhamical doctrine, but allowed will to be a part of the foundation of morality. \"Voluntas Dei non est tota <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> bonitatis aut mali\u00e6.\" (Suarez de Legibus, lib. ii. 66, p. 71. edit. Lond. 1679.)\n\nAs the great majority of the Schoolmen supported their opinion of this subject by the consideration of eternal and immutable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of right and wrong in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>, it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOMINALISTS\">Nominalists</a>, of whom Ockham was the founder, who rejected all general ideas, should also have rejected those moral distinctions which were then supposed to originate in such ideas. Gerson was a celebrated Nominalist; and he was the more disposed to follow the opinions of his master, because they agreed in maintaining the independence of the State on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a>, and the superiority of the Church over the Pope.\n\nNote G, p. 310.\n\nIt must be premised that Charitas among the ancient divines corresponded with \u0395\u1f30\u03c3\u03af\u03c2 of the Platonists, and with the \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1 of later philosophers, as comprehending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of all that is lovable in the Creator or his creatures. It is the theological <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>, and corre-\nsponds with no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> moralists. \"Cum objectum amoris sit bonum, dupliciter potest aliquis tendere in bonum aliquius rei; uno modo, quod bonum illius rei ad alterum referat, sicut amat quis vinnum in quantum dulcedinem vini peropit; et hic amor vocatur a quibusdam amor concupiscentiae. Amor autem iste non terminatur ad rem qua dicitur amari, sed reflectitur ad rem illam cui optatur bonum illius rei. Alio modo amor fortior in bonum aliquius rei, ita quod ad rem ipsam TERMINATUR; et hic est amor benevolentiae. Qua bonum nostrum in Deo perfectum est, sic ut in causa universali bonorum; ideo bonum in ipso esse magis naturaliter complacet quam in nobis ipsis: et ideo etiam amore amicitiae naturaliter Deus ab homine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PLUS\">plus</a> seipso dilitur.\"\n\nThe above quotations from Aquinas will probably be sufficient for those who are acquainted with these questions, and they will certainly be thought too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> by those who are not. In the next question he inquires, whether in the love of God there can be any view to reward. He appears to consider himself as bound by authority to answer in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATIVE\">affirmative</a>; and he employs much ingenuity in reconciling a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of reward with the disinterested character ascribed by him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with all the affections which terminate in other beings.\n\n\"Nihil aliud est merces nostra quam perfraui Deo. Ergo caritas non solum non excludit, sed etiam facit habere oculum ad mercedem.\" In this answer he seems to have anticipated the representations of Jeremy Taylor (Sermon on Growth in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">Grace</a>); of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SHAFTESBURY\">Shaftesbury</a> (Inquiry concerning Virtue, book i. part iii. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. 3); of Mr T. Erskine (Freeness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOSPEL\">Gospel</a>, Edinb. 1828); and more especially of Mr John Smith (Discourses, Lond. 1660). No extracts could convey a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the observations which follow, unless they were accompanied by a longer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> language of the Schoolmen than would be warranted on this occasion. It is clear that he distinguishes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WELL\">well</a> the affection of piety from the happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, which, as he cautiously expresses it, \"are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of a reward,\" just as the consideration of the pleasures and advantages of friendship may enter into the affection and strengthen it, though they are not its objects, and never could inspire such a feeling. It seems to me also that he had a dimmer view of another doctrine, by which we are taught, that though our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> be not the end which we pursue in loving others, yet it may be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> cause of the insertion of disinterested affections into the nature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. \"Ponere mercedem aliquam finem amoris ex parte amati, est contra rationem amicitiae. Sed ponere mercedem esse finem amoris ex parte amantis, non tamen ultimum, prout scilicet ipse amor est quadam operatione amantis, non est contra rationem amicitiae. Possim operationem amoris amare propter aliquid aliud, salva amicitia. Poteat habeas charitatem habere oculum ad mercedem, uti ponat beatitudinem creatam finem amoris, non autem finem amati.\" Upon the last words my interpretation chiefly depends. The immediately preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> must be owned to have been founded on a distinction between viewing the good fruits of our own affections as enhancing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> pleasures, and feeling love for another on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the advantage to be derived from him; which last is inconceivable.\n\nNOTE H, p. 310.\n\n\"Potestas spiritualis et secularis utraque deducitur a potestate divina; ideo in tantum secularis est sub spirituali, in quantum est a Deo supposita; scilicet, in his quae ad salutem animae pertinent. In his autem quae ad bonum civile spectant, est magis obediendum potestati seculari; sic ut illud Matthaei, 'Reddite quae sunt Caesaris Cesari.'\" What follows is more doubtful. \"Nisi forte potestati spirituali etiam potestas secularis conjungatur, ut in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PAPA\">Papa</a>, qui utriusque potestatis apicem tenet.\" (VIII.435.) Here, says the French editor, it may be doubted whether Aquinas means the Pope's temporal power in his own dominions, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> authority indirectly extending over all for the sake of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. My reasons for adopting the more rational <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> are shortly these:\u20141. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXT\">text</a> of Matthew is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> an assertion of the independence of both powers, that it would be the height of extravagance to quote it as an authority for the dependence of the state. At\nmost it could only be represented as reconcilable with such a dependence in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>.\n\n2. The word *forte* seems manifestly to refer to the territorial sovereignty acquired by the Popes. If they have a general power in secular affairs, it must be because it is necessary to their spiritual authority; and in that case to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALL\">call</a> it fortuitous would be to ascribe to it an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADJUNCT\">adjunct</a> destructive of its nature. 3. His former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> on the same question seems to be decisive. The power of the Pope over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, he says, is not founded merely in his superior nature, but in their authority being altogether derived from his, as the proconsular power from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a>. Therefore he infers that this case is not analogous to the relation between the civil and spiritual power, which are alike derived from God. 4. Had an Italian monk of the twelfth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> really intended to affirm the Pope's temporal authority, he probably would have laid it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in terms more explicit and more acceptable at Rome. Hesitation and ambiguity are here indications of unbelief. Mere veneration for the apostolical see might present a more precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> against it, as it caused the quotation which follows, respecting the primacy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>. (*Aquin. Opera*, VIII. 434, 435.)\n\nA mere abridgement of these very curious passages might excite a suspicion that I had tinctured Aquinas unconsciously with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of my own opinions. Extracts are very difficult, from the scholastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of stating objections and answers, as well as from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of theological authorities with philosophical reasons.\n\n**Note I**, p. 312.\n\nThe debates in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a> (1546), between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOMINICANS\">Dominicans</a> who adhered to Aquinas, and the Franciscans who followed Scotus on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> sin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a>, and grace, are to be found in Fra Paolo, *Istoria del Concilio Tridentino*, lib. ii. They show how much metaphysical controversy is hid in a theological form, how many disputes of our times are of no very ancient origin, and how strongly the whole western church, through all the divisions into which it has been separated, has manifested the same unwillingness to avow the Augustinian system, and the same fear of contradicting it. To his admirably clear and short statement of these abstruse controversies, must be added that of his accomplished opponent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Pallavicino (lib. vii. and viii.), who shows still more evidently the strength of the Augustinian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a>, and the disposition of the Council to tolerate opinions almost Lutheran, if not accompanied by revolt from the Church. A little more compromising disposition in the Reformers might have betrayed reason to a prolonged thraldom. We must esteem Erasmus and Melanchthon, but we should reserve our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a> and Calvin. The Scotists maintained their doctrine of merit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONGRUITY\">congruity</a>, waived by the Council, and soon after condemned by the Church of England; by which they meant that they who had good dispositions always received the divine grace, not indeed as a reward of which they were worthy, but as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> which they were fit and willing to receive.

(See a criticism on Mr Stewart's\nDissertation, Edinb. Review, XXXVI. 255.)\nMore careful reflection has corrected a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>\ncommon to him with most writers on the sub-\nject. What is called Sublapsarian Calvinism,\nwhich was the doctrine of the most eminent\nmen, including Augustin and Calvin himself,\nascribed to God, and to man before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, what\nis called free-will, which they even own still to\nexist in all the ordinary acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, though it\nbe lost with respect to religious morality. The\ndecree of election, on this scheme, arises from\nGod's foreknowledge that man was to fall, and\nthat all men became thereby with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> liable\nto eternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. The election of some to\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of divine goodness, and the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRETERITION\">preterition</a> of the rest was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> and justice.\n\nThis sublapsarian predestination is evidently irreconcilable with the doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, which considers free-will, or volitions not caused by motives, as absolutely inconsistent with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of an intelligent being, which is, that he acts from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a>, or, in other words, with a purpose.\n\nThe supralapsarian scheme, which represents the fall itself as fore-ordained, may indeed be built on necessitarian principles. But on that scheme original sin seems wholly to lose that importance which the former system gives it as a revolution in the state of the world, requiring an interposition of divine power to remedy a part of its fatal effects. It becomes no more than the first link in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of predestined offences. Yet both Catholic and Protestant predestinarians have borrowed the arguments and distinctions of philosophical necessitarians.\n\nOne of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> of Jansenius, condemned by the bull of Innocent X. in 1653, is, that \"to merit or demerit in a state of lapsed nature, it is not necessary that there should be in man a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> free from necessity; it is sufficient that there be a liberty free from constraint.\" (Dupin, Histoire de l'\u00c9glise en abr\u00e9g\u00e9, si\u00e8cle xvii, livre iv, chap. viii, p. 193.) Luther, in his once famous treatise de Servo Arbitrio against Erasmus (printed in 1526), expresses himself as follows: \"Hic est fidei summus gradus, credere illum esse elementem qui tam paucos salvat, tam multos damnat; credere justum qui sua voluntate nos necessario damnabiles facit, ut videatur, ut Erasmus refert, delectari cruciatiibus miserorum, et odio potius quam amore dignus.\" My <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of this stern and abusive book is not paged. In another passage, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a> the distinction between co-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> and necessity as familiar a hundred and thirty years before it was proposed by Hobbes, or condemned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JANSENISTS\">Jansenists</a>. \"Necessario dico, non coacte, sed, ut illi dicunt, necessitate immutabilitatis, non coactionis; hoc est, homo, cum vocat Spiritus Dei, non quidem violentia, velut raptus obtorto collo, nolens facit malum, quemadmodum fur aut latro nolens ad penam ducitur, sed sponte et libera voluntate facit.\" He uses also the illustration of Hobbes, from the difference between a stream forced out of its course and freely flowing in its channel.\n\nNote P, p. 352.\n\nThough some parts of the substance of the following letter have already appeared in various forms, perhaps the account of Mr Hume's illness, in the words of his friend and physician Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>, will be acceptable to many readers. I owe it to the kindness of Mrs Baillie, who had the goodness to copy it from the original, in the collection of her late learned and excellent husband, Dr Baillie. Some portion of what has been formerly published I do not think it necessary to reprint.\n\nFrom Dr Cullen to Dr Hunter.\n\n\"My Dear Friend,\u2014I was favoured with yours by Mr Halket on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a>, and have answered some part of it by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> whom I was otherwise obliged to write by; but as I was not certain how soon that might come to your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, I did not answer your postscript; in doing which, if I can oblige you, a part of the merit must be that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> being early, and I therefore give it you as soon as I possibly could. You desire an account of Mr Hume's last days, and I give it you with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; for though I could not look upon him in his illness without much concern, yet the tranquillity and pleasantry which he constantly discovered did even then give me satisfaction, and, now that the curtain is dropped, allows me to indulge the less allayed reflection. He was truly an example des grands hommes qui sont morts en plaisantant....For many weeks before his death he was very sensible of his gradual decay; and his answer to inquiries after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> was, several times, that he was going as fast as his enemies could wish, and as easily as his friends could desire. He was not, however, without a frequent recurrence of pain and uneasiness; but he passed most part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>-room, admitted the visits of his friends, and, with his usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>, conversed with them upon literature, politics, or whatever else was accidentally started. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> he seemed to be per-\nfectly at ease, and to the last abounded with that pleasantry; and those curious and entertaining anecdotes, which ever distinguished him. This, however, I always considered rather as an effort to be agreeable; and he at length acknowledged that it became too much for his strength. For a few days before his death, he became more averse to receive visits; speaking became more and more difficult for him, and for twelve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> before his death his speech failed altogether. His senses and judgment did not fail till the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of his life. He constantly discovered a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> and care of his friends; and, amidst great uneasiness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANGUOR\">languor</a>, never betrayed any peevishness or impatience. This is a general account of his last days; but a particular fact or two may perhaps convey to you a still better idea of them.\n\nAbout a fortnight before his death, he added a codicil to his will, in which he fully discovered his attention to his friends, as well as his own pleasantry. What little wine he himself drank was generally port, a wine for which his friend the poet [John Home] had ever declared the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> bequeaths to his friend John one bottle of port; and, upon condition of his drinking this even at two down-sittings, bestows upon him twelve dozen of his best claret. He pleasantly adds, that this subject of wine was the only one upon which they had ever differed. In the codicil there are several other strokes of raillery and pleasantry, highly expressive of the cheerfulness which he then enjoyed. He even turned his attention to some of the simple amusements with which he had been formerly pleased. In the neighbourhood of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol4.html#article-BERWICKSHIRE\">Berwickshire</a> is a brook, by which the access in time of floods is frequently interrupted. Mr Hume bequeaths L.100 for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> over this brook; but upon the express condition that none of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> for that purpose shall be taken from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a> in the neighbourhood, which forms part of a romantic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> in which, in his earlier days, Mr Hume took particular delight. Otherwise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> to go to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>.\n\n\"These are a few particulars which may perhaps appear trifling; but to me no particulars seem trifling that relate to so great a man. It is perhaps from trifles that we can best distinguish the tranquillity and cheerfulness of the philosopher, at a time when the most part of mankind are under disquiet, anxiety, and sometimes even horror....I had gone so far when I was called to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and I have returned only so long before the post as to say, that I am most affectionately yours,\n\n\"William Cullen.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, 17th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 1776.\"\n\nNote Q, p. 353.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PYRRHO\">Pyrrho</a> was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> his scepticism so far as not to avoid a carriage if it was driven against him. \u00c6nesidemus, the most famous of ancient sceptics, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> vindicates the more ancient doubter from such lunacy, of which indeed his having lived to the age of ninety seems sufficient to acquit him. (Diog. Laert. lib. ix. sect. 62.)\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">Brief</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> as our accounts of ancient scepticism are, it does appear that their reasoning on the subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAUSATION\">causation</a> had some resemblance to that of Mr Hume. (Ibid. ix. sect. 97.) It is perhaps impossible to translate the important technical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> \u03c4\u03b1 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b5\u03be\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1. It comprehends two or more things as related to each other\u2014both the relative and correlative taken together as such. Fire considered as having the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> wood is \u03c4\u03bf \u1f10\u03c0\u03b5\u03be\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1. The words of Laertius may therefore be nearly rendered into the language of modern philosophy as follows: \"Causation they take away thus. A cause is so only in relation to an effect. What is relative is only conceived, but does not exist. Therefore cause is a mere conception.\"\n\nThe first attempt to prove the necessity of belief in a divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>, by demonstrating that natural reason leads to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> scepticism, was made by Algazel, a professor at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BAGDAD\">Bagdad</a>, in\nthe beginning of the twelfth century of our era; whose work entitled *The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">Destruction</a> of the Philosopher* is known to us only by the answer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AVERROES\">Averroes</a>, called *Destruction of the Destruction*. He denied a necessary connection between cause and effect; for of two separate things, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of one does not necessarily contain the affirmation of the existence of the other; and the same may be said of denial. It is curious enough that this argument was more especially pointed against those Arabian philosophers who, from the necessary connection of causes and effects, reasoned against the possibility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>; thus anticipating one doctrine of Mr Hume, to impugn another. (*Tenneman, Gesch. der Phil.* VIII. 387.)\n\nThe same attempt was made by the learned but unphilosophical Huet, bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AVRANCHES\">Avranches</a> (*Questiones Alenanae*, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAEN\">Caen</a>, 1690, and *Trait\u00e9 de la Foiblisse de l'Esprit Humain*, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a>, 1723). A similar motive urged Berkeley to his attack on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLUXIONS\">Fluxions</a>. The attempt of Huet has been lately renewed by the Abb\u00e9 Lamennais, in his treatise on *Religious Indifference*; a fine writer, whose apparent reasonings amount to little more than well-varied assertions, and well-disguised assumptions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> to be proved.\n\nTo build religion upon scepticism is the most extravagant of all attempts; for it destroys the proofs of a divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MISSION\">mission</a>, and leaves no natural means of distinguishing between revelation and imposture. The Abb\u00e9 Lamennais represents authority as the sole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> of belief. Why? If any reason can be given, the proposition must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>; if none, it is obviously a mere groundless assertion.\n\n**Note R**, p. 356.\n\nCasanova, a Venetian doomed to solitary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPRISONMENT\">imprisonment</a> in the dungeons at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> in 1755, thus speaks of the only books which for a time he was allowed to read.

They are also the most conspicuous landmarks in the progress of the sciences to which they relate. It is remarkable that the defects of all these great works are very similar. The leading notions of none of them can, in the strictest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, be said to be original, though Locke and Smith in that respect surpass their illustrious rivals. All of them employ great care in ascertaining those laws which are immediately deduced from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, or directly applicable to practice; but apply metaphysical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> principles with considerable negligence. None pursues the order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, beginning with first elements, and advancing to more and more complicated conclusions; though Locke is perhaps less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> in method than the rest. All admit digressions which, though often intrinsically excellent, distract attention, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the chain of thought. None of them is happy in the choice, or constant in the use, of technical terms; and in none do we find much of that rigorous precision which is the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of philosophical language. Grotius and Montesquieu were imitators of Tacitus,\u2014the first with more gravity, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> with more vivacity; but both were tempted to forsake the simple diction of science, in pursuit of the poignant brevity which that great historian has carried to a vicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a>. Locke and Smith chose an easy, clear, and free, but somewhat loose and verbose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>\u2014more concise in Locke\u2014more elegant in Smith,\u2014in both exempt from pedantry, but not void of ambiguity and repetition. Perhaps all these apparent defects contributed in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> usefulness of these great works; and, by rendering their contents more accessible and acceptable to the majority of readers, have more completely blended their principles with the common opinions of mankind.\"\n\n(Edinburgh Review, vol.

(Ibid. II. 86.) If the latter word be applied to time as well as space, and considered as comprehending causation, the enumeration will coincide with that of Hume. The term \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7 is as significant as if it had been chosen by Hobbes. But it is to be observed, that these principles are applied only to explain memory.\n\nSomething has been said on the subject, and something on the present writer, by Mr Coleridge, in his unfortunately unfinished work called Biographia Literaria, chap. v., which seems to justify, if not to require, a few remarks. That learned gentleman seems to have been guilty of an oversight in quoting as a distinct work the Parva Naturalia, which is the collective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a> given by the scholastic translators to those treatises of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> which form the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of Duval's edition of his works, published at Paris in 1639. I have already acknowledged the striking resemblance of Mr Hume's principles of association to those of Aristotle. In answer, however, to a remark of Mr Coleridge, I must add, that the manuscript of a part of Aquinas which I bought many years ago (on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of a bookseller's catalogue) as being written by Mr Hume, was not a copy of the Commentary on the Parva Naturalia, but of Aquinas's own Secunda Secundae; and that, on examination, it proves not to be the handwriting of Mr Hume, and to contain nothing written by him. It is certain that, in the passages immediately preceding the quotation, Aristotle explains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> as depending on a general law,\u2014that the idea of\nan object will remind us of the objects which immediately preceded or followed when originally perceived. But what Mr Coleridge has not told us is, that the Stagyrite confines the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of this law exclusively to the phenomena of recollection alone, without any glimpse of a more general operation extending to all connections of thought and feeling,\u2014a wonderful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, indeed, even so limited, of the sagacity of the great philosopher, but which for many ages <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> barren of further consequences. The illustrations of Aquinas throw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the original doctrine, and show that it was unenlarged in his time. \"When we recollect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>, the thought of Plato occurs 'as like him.' When we remember <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HECTOR\">Hector</a>, the thought of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACHILLES\">Achilles</a> occurs 'as contrary.' The idea of a father is followed by that of a son 'as near.'\" (Aquinas Opera, I. pars ii. p. 62, et seq.) Those of Ludovicus Vives, as quoted by Mr Coleridge, extend no farther.\n\nBut if Mr Coleridge will compare the parts of Hobbes on Human Nature which relate to this subject, with those which explain general terms, he will perceive that the philosopher of Malmesbury builds on these two foundations a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the human understanding, of which reasoning is only a particular case. In consequence of the assertion of Mr Coleridge, that Hobbes was anticipated by Descartes in his excellent and interesting discourse on Method, I have twice reperused that work in quest of this remarkable anticipation, though, as I thought, well acquainted by my old studies with the writings of that great philosopher. My labour has, however, been vain. I have discovered no trace of that or of any similar speculation. My edition is in Latin by Elzevir, at Amsterdam, in 1650, the year of Descartes's death. I am obliged, therefore, to conjecture that Mr Coleridge, having mislaid his references, has, by mistake, quoted the discourse on Method, instead of another work; which would affect his inference from the priority of Descartes to Hobbes. It is not to be denied, that the opinion of Aristotle, repeated by so many commentators, may have found its way into the mind of Hobbes, and also of Hume; though neither might be aware of its source, or even conscious that it was not originally his own. Yet the very narrow view of association by Locke, his apparently treating it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, and the silence of common books respecting it, afford a presumption that the Peripatetic doctrine was so little known, that it might have escaped the notice of these philosophers, one of whom boasted that he was unread, and the other is not liable to the suspicion of unacknowledged borrowing.\n\nTo Mr Coleridge, who distrusts his own power of building a bridge by which his ideas may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> into a mind so differently trained as mine, I venture to suggest, with that sense of his genius which no circumstance has hindered me from seizing every fit occasion to manifest, that more of my early years were employed in contemplations of an abstract nature, than of those of the majority of his readers; that there are not, even now, many of them less likely to be repelled from doctrines by singularity or uncouthness; more willing to allow that every system has caught an advantageous glimpse of some side or corner of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>; more desirous of exhibiting this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a> of the fragments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> by attempts to translate the doctrine of one school into the language of another;\u2014who, when he cannot discover a reason for an opinion, considers it as important to discover the causes of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> by the philosopher; believing, in the most unfavourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, that one of the most arduous and useful researches of mental philosophy is to explore the subtle illusions which enable great minds to satisfy themselves by mere words, before they deceive others by payment in the same counterfeit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>. These habits, together with the natural influence of my age and avocations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> me to suspect that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> philosophy I am nearer to indifference than to an exclusive spirit. I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> that it can neither be thought presumptuous nor offensive in me to doubt, whether the circumstance of its being found difficult to convey a metaphysical doctrine to a person who, at one part of his life, made such studies his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> pursuit, may not imply either error in the opinion, or defect in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>.\nA very late writer, who seems to speak for Mr Bentham with authority, tells us that \"the first time the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> of 'the principle of utility' was brought decidedly into notice, was in the 'Essays, by David Hume,' published about the year 1742. In that work it is mentioned as the name of a principle which might be made the foundation of a system of morals, in opposition to a system then in vogue, which was founded on what was called the '<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>.' The ideas, however, there attached to it, are vague, and defective in practical application.\" (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> Review, No. xxi.) If these few sentences were scrutinized with the severity and minuteness of Bentham's Fragment on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>, they would be found to contain almost as many misremembrances as assertions. Utility is not \"mentioned,\" but fully discussed, in Mr Hume's Discourse. It is seldom spoken of by \"name.\" Instead of charging it with \"vagueness,\" it would be more just to admire the precision which it combines with beauty. Instead of being \"defective in practical application,\" perhaps the desire of rendering it popular has crowded it with examples and illustrations taken from life. To the assertion that \"it was opposed to the moral sense,\" no reply can be needful but the following words extracted from the Discourse itself: \"I am apt to suspect that reason and sentiment concur in almost all moral determinations and conclusions. The final sentence which pronounces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> and actions amiable or odious, probably depends on some internal sense or feeling, which nature has made universal in the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>.\" (An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, sect. i.) The phrase \"made universal,\" which is here used instead of the more obvious and common word \"implanted,\" shows the anxious and perfect precision of language, by which a philosopher avoids the needless decision of a controversy not at the moment before him.\n\nNote W, p. 380.\n\nA writer of consummate ability, who has failed in little but the respect due to the abilities and character of his opponents, has given too much countenance to the abuse and confusion of language exemplified in the well-known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> of Pope,\n\nModes of self-love the Passions we may call.\n\"We know,\" says he, \"no universal proposition respecting human nature which is true but one\u2014that men always act from self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>.\" (Edinburgh Review, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1829.) It is manifest from the sequel, that the writer is not the dupe of the confusion; but many of his readers may be so. If, indeed, the word self-interest could with propriety be used for the gratification of every prevalent desire, he has clearly shown that this change in the signification of terms would be of no advantage to the doctrine which he controverts. It would make as many sorts of self-interest as there are appetites, and it is irreconcilably at variance with the system of association embraced by Mr Mill. To the word self-love <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a> properly assigns two significations: 1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">Gross</a> self-love, which consists in the pursuit of the greatest pleasures, from all those desires which look to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> gratification; or, 2. refined self-love, which seeks the greatest pleasure which can arise from all the desires of human nature,\u2014the latter of which is an invaluable, though inferior principle. The admirable writer whose language has occasioned this illustration, who at an early age has mastered every species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, will doubtless hold fast to simplicity, which survives all the fashions of deviation from it, and which a man of a genius so fertile has few temptations to forsake.","sp":642,"ep":655},{"h":"RICHARD PRICE","t":"About the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a> with the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of Smith, but with a popular reception very different, Dr Richard Price, an excellent and eminent non-conformist minister, published A Review of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> Questions in Morals;\u2014an attempt to revive the intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of\n\n---\n\n1 Born in 1723; died in 1791.\n2 The third edition was published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> in 1787.\nmoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a>, which seemed to have fallen under the attacks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>, Hutcheson, and Hume, even before Smith.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of Geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">Analysis</a>, which investigates the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>, by remounting from its conditions along a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of dependence to some known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, affords decidedly the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> and initiatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> for the student in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a>. It imbues the mind with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and elegance which insensibly extend their influence over the culture of the other sciences. The most curious and difficult portion, however, of the Greek Geometry, has unfortunately been transmitted to us in a mutilated and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> state, which has often tortured the skill of commentators and mathematicians to restore it. Soon after the revival of letters, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> works of the Greek Geometers were translated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> by Commandine; but of Apollonius' Conics several books are wanting, and some parts of the Collections of Pappus exhibit only detached fragments. Near the close of the sixteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, and early in the seventeenth, Vieta, from a few scattered hints, restored the lost Tract on Tangencies, Fermat framed some beautiful separate demonstrations, and Snellius reproduced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLANE\">Plane</a> Loci, but in a tasteless shape. Soon afterwards Viviani, the surviving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Galileo, supplied the fifth book of Apollonius, and with such remarkable\nsuccess, that on comparing his production with an Arabic version <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> then discovered, he appeared to have surpassed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>. Huygens afterwards gave, in the purest taste, some specimens of the Ancient Geometry. A Collection of the Mathematical Treatises of the Greeks respecting the Art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAR\">War</a> was now published in a magnificent folio from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Press at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. But a more extensive undertaking was planned by our oriental traveller Bernard, to print at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of the Greek Geometers, filling up the blanks from the inspection of Arabic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">Manuscripts</a>. In pursuance of this scheme, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Gregory edited Euclid, and Dr Halley Apollonius, while he restored likewise the Tracts on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECTION\">Section</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RATIO\">Ratio</a> and of Space. After an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of fourscore years, Torelli's elegant edition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, purchased in Italy, has issued from the same press. Every lover of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> would rejoice to see a portion of those ample funds that have been provided at Oxford for the encouragement of such expensive works, appropriated to the republication of Pappus' Mathematical Collections, of which several manuscripts exist far more complete than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> printed by Commandine.\n\nThe relish for the Ancient Geometry has been\n\n---\n\n1 Born at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAGUE\">Hague</a> in 1629, and son of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> of Zuyllichen, Secretary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>; completed his mathematical studies at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> under Schooten, and printed a beautiful tract on the Circle and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPERBOLA\">Hyperbola</a> in 1651. But after visiting different countries, he published in 1658 his original and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOROLOGIUM\">Horologium</a> Oscillatorium. Having successfully applied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> to regulate the motions of clocks and watches, he was anxious to accommodate these instruments to the finding of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. For that purpose he visited England, where he was treated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>; but returning in 1653 through France, he was induced by the Minister Colbert to accept of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> pension, and fix his abode at Paris. There he resided till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> became impaired, and in 1661 he retired to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> near his native country. The same pursuits, however, engaged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> at the Hague on the 8th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1695. He was one of the clearest writers and most elegant geometers of modern times, and his powers of invention have seldom been surpassed. The finished works of Huygens have been collected at two several times into three quarto volumes.\n\n2 Nephew to the famous James Gregory, born at Aberdeen in 1661, completed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, and was appointed Professor of Mathematics in that University in 1663, the office having been suffered to remain vacant for eight years after the death of his uncle. In 1691 he had sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> to obtain the Savilian professorship at Oxford, and had the honorary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> in Physick conferred on him by the University. He published his Elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a> in 1702, and in the following year brought out his Edition of Euclid. He had made some progress in preparing the Conics of Apollonius, but fell a sacrifice in 1719 to an attack of malignant small-pox, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAIDENHEAD\">Maidenhead</a>, where he chanced to stop at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INN\">Inn</a>, on his return from a visit to Bath. He possessed some learning, but his genius was of a very inferior order to that of his uncle.\n\n3 Edmund Halley, born in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 29, 1656, the son of a substantial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITIZEN\">citizen</a>\u2014educated at St Paul's school, and sent to Oxford in 1673\u2014sailed for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of St Helena in November 1676, and returned with his catalogue of fixed stars after an absence of exactly two years\u2014elected immediately fellow of the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, and deputed by that learned body in 1679 to visit Hevelius, at Dantzig, and examine his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a>\u2014spent the years 1680 and 1681 in France and Italy. In 1684, having turned his attention to Kepler's problem, he tried, as some other mathematicians about this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a> had done, to derive it from a graduating central force, but was unable to find a geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>; and not obtaining any help as he expected in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> from Hooke or Wren, he had recourse to Newton, who astonished him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a> by the store of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> discoveries, condensed into eight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>. He overcame the scruples of the modest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, and prevailed with him to arrange the materials of the Principia, of which he superintended the publication in 1687, having written the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a> and some elegant recommendatory verses. Halley now gave a geometrical construction of the higher equations, computed the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, and revised tables of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANNUITIES\">annuities</a>. For the purpose of improving Nautical Science, he took the command of the Paramour Pink, with which he sailed from England on the 14th November 1688, traversed the Atlantic, and crossed the Equinoctial Line; but his crew growing sick and mutinous, he was obliged to return to England the following June. Invested with fuller powers, he set sail again in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>, and spent twelve months in exploring both hemispheres, and during the year after his return, he delineated and published his famous astronomical chart. He was next employed on a survey of the British Channel, and then sent by the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a> to assist her ally the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> of Germany in forming a harbour at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the Adriatic. On his return he was appointed, in November 1703, Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford, having been thwarted before in a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CANVASS\">canvass</a> by clerical influence. He now set about recovering the works of Apollonius; studied as much Arabic as enabled him to translate the tract on the Section of Ratio, and he restored the other tract on the Section of Space from the hints left by Pappus. These pieces, in a small octavo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, appeared in 1706; but four years afterwards came forth, in a splendid folio, his edition of the Conics, with the eighth book restored, and the additional treatise of Serenus. In 1719 Halley was appointed astronomer royal, and resided at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a> during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of his life, devoting his advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> to the careful and assiduous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of the Heavens. He completed even his projected task of embracing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of eighteen years. A paralytic disorder seized him in 1737, from which he partially recovered, but his strength declined insensibly, and he expired on the 14th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1742. Few philosophers have contributed more largely to the advancement of useful knowledge. Ingenuity, ardour, indefatigable perseverance, learning, and general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>, were possessed by Dr Halley in a most eminent degree; and having mingled in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> scenes of life, he had the rare advantage of combining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> with the habits of social intercourse.\n\n4 Born in 1721 at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VERONA\">Verona</a>, where he died in 1781. He studied at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a>, and became a great linguist, a good mathematician, and an excellent critical scholar. Being in easy circumstances, he devoted his whole time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> pursuits, and carried his admiration of the Ancient Geometry almost to a pitch of bigotry.\nlonger preserved in Italy and in England than over the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> ever cultivated that fine science with more assiduity, perseverance, and success, than our countryman Dr Robert Simson of Glasgow, the learned and critical editor of Euclid's Elements. In this department he concentrated his whole efforts, and appears, from his familiarity with the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of demonstration, to have inhaled the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of the Greeks. In 1749, he published his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESTORATION\">Restoration</a> of the books of Apollonius on Plane Loci, which by its fulness and peculiar elegance leaves scarcely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> of regret for the loss of the original. Simson pursued his researches in the Ancient Analysis through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> life, and not only restored various fragments, but threw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on some very difficult and abstruse questions connected with it. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a> volume, printed in 1776, at the expense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> Stanhope, besides many fine geometrical speculations, contains the first satisfactory exposition of Porisms, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> advanced by Pappus had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> regarded as an incomprehensible enigma. But from the unvarying tenor of his studies, the Scotch professor became a rigorist for the Ancient Analysis, and rejected with disdain the most obvious improvements in the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a>. It deserves remark, that mathematical demonstration, being addressed to the eye rather than to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, must attain its greatest perspicuity when the successive steps of reasoning are seized at a glance. This is effected by adopting the symbols of Algebraic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTATION\">Notation</a>, the most concise and perfect of all written <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>; nor is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and logical accuracy of the procedure in any degree impaired by such a transparent covering.\n\nDr Matthew Stewart of Edinburgh, who had been the pupil of Dr Simson, and possessed a\n\n---\n\n4 Born at Kirtonhall in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AYRSHIRE\">Ayrshire</a> on 14th October 1687, studied at Glasgow, and made such progress in elementary geometry, that at the early age of 22 he had an offer of the professorship of mathematics, which was immediately accepted to become vacant in that University. Feeling his deficiency, however, he obtained leave of a year's absence, which he spent in London under the tutelage of Humphry Ditton, and was admitted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> on the 20th of November 1711. His time seems afterwards to have been mostly spent in discharging the duties of his office, the intervals being allotted to the solution of geometrical problems, the perusal of the older mathematicians, and to miscellaneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-READING\">reading</a>. He led the life of a recluse, and all his steps were formal and methodical; yet his disposition was amiable, and he indulged at stated times in easy conviviality. He sent two papers, geometrical and algebraical, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">Indeterminate</a> Problems, to the Royal Society in 1723 and 1753, gave his restoration of the Loci Plani in 1745, published his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONIC_SECTIONS\">Conic Sections</a> in 1735, produced the Latin edition of Euclid's Elements in a quarto volume in 1756, which he compressed in 1760 into an English octavo, to which he annexed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> in 1762. It contains only the first six books of the original, with the eleventh and twelfth, the rest of the books being omitted as of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> in the present state of science. Perhaps the selection should have been carried farther. This edition is correct and creditable to the compiler, and has obtained prodigious success. Nay, the very Scottians with which it abounds appear now to be adopted at Oxford and Cambridge as the appropriate dictum of the Ancient Geometry. Simson quite idolized his original. He had a fine taste for geometry, some talents of invention, and considerable attainments as a scholar, but without any great force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>. In his latter years, from excessive veneration of the Greek Geometry, he not only viewed the Cartesian method with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a>, but began to regard the Fluxionary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALCULUS\">Calculus</a> with mistrust and suspicion. He became curricula professor in 1761, and died on the 1st of October 1766.\n\n5 Born in 1717 at Rothesay, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of Bute, of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> his father was minister; studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years at Glasgow, where he distinguished himself; to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> farther instruction, in 1741 he removed to Edinburgh, where he cultivated the society of the celebrated MacLaurin, while he corresponded with Simson, his old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>. He now prosecuted geometrical studies with ardour, and put forth his uncommon powers of invention; and after he became minister at Rosemount, he found leisure in that seclusion to continue his favourite pursuits. On the occasion of a vacancy of the mathematical chair at Edinburgh by the death of MacLaurin, he was induced to draw out the substance of his most profound geometrical investigations, which he printed under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of General Theorems, in a small volume, about the end of 1746. This publication secured his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>, and after some delay he was appointed professor in September 1747. He thus enjoyed a situation most congenial to his taste, and favourable to the exercise of his rare talents. Ambitious to apply his beloved geometry to unravel questions which were believed to demand all the resources of algebra, he discovered a solution of Kepler's problem at once simple and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a>, and greatly surpassing in beauty even more laboured efforts of calculation. This investigation was inserted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> volume of the Transactions of the Edinburgh Society, which appeared in 1756. Encouraged by this success, he five years afterwards produced his Physical and Mathematical Tracts; a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> and elegant work, which would have been clearer had the author only admitted an abbreviation by the simpler algebraic symbols. About this time the results of the observations of the Transit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a>, which had been expected to give the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">Sun</a>, were found to be unsatisfactory and discordant. Stewart therefore published in 1763, as a sequel to his Tracts, a theoretical solution of the problem; in which he was directed by Geometry to the exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the Lunar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APOGEE\">Apogee</a>, a question that, since the analysis of Newton, had perplexed the greatest mathematicians. But he was not equally felicitous in Determining the Solar Distance, which required the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INVERSION\">inversion</a> of the problem, and involved some deceitful and precarious compensations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. This pamphlet was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> production, having printed only a few months before an octavo volume under the title of Propositiones More Veteranum Demonstratae. These propositions, however, derive their value merely as exercises of the method of conducting geometrical analysis and synthesis. But his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a> of genius was already nearly extinguished. Dr Stewart fell into a state of bad health, and having devolved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of teaching on his son, then a youth of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, he retired in 1772 to a small paternal property in Ayrshire, where he chiefly spent the rest of his days, and died on the 23d of January 1785.\nmuch richer invention, was likewise an able and zealous promoter of the Greek Geometry, which he directed besides to the investigation of certain difficult parts of Physical Astronomy. But though managed with sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> he employed was hardly fitted for exploring the more abstruse and recondite problems, which often require all the concentrated powers of the Modern Analysis. The conclusions at which he arrived display much elegance, though merely approximative, and devoid of the precision that is indispensable in the present advanced state of Astronomical Science.\n\nI need not stop to notice the attempts of other English mathematicians, to restore some fragments of Apollonius. After the principal demonstration was obtained, there could be little difficulty in evolving its different phases, and modifying it to the several cases. Playfair's elucidation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of Porisms is entitled to higher distinction.\n\nIt has often been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of surprise, that the Greeks should have spent so much ingenuity, and set such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> value on the Geometrical Construction of Problems. But the application of Geometry served them in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the purpose of calculation, and became a sort of substitute for the tedious and laborious operations of their imperfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of Arithmetic. Accustomed, as we are, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> facility of computing by help of the Arabic ciphers, we can form no adequate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the toil of working with alphabetic numerals, though the Greeks had made some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> improvements in their system of notation. They could extract laboriously the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">Square</a> Root of a number, but never attained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">Cube</a> Root, which it appears was first discovered many centuries afterwards by the Arabians. Hence undoubtedly the solicitude of the Greeks to solve, by a Geometrical, or even a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">Mechanical</a> Construction, the famous Delian Problem, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUPLICATION\">Duplication</a> of the Cube.\n\nIt would seem that, in finding the square root, the Greek mathematicians must have employed certain methods of abbreviation which are not explained. Archimedes, in his famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUADRATURE\">Quadrature</a> of the Circle, to which he approximated by measuring the successive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> and circumscribing polygons, having occasion repeatedly to extract the square root, expressed the value by fractions, and yet with such felicity as always to adopt the lowest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEGRAL\">integral</a> numerator and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENOMINATOR\">denominator</a>. He thus discovered that the circumference of a circle is less than $3\\frac{1}{7}$ times and greater than $3\\frac{10}{71}$ times its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, or that their ratio lies between the ratios 7 to 22 and of 71 to 223. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> within the limits of the 2000th and 4000th parts, might be sufficient for ordinary practice. But Apollonius and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> afterwards approached a hundred times nearer. Yet no farther advances were made in solving that important problem, which required the most refined address, till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of near a thousand years, when the Arabians became possessed of the denary system of notation, and carried the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> for the circumference of a circle to ten decimal places. But this elaborate result was imperfectly known to the revivers of science in Europe; and Vieta, Adrianus Romanus, and others, exerted their ingenuity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> in extending the earlier solution. The simplest and most elegant is that of 113 to 355, an approximation differing scarcely by the ten millionth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, which was discovered about the year 1595 by the elder Adrian Metius, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> engineer in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>. His countrymen Van Keulen and Snellius, in the next century, pushed the expression for the circumference of the circle to 35 figures. But the progress of the higher analysis opened more easy and rapid modes of approximation. In the early part of the eighteenth century, Sharp and Ma-\n\nThis ratio, it may be observed, is easily derived from the limits assigned by Archimedes, for $71 + 7 \\times 6 = 113$, and $223 + 22 \\times 6 = 355$.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> Sharp, born at Little Horton, in the West Riding of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, in 1651, was apprenticed to a merchant at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>; but preferring the study of mathematics, he supported himself by teaching a school in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>. Here he engaged as amanuensis to Flamsteed, and became his assistant when the Royal Observatory was erected at Greenwich in 1676. His services were most eminent in every department. He constructed optical and astronomical instruments, observed stars, calculated tables, and delineated celestial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARTS\">charts</a>. His peculiar neatness of execution is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in a small geometrical work which he published in 1717. About that time he seems to have retired to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a>, where he led the life of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HERMIT\">hermit</a>, but esteemed for his quiet and beneficent disposition. He died in 1742.\nchin computed in England the quadrature of the circle to 75 and 100 places of decimals, and Lagny in France advanced to 128 figures. But these labours were outdone by Vega, an officer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a> in the Austrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, who amused his leisure during a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a>, in employing one of Euler's formulae to derive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> from the tangents of fractional arcs, carried the expression to 140 decimal places. This was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> of calculation; and though no doubt superfluous, it might at least convince any judicious person of the impossibility of stating the ratio of the diameter to the circumference in finite terms. Yet the squaring of the circle is a problem which has at all times fascinated the attention and bewildered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> of many superficial or antiquated students in Geometry. The incom-\n\nmensurability of the circle, which James Gregory had attempted to prove in 1661, was finally demonstrated a century afterwards by Lambert, from an ingenious transformation of the known series for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUADRANTAL\">quadrantal</a> arc in terms of its tangent or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a>. The same ingenious mathematician likewise proposed several neat geometrical constructions, for approximating to the length of arcs of a circle still more nearly than the methods given by Fermat, Gregory, Huygens, and others.\n\nElementary Plane Geometry rests on the combined properties of the straight line and the circle. Many important additions have been made to the digest of Euclid; and several eminent mathematicians of the eighteenth century have corrected, simplified, and essentially improved the only valuable portion of the large work. Some\n\n---\n\n1 John Machin, elected professor of Astronomy in Gresham <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> in 1713, and became secretary of the Royal Society. He had the reputation of being an able mathematician, yet his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> on the Laws of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MOON\">Moon</a>'s Motion, in which he attempted to rectify the Principia, was but a superficial performance. He died in 1731.\n\n2 This excellent mathematician, who published in 1794 a complete collection of Logarithmic Tables and Analytical Formulae, was eight years afterwards robbed and barbarously murdered by a miller, in whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> he lodged, and his body thrown into the Danube.\n\n3 It may be sufficient perhaps to notice the Elements of Geometry by Thomas Simpson, and the similar treatises in the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> by Clairaut and Legendre. These productions all unite clearness with precision; and excluding whatever appears superfluous, they still comprise the whole series of connected propositions. Simpson's unpretending volume is neat and very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a>, yet sufficiently perspicuous. The Geometry of Clairaut is still shorter, but has an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of originality, being designed to show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a>, or to guide the learner through his efforts at the solution of geometric problems, to discover the great elementary truths. He followed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, and with more complete success, in his excellent Elements of Algebra. But the Geometry by Legendre claims much higher merit, and is perhaps the best on the whole that has yet appeared. It wants, however, of exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>; the steps of his demonstrations are sometimes incomplete, and the entire separation of the problems is at least a very questionable improvement. The notes he has added are valuable, but appear disproportioned to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXT\">text</a>, and certainly too profound for beginners. This elegant geometer attempted to found the comparison of triangles on abstract considerations derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of functions. But such reasonings a priori are fallacious, involving unperceived some metaphysical assumptions.\n\nThe works now mentioned might suffice for the instruction of practical or professional men; but the pursuit of a liberal education aspires to greater attainments. The main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is to sharpen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of perception, and invigorate by due exercise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> of the intellectual powers. For contributing to that effect, the fulness and circumspection of the ancient mode of demonstration are admirably calculated. It seemed, therefore, an estimable task to select the scattered wrecks of the Greek Analysis, and dispose them into a form accessible to ordinary students. The beauty of the propositions concerning Locl was particularly striking.\n\nIt would be preposterous, however, to hold up the Elements of Euclid as a standard of instruction in Geometry for the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. They were composed before the invention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">Trigonometry</a>, and probably designed chiefly as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> to the Pythagorean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>. Hence the large portion of them devoted to the relations of numbers, and the properties of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> polygons and solids. By common consent, therefore, the greater part of the system is now laid aside, and the other books are commonly altered or curtailed in practice. Many trivial propositions occur in the third book; several of the fourth have little interest; and it may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABATE\">abate</a> that extravagant praise which several mathematicians have lavished on the Doctrine of Proportion contained in the fifth book, to know that it really cannot be taught. But the language employed in that celebrated compilation, for want of appropriate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> terms, is often vague and indistinct. The word <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, for instance, has no less than three different significations; and other examples of a like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> might be easily cited. In some cases, the demonstrations of Euclid are imperfect or inconclusive. Thus, the reasoning in the twenty-fourth proposition of the first book applies only to the particular position of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>; an objection first started by Thomas Simpson, to the great annoyance of his critical namesake. But similar oversight was made in the demonstration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> proposition of the same book, which fails <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the figure be changed. Both these propositions are only of consequence as auxiliaries in the train of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>. But of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> property of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> lines, the demonstration rests on the mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> of an intricate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a>. In a few cases the reasoning is unnecessarily complicated, from the peculiar conceptions of the author. Thus, the noted fifth proposition of the first book is of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. Its demonstration implies the reversed application, at least mentally, of the isosceles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>; but Euclid evades or disguises the process, by producing the sides of the triangle, and forming two interwoven triangles, which are virtually adapted by inversion, and the annexed triangles being then taken away, the equality of the angles at the base hence follows. But the last is the only step wanted, and the other two were evidently superfluous. This stumbling proposition has been called the Ponca Athorium; and no wonder that the beginner should feel puzzled at seeing such a parade of argument end in so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> a result.\nremarkable propositions, derived from sources beyond the usual scope of Geometry, are yet assimilated with that science. Of such accessions, one of the most beautiful is the late curious and unexpected discovery of Gauss, that, besides the ordinary regular polygons, a numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a>, including the next polygon of seventeen sides, are capable of being inscribed within a circle, by a mere geometrical construction.\n\nIn solving the common problems, the straight line and the circle are generally combined, which requires the application of both the ruler and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPASSES\">compasses</a>. Schooten effected by the ruler alone several simple constructions, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> particularly in castrametation. But the late Mascheroni of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BERGAMO\">Bergamo</a>, in a small work which appeared in 1795, made a beautiful addition to Elementary Geometry, by the solution of a variety of problems, especially those concerning the inscription of the regular polygons, with the help exclusively of compasses. Such speculations, however, are in a great measure extraneous to the science.\n\nThe theory of Lines of the Second Order forms one of the finest speculations of the more advanced geometry. These curves were derived from the Section of the Cone; but the clearest and most philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of treating them is by considering their description on a plane. The distinguishing property of the foci was known to Apollonius, but the advantage of its application overlooked. The Parabola forms the intermediate transition of the Ellipse to the Hyperbola, the remote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> stretching farther out, till it vanishes into indefinite space, again to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-appear on the opposite side. The features of the Parabola are therefore not strictly included in the phases of the Ellipse and Hyperbola. The more comprehensive relation of the distances of any point in the curve from a focus and the directrix is mentioned by Pappus, but the beauty of that locus was not perceived till Boscovich, in 1752, deduced the properties of those lines from it in a string of corollaries, more ingenious than elegant. This essay was compressed and methodized by Thomas Newton in 1794; and in the same year Walker, a respectable mathematician, unaware of what had been already done, produced a work on a similar plan, of which the first part occupied a quarto volume, composed indeed after the manner of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, but so exceedingly prolix in diction as to have very few readers.\n\nAn elegant mode of investigating curves of the second or higher orders, is to consider them as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONDITIONAL\">conditional</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a> of angles or lines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> about fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>. The property had been stated generally in the Principia, but was expanded in 1720 by Maclaurin in his Geometria Organica. The intersections of Polar Radiants were discussed by Brackenridge in 1733. The subject has been again revived, and prosecuted with great ingenuity and research, by the celebrated Carnot, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of Transversals.\n\nNo part of Geometry has been more improved in the course of the last century than Trigonometry, which is not only simplified but much extended in its application. The theory of planes and solids has likewise been cultivated with eminent success. As the position of a point on a plane is assigned by referring it to two co-ordinate lines, so the place of a point in space may be determined by its distances from three planes which are mutually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a>. The properties of a line of single curvature may be derived from the equation of its co-ordinates; the properties of a curved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> can likewise be deduced from its triple shades, or the perpendicular projections on the three planes. Such is the process employed by Monge in his Descriptive\n\n---\n\n1 Gauss found that the expression for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MULTIPLE\">multiple</a> cosine is always decomposable into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BINOMIAL\">binomial</a> factors, and hence concluded that any regular polygon, the number of whose sides is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a>, and denoted by $2^n + 1$, may be inscribed in a circle by mere Elementary Geometry. These numbers form the series 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537, &c., of which the first two only were known before.\n\n2 Born in 1759; died at Paris, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 14, 1800. His tract on the Compasses happening to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of General Bonaparte during his first triumphant campaign in Italy, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was so struck with its ingenuity, that, on his return to Paris, he communicated, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>, some of the propositions to the members of the Institute. The book was immediately translated into French, and the author promoted to a place of trust and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a> in the Italian Republic.\n\n3 Gaspard Monge, born in 1746 at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BEAUNE\">Beaune</a>, and educated at the Jesuits' seminary at Lyons. His uncommon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> procured him admission into the Military School at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MEZIERES\">Mezieres</a>, where he soon became assistant teacher. Disgusted\nGeometry, which may be considered as the completion of the analytical method of Descartes. It furnishes direct and general solutions of several important problems, especially of those relating to the intersection of planes and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of solids. Descriptive Geometry comprehends also the theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">Perspective</a>, which was founded by Ubaldi, and long afterwards recast and simplified by Brook Taylor, and rendered still more practical by Lambert.\n\n2. ARITHMETIC.\n\nTo express large numbers by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> additions being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, it soon became necessary to arrange them on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> of ascending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROGRESSION\">progression</a>. The simplest mode was evidently to repeat the same root of the scale; and as men in the earlier periods of society used to reckon with the ten fingers of both hands, they were led by Nature herself to frame the Denary System of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUMERATION\">Numeration</a>. If they had likewise formed marks for a Digital Notation, they would have completed the bases of Arithmetic. But unfortunately the Alphabetic Characters had been introduced before distinct symbols were contrived to represent numbers. The letters designed merely for written language, came hence among all nations to be employed besides in numeral notation, though hardly manageable, and ill adapted to any regular system of arrangement. In the application of those characters the ancient Greeks showed great ingenuity, by distinguishing them into three classes, appropriated to the ascending progression of units, tens, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>. In this way they reached the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of a thousand, and by employing as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AUXILIARY\">auxiliary</a> the capital M, they could indicate myriads or ten thousands. The triple series of thousands up to a million were more easily denoted, however, by placing a dash under the successive sections of letters. But Archimedes indicated a mode of obtaining almost unbounded extension of this system, by decomposing the elements of the notation into periods of ascending myriads. Apollonius simplified the plan, by adopting a thousand as the root of the progressive scale. Had he proceeded only a little farther, and rejected the letters, except the first class denoting digits, he would have rendered his notation perfect, and have achieved one of the most useful and prolific discoveries ever made. Ptolemy afterwards advanced much nearer to this ultimate object, by employing, in his Trigonometrical Tables, the descending Sexagesimal Scale, suggested by the subdivision of the circumference of a circle into degrees, of which sixty, or the root of this scale, correspond nearly to the length of the radius. It would seem, however, that, during the interval between Archimedes and Ptolemy, the Greek Arithmetic had received some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> improvements in practice; for the Sicilian geometer, by a very tedious and operose process, of which he gives merely the results, was content with stating the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of a circle as intermediate between that of 7 to 22 and of 71 to 223, differing therefore by a 1200th part from the truth; whereas the chords computed by the astronomer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> for every half degree of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a> are correct to the last place, and consequently never deviate by a 300,000th part of the whole.\n\nwith the tedious and operose methods of calculation then practised among engineers, he sought to shorten the road by recurring to general principles and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of Geometry. Thinking closely on that subject, he matured a regular system, which has changed the theory of planes and solids. The ardour of his pursuits was infused into his pupils, and the frequent communications he made to learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> rapidly extended his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>. In 1760 he was conjoined with Bossut as acting professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol10.html#article-HYDRODYNAMICS\">Hydrodynamics</a> at the Louvre, a place erected by the patriotic minister Turgot, which required him to reside at Paris only during half the year. But three years afterwards, on being appointed to succeed Bezout as Examiner of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARINE\">Marine</a>, he fixed his permanent abode in the capital, and engaged in the experiments and discussions of the philosophers. He became a warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARTISAN\">partisan</a> of the Revolution, and conducted its utmost efforts to promote the various plans adopted by its leaders. But he deserved praise for the great concern he took in founding the Polytechnic School, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> eventually productive of the very best effects. Having accompanied Bonaparte to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, he returned with the fruit of his observations to share in the fortunes of that wonderful man. He resumed with lustre the duties of professor, and continued to delight the numerous pupils by his kind attention and the clearness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORAL\">oral</a> discourses. But on the second return of the Bourbons in 1815, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of their vengeance. The Institute was remodelled, and the Polytechnic School suppressed. This sad reverse preyed on his spirits, and produced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALIENATION\">alienation</a> of mind; in which melancholy state he languished for some time, and expired on the 28th July 1818.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who cared only about objects of vulgar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a>, overlooked the refined mode of Greek Notation, and remained satisfied with their own very clumsy and involved system, which could with difficulty represent a large number, but was absolutely disqualified for serving in any way the purposes of calculation. They were obliged therefore to have recourse to counters, and by help of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABACUS\">Abacus</a>, or decimal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>, they performed the ordinary operations of summing accounts. This humble expedient was practised in Europe till the seventeenth century, and is still used by the traders throughout the Chinese Empire, its application being there facilitated by the prevalence of the decimal subdivision of weights, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, and coins.\n\nThe discovery of the Denary Notation, so beautiful and simple in its application, is commonly referred to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, though neither the place nor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of its origin has been ascertained. It was unknown to the Arabian astronomers till near the close of the eleventh century of our era, and even at this period its expressions appear sometimes intermingled with the alphabetic numerals. But the advantages of the system were soon perceived; and the Tables of Sines and Tangents calculated by those laborious mathematicians are now found, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the manuscripts belonging to the University of Leyden, to be correct to the tenth decimal figure. The Arabians transmitted the new system of notation to the flourishing colony of their countrymen in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, whence it was slowly communicated to the several Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">States</a> over Europe. This change was effected chiefly by the calendars or perpetual almanacs compiled in the Moorish seminaries, and eagerly purchased by the various monasteries and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a> throughout Christendom. Yet the Arabic ciphers appear to have remained unknown in every part of Europe beyond Spain, before the middle of the fourteenth century; nor in mercantile transactions were they commonly adopted till near two centuries later. It is a singular circumstance that the advantages of employing the descending progression in the nicer calculations were not sooner perceived, especially after the use which Ptolemy had made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEXAGESIMALS\">sexagesimals</a>. Stevinus was the first who distinctly introduced the practice of decimal fractions in 1585, though Regiomontanus had made a great step towards that improvement, which Ramus even indirectly employed. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> downwards might seem as easy as to reckon upwards. But the mode of denoting the ranks of decimals was then most cumbrous, the successive numerals, like the indices in Algebra, being inclosed in small circles. Bayer in 1619 proposed to substitute for these complex marks an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCENT\">accent</a> repeated. It was our illustrious countryman Napier, however, that brought the notation of decimals to its ultimate simplicity, having proposed in his Rhindologia, printed ten years earlier, to reject entirely the marks placed over the fractions, and merely to set a point at the end of the units. But his sublime invention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">Logarithms</a> about this epoch eclipsed every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> improvement, and as far transcended the denary notation, as this had surpassed the numeral system of the Greeks.\n\nVarious speculations have been framed regarding the properties of the different arithmetical scales. Leibnitz fancied important advantages to accrue from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of the Binary Scale, which operates with extreme facility, and requires only a single character besides the zero. This progression mounts so slowly, however, that it cannot express a large number without employing a multitude of terms. But the Duodecimal Notation, which is partially admitted in the uncial subdivisions, would evidently answer the best for general practice. It proceeds faster than the Denary Scale, and is less subject to be affected by fractions, since its root has no fewer than four divisors, while ten admits only of two. Still these advantages would not compensate for its want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> with the train of ordinary language. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECIMAL_ARITHMETIC\">Decimal Arithmetic</a> would soon generally supersede the use of every other kind of fractions, if it were likewise in practice combined with an extensive decimal subdivision of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WEIGHTS_AND_MEASURES\">weights and measures</a>.\n\nThe curious or mystical properties of numbers have at all times fixed the attention of mankind. Square numbers, denoting the sides of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>-angled triangle, were sought for by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PYTHAGOREANS\">Pythagoreans</a>, who gave a very simple rule\nPerfect numbers, or such as may be composed by the addition of their aliquot parts, could not fail to excite admiration; and Euclid produced an elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a> for discovering them. It is remarkable that these numbers should appear frequent at first in the series, and afterwards occur only at wide intervals. Thus, below 10,000, there are four perfect numbers; but the last of the succeeding four includes no fewer than nineteen ciphers. The moderns have advanced farther, and imagined what are called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMICABLE\">Amicable</a> numbers, on all which subjects Euler has shown his ingenuity and unrivalled analytical skill.\n\nIt is less a matter of speculation, while it is of considerable consequence in the practice of calculation, to assign the Prime Numbers, or such as admit of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, and to resolve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COMPOSITE\">Composite</a> Numbers into their several factors. No general method has yet been devised for the investigation of Primes, though by the researches of Bachet and Fermat in the seventeenth century, and of Euler, Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss, in the eighteenth, they are now reduced to certain constant forms, which may facilitate their discovery. By an extension of the method called the Sieve of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ERATOSTHENES\">Eratosthenes</a>, a sort of mechanical process, the prime numbers are separated from the ordinary progression. In this way several authors have constructed tables of Primes, and of Composite Numbers, with their various factors or divisors. Lindenau proceeded to a hundred thousand, but Cherac has lately carried the enumeration as high as ten millions.\n\nThe formation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGIC\">Magic</a> Squares, by which the numbers in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> order are disposed in cells, so that each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> gives an equal sum, remounts to high antiquity. They have been regarded in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EAST\">east</a> as charms or talismans, of great potency in the tide of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> affairs. The digital squares from 3 to 9 were dedicated to the seven stars, including the sun and moon, which in the astrological visions were believed to rule the successive days of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. The people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SIAM\">Siam</a> had learned a very simple method of filling up those squares; but some European Mathematicians have since amused themselves with such arithmetical curiosities. Stifels, in his Arithmetica Integra, incidentally treated of Magic Squares, yet without naming them. He was immediately followed in a small arithmetical treatise by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Riese; but the French seem to have directed most attention to those scientific recreations. From the latter part of the 17th till beyond the middle of the 18th century, a succession of ingenious persons were at pains to improve and extend the construction. Frenicle, Poignard, Delahire, Ons-en-Bray, and Rallier des Ourmes, are entitled to particular notice.\n\nThe construction of Magic Squares belongs to the class of problems styled Indeterminate, which depend on variable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a>, and therefore admit of very numerous answers. Thus, Frenicle, who successfully studied this subject near the beginning of the last century, showed that the first sixteen of the natural numbers could be formed into a Magic Square in not fewer than 880 different ways. Analysts have since tried to narrow those chances, and augment the difficulty of the investigation, by annexing other conditions. Dr Franklin produced, by dint of perseverance, what he called a Magic Square of Squares, and a Magical Circle. De la Hire treated the formation of Magic Squares with such copious detail as to leave very little to be done by his successors. Yet several eminent mathematicians have occasionally reverted to this amusing subject. Even the great Euler has not disdained to direct his transcendent skill in algebraic analysis to the solution of\n\n---\n\n1 See notes to the Elements of Geometry. Euler has demonstrated that every number whatever consists of not more than four squares. An example may be given of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of numbers between 10 and 20: 10 = 9 + 1, 11 = 9 + 1 + 1, 12 = 9 + 1 + 1 + 1, 13 = 9 + 4, 14 = 9 + 4 + 1, 15 = 9 + 4 + 1 + 1, 16 = 16 + 1, 17 = 16 + 1 + 1, 18 = 16 + 1 + 1 + 1, 19 = 16 + 1 + 1 + 1, 20 = 16 + 4.\n\n2 It may gratify the curious to see the series 6, 23, 496, 8123, 33550336, 8589869056, 137436691323, and 29056439061369551236. These numbers are obtained by multiplying the 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 16, 18, and 30 powers of 2 by its 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, and 31 powers diminished by unit.\n\n3 The first in modern times who noticed Magic Squares was Agrrippa of Nettesheim, who gave in his book de Occulta Philosophia, printed in 1533, the Sigilla Jovis, Martis, Solis, Veneris, Mercurii, and Lunae.\n\n4 Born at Paris in 1640, and died in 1716, a man of some attainments, and great application\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WELL\">well</a> acquainted with the details of surveying, and of practical astronomy.\nproblems connected with the theory of Magic Squares.\n\nAnother portion of Arithmetic, not merely curious, but of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> importance in the application of that science, has been much cultivated during the eighteenth century. If both the terms of a proper fraction be divided by the numerator, there <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> result an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> fraction, having unit for its numerator, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEGER\">integer</a>, conjoined with another fraction of smaller terms, for its denominator. But this new fraction may be again broken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in the same way, and the process of decomposition renewed successively, till a fraction with an integral denominator is at length obtained. This mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> is therefore the very same as what is employed in finding a common measure or divisor, only the several quotients are here preserved. When the original fraction is expressed by rational numbers, its decomposition must always terminate; but if the numerator and denominator be mutually incommensurable, the process of evolving their elements will never draw to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a>. The fractions which thence arise may simply repeat, or they may circulate at short intervals or periods, or they may succeed each other without any sort of order whatever. But it is evident that such progressive subdivision must approach constantly nearer to the true value, and that the resulting fractions, if successively recombined, will exhibit a series of approximations.\n\nThe fractions of this kind were first noticed by Lord Brounker, who proposed one of them to express the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of a circle, which Dr Wallis afterwards investigated. Huygens perceived the utility of employing such fractions to represent approximate ratios, and in this way he found convenient small numbers to represent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> and pinions of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PLANETARIUM\">Planetarium</a>. But the subject appears to have lain neglected till 1737, when Euler explored it with his usual depth and felicity, in a distinct memoir published in the Petersburg Transactions. He may consequently be regarded as the real founder of the Theory of Continued Fractions, to which indeed he gave the appellation they have since retained. It was a favourite speculation of that great analyst, who resumed the subject at different times, and widely extended its application. Euler showed how to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> any quadratic equation into a Continued Fraction, and demonstrated that the expression for an irrational square root consists of terms which either repeat or circulate in regular periods. A cube root may likewise be expressed by a Continued Fraction, but its terms can have no sort of order in their sequence. As these Fractions, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> to their ultimate value, oscillate continually between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> and defect, they are always capable of being changed into Converging Series, affected by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> signs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PLUS\">plus</a> and minus, and the transformation may be reversed. By this method the very ingenious Lambert converted the series of Gregory and Leibnitz for the length of a quadrant into a Continued Fraction, whose terms have a regular and incessant circulation, and hence proved (what had only been presumed before) that the Circle is incommensurable. But he was enabled to proceed still farther, and to establish, that even the square of the number\n\n---\n\n1 Cornelius Capito printed, in 1767, at Gl\u00fcckstadt, a short treatise on Magic Squares, in which he proposed to vary their construction no fewer than a million times. But the latest and completest work on this curious subject was compiled by the late Professor Mollweide of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEIPZIG\">Leipzig</a>, the ingenious editor of Kl\u00fcgel's valuable Mathematisches W\u00f6rterbuch.\n\n2 Born in 1620, and died in 1684; an able mathematician, but an unprincipled courtier.\n\n3 This very remarkable man was born November 23, 1616, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASHFORD\">Ashford</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>\u2014educated at Cambridge\u2014became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHAPLAIN\">chaplain</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> Vere in 1643, and was then led to cultivate the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECIPHERING\">deciphering</a>, in which he acquired such skill, as to be afterwards frequently employed by the Long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> in examining intercepted dispatches. Through that interest he was appointed to a sequestrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> in London, and chosen in 1644 one of the scribes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">Assembly</a> of Divines. But his austere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> did not divert him from the nobler pursuits of philosophy and science; and being appointed by the Parliamentary commissioners in 1649, Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford, he continued regularly to discharge the duties of that office. He had afterwards some hot disputes with Hobbes, who, though a most ingenious metaphysician, unfortunately mistook his own blunders for discoveries in Mathematics. Wallis maintained a large correspondence with men of science, and assiduously contributed to the progress of philosophical discovery during that active period. The moderation of his character assured him the possession of the places he held at the Restoration; and though he found leisure to compose a very learned philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> of the English language, and sometimes indulged his early taste for controversial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, he devoted the greater part of a long life to the laborious cultivation and extension of the various departments of Mathematical Science. His works are voluminous, and display great erudition, talents for deep research, and originality of conception. He died on the 20th October 1703, and was succeeded in the chair by Dr Halley.\nexpressing the circumference is likewise irrational.\\(^1\\)\n\nLagrange has since recommended and explained the application of Continued Fractions to the solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NUMERICAL\">numerical</a> equations. These fractions may be readily changed into Recurring Series,\\(^2\\) which, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of small roots, are often beautifully simple and remarkably convergent. But sometimes they betray the opposite tendency to diverge; and the great object of Lagrange was to remove that defect. Euler, in several of his last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> and opuscules, directed them to indeterminate problems, to the finding of maxima and minima, and to the development and integration of certain analytical formulae. Nothing can exceed the beauty of some of these speculations.\n\nIt is a singular fact, that though Continued Fractions had their origin in this island, they were afterwards almost wholly overlooked by our mathematicians. Scarcely thirty years have passed away since the attention of the curious was again recalled to them. But an acquaintance with the transformation of those fractions would prove extremely useful to practical men, by furnishing a variety of short approximations, which are easily remembered and readily applied. Ordinary computations in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MENSURATION\">mensuration</a>, in the comparison of different weights and measures, and in several standard proportions, might thus be much abbreviated without any sensible inaccuracy. The method proposed by Lambert for decomposing fractions into progressions that have their denominators formed by successive multipliers, could be employed in a similar way; but its application is somewhat difficult and intricate.\\(^3\\)\n\nTo facilitate the operations of arithmetic, tables have been digested of the powers and products of numbers. The most astonishing work of that kind, including all the multipliers from one to one thousand, was produced by Hervart, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>, in 1610, only four years before the invention of Logarithms, the want of which it could in some faint degree have supplied. But tables of products in a less unwieldy shape are still occasionally used for abridging the labour of calculation. A notable improvement has been lately introduced by the substitution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">Quarter</a> Squares, grounded on the known property that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> of any two numbers is equal to the fourth part of the excess of the square of their sum above the square of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>. A single page might comprise as many of those numbers as, by simple addition and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUBTRACTION\">subtraction</a>, would exhibit an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of products equal to those contained in Hervart's enormous folio.\\(^4\\)\n\nIt would be a great improvement in elementary education to introduce into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> a more extended multiplication <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, including at least all the products of the numbers from 1 to 25. A very useful practice has been adopted lately in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of Germany, to accustom learners to the readiness of mental calculation.\\(^5\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of a circle having unit for its diameter is expressed by the alternating series \\(1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4} + \\ldots\\), which was converted by Euler into the continued fraction\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{9}{2 + \\frac{25}{2 + \\frac{49}{2 + \\ldots}}}}}\n\\]\n\nof the odd numbers. This extension never stops, and consequently the fraction is not reducible to finite terms. The square of the expression runs into a similar infinitude.\n\n\\(^2\\) It deserves to be mentioned that Girard first gave the simple recurring series which expresses the parts of a line divided into extreme and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> ratio. It is formed by the continued addition of the two preceding terms. Thus 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, &c. The square of each number in this series differs from the product of the two numbers which inclose it, only by unit alternately in excess and defect: Thus \\(0^2 = 0\\), \\(1^2 = 1\\), \\(2^2 = 4\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), \\(5^2 = 25\\), \\(8^2 = 64\\), \\(13^2 = 169\\), \\(21^2 = 441\\), \\(34^2 = 1156\\), \\(55^2 = 3025\\), \\(89^2 = 7921\\), \\(144^2 = 20736\\).\n\n\\(^3\\) For an explication of Lambert's method of decomposing fractions, see Philosophy of Arithmetic.\n\n\\(^4\\) A large table of multiplication, from 1 to 10,000, and a specimen of quarter squares, extending to a million, may be seen in the treatise quoted above.\n\n\\(^5\\) It is called Kopfrechnung or calculating by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. Three works are current on this subject, those of Biermann, Heuss, and K\u00f6hler\u2014published between 1790 and 1816.\n3. ALGEBRA.\n\nAlgebra derives its immense superiority over the ancient analysis from the very complete system of notation which it has at length attained. Each step of an investigation being now registered in the clearest and most precise manner, the mind is relieved from the fatigue of carrying forward the whole of a continuous chain of reasoning. It can rest at any place, and again resume the process of deduction with the greatest facility. But this perfection of pictured language has been the result of a series of slow and successive improvements. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DIOPHANTUS\">Diophantus</a>, who, soon after the Christian era, composed a large treatise on the resolution of certain arithmetical problems, a portion of which work is preserved, made the first attempt towards an abbreviated form of analysis. The symbols he used were, however, exceedingly few, being the initials or terminations of the ordinary words, only somewhat modified. It deserves remark, that Diophantus viewing a number as composed from another by the addition or subtraction of a third, he termed this last one abundant or deficient, and gave a rule for the multiplication of those affected numbers, similar to what is now applied to the signs plus and minus. His treatise passed into the hands of the Arabians, who studied the numerical properties with much ardour, but made no advances in refining or simplifying the form of notation. From them again this higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of arithmetic was transplanted into Italy, probably during the fourteenth century, by Leonard, a merchant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a>, who had travelled long in the East. A series of works on Arithmetic and Geometry were published between the years 1470 and 1487 by Pacciolo, a Minorite Friar, who in 1494 brought out his Arte Maggiore, or what he says was vulgarly called the Regola de la Cosa, or Algebra and Almucabala; the first appellation derived from the Italian Cosa, denoting the Thing sought, and the other borrowed from the Arabic words expressing Resolution and Composition. After the appearance of this elementary digest, Algebra was cultivated in Italy, during the first half of the sixteenth century, with great industry and success. Ferreo, Tartalea, and especially Cardan, made rapid advances in the new science. This ingenious though very singular person not only gave the solution of Cubic Equations which bears his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, but discovered the leading properties of equations in general, distinguishing their roots into the true and the fictitious; and besides improved the notation by employing frequently the letters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>. The Italians, however, still used contracted words for symbols, and the initials p. and m. for the signs of plus and minus. In 1572, Bombelli of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, retaining this embarrassed mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, composed a regular summary of Algebra, which he enriched with Ferrari's rule for resolving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BIQUADRATIC\">biquadratic</a> equations. In the meanwhile the knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYTIC\">analytic</a> art had penetrated into Germany, where it received its capital improvement in notation from the systematic genius of that people. The change was chiefly effected by the industry of Stifels, a Protestant minister and zealous follower of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a>, who in 1544 published his Arithmetica Integra. In that remarkable work he first introduced the symbols + and \u2014 for plus and minus, and the character \u221a (or a contracted R) for Radix or root; and he represented unknown quantities by the capital letters A, B, C, &c. and intimated the successive powers and their reciprocals by an ascending and descending series of exponents. Nor was his merit confined to algebraic writing: the en-\n\n---\n\n1 Born at Ealingen, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, in 1529, and died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JENA\">Jena</a> in 1567. Though a profound and inventive mathematician, he seems to have inhibited all the wild enthusiasm of that convulsed period. Captivated perhaps by the wonderful properties of numbers, he fancied, as other ingenious persons have since done, that he could interpret the visions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-APOCALYPSE\">Apocalypse</a>, and foretell the end of the world. He was so imprudent as to place that awful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> very near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. Early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of the day predicted in the year 1553, he assembled his trembling flock in a wide open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, where he endeavoured to season their minds for the tremendous change by fervid prayers and pathetic exhortations. The sky was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a>, the darkness thickened, a portentous silence prevailed, and the preacher rolled his thunders with overpowering energy. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> soon passed away, the sun shone forth in his wonted splendour, and all nature smiled. The populace recovered their agitated spirits; and now breathing rage and disdain, they chased the unlucky prophet home with volleys of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>.\nthusiasm of the age seems to have roused the spirit of invention in him; and Stifels anticipated some of the later discoveries, pointed out the nature of Logarithms, explained the properties of figurate numbers, and showed how the co-efficients of the powers of a binomial quantity may be derived from the columns of what has been since called the arithmetical triangle. Scheubel a few years afterwards pursued the same path, yet without adding any thing material to the science. In this state it made its way at last into England, where Recorde, an ingenious though unfortunate man, printed the Cossic Art at London in 1553. He was the first to propose the sign = for equality, but made no other advances; and during a period of most active enterprise, till the close of the century, Algebra was not cultivated at all in this country.\n\nIn the meanwhile France continued the pursuit of the mathematical sciences. Ramus had revived those abstract studies; but Vieta, who succeeded him, and flourished between the years 1570 and 1600, rose by his numerous discoveries to much higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>; a lawyer by profession, yet a man of great learning, and gifted with profound and original genius, conjoined with the most indefatigable application. Vieta introduced the literal or specious Algebra, and thus rendered its procedure quite general, by employing the Roman capitals always to denote numbers, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-VOWELS\">vowels</a> being appropriated to unknown quantities. He likewise traced various distinctions, and framed several significant terms, which are still retained. But while he improved the analytical symbols, he greatly extended the theory of equations, and cultivated with success the prolific and important subject of angular sections.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a> at this period equally displayed the spirit of invention. Stevin of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRUGES\">Bruges</a>, born about the middle of the sixteenth century, was an engineer eminently skilled both in the theory and practice of his profession, possessing great original powers of mind. He reduced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATICS\">Statics</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">Hydrostatics</a> to their simplest principles; and in his Arithmetic or Algebra, printed in 1585, he extended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of calculation by several fine improvements and discoveries. Marking the unknown quantity with a small circle, he denoted its power by inserting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a>; and was enabled, by prefixing a fraction, to represent also the roots. But, besides improving and simplifying the symbols, he enriched the analytic art by his inventions, and gave a general method for the resolution of numerical equations. The works of Stevin were, in 1625, collected and expanded by his countryman Girard, a man likewise of most original conception, who eagerly promoted the objects of science. Four years afterwards this editor produced a small tract exclusively his own, and full of new and ingenious deductions. He there gave a very complete theory of equations, distinguishing them into their several orders, and proving that they had always a corresponding number of roots; he showed how these roots are successively combined in forming the co-efficients of the several terms; and finally anticipated the remarkable rule discovered by Newton, to find the sums of their different powers. Girard was possessed of fancy as well as invention; and his fondness for philological speculation led him to frame new terms, and to adopt certain modes of expression which are not always strictly logical. Though he stated well the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> of the signs plus and minus, in reference to mere geometrical position, he first introduced the very inaccurate phrases of greater and less than nothing, and began the unfortunate appellation of impossible quantities.\n\nIt is indeed the reproach of modern analysis to be clothed in such loose and figurative language, which has created mysticism, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a>, and misconception. The Algebraist, confident in the accuracy of his results, whenever they-\n\n---\n\n1 Robert Recorde, born of a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, about the year 1506\u2014studied at Oxford, and elected a fellow there in 1531. He embraced the medical profession, but taught mathematics at both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>, and afterwards in London, where between the years 1551 and 1557 he published several elementary treatises on Geometry and Algebra, with quaint titles. But Recorde was unfortunate, and having been thrown into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLEET\">Fleet</a> for debt, he died a prisoner in 1558.\n\n2 Albert Girard published his edition of Stevin's Arithmetic in 1625, and his own discoveries in Algebra in a small quarto at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> in 1629. He died in 1633, and his widow the year after put forth his complete collection of Stevin's works.\nbecome significant, hastens through the successive steps to a conclusion, without stopping to mark the conditions and restrictions implicated in the problem. This rapidity of operation, though in many respects most advantageous, yet affords less mental exercise than the cautious and guarded procedure of the Greeks. It will not be deemed foreign to the scope of this discourse, to remark, that the signs plus and minus confer no distinctive character, but merely indicate that the number to which they are prefixed, is to be annexed to some other number, or disjoined from it. The terms additive and subtractive would express correctly their whole import. The rules for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INVOLUTION\">involution</a> of those signs are derived from the consideration of the properties of compounds, arising from the addition or multiplication, for instance, of the binomials $a + b$ and $c + d$. The operation proceeds by detail; but the real meaning of the notation may be suspended, and it becomes significant only after the several members have been recombined. A number, in strict language, is altogether devoid of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, and can be reckoned neither positive or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATIVE\">affirmative</a>, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>, which designations are accidents, and not attributes. In proposing these terms, Vieta did not, therefore, discriminate the precise nature of the symbols; and his powerful example has continued to infect the language and darken the conceptions of algebraists. A disposition has also prevailed in modern times, of hastening to general conclusions, although the data be limited or imperfect. Such careless deductions are but awkwardly amended, by the adoption of expedients more like the fictions of lawyers than the reasonings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> logicians. The introduction of equal and impossible roots of equations served only to restrict the ordinary rules, which had been made too general, representing the number of roots as always equal to the index of the highest power. The involution or repeated multiplication of binomials will produce the successive orders of expressions, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> into equations on the supposition that any one of them vanishes or has its parts mutually balanced. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> of this proposition will not always hold true, That every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> expression is resolvable into as many binomial factors as the index of its highest power signifies. Several forms even of the quadratic or cubic expressions resist all binomial decomposition. But it is a property demonstrated, that every higher expression whatever may be resolved into binomial or trinomial factors, or into simple or quadratic elements. Impossible quantities are thus merely the symbolical exhibition of the binomial factors of a quadratic or trinomial expression which is irreducible; and\n\n---\n\n1 This distinction might perhaps have satisfied the scruples of the late venerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Maseres, who wrote an express treatise against the abuse of the Negative Sign, which he came to view with a sort of aversion as the main source of the incorrect language and vague conception so prevalent among algebraists. Though not quite entitled to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of a discoverer, that excellent person deserves a place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Mathematics, for his valuable contributions, and his zealous and unrestrained exertions to promote accurate science. He was an able geometer, a profound constitutional lawyer, a man of sound and most extensive learning, and of very general information. But he possessed the higher qualities of our nature, and combined liberality of sentiment and unbounded integrity with the feelings of a kind, generous, and social disposition. His Elements of Trigonometry was the completest treatise in English at the period of its appearance. He afterwards improved the solutions of cubic and biquadratic equations, and illustrated the methods of approximating to the resolution of equations in general. But the most important service he rendered to mathematical science consists in reprinting at great expense, and chiefly for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a>, the series of original authors in logarithms, with ample annotations, in six large quarto volumes. From his anxiety to be perspicuous, he was apt to fall into the opposite extreme of tiresome prolixity.\n\nThe grandfather of Maseres was an officer in the French guards, born in the district of Bearn, and a Hugonot, who, on the revocation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDICT\">Edict</a> of Nantes, retired to Holland, and transferring his services to the Prince of Orange, accompanied the Preserver of our liberties into England, and fought by his side in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>. The grandson having embraced the profession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, was soon after the peace of 1763, probably on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of his intimate acquaintance with French language and customs, appointed Attorney General of Quebec, where he resided till 1776. At leaving his charge, he visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BOSTON\">Boston</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NEW_YORK\">New <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, while that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> was fermenting which burst into open revolt. Soon after his return to England, he published in successive volumes his Canadian Freeholders, in which he refuted the despotic maxims of Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MANSFIELD\">Mansfield</a>, and earnestly recommended conciliatory measures with our American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>. But it was a time of infatuation and disaster. Maseres by his firmness gave mortal offence to the courtiers, and never obtained any promotion, farther than the small sinecure office of Cursitor Baron of Exchequer. But fortune had abundantly provided for all his wants, and he enjoyed unbroken health, and the renovating pleasures of study and social intercourse. The Baron had composed a full and learned treatise on Life Annuities, and matured a plan for securing small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PENSIONS\">pensions</a> from Government to such of the poorer classes as should make certain contributions during the vigour of their days. This he embodied in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BILL\">Bill</a> which passed the Commons, but was lost in the House of Lords, through the influence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">Bishops</a>, who seem to have considered pauperism as a right appendage to their splendid ecclesiastic establishment. He died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REIGATE\">Reigate</a> in May 1824, at the very advanced age of 93.\n\nDiss. IV.\nthe mark of impossibility is removed, either by a change of the signs, or by a recombination that restores those factors to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> binomial form. Such notation may indicate the limits of a problem, and seems to originate in neglecting the previous statement of the limitations. In reference to Geometry, the impossible expressions intimate the transition of the circle into the equilateral hyperbola, or of arcs into logarithms.\n\nThe publication of the Geometry of Descartes in 1637 is justly deemed an epoch in the history of analytical science. The capacious mind of the author seized on all the preceding discoveries, and moulded them with his original inventions into a regular and comprehensive system. He gave rapidity to the writing of Algebra by the introduction of small characters, and rendered the distinction more palpable between known and unknown quantities, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROPRIATION\">appropriation</a> of the initial and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> letters of the alphabet. He adopted the notation of the integral exponents or indices, as reduced to its simplest form by Herigon; and this apparently very slight improvement led, in the sequel, to the most important results. Though the index was at first merely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> for the repeating of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> in the involution of powers, yet it acquired a most extensive import when it came to be treated abstractly as a number. The prefixing of the subtractive sign changed the expression into its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a>, and the substituting of a fraction converted it into the symbol of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVOLUTION\">evolution</a> or the extraction of roots. Nothing can better illustrate the efficiency of a systematic notation, as an instrument for enabling the intellect to pursue and generalize its deductions, than the successive modifications which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> suggested in the marking of exponents, during the short period from Descartes to Newton.\n\nBut the French philosopher effected a revolution in scientific procedure, by applying (what his countryman Vieta had only partially attempted before) the symbols and calculations of Algebra to the solution of geometrical problems. By referring curve lines to co-ordinates or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> perpendiculars, he expressed their relations by equations, of which he distinguished the rank and composition. He showed that a biquadratic equation is, by the help of indeterminate co-efficients, resolved into two quadratics, and may be constructed by combining a circle with a conic section. The construction of a cubic equation was somewhat simpler, though derived from the same principles. But Descartes proceeded still farther, and represented what are now called curves of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> curvature, by reducing them, by a series of perpendiculars, to some plane of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a>. These were all important advances in mathematical speculation.\n\nAttempts have been made to apply the Cartesian method even to Elementary Geometry, which is in fact to convert a clear and simple train of reasoning into a sort of hard mechanical process of calculation. This change, were it attainable, would be the reverse of an improvement. It would extinguish that fine study which affords the best exercise and discipline of the intellectual powers. The wonderful dexterity and readiness which men of such teeming invention as the Bernoullis, Euler, and Lagrange generally displayed in managing algebraic analysis, appear to have seduced their admirers into an over-estimate of its real advantages. The constructions derived from algebra very seldom reach the purity and elegant simplicity of the geometrical methods. In those cases where Geometry\n\n---\n\n1 A very simple problem will illustrate this: Suppose it were required, from a given point, to draw a tangent to a given circle. The construction would be, to join the centre with the given point, and upon the connecting line describe a circle to cut the former in the points of contact. It is evident, that if the given point occupied the extremity of the diameter, there would be only one point of contact; and if it lay within the circle, there could be none. This construction hence intimates sufficiently the conditions of the problem; and yet it fails in the case where the circle described merges in the given point, and consequently ceases to determine the position of the tangent. The algebraical solution, if rightly interpreted, gives similar information. Let \\( r \\) denote the radius of the given circle, and \\( a \\) the distance from its centre to the given point; then \\( \\sqrt{a^2 - r^2} \\) will express the length of the tangent, which only requires to be inflected to the given circumference. But if the given point fall on that circumference, then \\( a = r \\) and the origin and termination of the tangent coincide, leaving its position undetermined. Again, if the given point <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> within the circle, \\( a \\) will be less than \\( r \\), and consequently the subtractive portion \\( -r^2 \\) will predominate over the other portion \\( a^2 \\), and the compound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RADICAL\">radical</a> \\( \\sqrt{a^2 - r^2} \\) become impossible. It serves to show, however, that by a change of condition the problem would be rendered soluble.\nis most felicitous, they betray the features of a clumsy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> combination. The application of Algebra should therefore be reserved for the most arduous and complicated problems in the Higher Geometry.\n\nIn the latter part of the seventeenth, and during the course of the eighteenth century, Algebra still continued to advance; and though it underwent no revolution, it acquired greater perfection in all its details. The construction of cubic and biquadratic equations, which Descartes had effected by combining a circle with a parabola, was afterwards improved; but Newton proposed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCHOID\">Conchoid</a> as the curve best adapted for the practical solution of such problems. Leibnitz succeeded in conquering the irreducible case of Cardan, by a bold application of the binomial theorem, having converted the cubic roots of the compound expressions into two series, with alternate imaginary terms, which are extinguished by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a>. In examining generally the nature of cubic equations, their solution came afterwards to be referred to the trisection of a Circular or Hyperbolic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECTOR\">Sector</a>, and was therefore accomplished by the application of a table either of Sines or of Logarithms. The theory of the Section of Angles and of Ratios, founded by the ingenuity of Cotes, furnished a clue to the resolution of certain forms of the Higher Equations. But though Euler solved biquadratics in a different way from that of Descartes, all attempts to find directly the roots of the fifth and the superior orders of equations had totally failed. It became necessary therefore to have recourse to the approximative methods of resolving equations. Successive improvements in the process of calculation were made by Raphson, Halley, Laguy, and Taylor; so that little seemed wanting for any practical end.\n\nDuring the last century likewise the method of series, so various and extensive in its application, was cultivated with the greatest success. About the years 1714 and 1718, Montmort and James Bernoulli employed it in the investigation of the Laws of Chance. But De Moivre, a French refugee, and a man of learning and profound science, carried these researches much farther, having devoted his time professionally to the calculation of probabilities, and of the values of life-annuities. In 1730, he published an original work, which, besides other useful inventions, explained the properties of a Recurring Series, that always repeats the same succession of co-efficients in distinct sequences. About the same time, Stirling brought out a complete treatise on Series, in which he advanced by a different road to consider their convergence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INTERPOLATION\">interpolation</a>, and summation. This ingenious\n\n---\n\nA man of some rank, and an able mathematician, born in 1673 at Paris, where he died in 1719.\n\nAbraham De Moivre, born in 1667 at Vitri in Champagne, being a Protestant, he was obliged at the age of eighteen to seek shelter in England after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Having shown an early taste for Mathematics, he continued to prosecute the study as a profession. He supported himself creditably by giving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> and reading public lectures. His analytical discoveries extended his fame, and his good conduct insured him respect. He embraced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEWTONIAN_PHILOSOPHY\">Newtonian Philosophy</a>, and made some improvements on it. He generalized Cotes' famous theorem of the section of a circle, but turned his attention chiefly to the method of series, which he applied successfully to the doctrine of annuities and chances. After his reputation for such calculations had been established, it is said that he spent a great part of the day at Slaughter's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COFFEE\">Coffee</a>-House, in St Martin's Lane, where he was ready to answer any question of that nature propounded to him, for the fee of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GUINEA\">guinea</a>. His principal work on the Doctrine of Chances was published in 1738, but the enlarged and improved edition bears date 1756. De Moivre lived to a great age, but in his advanced years he was subject to obstinate fits of sleeping, and in that torpid state he remained for at least several weeks, till death closed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> in November 1754.\n\nJames Stirling, born about the year 1690 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-STIRLINGSHIRE\">Stirlingshire</a>, where his father owned a small property. He was educated at Glasgow, and sent by that University on Snell's Foundation to Balliol College in Oxford. During his retreat there he applied himself so diligently to the study of Mathematics, that he printed in 1717 a small tract on Lines of the Third Order, with new solutions of one or two difficult problems by the fluxionary calculus. He then repaired to London, and becoming acquainted with the Venetian Minister, he accepted an invitation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, where he resided several years, and taught Mathematics. The vicinity of Padua gave him an opportunity of acquiring the friendship of Nicholas Bernoulli, nephew of the two elder Bernoullis, who was Mathematical professor in that University. During his stay at Venice, Stirling contrived to gain access to the manufacture of glass plates, and escaping at some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> risk, he is said to have transferred the secret to England. He now conducted a mathematical or nautical school on Tower Hill, while he maintained a correspondence with the philosophers both abroad and at home. Here he published his great work on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENTIAL\">Differential</a> Method and Series in 1730. After toiling in his academy several years, he was induced to leave London, and undertake the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MINES\">Mines</a> at Leadhills in Scotland. In that elevated district near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SANQUHAR\">Sanquhar</a> he resided during the rest of his life, and by his skill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> he greatly improved the operations of extracting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> ore. He now held a profitable employment, but his high mathematical fame would have secured him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of succeeding Maclaurin in 1746, if he had not at that unhappy period been tainted with Jacobite principles. In his latter years he seems to have confined his attention to practical concerns, and died at Leadhills in 1772.\nmathematician followed no general procedure, but showed great felicity and address in transforming one series into another. The subject was at different times partially extended by Simpson, Maclaurin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANDEN\">Landen</a>, Lorgna, Hutton, Waring, Pfaff, and Kramp. Euler handled Series with his usual fulness, perspicuity, and penetration; and yet Lagrange and Laplace, in surveying that field, have gleaned fresh discoveries, which the latter of these illustrious men applied most happily to develope the Theory of Probabilities.\n\nThe composition of equations was at the same time investigated with more address and precision. The rule for distinguishing the positive and negative roots from the alternating signs, which Descartes had merely stated, now received a strict demonstration by Segner. The mode of finding the impossible roots, or rather the quadratic factors, of an equation, which Newton probably had inferred from mere induction, was traced by Maclaurin to its real source. D'Alembert proved that every irrational expression is reducible to the form $A^2 = \\sqrt{-B^2}$; or, in other words, that every compound expression of a higher order may be resolved either into simple or quadratic factors. This is the most important conclusion perhaps relating to the nature of equations. But the general theory was never so clearly and completely discussed as by Gauss, in a small work published by him in 1779. Various methods, and several of them elegant, have been proposed by Euler and others for simplifying and expediting the approximation to the roots of equations. When a question involved the powers and products of more than one unknown quantity, it exercised the skill of algebraists to separate them; but Bezout has brought the mode of this elimination into a regular system, which removes all the difficulties. Among the promoters of Algebraical Science may be ranked our countryman Dr Waring, a profound analyst, but unfortunately an obscure and confused writer. His Miscellanea Analytica and other detached pieces discover uncommon penetration and originality of conception, and though neglected at home, they have, notwithstanding their repulsive form, been duly appreciated by the great mathematicians on the Continent.\n\nThe latest improvement that Algebra has received consists in the Combinatorial Analysis, which may be viewed as an important extension of the principles of the binomial theorem. Vieta traced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of the doctrine, which was successively enlarged by Mersenne, Guldinus, Schooten, Pascal, Wallis, James Bernoulli, De Moivre, and Euler. But it has received its greatest expansion in Germany, and chiefly from the laborious and persevering researches of Hindenburg, who first published a tract on this subject in 1779, and resumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> in the years 1793, 1794, and 1795. He was followed in the same line of investigation by Bureckhardt, Rothe, De Prassi, and Pfaff; and this interesting branch of analysis now forms a part of the algebraical course pursued in the German States. It throws much light on the theory of equations, renders more general the method of series, and facilitates the calculation of chances.\n\nIn the application of Algebra to Geometry, Euler, pursuing the route marked out in 1727 by Frederick Mayer, has given such extension to the properties of Angular Sections, as to create almost a new science, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the appellation of the Arithmetic of Series. Vieta prepared the\n\n---\n\n1 Stephen Bezout, born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NEMOURS\">Nemours</a> on the 31st <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1730\u2014led accidentally to the study of Geometry, and fired by the perusal of the Eloges of Fontenelle. Having soon distinguished himself by proficiency in Mathematical Science, he was appointed Examiner to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NAVY\">Navy</a> in 1763, and Examiner of the Artillery Department 1768. In the discharge of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> in those offices, he gained the love and respect of the youth by his impartiality, kindness, and solicitude for their advancement. He published The General Theory of Equations in 1779, and gave further proofs of his original inventive powers in other occasional Memoirs. But he has owed his celebrity chiefly to the excellent Course of Mathematics compiled for professional education, which is highly esteemed and generally adopted on the Continent. The constitution of Bezout was prematurely exhausted, and he died of a malignant fever on the 27th of September 1793.\n\n2 Edward Waring, born near Shrewsbury in 1736. He studied at Cambridge, where he distinguished himself so much in abstract calculations, that he was elected, after a hard contest, Lucasian professor of Mathematics in January 1760. He led the life of a recluse student, and though a man of great worth, he was unfitted by his extreme diffidence for the general intercourse of society. His latter years appear to have been spent at his place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATIVITY\">nativity</a>, where he died on the 16th August 1798. Waring had not entirely confined his application to mathematical research; he printed a metaphysical tract of considerable merit, which was distributed among his friends; and it deserves mention, that he there distinctly brought forward the philosophical view of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAUSATION\">Causation</a> which is now very generally embraced.\nway, and the Bernoullis had advanced far in the research, but it was reserved for their great disciple to expand and convert their conclusions into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> body of doctrine. This important branch of Analysis has continued to be much cultivated in Germany, under the more expressive name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GONIOMETRY\">Goniometry</a>, which was first applied by Lagny in the Parisian Transactions for 1724, to an ingenious method proposed by him for measuring angles. Pfaff has lately enlarged it with the properties of the multiple tangents, and his countryman Mollweide has likewise made some valuable additions. The store of formulae now collected is of the utmost utility in transforming and reducing into practical operation the different series adopted by Physical Astronomy.\n\nAlgebra has also been applied with advantage to Goniometry generally, as comprehending the solution of the cases both in Plane and Spherical Trigonometry. This was early attempted by Girard, but carried to its completion by Euler and Lagrange. Some concise and elegant formulae have been deduced, which facilitate and diversify the practice of computation. In short, if Algebra were purged of the vitiuous language and inaccurate conceptions that pervade it, and which were early introduced by the confidence of rapid and careless calculators, it might at last claim the character of a perfect science.\n\nThe number of elementary treatises of Algebra which have been produced in various languages during the currency of the eighteenth century, appears quite incredible. They are almost ephemeral, and assume every feature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a>, superficial or profound, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of a primer to the magnitude of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEXICON\">lexicon</a>. A very few of those works claim the highest praise, and may retain their hold of education. The Algebra of Euler is in various respects a most remarkable production. That illustrious analyst, when totally deprived of sight in his advanced age, dictated it in the German language to a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a>, whom he trained for an amanuensis. He was obliged therefore to be plain, distinct, and perspicuous; and these qualities he combined with richness of invention. The second volume had an air of originality, which made it peculiarly interesting. It treated of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DIOPHANTINE_PROBLEMS\">Diophantine Problems</a>, and the resolution of Indeterminate Equations, and was afterwards expanded in the French version by the masterly annotations of Lagrange. In our own language, Maclaurin's Elements of Algebra, though a posthumous work, is perhaps the ablest on the whole, and the most complete. The bulky volumes of Dr Sanderson, which were likewise printed after the death of the author, are commendable chiefly as the production of an ingenious person, afflicted from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a> with the calamity of total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>; they have little claims to depth, originality, or logical precision, but possess the merit of being eminently clear, methodical, and copious even to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>. The Algebra of Thomas Simpson is a work of an opposite description\u2014brief, condensed, and marked with traits of invention. Passing over the numerous smaller treatises which have run through the schools, the compilation of Emerson deserves notice. It forms part of the Cyclomathesis, or\n\n---\n\n1 This consists in performing by the help of compasses a repeated decomposition, similar to what is effected in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of a common to a continued fraction. There being in practice generally a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> of errors, the numerical relation hence derived approximates to great precision. The method may be applied to the comparison either of arcs or of straight lines.\n\n2 The collection of formulae by Hirsch deserves particular commendation.\n\n3 Nicholas Sanderson, born at Thurleston in Yorkshire in 1689. When only twelve months old, he lost both eyeballs by small-pox; but showing early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, he was sent to the free-school at Penniston, where he made great proficiency in the knowledge of the classics, and soon understood the works of the ancient Geometers when read to him in the original Greek. He afterwards profited by the kind instructions of some mathematical friends, and found himself so far advanced in science, that at the age of 25 he repaired to Cambridge, and established his fame in that university by the warmth and splendour of his lectures on the New and Philosophy. He was encouraged by the gentleness of Whiston, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> no rival; and, on the election of that eminent enthusiast in 1711 as head of dogmatism, proceeded to the Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics, the duties of which he continued henceforth to perform with zeal and assiduity. The faculties of touch and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> he possessed in a wonderful degree; and he was a lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, breathing a free and open disposition. But sedentary habits impaired his vigorous constitution, and he died of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> on the 19th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1739.\n\n4 William Emerson, born in June 1701 at Hurworth, a village near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DARLINGTON\">Darlington</a>\u2014the son of a schoolmaster, who taught him Mathematics, and left him a small property, which he occupied and cultivated. He was a person of strong intellect.\nseries of elementary works in all the departments of Mathematics and Mechanical Philosophy, executed with ability by that singular man; exhibiting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of valuable matter, clothed in a slovenly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, and digested without method, or any regard to taste or elegance. Nothing is more wanted for the purpose of education than a classical treatise on Algebra, which, avoiding all vague terms and hasty analogies, should unfold the principles with simplicity and rigid accuracy, and follow the train of induction with close and philosophical circumspection.\n\n4. THE HIGHER CALCULUS.\n\nLeibnitz, at his death, left the Calculus which he had framed in a most flourishing condition. The superiority of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALGORITHM\">algorithm</a>, joined to the ardour of his disciples and successors the Bernoullis, gave it the complete possession of the Continent. But in England, the Method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLUXIONS\">Fluxions</a>, now greatly in arrear, was cultivated only by a very few aspirants. Its inventor had vacillated about the notation he should adopt, and the unfortunate marking by points appeared the first time in one of the volumes of Dr Wallis' works, printed in 1699. Newton had published nothing separately on the subject, till the Tract on Fluxions, drawn from the recesses of his closet, made its appearance in 1704; which, though full of ingenuity, was then decidedly imperfect and insufficient. But Cotes* and Taylor\u2020 laboured successfully in extending the analytical discoveries of their great master. The former, one of the brightest mathematicians whom England has produced, died at an early age, after achieving, however, some fine analytical discoveries. Besides producing the beautiful geometrical theorem on which is founded the application of Binomial Factors, he constructed an ample Table of Fluents or Integrals, which were solved by the decomposition of fractions, by Logarithms or Circular Arcs. Other ingenious problems are introduced in his posthumous volume entitled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARMONIA\">Harmonia</a> Mensurarum, published in 1722 by his relative and successor Dr Smith; but for want of the author's revision, this profound tract is unluckily so concise and obscure as to need a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a>. Some of the propositions were neatly demonstrated by John Bernoulli; but De Moivre considerably extended the doctrine, which was afterwards reduced into a systematic form by Walmesley.\n\nDr Brook Taylor was a man of rich invention and elegant accomplishments, who supported with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> the reputation of English science. He was indeed our only mathematician that,\n\nand considerable talent of invention; but affected singularity, and indulged coarse boorish habits. Having a mechanical turn, he constructed his own instruments, and delineated all the figures he wanted. His best work, perhaps, was the treatise of Increments, but his System of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a> has had the greatest currency among all ranks of students. In the decline of life he suffered much from the cruel attacks of gravel, and died after a lingering illness on the 20th May 1732.\n\nThe earliest mode used by Newton for denoting a Fluxion seems to have been a zero prefixed to the variable quantity. Thus, the fluxion of $x^n$ was written $x^{n-1} \\cdot x$. It is evident therefore that the great inventor must have then had nearly the same conception of the origin of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVISIBLES\">Indivisibles</a> as his rival Leibnitz.\n\n* Roger Cotes, born July 10, 1682, at Burbach in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEICESTERSHIRE\">Leicestershire</a>, of which his father was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RECTOR\">rector</a>. Having shown an early and decided inclination to Mathematics, he was encouraged by his uncle, the Rev. John Smith, who carried the boy to his house in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LINCOLNSHIRE\">Lincolnshire</a>, and carefully instructed him in the principles of science. Hence he removed to St Paul's school, where he made great progress in classical attainments, but still found leisure to cultivate his favourite studies. Thus accomplished, he was sent to Trinity College at Cambridge, and advanced through all the gradations with unrivalled distinction. In January 1706, he was elected unanimously to the chair of Astronomy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Experimental Philosophy</a>, which had been just founded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARCHDEACON\">Archdeacon</a> Plume. He took orders in 1713, and at the desire of Dr Bentley superintended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> of the second edition of the Principia, to which he furnished a learned and ingenious preface. His genius and uncommon talents had raised the highest expectations, when a putrid fever snatched him away in the full tide of vigour, on the 5th of June 1716. Newton in his latter days used often to exclaim with a modest feeling of regret, \"If Cotes had lived, we should have known something.\" This very promising philosopher was perhaps rather ambitious; for, except a short but ingenious essay on Logarithms, he produced nothing of decided importance during his lifetime. The papers left by him in an imperfect and unfinished state were collected and published with some annotations by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a> and successor Dr Robert Smith.\n\n\u2020 Born in affluent circumstances at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDMONTON\">Edmonton</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a> in 1682; studied at Cambridge, where he distinguished himself, and passed through the successive gradations with the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a>. The mathematical and physical sciences were his favourite pursuits, but he embraced general learning and cultivated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">fine arts</a>, being especially fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> and music. Fortune enabled him to indulge his taste. He held the office of Secretary to the Royal Society for a few years, and afterwards visited the Continent. His mind was most acute and inventive; but, though methodical on the whole, he was at no pains to unfold his original conceptions. He died at an early age in 1731.\nafter the retreat of Newton, could safely enter the lists with the Bernoullis. His most original work, the *Methodus Incrementorum*, published in 1715, unfolded the elements of the increase and decrease of a variable quantity or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>. It was a fine extension of the Differential or Fluxionary Calculus, and constituted a new and important branch of the Higher Analysis, which has since received an appropriate algorithm, and acquired the appellation of *Finite Differences*. The *Method of Increments* was applied to the summation of series, and a variety of difficult problems, of which it afforded easy and rapid solutions. It furnished the first investigation of the motions of a vibrating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>, showing that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARMONIC\">harmonic</a> curve is a Trochoid or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROLATE\">Prolate</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYCLOID\">Cycloid</a>. Among other improvements, it contained the celebrated theorem for the expansion of a magnitude, arising from the combination of its successive orders of differentials, which has deservedly retained the name of its ingenious author. This elegant formula is of extensive use in almost every analytical inquiry, and even performs the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> process of Fluxions, by exhibiting in many cases at once the resulting fluent or integral. But the notation employed was imperfect, consisting merely of accents instead of points; and the Tract, like other works of Taylor, affected a degree of brevity which borders on obscurity. It was therefore elucidated by Nicole, an eminent French mathematician, in a series of able dissertations, between the years 1717 and 1727. The Taylorian Theorem itself has been successively modified, transformed, and extended by Maclaurin, Lagrange, and Laplace, whose names are attached to their several formul\u00e6.\n\nThe Italian mathematicians contributed materially to the progress of the Higher Calculus. The Integration of a class of Differential Equations was proposed by Count Riccati, and solved in different ways by himself and the sons and nephews of the first Bernoullis. Manfredi\\(^1\\) in 1707 gave a skilful solution of differential equations of the first degree; and in 1722, Vincent, the son of James Riccati, pursued likewise the same road. A curious kind of problems was started by Fagnano,\\(^2\\) another Italian Count, to determine those Elliptical or Hyperbolic Arcs, which have their difference expressed by an algebraical quantity. This led Euler, in 1756, to invent a very comprehensive method of determining particular integrals, that Lagrange improved in 1766 and 1769, and which he himself again simplified in 1778. Our ingenious countryman Landen has chanced to fall into a similar train, having in 1775 converted the formula for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECTIFICATION\">rectification</a> of the Hyperbola into another which includes two arcs of an Ellipse, together with an algebraical quantity. The rectification of the Ellipse has been since improved by Legendre and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-IVORY\">Ivory</a>.\n\nTo obtain the differential of any integral expression, is always practicable; the great difficulty consists in reversing the problem, and finding the integral which corresponds to a given differential equation. Such equation must be rendered complete before the integration is effected. It was hence a question of much importance, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> unavailing efforts, by determining the conditions necessarily required for integration. Euler, as usual, was the first to discover the rule in 1736; but, only three years afterwards, it was without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> produced by Fontaine and Clairaut. At a later period, Euler extended the conditions of integrability to the higher orders of Differential Equations, which Condorcet demonstrated with equal simplicity and elegance.\n\nThe Modern Analysis thus constantly advancing, received a capital extension about the middle of the last century, by what is termed the *Calculus of Partial Differences*, which applies with singular felicity to the solution of the most arduous and recondite physical problems. It would be difficult to communicate any distinct conception of this subtle doctrine to the uninitiated, but the object proposed may be stated generally as, the method of finding the function of several\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Born at Bologna in 1674\u2014appointed professor of Mathematics there in 1698, and astronomer to the Institute of Bologna in 1711. He died in 1739, having produced several excellent works, in which his taste, learning, and science appear conspicuous.\n\n\\(^2\\) Born about 1690 at Senegaglia in the Roman State, where he died in 1760. His mathematical researches were published in two volumes quarto, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PESARO\">Pesaro</a>, in 1750. He devoted much attention to the remarkable properties of the curves called Lemniscates.\nvariable quantities, from the relation merely of the Differential Co-efficients contained in their Complete Differential. The first specimen of this sort of Integration was given by Euler in 1734; but D'Alembert expanded the process in his Discourse on the General Cause of Winds, which appeared in 1749. It was likewise employed by both these illustrious mathematicians in the rigorous solution of the problem of the vibrating musical string, the position of any point in the harmonic curve depending evidently on the interval of time, as well as on the relation between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ABSCISS\">absciss</a> and ordinate. But Euler left nothing unfinished. In 1762 he resumed the subject of Partial Differences, and gave a complete explication of its principles, embodying the mode of calculation by an appropriate Algorithm, in a memoir of the Petersburg Acts, entitled, Investigatio functionum ex data differentiacione conditione. But still further progress was made by him in the third volume of his immortal work on the Differential and Integral Calculus, which came out in 1770. Euler, having then advanced to differential equations of the second order, digested the whole doctrine of Partial Differences into a clear and systematic form. Yet several important additions and improvements have been since contributed to this intricate subject by Lagrange and Laplace, by Nieuport and Trembley.\n\nThe last great accession to the Higher Analysis, and somewhat resembling the method of Partial Differences, is the Calculus of Variations. Of this fine theory, the first trace was shown by the rapid genius of Leibnitz, in his mode of differentiating a curve whose equation itself is supposed to undergo the minutest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>. The controversies of the Bernoullis concerning Isoperimeters and Lines of the Swiftest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">Descent</a>, augmented greatly the various resources of that kind of Analysis. But Euler, combining their discoveries, produced a new and direct mode of finding such Maxima and Minima, and compressed the solutions into a systematic form, in a distinct treatise published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAUSANNE\">Lausanne</a> in 1744. This elaborate performance led the way for the simpler and most elegant and comprehensive doctrine created by the early genius of Lagrange, and invested by him with a commodious notation. Euler, who was far superior to any feeling of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a>, readily embraced this improvement, and bestowed on it the denomination of the Calculus of Variations, of which he explained the principles and application, after the most complete manner, in a tract appended to the third volume of his great work. The distinction between Differentials and Variations is rather subtle, yet may be easily conceived by considering the nature of the Parabola. When an ordinate shifts into a proximate position, both it and the corresponding absciss acquire Differentials; but if the Parameter suffer the minutest alteration, the whole trace of the curve will vary, and the infinitesimal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MUTATION\">mutation</a> which the ordinate thence undergoes is termed its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">Variation</a>. The algorithm adopted to denote Variations consists of the Greek letters instead of the Roman or Italic, which have been appropriated to the ordinary Differentials. The modes of Integration used in both forms are fortunately convertible.\n\nThe Integration of Differential Equations has at length, perhaps, nearly attained that degree of perfection of which it is susceptible. A multitude of expedients are devised for effecting the process in particular cases, but no general and direct method has been yet found. To integrate a differential equation of the first order composed of two variable quantities, is the problem originally known by the title of the Inverse Method of Tangents, and is commonly solved by the separation of the indeterminate members, which brings it to a question of Quadratures. Some equations consist of parts which, though not separately integrable, will yet admit of integration when combined. Others are integrated by the inverse method of factors; but the process by successive approximations may be regarded as in most cases the preferable mode. The skill of the analyst is chiefly displayed in the evolution of series the most converging.\n\nOf the Theory of the Infinitesimal Calculus, various modifications have been offered during the course of the eighteenth century, which help to elucidate the subject by their contrast, and may be regarded as fine speculations, though they should lead to no material improvements in the practice. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of flowing quantities,\nfirst proposed by Newton, and from which he framed the terms Fluxions and Fluents, appears, on the whole, very clear and satisfactory; nor should the metaphysical objection of introducing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of motion into Geometry have much weight. Maclaurin was induced, however, by such caviling, to devote half a volume to an able but superfluous discussion of this question. As a refinement on the ancient process of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXHAUSTIONS\">Exhaustions</a>, the noted method of Prime and Ultimate Ratios, or of the Relations of Vanishing or Evanescent Quantities, which Newton preferred in the Principia, deserves the highest praise for accuracy of conception. It has been justly commended by D'Alembert, who expounded it copiously, and adopted it as the basis of the Higher Calculus. The same doctrine was likewise elucidated by our acute countryman Robins, who did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCRUPLE\">scruple</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> the occasion of making a coarse attack on the great Euler. Landen, one of those men so frequent in England whose talents surmount their narrow education, produced, in 1758, a new form of the Fluxionary Calculus, under the title of Residual Analysis, which, though framed with little elegance, may be deemed, on the whole, an improvement on the method of ultimate ratios. To confer more consequence on his innovation, he contrived likewise a set of symbols, and applied his algorithm to the solution of different problems. But it never obtained any currency, and soon fell into oblivion.\n\nThe method of Analytical or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DERIVATIVE\">Derivative</a> Functions, which has since acquired such celebrity, was darkly anticipated by Dr Waring, one of the profoundest but most obscure of algebraical writers. This elegant theory was concisely sketched by Lagrange in 1772, and enlarged thirty years afterwards into a distinct work; the same subject having been treated very fully and somewhat differently by Arbogast in 1800. It is grounded chiefly on the inversion of Taylor's theorem, the co-efficients of the several terms of a Derived or Expanded Function involving the successive orders of its Differentials. But Lagrange deduces the formula from considerations purely analytical, and endeavours thence to erect a science on strict logical principles, entirely disengaged from ideas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFINITESIMALS\">Infinitesimals</a> or of Vanishing Ratios. It may however be doubted whether, with all his ingenuity, he has attained that object, or gained, indeed, any real advantage. A mathematician so deeply imbued as that sublime genius with the spirit of calculation, would almost spontaneously regard a process of analysis in the same light as a train of legitimate reasoning. However satisfactory may seem the origin of Derivative Functions, if we examine it closely, we shall probably find the demonstration to rest merely on the strength of analogy, which surely is not the most conclusive sort of argument. But though the method of Derivations should not possess that logical superiority over the Fluxionary or Differential Calculus.\n\n---\n\n4 Benjamin Robins, born of Quaker parents at Bath in 1707. He discovered early and powerful talents, which he improved with intense ardour, and soon emancipated himself from the trammels of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. Mathematics were his favourite study, but he enriched his mind by a course of extensive reading and the pursuit of general information. He became a successful teacher of those sciences in London, and turned his attention to their practical application. Having cultivated also the art of writing, he distinguished himself by several controversial pieces in science, and even assisted by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> the opposition to Walpole's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>.

His various mathematical works are stamped with originality of conception, and composed in a clear, neat, and forcible style.\n\n5 John Landen, born at Peakirk in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NORTHAMPTONSHIRE\">Northamptonshire</a> in January 1719. Bred up to business, he showed an early talent for Mathematics, which he strenuously cultivated at his leisure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>. In 1762 he was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> to Earl Fitzwilliam, an employment which he held till within two years of his death. Besides his separate publications, he communicated to the Royal Society, at different times, valuable papers on the most difficult parts of mathematical and physical science, all of them distinguished by depth, ingenuity, and powerful invention. It is only to be regretted that, perhaps for want of the collision of society, he indulged a dogmatic and pugnacious temper. He died near his native spot on the 15th of January 1790.\n\nAn example will show how Landen's operation might be simplified. Let it be required to find the ratio of the differential of $x$ to that of $x^n$. Assume $v$ a proximate value or state of the variable $x$; then by division $\\frac{x^n - v^n}{x - v} = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}v + \\ldots + xv^{n-1} + v^n$, the number of terms being $n$. But it is evident that the closer $x$ comes to $v$, the nearer will each of these terms approximate to $x^{n-1}$. Therefore, at the coincidence of $x$ with $v$, the differential of $x^n$ divided by the differential of $x$ is $x^{n-1}$, and consequently $dx^n = x^{n-1} dx$.\nlus which its author fondly supposed, yet is the invention entitled to the highest praise for its beautiful perspicuity and its ready and most extensive application. We have only to regret that it has required a new system of characters, when the ordinary notation has become so familiar, and attained so great perfection.

His heart sought little abroad, but contentedly dwelt in his family and in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>. He was one of those men of genius who repaid the tender care of a mother by rocking the cradle of her reposing age. He ended a life spent in searching for truth, and exercising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, by desiring that he should be buried in his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>, with his \"dear father and mother.\" Some of these delightful qualities were perhaps hidden from the casual observer in general society, by the want of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> simplicity of manner which is doubtless their natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REPRESENTATIVE\">representative</a>. Manner is a better mark of the state of a mind, than those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and deliberate actions which form what is called conduct. It is the constant and insensible transpiration of character. In serious acts a man may display himself. In the thousand nameless acts which compose manner, the mind betrays its habitual bent. But manner is then only an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> of disposition, when it is that of men who live at ease in the intimate familiarity of friends and equals. It may be diverted from simplicity by causes which do not reach so deep as the character; by bad models, or by a restless and wearisome anxiety to shine, arising from many circumstances, none of which are probably more common than the unseasonable exertions of a recluse student in society, and the\n\n---\n\n1 See Sir H. Moncreiff's Life of the Reverend Dr Erskine.\n2 Welsh's Life of Brown, p. 77, and App. p. 498.\n3 A part of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>'s minutes is here borrowed from Mr Welsh:\u2014\"7th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1797.\u2014Present, Mr Erskine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a>,\u2014Mr Brougham, Mr Reddie, Mr Brown, Mr Birbeck, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>,\" &c. who were afterwards joined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Webb Seymour, Messrs Horner, Jeffrey, Smyth, &c., Mr Erskine, who thus appears at the head of so remarkable an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>, and whom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DILAPIDATION\">dilapidation</a> and untoward circumstances have hitherto withheld from the full manifestation of his powers, continued to be the bosom friend of Brown to the last, and showed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> of his friendship for others by converting all his invaluable preparations for a translation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SULTAN\">Sultan</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BABER\">Baber</a>'s Commentaries (perhaps the best, certainly the most European work of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a>) into the means of completing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> attempt of Leyden; with a regard equally generous to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of his early friend, and to the comfort of that friend's surviving relations. The review of Baber's Commentaries, by M. Silvestre de Sacy, in the Journal des Savans for May and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1829, is perhaps one of the best specimens extant of the value of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> commendation when it is bestowed with conscientious calmness, and without a suspicion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BIAS\">bias</a>, by one of the greatest orientalists, in a case where he pronounces every thing to have been done by Mr Erskine \"which could have been performed by the most learned and the most scrupulously conscientious of editors and translators.\"\nunfortunate attempts of some others, to take by violence the admiration of those with whom they do not associate with ease. The association with unlike or superior companions which least distorts manners, is that which takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> with those classes whose secure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> generally renders their own manners easy; with whom the art of pleasing or of not displeasing each other in society is a serious concern; who have leisure enough to discover the positive and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> parts of the smaller moralities; and who, being trained to a watchful eye on what is ludicrous, apply the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LASH\">lash</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> to affectation, the most ridiculous of faults. The busy in every department of life are too respectably occupied to form these manners or to bestow them. They are the frivolous work of polished idleness; and perhaps their most serious value consists in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAR\">war</a> which they wage against affectation; though even there they betray their nature in punishing it, not as a deviation from nature, but as a badge of vulgarity.\n\nThe prose of Dr Brown is brilliant to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a>. It must not be denied that its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> is sometimes womanly; that it too often melts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> precision into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>; that it buries the main idea under a load of illustration, of which every part is expanded and adorned with such a visible labour, as to withdraw the mind from attention to the thoughts which it professes to introduce more easily into the understanding. It is darkened by excessive brightness; it loses ease and liveliness by over-dress; and, in the midst of its luscious sweetness, we wish for the striking and homely illustrations of Tucker, and for the pithy and sinewy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of Paley, either of whom, by a single short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METAPHOR\">metaphor</a> from a familiar, perhaps a low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, could at one blow set the two worlds of reason and fancy in movement.\n\nIt would be unjust to censure severely the declamatory parts of his Lectures; they are excusable in the first warmth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>. They might even be justifiable allurements in attracting young hearers to abstruse speculations. Had he lived, he would probably have taken his thoughts out of the declamatory forms of spoken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, and given to them the appearance, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>, of deep and subtile discussion. The habits indeed of so successful a lecturer, and the natural luxuriancy of his mind, could not fail to have somewhat tinctured all his compositions; but though he might still have fallen short of simplicity, he certainly would have avoided much of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>, and even common-place, which hang heavily on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> and brilliant thoughts; for it must be owned, that though, as a thinker, he is unusually original, yet when he falls among the declaimers, he is infected by their common-places.\n\nIn like manner, he would assuredly have shortened or left out many of the poetical quotations which he loved to recite, and which hearers even beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> hear with delight. There are two very different sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of poetry to be found in works on philosophy, which are as far asunder from each other in value as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. A philosopher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> admit some of those wonderful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> or words which bring to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> varieties of character, the furious bursts or wily workings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, the winding approaches of temptation, the slippery path to depravity, the beauty of tenderness, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> of what is awful and holy in man. In every such quotation, the moral philosopher, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he be successful, uses the best materials of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>; for what are they but the results of experiment and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> on the human heart, performed by artists of far other skill and power than his? They are facts which could have only been ascertained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, by Dante, by Shakspeare, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CERVANTES\">Cervantes</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>. Every year of admiration since the unknown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> when the Iliad first gave delight, has extorted new proofs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of human nature, from the responding hearts of the admirers. Every strong feeling which these masters have excited is a successful repetition of their original experiment, and a continually growing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of the greatness of their discoveries. Quotations of this nature may be the most satisfactory, as well as the most delightful, proofs of philosophical positions. Others of inferior merit are not to be interdicted\u2014a pointed maxim, especially when familiar, pleases, and is recollected. I cannot entirely conquer my passion for the Roman and Stoical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a> of some passages in Lucan and Akenside. But\nquotations from those who have written on philosophy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>; or, in other words, from those who generally are inferior philosophers, and voluntarily deliver their doctrines in the most disadvantageous form, seem to be unreasonable. It is agreeable, no doubt, to the philosopher, still more to the youthful student, to meet his abstruse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> clothed in the sonorous verse of Akenside. The surprise of the unexpected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of verse with science is a very lawful enjoyment. But such slight and momentary pleasures, though they may tempt the writer to display them, do not excuse a vain effort to obtrude them on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a> of the searcher after truth in after-times. It is peculiarly unlucky that Dr Brown should have sought supposed ornament from the moral common-places of Thomson, rather than from that illustration of philosophy which is really to be found in his picturesque strokes.\n\nMuch more need not be said of Dr Brown's own poetry, somewhat voluminous as it is, than that it indicates fancy and feeling, and rose at least to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of an elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a>. It may seem a paradox, but it appears to me that he is really most poetical in those poems and passages which have the most properly metaphysical character. For every various form of life and nature, when it is habitually contemplated, may inspire feeling; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> representation of these feelings may be poetical. Dr Brown observed man, and his wider world, with the eye of a metaphysician; and the dark results of such contemplations, when he reviewed them, often filled his soul with feelings which, being both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and melancholy, were truly poetical. Unfortunately, however, few readers can be touched with fellow-feeling. He sings to few, and must be content with sometimes moving a string in the soul of the lonely visionary, who, in the day-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> of youth, has felt as well as meditated on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of nature. His heart has produced charming passages in all his poems; but, generally speaking, they are only beautiful works of art and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>. The choice of Akenside as a favourite and a model may, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEROGATION\">derogation</a> from that writer, be considered as no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of a poetically formed mind. There is more poetry in many single lines of Cowper than in volumes of sonorous verses such as Akenside's. Philosophical poetry is very different from versified philosophy. The former is the highest exertion of genius, the latter cannot be ranked above the slighter amusements of ingenuity. Dr Brown's poetry was, it must be owned, composed either of imitations, which, with some exceptions, may be produced and read without feeling, or of effusions of such feelings only as meet a rare and faint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ECHO\">echo</a> in the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>.\n\nA few words only can here be bestowed on the intellectual part of his philosophy. It is an open revolt against the authority of Reid; and, by a curious concurrence, he began to lecture nearly at the moment when the doctrines of that philosopher came to be taught with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> in France. Mr Stewart had dissented from the language of Reid, and had widely departed from his opinions on several secondary theories. Dr Brown rejected them entirely. He very justly considered the claim of Reid to the merit of detecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> delusion which had betrayed philosophers into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that ideas which were the sole objects of knowledge had a separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>, as a proof of his having mistaken their illustrative language for a metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>; but he does not do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> which Reid really rendered to mental science, by keeping the attention of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> speculators in a state of more constant watchfulness against the transient influence of such an illusion. His choice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> feeling to denote the operations which we usually refer to the understanding, is evidently too wide a departure from its ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, to have any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a>. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> can strip so familiar a word of the thoughts and emotions which have so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> accompanied it, so as to fit it for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> term of the highest\n\n---\n\n1 His accomplished friend Mr Erskine confesses that Brown's poems \"are not written in the language of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a>. The string touched is too delicate for general sympathy. They are in an unknown tongue, to one half\" (he might have said nineteen twentieths) \"of the reading part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>.\" (Welsch's Life of Brown, p. 431.)\n2 Brown's Lectures, vol. II. p. 1-49.\nabstraction. If we can be said to have a feeling \"of the equality of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of forty-five degrees to half the angle of ninety degrees,\"\u00b9 we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALL\">call</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">Arithmetic</a> sciences of feeling. He has very forcibly stated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of assuming \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> universal intuitions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> belief,\" which, in their nature, are incapable of all proof. They seem to be accurately described as notions which cannot be conceived separately, but without which nothing can be conceived. They are not only necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> and to belief, but to thought itself. It is equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to prove or to disprove them. He has very justly blamed the school of Reid for \"an extravagant and ridiculous\" multiplication of those principles which he truly represents as inconsistent with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> philosophy. To philosophize is indeed nothing more than to simplify securely.\u00b2\n\nThe substitution of suggestion for the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a>, association of ideas, would hardly deserve notice in so cursory a view, if it had not led him to a serious misconception of the doctrines and deserts of other philosophers. The fault of the latter phrase is rather in the narrowness of the last, than in the inadequacy of the first word. Association presents the fact in the light of a relation between two mental acts. Suggestion denotes rather the power of the one to call up the other. But whether we say that the sight of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> suggests fire, or that the ideas of fire and ashes are associated, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to convey the same fact; and, in both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, an exact thinker means to accompany the fact with no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>. Dr Brown has supposed the word association as intended to affirm that there was some \"intermediate process\"\u00b3 between the original succession of the mental acts, and the power which they acquired therefrom of calling up each other. This is quite as much to raise up imaginary antagonists for the honour of conquering them, as he justly reprehends Dr Reid for doing in the treatment of preceding philosophers. He falls into another more important and unaccountable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, in representing his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Mr Hume's principles of association (resemblance, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">contrariety</a>, causation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTIGUITY\">contiguity</a> in time or place) to the one principle of contiguity, as a discovery of his own, by which his theory is distinguished from \"the universal opinion of philosophers.\"\u2074 Nothing but too exclusive a consideration of the doctrines of the Scottish school could have led him to speak thus of what was hinted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, distinctly laid down by Hobbes, and fully unfolded both by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a> and Condillac. He has, however, extremely enlarged the proof and the illustration of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of mind, by the exercise of \"a more subtile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>,\" and the disclosure of \"a finer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a>.\"\u2075 As he has thus aided and confirmed, though he did not discover the general law, so he has rendered a new and very important service to mental science, by what he properly calls \"secondary laws of suggestion\"\u2076 or association,\u2014circumstances which modify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the general law, and must be distinctly considered, in order to explain its connection with the phenomena. The enumeration and exposition are instructive, and the example is worthy of commendation. For it is in this lower region of science that most remains to be discovered; it is that which rests most on observation, and least tempts to controversy; it is by improvements in that part of knowledge that the foundations are secured, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> so repaired as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> steadily on them. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of common language between the head and the heart, which, as we have seen, is so often overlooked or misapplied by metaphysicians, is, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of Brown, signified by the terms \"mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a>\" and \"emotions.\" It is unlucky that no single word could be found for the former, and that the use of \"feeling,\" as the generic term, should disturb its easy\n\n\u00b9 Brown's Lectures, vol. I. p. 222.\n\u00b2 Dr Brown always expresses himself best where he is short and familiar. \"An hypothesis is nothing more than a reason for making one experiment or observation rather than another.\" (Lectures, vol. I. p. 170.) In 1812, as the present writer observed to him that Reid and Hume differed more in words than in opinion, he answered, \"Yes, Reid bawled out, we must believe an outward world; but added in a whisper, we can give no reason for our belief.\" Hume cries out, we can give no reason for such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a>; and whispers, I own we cannot get rid of it.\"\n\u00b3 Lectures, vol. II. p. 335-347.\n\u2074 Ibid. vol. II. p. 349.\n\u2075 Ibid. vol. II. p. 216, &c.\n\u2076 Ibid. vol. II. p. 270.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> when it is applied more naturally.\n\nIn our more proper province he has followed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>, who appears to have been chiefly known to him through Mr Stewart, in the theory of the social affections. Their disinterestedness is enforced by the arguments of both these philosophers, as well as of Hutcheson. It is observable, however, that he applies the principle of suggestion or association boldly to this part of human nature, and seems inclined to refer to it even sympathy itself. It is hard to understand how, with such a disposition on the subject of a principle so generally thought ultimate as Sympathy, he should, inconsistently with himself, follow Mr Stewart in representing the theory which derives the affections from association as \"a Modification of the Selfish System.\" He mistakes that theory by stating, that it derives the affections from our experience that our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> was connected with that of others; while in truth it considers our regard to our own interest as formed from the same original pleasures by association, which, by the like process, may and do directly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> affections towards others, without passing through the channel of regard to our general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. But, says he, this is only an hypothesis, since the formation of these affections is acknowledged to belong to a time of which there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a>;\u2014an objection fatal to every theory of any mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>,\u2014subversive, for example, of Berkeley's discovery of acquired visual perception, and most strangely inconsistent in the mouth of a philosopher whose numerous simplifications of mental theory are and must be founded on occurrences which precede experience. It is in all other cases, and it must be in this, sufficient that the principle of the theory is really existing, that it explains the appearances, that its supposed action resembles what we know to be its action in those similar cases of which we have direct experience. Lastly, he in express words admits that, according to the theory to which he objects, we have affections which are at present disinterested. Is it not a direct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> in terms to call such a theory \"a modification of the selfish system\"? His language in the sequel clearly indicates a distrust of his own statement, and a suspicion that he is not only inconsistent, but altogether mistaken.\n\nAs we enter more deeply into the territory of Ethics, we at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> discover in Brown a distinction, the neglect of which by preceding speculators we have more than once lamented as productive of obscurity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>:\u2014\"The moral affections,\" says he, \"which I consider at present, I consider rather physiologically\" (or, as he elsewhere better expresses it, \"psychologically\") \"than ethically, as parts of our mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, not as involving the fulfilment or violation of duties.\" He immediately, however, loses sight of this distinction, and reasons inconsistently with it, instead of following it to its proper consequences in his explanation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>. Perhaps, indeed, (for the words are capable of more than one sense,) he meant to distinguish the virtuous affections from those sentiments which have morality exclusively in view, rather than to distinguish the theory of moral sentiment from the attempt to ascertain the characteristic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> action. Friendship is conformable in its dictates to morality; but it may, and does exist, without any view to it. He who feels the affections, and performs the duties of friendship, is the object of that distinct emotion which is called moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a>.\n\nIt is on the subject of conscience that, in imitation of Mr Stewart, and with no other arguments than his, he makes his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> stand against the theory which considers the formation of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> itself as probably referable to the necessary and universal operation of those laws of human nature to which he himself ascribes almost every other state of mind. On both sides of this question the supremacy of conscience is alike held to be venerable and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a>.

Let it, however, be also remembered, that we are not driven to this supposition by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> circumstance, that no satisfactory explanation has yet appeared; for there are many analogies in an unexplained state of mind to states already explained, which may justify us in believing that the explanation requires only more accurate observation, and more patient meditation, to be brought to that completeness which it probably will attain.","sp":620,"ep":626},{"h":"WILLIAM PALEY","t":"This excellent writer, who, after Clarke and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>, ought to be ranked among the brightest ornaments of the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> in the eighteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, is, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, naturally placed after Tucker, to whom, with praiseworthy liberality, he owns his extensive obligations. It is a mistake to suppose that he owed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> to Hume, a thinker too refined, and a writer perhaps too elegant, to have naturally attracted him. A coincidence in the principle of utility, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to both with so many other philosophers, affords <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> for the supposition. Had he been habitually influenced by Mr Hume, who has translated so many of the dark and crabbed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of Butler into his own transparent as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, it is not possible to suppose that such a mind as that of Paley should have fallen into those principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> selfishness of which Mr Hume is a uniform and zealous antagonist.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> frame of Paley's understanding fitted it more for business and the world than for philosophy; and he accordingly enjoyed with considerable relish the few opportunities which the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> afforded of taking a part in the affairs of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>. Penetration and shrewdness, firmness and coolness, a vein of pleasantry, fruitful though somewhat unrefined, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> homeliness and significancy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, were\n\n---\n\n1 Much of Tucker's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ON\">on</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">Pleasure</a>, and of Paley's on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">Happiness</a> (both of which are invaluable), is contained in the passage of The Traveller, of which the following couplet expresses the main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>:\n\n\"Unknown to them when sensual pleasures cloy,\nTo fill the languid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PAUSE\">pause</a> with fliter joy.\"\n\n2 An honest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>,\" says Mr Hume, \"has the frequent satisfaction of seeing knaves betrayed by their own maxims.\" (Enquiry into Morals)\n\n\"I used often to laugh at your honest simple neighbour Flamborough, and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAY\">way</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> another generally cheated him once a year. Yet still the honest man went forward without suspicion, and grew rich, while I still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> tricksy and cunning, and was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, without the consolation of being honest.\" (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VICAR\">Vicar</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAKEFIELD\">Wakefield</a>, chap. xxvi.)\n\n3 Born in 1743; died in 1805.\nperhaps more remarkable in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> than the restraints of authorship and profession allowed them to be in his writings. Grateful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> brings this assemblage of qualities with unfaded colours before the mind at the present moment, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of twenty-eight years. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for the common business and ordinary amusements of life fortunately gave a zest to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> which his neighbourhood chanced to yield, without rendering him insensible to the pleasures of intercourse with more enlightened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. The practical bent of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> is visible in the language of his writings, which, on practical matters, is as precise as the nature of the subject requires, but, in his rare and reluctant efforts to rise to first principles, becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> and unsatisfactory; though no man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> was more free from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPEDIMENTS\">impediments</a> which hinder a writer's meaning from being quickly and clearly seen. He seldom distinguishes more exactly than is required for palpable and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> usefulness. He possessed that chastised acuteness of discrimination, exercised on the affairs of men, and habitually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> to a purpose beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> increase of knowledge, which forms the character of a lawyer's understanding, and which is apt to render a mere lawyer too subtile for the management of affairs, and yet too gross for the pursuit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> is as near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> in its kind as any in our language. Perhaps no words were ever more expressive and illustrative than those in which he represents the art of life to be that of rightly \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> our habits.\"\n\nThe most original and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> of his writings is the Horae Paulinae. The Evidences of Christianity are formed out of an admirable translation of Butler's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">Analogy</a>, and a most skilful abridgement of Lardner's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREDIBILITY\">Credibility</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOSPEL\">Gospel</a> History. He may be said to have thus given value to two works, of which the first was scarcely intelligible to most of those who were most desirous of profiting by it; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> soon wearies out the greater part of readers, though the few who are more patient have always been gradually won over to feel pleasure in a display of knowledge, probity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>, and meekness, unmatched by an avowed advocate in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> deeply interesting his warmest feelings. His Natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">Theology</a> is the wonderful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of a man who, after sixty, had studied anatomy in order to write it; and it could only have been surpassed by a man who, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> originality of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> and clearness of exposition, added the advantage of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of physiologists.\n\nIt would be unreasonable here to say much of a work which is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of so many as his Moral and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> Philosophy. A very few remarks on one or two parts of it may be sufficient to estimate his value as a moralist, and to show his defects as a metaphysician. His general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> may indeed be chosen for both purposes. The manner in which he deduces the necessary tendency of all virtuous actions to the general happiness, from the goodness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">Divine</a> Lawgiver, though the principle be not, as has already more than once appeared, peculiar to him, but rather common to most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> philosophers, is characterized by a clearness and vigour which have never been surpassed. It is indeed nearly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not entirely, an identical proposition, that a Being of unmixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> prescribe those laws only to his creatures which contribute to their wellbeing. When we are convinced that a course of conduct is generally beneficial to all men, we cannot help considering it as acceptable to a benevolent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>. The usefulness of actions is the mark set on them by the Supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">Legislator</a>, by which reasonable beings discover it to be His will that such actions should be done. In this apparently unanswerable deduction it is partly admitted, and universally implied, that the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and wrong may be treated apart from the manifestation of them in the Scriptures. If it were otherwise, how could men of perfectly different religions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> with each other on moral subjects? How could they regard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> and duties as subsisting between them? To what common principles could they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a>\n\n---\n\n1 See Animal Mechanic, by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a>, published by the Society for Useful Knowledge.\nin their differences? Even the Polytheists themselves, those worshippers of\n\nGods partial, changeful, passionate, unjust,\nWhose attributes are rage, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>, or lust,\n\nby a happy inconsistency are compelled, however irregularly and imperfectly, to ascribe some general enforcement of the moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CODE\">code</a> to their divinities. If there were no foundation for morality <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANTECEDENT\">antecedent</a> to revealed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, we should want that important test of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a> to pure morality, by which its claim to a divine origin is to be tried. The internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of religion necessarily presupposes such a standard. The Christian contrasts the precepts of the Koran with the pure and benevolent morality of the Gospel. The Mahometan claims, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, a superiority over the Hindoo, inasmuch as the Mussulman religion inculcates the moral perfection of one Supreme Ruler of the world. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CEREMONIAL\">ceremonial</a> and exclusive character of Judaism has ever been regarded as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> that it was intended to pave the way for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> religion,\u2014a morality seated in the heart, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WORSHIP\">worship</a> of sublime simplicity. These discussions would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, unless morality were previously proved or granted to exist. Though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of Ethics is thus far independent, it by no means follows that there is any equality, or that there may not be the utmost inequality, in the moral tendency of religious systems. The most ample scope is still left for the zeal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of those who seek to spread important truth. But it is absolutely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to ethical science that it should contain principles, the authority of which must be recognised by men of every conceivable variety of religious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>.\n\nThe peculiarities of Paley's mind are discoverable in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>, or rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a>, between the practical chapter on Happiness, and the philosophical portion of the chapter on Virtue. \"Virtue is the doing good to mankind, in obedience to the will of God, and for the sake of everlasting happiness.\" It is not perhaps very important to observe, that these words, which he offers as \"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a>,\" ought in propriety to have been called a proposition; but it is much more necessary to say that they contain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> account of virtue. According to this doctrine, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> not done for the sake of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>'s happiness is vicious. Now, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> cannot be said to be done for the sake of any thing which is not present to the mind of the agent at the moment of action. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> in terms to affirm that a man acts for the sake of any object, of which, however it may be the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of his act, he is not at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a> fully aware. The unfelt consequences of his act can no more influence his will than its unknown consequences. Nay, further, a man is only with any propriety said to act for the sake of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> object; nor can he with entire correctness be said to act for the sake of any thing but his sole object. So that it is a necessary consequence of Paley's proposition, that every act which flows from generosity or benevolence is a vice. So also of every act of obedience to the will of God, if it arises from any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> but a desire of the reward which he will bestow. Any act of obedience influenced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, and affection, and veneration towards supreme benevolence and perfection, is so far <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>; and if it arises solely from these motives it becomes a vice. It must be owned, that this excellent and most enlightened man has laid the foundations of religion and virtue in a more intense and exclusive selfishness than was avowed by the Catholic enemies of Fenelon, when they persecuted him for his doctrine of a pure and disinterested <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of God.\n\nIn another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, of a very subordinate kind, the disposition of Paley to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> his principles to his own time and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and to look at them merely as far as they are calculated to amend prevalent vices and errors, betrayed him into narrow and false views. His chapter on what he calls the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">Honour</a> is unjust, even in its own small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, because it supposes honour to allow what it does not forbid; though the truth be, that the vices enumerated by him are only not forbidden by honour, because they are\n\n---\n\n'Paley, book i. chap. vii.'\nnot within its jurisdiction. He considers it as \"a system of rules constructed by people of fashion;\"\u2014a confused and transient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of expression, which may be understood with difficulty by our posterity, and which cannot now be exactly rendered perhaps in any other language.\n\nThe subject, however, thus narrowed and lowered, is neither unimportant in practice, nor unworthy of the consideration of the moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>. Though all mankind honour virtue and despise vice, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of respect or contempt is often far from being proportioned to the place which virtues and vices occupy in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> system of Ethics. Wherever higher honour is bestowed on one moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> than on others of equal or greater moral value, what is called a point of honour may be said to exist. It is singular that so shrewd an observer as Paley should not have observed a law of honour far more permanent than that which attracted his notice, in the feelings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> respecting the conduct of men and women. Cowardice is not so immoral as cruelty, nor indeed so detestable, but it is more despicable and disgraceful. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> point of honour forbids indeed a great vice, but one not so great as many others by which it is not violated. It is easy enough to see, that where we are strongly prompted to a virtue by a natural impulse, we love the man who is constantly actuated by the amiable sentiment, but we do not consider that which is done without difficulty as requiring or deserving admiration and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>. The kind affections are their own rich reward, and they are the object of affection to others. To encourage kindness by praise would be to insult it, besides its effect in producing counterfeits. It is for the conquest of fear, it would be still more for the conquest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>, if that were not; wherever it is real, the cessation of a state of mental agony, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> of mankind is reserved. Observations of a similar nature will easily occur to every reader respecting the point of honour in the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>. The conquest of natural frailties, especially in a case of far more importance to mankind than is at first sight obvious, is well distinguished as an object of honour, and the contrary vice is punished by shame. Honour is not wasted on those who abstain from acts which are punished by the law. These acts may be avoided without a pure motive. Wherever a virtue is easily performed by good men\u2014wherever it is its nature to be attended by delight\u2014wherever its outward observance is so necessary to society as to be enforced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>\u2014it is not the proper object of honour. Honour and shame, therefore, may be reasonably dispensed, without being strictly proportioned to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> morality of actions, if the inequality of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> contributes to the general equipoise of the whole moral system.\n\nA wide disproportion, however, or indeed any disproportion not justifiable on moral grounds, would be a depravation of the moral principle. Duelling is among us a disputed case, though the improvement of manners has rendered it so much more infrequent, that it is likely in time to lose its support from opinion. Those who excuse individuals for yielding to a false point of honour, as in the suicides of the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, may consistently blame the faulty principle, and rejoice in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>. The shame fixed on a Hindoo widow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> who voluntarily survives her husband, is regarded by all other nations with horror.\n\nThere is room for great praise and some blame in other parts of Paley's works. His political opinions were those generally adopted by moderate whigs in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. His language on the Revolution of 1688 may be very advantageously compared, both in precision and in generous boldness, to that of Blackstone, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of classical and harmonious composition, but a feeble reasoner and a confused thinker, whose writings are not exempt from the taint of slavishness.\n\nIt cannot be denied that Paley was sometimes rather a lax moralist, especially on public duties.\n\n---\n\n1 \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a> may be too secure. The greatest tyrants have been those whose titles were the most unquestioned. Whenever, therefore, the opinion of right becomes too predominant and superstitious, it is aborted by breaking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>. Thus the Revolution broke the custom of succession, and thereby moderated, both in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> and in the people, those lofty notions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> right, which in the one were become a continual incentive to tyranny, and disposed the other to invite servitude, by undue compliances and dangerous concessions.\" (Paley, book vii. chap ii.)\nIt is a sin which easily besets men of strong good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, little enthusiasm, and much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. They are naturally led to lower their precepts to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of their expectations. They see that higher pretensions often produce less good, to say nothing of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOCRISY\">hypocrisy</a>, extravagance, and turbulence, to which they lend some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. As those who claim more from men often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> less, it is natural for more sober and milder casuists to present a more accessible virtue to their followers. It was thus that the Jesuits began, till, strongly tempted by their perilous station as the moral guides of the powerful, some of them by degrees fell into that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> licentiousness for which all, not without injustice, have been cruelly immortalized by Pascal. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">Indulgence</a>, which is a great virtue in judgment concerning the actions of others, is too apt, when blended in the same system with the precepts of morality, to be received as a licence for our own offences. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">Accommodation</a>, without which society would be painful, and arduous affairs would become impracticable, is more safely imbibed from temper and experience, than taught in early and systematic instruction. The middle region between laxity and rigour is hard to be fixed, and it is still harder steadily to remain within its boundaries. Whatever may be thought of Paley's observations on political influence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> subscription, as temperaments and mitigations which may preserve us from harsh judgment, they are assuredly not well qualified to form a part of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> which ought to breathe into the opening souls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>, at the critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of the formation of character, those inestimable virtues of sincerity, of integrity, of independence, which will even guide them more safely through life than mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, while they provide an inward fountain of pure delight, immeasurably more abundant than all the outward sources of precarious and perishable pleasure.","sp":598,"ep":602}]
