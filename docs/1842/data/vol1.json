[{"h":"ADAM SMITH","t":"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Smith rests upon the Enquiry into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> and Causes of the Wealth of Nations; perhaps the only book which produced an immediate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, and irrevocable change in some of the most important parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a> of all civilized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a>. The works of Grotius, of Locke, and of Montesquieu, which bear a resemblance to it in character, and had no inconsiderable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of their popular influence, were productive only of a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMENDMENT\">amendment</a>, not so conspicuous in particular instances, as discoverable, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, in the improved condition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> affairs. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of Smith, as it touched those matters which may be numbered, and measured, and weighed, bore more visible and palpable fruit. In a few years it began to alter laws and treaties, and has made its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, throughout the convulsions of revolution and conquest, to a due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASCENDANT\">ascendant</a> over the minds of men, with far less than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> obstructions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> and clamour, which choke the channels through which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> flows into practice. The most eminent of those who have since cultivated and improved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be the foremost to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>,\n\nTenebris tantis tam clarum extollere lumen\nQui primus potuisti, INLUSTRANS COMMODA VIT\u00c6,\nTe sequor! (Lucret. lib. iii.)\n\nIn a science more difficult, because both ascending to more simple general principles, and running <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> through more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> applications, though the success of Smith has been less complete, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> is not less conspicuous. Perhaps there is no ethical work since Cicero's Offices, of which an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> enables the reader so inadequately to estimate the merit, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a> of Moral Sentiments. This is not chiefly owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of diction, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of Cicero; but to the variety of explanations of life and manners which embellish the book often more than they illuminate the theory. Yet, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ON\">on</a> the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, it must be owned that, for purely philosophical purposes, few books more need abridgement: for the most careful reader frequently loses sight of principles buried under illustrations. The naturally copious and flowing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of the author is generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REDUNDANT\">redundant</a>, and the repetition of certain formularies of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> is, in the later editions, so frequent as to be wearisome, and sometimes ludicrous. Perhaps Smith and Hobbes may be considered as forming the two extremes of good style in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>; the first of graceful fulness falling into flaccidity; while the masterly concision of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> is oftener tainted by dictatorial dryness. Hume and Berkeley, though they are nearer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> of abundance, are probably the least distant from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>.\n\nThat mankind are so constituted as to sympathize with each other's feelings, and to feel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in the accordance of these feelings, are the only facts required by Dr Smith, and they certainly must be granted to him. To adopt the feelings of another, is to approve them. When the sentiments of another are such as would be excited in us by the same objects, we approve them as morally proper. To obtain this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a>, it becomes necessary for him who enjoys <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-OR\">or</a> suffers, to lower his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of feeling to the point to which the by-stander can raise his fellow-feelings; on which are founded all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> virtues of self-denial and self-command; and it is equally necessary for the by-stander to raise his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a> as near as he can to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> feeling. In all unsocial passions, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>, we have a divided sympathy between him who feels them and those who are the\n\n1 Born in 1723; died in 1790.\n2 Notes and Illustrations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> S.\n3 This remark is chiefly applicable to Hume's Essays. His Treatise of Human Nature is more Hobbian in its general tenor, though it has Ciceronian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>.\nobjects of them. Hence the propriety of extremely moderating them. Pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MALICE\">malice</a> is always to be concealed or disguised, because all sympathy is arrayed against it. In the private passions, where there is only a simple sympathy\u2014that with the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>\u2014the expression has more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. The benevolent affections, where there is a double sympathy\u2014with those who feel them, and those who are their objects\u2014are the most agreeable, and may be indulged with the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of finding no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ECHO\">echo</a> in other breasts. Sympathy with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> of those who are benefited by good actions, prompts us to consider them as deserving of reward, and forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of merit; as fellow-feeling with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a> of those who are injured by crimes leads us to look on them as worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, and constitutes the sense of demerit. These sentiments require not only beneficial actions, but benevolent motives for them; being compounded, in the case of merit, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> sympathy with the good disposition of the benefactor, and an indirect sympathy with the persons benefited; in the opposite case, with precisely opposite sympathies. He who does an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of wrong to another to gratify his own passions, must not expect that the spectators, who have none of his undue partiality to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, will enter into his feelings. In such a case, he knows that they will pity the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> wronged, and be full of indignation against him. When he is cooled, he adopts the sentiments of others on his own crime, feels shame at the impropriety of his former passion, pity for those who have suffered by him, and a dread of punishment from general and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> resentment. Such are the constituent parts of remorse.\n\nOur moral sentiments respecting ourselves arise from those which others feel concerning us. We feel a self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> whenever we believe that the general feeling of mankind coincides with that state of mind in which we ourselves were at a given time. \"We suppose ourselves the spectators of our own behaviour, and endeavour to imagine what effect it would in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> produce in us.\" We must view our own conduct with the eyes of others before we can judge it. The sense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> arises from putting ourselves in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of others, and adopting their sentiments respecting our own conduct. In utter solitude there could have been no self-approbation. The rules of morality are a summary of those sentiments; and often beneficially stand in their stead when the self-delusions of passion would otherwise hide from us the non-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> of our state of mind with that which, in the circumstances, can be entered into and approved by impartial bystanders. It is hence that we learn to raise our mind above local or temporary clamour, and to fix our eyes on the surest indications of the general and lasting sentiments of human nature:\n\n\"When we approve of any character or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, our sentiments are derived from four sources: first, we sympathize with the motives of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>; secondly, we enter into the gratitude of those who have been benefited by his actions; thirdly, we observe that his conduct has been agreeable to the general rules by which those two sympathies generally act; and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> of all, when we consider such actions as forming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a system of behaviour which tends to promote the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> either of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, they appear to derive a beauty from this utility, not unlike that which we ascribe to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-contrived machine.\"","sp":584,"ep":585},{"h":"BACON","t":"The state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the sixteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, presented a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> singularly calculated to attract the curiosity, and to awaken the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of Bacon; nor was it the least of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> advantages, that, as the son of one of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>'s ministers, he had a ready access, wherever he went, to the most enlightened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. While yet only in the seventeenth year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, he was removed by his father from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, where it is not to be doubted, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> must have largely contributed to cherish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> liberality and independence of his mind. Sir Joshua Reynolds has remarked, in one of his academical Discourses, that \"every seminary of learning is surrounded with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> of floating knowledge, where every mind may imbibe somewhat congenial to its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> conceptions.\" He might have added, with still greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that it is an atmosphere, of which it is more peculiarly salutary for those who have been elsewhere reared to breathe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. The remark is applicable to higher pursuits than were in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of this philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>; and it suggests a hint of no inconsiderable value for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>.\n\nThe merits of Bacon, as the father of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Experimental <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>, are so universally acknowledged, that it would be superfluous to touch upon them here. The lights which he has struck out in various branches of the Philosophy of Mind, have been much less attended to; although the whole scope and tenor of his speculations show, that to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> his genius was far more strongly and happily turned, than to that of the Material World. It was not, as some seem to have imagined, by sagacious anticipations of particular discoveries afterwards to be made in physics, that his writings have had so powerful an influence in accelerating the advancement of that science. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> and accuracy of his physical knowledge, he was far inferior to many of his predecessors; but he surpassed them all in his knowledge of the laws, the resources, and the limits of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> understanding. The sanguine expectations with which he looked forwards to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a>, were founded solely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ON\">on</a> his confidence in the untried capacities of the mind, and on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> of the possibility of invigorating and guiding, by means of logical rules, those faculties which, in all our researches after truth, are the organs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-OR\">or</a> instruments to be employed. \"Such rules,\" as he himself has observed, \"do in some sort equal men's wits, and leave no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> advantage or pre-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> and excellent motions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>.

It would be difficult to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a> another writer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to Locke, whose works are enriched with so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> observations on the intellectual phenomena. Among these, the most valuable relate to the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">Memory</a>, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">Imagination</a>; the latter of which subjects he seems to have studied with peculiar care. In one short but beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a> concerning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-POETRY\">Poetry</a> (under which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> may be comprehended all the various creations of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>), he has exhausted every thing that philosophy and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> have yet had to offer, on what has been since called the Beau Ideal; a topic, which has furnished occasion to so many over-refinements among the French critics, and to so much extravagance and mysticism in the cloud-clapt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a> of the new German school. In considering imagination as connected with the nervous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, more particularly as connected with that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a> to which medical writers have given the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>, he has suggested some very important hints which none of his successors have hitherto prosecuted; and has, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, left an example of cautious inquiry, worthy to be studied by all who may attempt to investigate the laws regulating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> between Mind and Body. His illustration of the different classes of prejudices <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INCIDENT\">incident</a> to human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, is, in point of practical utility, at least equal to any thing on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> to be found in Locke, of whom it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to forbear remarking, as a circumstance not easily explicable, that he should have resumed this important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>, without once mentioning the name of his great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> improvement made by Locke, in the farther prosecution of the argument, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of Hobbes's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>, to explain in what manner these prejudices are originally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a>.\n\nIn Bacon's scattered hints on topics connected with the Philosophy of the Mind, strictly so called, nothing is more remarkable than the precise and just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> they display of the proper aim of this science. He had manifestly reflected much and successfully on the operations of his own understanding, and had studied with uncommon sagacity the intellectual characters of others. Of his reflections and observations on both subjects, he has recorded many important results, and has in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> stated them without the slightest reference to any physiological theory concerning their causes, or to any analogical explanations founded on the caprices of metaphorical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. If, on some occasions, he assumes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of animal spirits, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUL\">Soul</a> and Body, it must be remembered, that this was then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of the learned; and that it was at a much later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> not less confidently avowed by Locke. Nor ought it to be overlooked (I mention it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of both authors),\n\n---\n\n1 \"Cum mundus sensibilis sit anima rationali dignitate inferior, videtur Po\u00ebsis h\u00e6c humanae natur\u00e6 largiri qu\u00e6 historia denegat; atque animo umbris rerum utcumque satisfacere, cum solida haberi non possint.

Lib. ii. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. xiii.)\n\n2 To this branch of the philosophy of mind, Bacon gives the title of Doctrina de fidebre, sive de communi vinculo anim\u00e6 et corporis.\u2014(De Aug. Scient. Lib. iv. cap. i.) Under this article, he mentions, among other desiderata, an inquiry (which he recommends to physicians) concerning the influence of imagination over the body. His own words are very remarkable; more particularly, the clause in which he remarks the effect of fixing and concentrating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, in giving to ideal objects the power of realities over the belief. \"Ad aliquid quippe, quod hoc pertinet, parce admodum, nec pro rei substitute, vel utilitate, illoquium est; quatenus silex ipsa imaginatio anim\u00e6 vel cogitatio perspicuum fixa, et veluti in fide quemdam excitata, valeat ad immutandum corpus imaginari.\"\u2014(Ibid.) He suggests also, as a curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>, to ascertain how far it is possible to fortify and exalt the imagination; and by what means this may most effectually be done. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of facts here alluded to, are manifestly of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> with those to which the attention of philosophers has been lately called by the pretensions of Mesmer and of Perkins: \"Atque huic conjuncta est <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISQUISITION\">disquisition</a>, quo modo imaginatio intendi et fortificari possit?

As to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCHOLASTIC\">scholastic</a> questions concerning the nature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a> of mind,\u2014whether it be extended or unextended? whether it have any relation to space or to time? or whether (as was contended by others) it exist in every ubi, but in no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>?\u2014Bacon has uniformly passed them over with silent contempt; and has probably contributed not less effectually to bring them into general discredit, by this indirect intimation of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, than if he had descended to the ungrateful task of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> their absurdity.\n\nWhile Bacon, however, so cautiously avoids these unprofitable discussions about the nature of Mind, he decidedly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a> his conviction, that the faculties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">Man</a> differ not merely in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, but in kind, from the instincts of the brutes. \"I do not, therefore,\" he observes on one occasion, \"approve of that confused and promiscuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> in which philosophers are accustomed to treat of pneumatology; as if the human Soul ranked above those of brutes, merely like the sun above the stars, or like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> above other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>.\"\n\nAmong the various topics started by Bacon for the consideration of future logicians, he did not overlook (what may be justly regarded, in a practical view, as the most interesting of all logical problems) the question concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> influence of Thought and of Language on each other. \"Men believe,\" says he, \"that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> governs their words; but it often happens, that words have power enough to react upon reason.\" This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APHORISM\">aphorism</a> may be considered as the text of by far the most valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Locke's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a>,\u2014that which relates to the imperfections and abuse of words; but it was not until within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> twenty years that its depth and importance were perceived in all their extent. I need scarcely say, that I allude to the excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of M. Prevost and of M. Degerando, on \"Signs considered in their connection with the Intellectual Operations.\"\n\nThe anticipations formed by Bacon, of that branch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> logic which relates to Universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GRAMMAR\">Grammar</a>, do no less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to his sagacity. \"Grammar,\" he observes, \"is of two kinds, the one literary, the other philosophical. The former has for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to trace the analogies running through the structure of a particular tongue, so as to facilitate its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> to a foreigner, or to enable him to speak it with correctness and purity. The latter directs the attention, not to the analogies which words bear to words, but the analogies which words bear to things;\" or, as he afterwards explains himself more clearly, \"to language considered as the sensible portraiture or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> of the mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>.\" In farther illustration of these hints, he takes notice of the lights which the different genius of different languages reflect on the characters and habits of those by whom they were respectively spoken. \"Thus,\" says he, \"it is easy to perceive, that the Greeks were addicted to the culture of the arts, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> engrossed with the conduct of affairs; inasmuch as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> distinctions introduced in the progress of refinement require the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of compounded words; while the real business of life stands in no need of so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASEOLOGY\">phraseology</a>.\" Ideas of this sort have, in the course of a very few years, already become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, and almost tritical; but how different was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> two centuries ago!\n\nWith these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> and enlarged views concerning the philosophy of the Mind, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not appear surprising to those who have attended to the slow and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> advances of human reason, that Bacon should occasionally blend incidental\n\n---\n\n1 Notwithstanding the extravagance of Spinoza's own philosophical creed, he is one of the very few among Bacon's successors, who seem to have been fully aware of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a>, importance, and originality of the method pointed out in the Novum Organum for the study of the Mind. \"Ad h\u00e6c intelligenda, non est opus naturam mentis cognoscere, sed sufficit, mentis sive perceptionum historiam concinnare modo illo quo VERULAMIUS docet.\"\u2014Spin. Epist. 42.\n\nIn order to comprehend the whole merit of this remark, it is necessary to know that, according to the Cartesian phraseology, which is here adopted by Spinoza, the word perception is a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, equally applicable to all the intellectual operations. The words of Descartes himself are these: \"Omnes modi cogitandi, quos in nobis experimur, ad duos generaes referri possunt: quorum unus est, perceptione, sive operatio intellectus; alius vero, volitione, sive operatio voluntatis. Nam sentiri, imaginari, et pure intelligere, sunt tantum diversi modi percipiendi; ut et cupere, aversari, affirmare, negare, dubitare, sunt diversi modi volendi.\"\u2014Princip. Phil. Pars I. \u00a7 32.\n\n2 De Aug. Scient. Lib. vi. cap. i.\n\n3 Ibid.\nremarks, savouring of the habits of thinking prevalent in his time. A curious example of this occurs in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> which contains his excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> or description of universal grammar. \"This too,\" he observes, \"is worthy of notice, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> languages were full of declensions, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, of conjugations, of tenses, and of other similar inflections; while the modern, almost entirely destitute of these, indolently accomplish the same purpose by the help of prepositions, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AUXILIARY\">auxiliary</a> verbs. Whence,\" he continues, \"may be inferred, (however we may flatter ourselves with the idea of our own superiority), that the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a> was much more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> and subtle in ancient, than it now is in modern times.\"1 How very unlike is this last reflection to the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a> of Bacon's writings! It seems, indeed, much more congenial to the philosophy of Mr Harris and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Monboddo; and it has accordingly been sanctioned with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> of both these learned authors. If my memory does not deceive me, it is the only passage in Bacon's works, which Lord Monboddo has anywhere condescended to quote.\n\nThese observations afford me a convenient opportunity for remarking the progress and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of the philosophical spirit, since the beginning of the seventeenth century. In the short passage just cited from Bacon, there are involved no less than two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> errors, which are now almost universally ranked, by men of education, among the grossest prejudices of the multitude. The one, that the declensions and conjugations of the ancient languages, and the modern substitution in their place of prepositions and auxiliary verbs, are, both of them, the deliberate and systematical contrivances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> grammarians; the other (still less analogous to Bacon's general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>), that the faculties of man have declined, as the world has grown older. Both of these errors may be now said to have disappeared entirely. The latter, more particularly, must, to the rising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>, seem so absurd, that it almost requires an apology to have mentioned it. That the capacities of the human mind have been in all ages the same; and that the diversity of phenomena exhibited by our species, is the result merely of the different circumstances in which men are placed, has been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> received as an incontrovertible logical maxim; or rather, such is the influence of early instruction, that we are apt to regard it as one of the most obvious suggestions of common sense. And yet, till about the time of Montesquieu, it was by no means so generally recognised by the learned, as to have a sensible influence on the fashionable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> of thinking over Europe. The application of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> and leading idea to the natural or theoretical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of society in all its various aspects;\u2014to the history of languages, of the arts, of the sciences, of laws, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, of manners, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>,\u2014is the peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of the latter half of the eighteenth century, and forms a characteristic feature in its philosophy, which even the imagination of Bacon was unable to foresee.\n\nIt would be endless to particularize the original suggestions thrown out by Bacon on topics connected with the science of Mind. The few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of this sort already quoted, are produced merely as a specimen of the rest. They are by no means selected as the most important in his writings; but as they happened to be those which had left the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on my memory, I thought them as likely as any other, to invite the curiosity of my readers to a careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the rich mine from which they are extracted.\n\nThe Ethical disquisitions of Bacon are almost entirely of a practical nature. Of the two theoretical questions so much agitated, in both parts of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, during the eighteenth century, concerning the principle and the object of moral approbation, he has said nothing; but he has opened some new and interesting views with respect to the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> and the formation of habits;\u2014a most important article of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a>, on which he has enlarged more ably and more usefully than any writer since <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>.2 Under the same head of Ethics may\n\n---\n\n1 De Aug. Scient. Lib. vi. cap. i.\n2 De Aug. Scient. Lib. vii. cap. iii.\nbe mentioned the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> to which he has given the title of Essays; the best known and the most popular of all his works. It is also one of those where the superiority of his genius appears to the greatest advantage; the novelty and depth of his reflections often receiving a strong relief from the triteness of his subject. It may be read from beginning to end in a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>,\u2014and yet, after the twentieth perusal, one seldom fails to remark in it something overlooked before. This, indeed, is a characteristic of all Bacon's writings, and is only to be accounted for by the inexhaustible aliment they furnish to our own thoughts, and the sympathetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> they impart to our torpid faculties.\n\nThe suggestions of Bacon for the improvement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> Philosophy, exhibit as strong a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> to the narrow systems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> statesmen, as the Inductive Logic to that of the Schools. How profound and comprehensive are the views opened in the following passages, when compared with the scope of the celebrated treatise De Jure Belli et Pacis; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which was first published about a year before Bacon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, and which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, for a hundred and fifty years afterwards, to be regarded in all the Protestant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> of Europe as an inexhaustible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> of moral and jurisprudential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>!\n\n\"The ultimate object which legislators ought to have in view, and to which all their enactments and sanctions ought to be subservient, is, that the citizens may live happily. For this purpose, it is necessary that they should receive a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> and pious education; that they should be trained to good morals; that they should be secured from foreign enemies by proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> arrangements; that they should be guarded by an effectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a> against seditions and private injuries; that they should be loyal to government, and obedient to magistrates; and, finally, that they should abound in wealth, and in other national resources.\"1\u2014\u201cThe science of such matters certainly belongs more particularly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of men who, by habits of public business, have been led to take a comprehensive survey of the social order; of the interests of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>; of the rules of natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a>; of the manners of nations; of the different forms of government; and who are thus prepared to reason concerning the wisdom of laws, both from considerations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and of policy. The great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DESIDERATUM\">desideratum</a>, accordingly, is, by investigating the principles of natural justice, and those of political expediency, to exhibit a theoretical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a>, which, while it serves as a standard for estimating the comparative excellence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MUNICIPAL\">municipal</a> codes, may suggest hints for their correction and improvement, to such as have at heart the welfare of mankind.\u201d2\n\nHow precise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> was that Bacon had formed of a philosophical system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a> (with which as a standard the municipal laws of different nations might be compared), appears from a remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, in which he mentions it as the proper business of those who might attempt to carry his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> into execution, to investigate those \u201cleges legum, ex quibus informatio peti possit, quid in singulis legibus bene aut perperam positum aut constitutum sit.\u201d3 I do not know if, in Bacon's\n\n---\n\n1 Exemplum Tractatus de Fontibus Juris, Aphor. 5. This enumeration of the different objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> approaches very nearly to Mr Smith's ideas on the same subject, as expressed by himself in the concluding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of his Theory of Moral Sentiments. \u201cIn another Discourse, I shall endeavour to give an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the general principles of law and government, and of the different revolutions they have undergone in the different ages and periods of society; not only in what concerns justice, but in what concerns police, revenue, and arms, and whatever else is the object of law.\u201d\n\n2 De Aug. Scient. Lib. viii. cap. iii.\n\n3 De Fontibus Juris, Aphor. 6.\n\nFrom the preface to a small tract of Bacon's entitled, The Elements of the Common Laws of England, written while he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOLICITOR\">Solicitor</a>-General to Queen Elizabeth, we learn, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> leges legum had been previously used by some \u201cgreat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CIVILIAN\">civilian</a>.\u201d To what Cr\u00e9das Bacon here alludes, I know not; but, whoever he was, I doubt much if he annexed to it the comprehensive and philosophical meaning so properly explained in the above definition. Bacon himself, when he wrote his Tract on the Common Laws, does not appear to have yet risen to this vantage-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> of Universal Jurisprudence. His great object (he tells us) was \u201cto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> the rules and grounds disposed throughout the body of the same laws, in order to see more profoundly into the reasons of such judgments and ruled cases, and thereby to make more use of them for the decision of other cases more doubtful; so that the uncertainty of law, which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> and most just challenge that is made to the laws of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> at this time, will, by this new strength laid to the foundation, be somewhat the more settled and corrected.\u201d In this passage, no reference whatever is made to the Universal Justice spoken of in the aphorisms De Fontibus Juris; but merely to the leading and governing rules which give to a municipal system whatever it possesses of\nprophetic anticipations of the future progress of Physics, there be any thing more characteristic, both of the grandeur and of the justness of his conceptions, than this short definition; more particularly, when we consider how widely Grotius, in a work professedly devoted to this very inquiry, was soon after to wander from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> path, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of his vague and wavering idea of the aim of his researches.\n\nThe sagacity, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in these, and various other passages of a similar import, can by no means be duly appreciated, without attending, at the same time, to the cautious and temperate maxims so frequently inculcated by the author, on the subject of political innovation. \"A stubborn retention of customs is a turbulent thing, not less than the introduction of new.\"\u2014\"Time is the greatest innovator; shall we then not imitate time, which innovates so silently as to mock the sense?\" Nearly connected with these aphorisms, are the profound reflections in the first book *De Augmentis Scientiarum*, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of accommodating every new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> to the character and circumstances of the people for whom it is intended; and on the peculiar danger which literary men run of overlooking this consideration, from the familiar acquaintance they acquire, in the course of their early studies, with the ideas and sentiments of the ancient classics.\n\nThe remark of Bacon on the systematical policy of Henry VII. was manifestly suggested by the same train of thinking. \"His laws (whoso marks them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WELL\">well</a>) were deep and not vulgar; not made on the spur of a particular occasion for the present, but out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a> for the future; to make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> of his people still more and more happy, after the manner of the legislators in ancient and heroic times.\" How far this noble eulogy was merited, either by the legislators of antiquity, or by the modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> on whom Bacon has bestowed it, is a question of little moment. I quote it merely on account of the important philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> which it indirectly marks, between \"deep and vulgar laws;\" the former invariably aiming to accomplish their end, not by giving any sudden shock to the feelings and interests of the existing generation, but by allowing to natural causes time and opportunity to operate; and by removing those artificial obstacles which check the progressive tendencies of society. It is probable, that, on this occasion, Bacon had an eye more particularly to the memorable statute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALIENATION\">alienation</a>; to the effects of which (whatever were the motives of its author) the above description certainly applies in an eminent degree.\n\nAfter all, however, it must be acknowledged, that it is rather in his general views and maxims, than in the details of his political theories, that Bacon's sagacity appears to advantage. His notions with respect to commercial policy seem to have been more peculiarly erroneous; originating in an overweening opinion of the efficacy of law, in matters where natural causes ought to be allowed a free operation. It is observed by Mr Hume, that the statutes of Henry VII. relating to the police of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, are generally contrived with more judgment than his commercial regulations. The same writer adds, that \"the more simple ideas of order and equity are sufficient to guide a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a> in every thing that regards the internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> of justice; but that the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> are much more complicated, and require long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> and deep reflection to be well understood in any state. The real consequence is there often contrary to first appearances. No wonder, that, during the reign of Henry VII., these matters were frequently mistaken; and it may safely be affirmed, that, even in the age of Lord Bacon, very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> and erroneous ideas were formed on that subject.\"\n\nThe instances mentioned by Hume in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of these general remarks, are peculiarly gratifying to those who have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in tracing the slow but certain progress of reason and liberality. \"During the reign,\" says he, \"of Henry VII. it was prohibited to ex-\nport horses, as if that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> did not encourage the breed, and make them more plentiful in the kingdom. Prices were also affixed to woollen cloths, to caps and hats, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> of labourers were regulated by law. It is evident, that these matters ought always to be left free, and be entrusted to the common course of business and commerce.\"\u2014\"For a like reason,\" the historian continues, the \"law enacted against inclosures, and for the keeping up of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FARM\">farm</a>-houses, scarcely deserves the praises bestowed on it by Lord Bacon. If husbandmen understand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, and have a ready vent for their commodities, we need not dread a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of the people employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. During a century and a half after this period, there was a frequent renewal of laws and edicts against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOPULATION\">depopulation</a>; whence we may infer, that none of them were ever executed. The natural course of improvement at last provided a remedy.\"\n\nThese acute and decisive strictures on the impolicy of some laws highly applauded by Bacon, while they strongly illustrate the narrow and mistaken views in political economy entertained by the wisest statesmen and philosophers two centuries ago, afford, at the same time, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the general diffusion which has since taken place among the people of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, of juster and more enlightened opinions on this important branch of legislation. Wherever such doctrines find their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAY\">way</a> into the page of history, it may be safely inferred, that the public mind is not indisposed to give them a welcome reception.\n\nThe ideas of Bacon concerning the education of youth, were such as might be expected from a philosophical statesman. On the conduct of education in general, with a view to the development and improvement of the intellectual character, he has suggested various useful hints in different parts of his works; but what I wish chiefly to remark at present is, the paramount importance which he has attached to the education of the people,\u2014comparing, as he has repeatedly done, the effects of early culture on the understanding and the heart, to the abundant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> which rewards the diligent husbandman for the toils of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>. To this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> he seems to have been particularly anxious to attract the attention of his readers, by bestowing on education the title of the Georgics of the Mind; identifying, by a happy and impressive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METAPHOR\">metaphor</a>, the two proudest functions entrusted to the legislator,\u2014the encouragement of agricultural industry, and the care of national instruction. In both instances, the legislator exerts a power which is literally productive or creative; compelling, in the one case, the unprofitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> to pour forth its latent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>; and in the other, vivifying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DORMANT\">dormant</a> seeds of genius and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, and redeeming from the neglected wastes of human intellect, a new and unexpected accession to the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a> of mankind.\n\nWhen from such speculations as these we descend to the treatise De Jure Belli et Pacis, the contrast is mortifying indeed. And yet, so much better suited were the talents and accomplishments of Grotius to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, not only of his contemporaries, but of their remote descendants, that, while the merits of Bacon failed, for a century and a half, to command the general admiration of Europe,\u00b9 Grotius continued, even in our British universities, the acknowledged Oracle of Jurisprudence and of Ethics, till long after the death of Montesquieu. Nor was Bacon himself unapprised of the slow growth of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>. No writer seems ever to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> more deeply, that he properly belonged to a later and more enlightened age;\u2014a sentiment which he has pathetically expressed in that clause of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">testament</a> where he \"bequeaths his name to posterity, after some generations shall be past.\"\u00b2\n\nUnbounded, however, as the reputation of Grotius was on the Continent, even before his own death, it was not till many years after the publication of the treatise De Jure Belli et Pacis, that the science of Natural Jurisprudence became, in this island, an object of much attention, even\n\n\u00b9 \"La c\u00e9l\u00e9brit\u00e9 en France des \u00e9crits du Chancelier Bacon n'a gu\u00e8re pour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> que celle de l'Encyclop\u00e9die.\"\u2014(Histoire des Math\u00e9matiques par Montucla, Pr\u00e9face, p. ix.) It is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> circumstance, that Bayle, who has so often wasted his erudition and acuteness on the most insignificant characters, and to whom Le Clerc has very justly ascribed the merit of une exactitude \u00e9tonnante dans des choses de moins, should have devoted to Bacon only twelve lines of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>.\n\n\u00b2 See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a> F.\nto the learned. In order, therefore, to give to the sequel of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> some degree of continuity, I shall reserve my observations on Grotius and his successors, till I shall have finished all that I think it necessary to mention further, with respect to the literature of our own country, prior to the appearance of Mr Locke's Essay.\n\nThe rapid advancement of intellectual cultivation in England, between the years 1588 and 1640 (a period of almost uninterrupted peace), has been remarked by Mr Fox. \"The general improvement,\" he observes, \"in all arts of civil life, and, above all, the astonishing progress of literature, are the most striking among the general features of that period; and are in themselves causes sufficient to produce effects of the utmost importance. A country whose language was enriched by the works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOOKER\">Hooker</a>, Raleigh, and Bacon, could not but experience a sensible change in its manners, and in its style of thinking; and even to speak the same language in which Spencer and Shakspeare had written, seemed a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> to rescue the Commons of England from the appellation of Brutes, with which Henry the Eighth had addressed them.\"\u2014The remark is equally just and refined. It is by the mediation of an improving language, that the progress of the mind is chiefly continued from one generation to another; and that the acquirements of the enlightened few are insensibly imparted to the many. Whatever tends to diminish the ambiguities of speech, or to fix, with more logical precision, the import of general terms;\u2014above all, whatever tends to embody, in popular forms of expression, the ideas and feelings of the wise and good, augments the natural powers of the human understanding, and enables the succeeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RACE\">race</a> to start from a higher ground than was occupied by their fathers. The remark applies with peculiar force to the study of the Mind itself; a study, where the chief source of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> is the imperfection of words; and where every improvement on this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of thought may be justly regarded in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of a discovery.\n\nIn the foregoing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of illustrious names, Mr Fox has, with much propriety, connected those of Bacon and Raleigh; two men, who, notwithstanding the diversity of their professional pursuits, and the strong contrast of their characters, exhibit, nevertheless, in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of authors, some striking features of resemblance. Both of them owed to the force of their own minds, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMANCIPATION\">emancipation</a> from the fetters of the schools; both were eminently distinguished above their contemporaries, by the originality and enlargement of their philosophical views; and both divide, with the venerable Hooker, the glory of exemplifying, to their yet unpolished countrymen, the richness, variety, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, which might be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> to the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IDIOM\">idiom</a>, by the hand of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>.\n\nIt is not improbable that Mr Fox might have included the name of Hobbes in the same enumeration, had he not been prevented by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a> to his slavish principles of government, and by his own disrelish for metaphysical theories. As a writer, Hobbes unquestionably ranks <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> among the older English classics, and is so peculiarly distinguished by the simplicity and ease of his manner, that one would naturally have expected from Mr Fox's characteristical taste,\n\n---\n\n1 It is not so foreign as may at first be supposed to the object of this Discourse, to take notice here of the extraordinary demand for books on Agriculture under the government of James I. The fact is thus very strongly stated by Dr Johnson, in his introduction to the Harleian Miscellany. \"It deserves to be remarked, because it is not generally known, that the treatises on husbandry and agriculture, which were published during the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-KING\">King</a> James, are so numerous, that it can scarcely be imagined by whom they were written, or to whom they were sold.\" Nothing can illustrate more strongly the effects of a pacific system of policy, in encouraging a general taste for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, as well as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> spirit of national improvement. At all times, and in every country, the extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of books on agriculture, may be regarded as one of the most pleasing symptoms of mental cultivation in the great body of a people.\n\n2 To prevent being misunderstood, it is necessary for me to add, that I do not speak of the general style of these old authors; but only of detached passages, which may be selected from all of them, as earnests or first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of a new and brighter era in English literature. It may be safely affirmed, that in their works, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a> compositions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>, are to be found some of the finest sentences of which our language has yet to boast. To propose them now as models for imitation would be quite absurd. Dr Lowth certainly went much too far when he said, \"That in correctness, propriety, and purity of English style, Hooker hath hardly been surpassed, or even equalled, by any of his successors.\"\u2014Preface to Lowth's English Grammar.\nthat he would have relished his style still more than that of Bacon or of Raleigh. It is with the philosophical merits, however, of Hobbes, that we are alone concerned at present; and, in this point of view, what a space is filled in the subsequent history of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> literature, by his own works, and by those of his innumerable opponents! Little else, indeed, but the systems which he published, and the controversies which they provoked, occurs, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between Bacon and Locke, to mark the progress of English Philosophy, either in the study of the Mind, or in the kindred researches of Ethical and Political Science.\n\nOf the few and comparatively trifling exceptions to this remark, furnished by the metaphysical tracts of Glanville, of Henry More, and of John Smith, I must delay taking notice, till some account shall be given of the Cartesian Philosophy; to which their most interesting discussions have a constant reference, either in the way of comment or refutation.\n\nHOBBIEST\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> of Malmesbury,\" says Dr Warburton, \"was the terror of the last age, as Tindall and Collins are of this. The press sweat with controversy; and every young churchman militant, would try his arms in thundering on Hobbes's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> cap.\" Nor was the opposition to Hobbes confined to the clerical order, or to the controversialists of his own times. The most eminent moralists and politicians of the eighteenth century may be ranked in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of his antagonists; and even at the present moment, scarcely does there appear a new publication on Ethics or Jurisprudence, where a refutation of Hobbism is not to be found.\n\nThe period when Hobbes began his literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>, as well as the principal incidents of his life, were, in a singular degree, favourable to a mind like his; impatient of the yoke of authority, and ambitious to attract attention, if not by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and useful discoveries, at least by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of paradoxical tenets. After a residence of five years at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, and a very extensive tour through France and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, he had the good fortune, upon his return to England, to be admitted into the intimacy and confidence of Lord Bacon; a circumstance which, we may presume, contributed not a little to encourage that bold spirit of inquiry, and that aversion to scholastic learning, which characterise his writings. Happy, if he had, at the same time, imbibed some portion of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of truth and zeal for the advancement of knowledge, which seem to have been Bacon's ruling passions! But such was the obstinacy of his temper, and his overweening self-conceit, that, instead of co-operating with Bacon in the execution of his magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, he resolved to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REAR\">rear</a>, on a foundation exclusively his own, a complete structure both of Moral and Physical Science; disdaining to avail himself even of the materials collected by his predecessors, and treating the experimental philosophers as objects only of contempt and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a>.\n\nIn the political writings of Hobbes, we may perceive the influence also of other motives. From his earliest years, he seems to have been\n\n---\n\n1 According to Dr Burnet (no contemptible judge of style), Bacon was \"the first that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRIT\">writ</a> our language correctly.\" The same learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRELATE\">prelate</a> pronounces Bacon to be \"still our best author;\" and this, at a time when the works of Sprat, and many of the prose compositions of Cowley and of Dryden, were already in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the public. It is difficult to conceive on what grounds Burnet proceeded, in hazarding so extraordinary an opinion.\u2014See the preface to Burnet's Translation of More's Utopia.\n\nIt is still more difficult, on the other hand, to account for the following very bold decision of Mr Hume. I transcribe it from an essay first published in 1742; but the same passage is to be found in the last edition of his works, corrected by himself. \"The first polite prose we have, was writ by a man (Dr Swift) who is still alive. As to Sprat, Locke, and even Temple, they knew too little of the rules of art to be esteemed elegant writers. The prose of Bacon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARRINGTON\">Harrington</a>, and Milton, is altogether stiff and pedantic, though their sense be excellent.\"\n\nHow insignificant are the petty grammatical improvements proposed by Swift, when compared with the inexhaustible riches imparted to the English tongue by the writers of the seventeenth century; and how inferior, in all the higher qualities and excellences of style, are his prose compositions, to those of his immediate predecessors, Dryden, Pope, and Addison!\n\n2 Born 1588, died 1679.\n\n3 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">Divine</a> Legation, Pref. to Vol. II. p. 9.\n\n* See Note G.\ndecidedly hostile to all the forms of popular government; and it is said to have been with the design of impressing his countrymen with a just sense of the disorders incident to democratical establishments, that he published, in 1618, an English translation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THUCYDIDES\">Thucydides</a>. In these opinions he was more and more confirmed by the events he afterwards witnessed in England; the fatal consequences of which he early foresaw with so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a>, that, in 1640, he withdrew from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> storm, to enjoy the society of his philosophical friends at Paris. It was there he wrote his book *De Cive*, a few copies of which were printed, and privately circulated in 1642. The same work was afterwards given to the public, with material corrections and improvements, in 1647, when the author's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the royal cause being strengthened by his personal connection with the exiled king, he thought it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> on him to stand forth avowedly as an advocate for those principles which he had long professed. The great object of this performance was to strengthen the hands of sovereigns against the rising spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMOCRACY\">democracy</a>, by arming them with the weapons of a new philosophy.\n\nThe fundamental doctrines inculcated in the political works of Hobbes are contained in the following propositions. I recapitulate them here, not on their own account, but to prepare the way for some remarks which I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> afterwards to offer on the coincidence between the principles of Hobbes and those of Locke. In their practical conclusions, indeed, with respect to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> and duties of citizens, the two writers differ widely; but it is curious to observe how very nearly they set out from the same hypothetical assumptions.\n\nAll men are by nature equal; and, prior to government, they had all an equal right to enjoy the good things of this world. Man, too, is (according to Hobbes) by nature a solitary and purely selfish animal; the social union being entirely an interested <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a>, suggested by prudential views of personal advantage. The necessary consequence is, that a state of nature must be a state of perpetual warfare, in which no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> has any other means of safety than his own strength or ingenuity; and in which there is no room for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> industry, because no secure enjoyment of its fruits. In confirmation of this view of the origin of society, Hobbes appeals to facts falling daily within the circle of our own experience. \"Does not a man (he asks), when taking a journey, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> himself, and seek to go well accompanied? When going to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, does he not lock his doors? Nay, even in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, does he not lock his chests? Does he not there as much accuse mankind by his actions, as I do by my words?\"\u00b9 An additional argument to the same purpose may, according to some later Hobbists, be derived from the instinctive aversion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> for strangers; and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> which, it is alleged, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> feels, when he hears the tread of an unknown foot in the dark.\n\nFor the sake of peace and security, it is necessary that each individual should surrender a part of his natural right, and be contented with such a share of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> as he is willing to allow to others; or, to use Hobbes's own language, \"every man must divest himself of the right he has to all things by nature; the right of all men to all things being in effect no better than if no man had a right to any thing.\"\u00b2 In consequence of this transference of natural rights to an individual, or to a body of individuals, the multitude become one person, under the name of a State or Republic, by which person the common will and power are exercised for the common defence. The ruling power cannot be withdrawn from those to whom it has been committed; nor can they be punished for misgovernment. The interpretation of the laws is to be sought, not from the comments of philosophers, but from the authority of the ruler; otherwise society would every moment be in danger of resolving itself into the discordant elements of which it was at first composed. The will of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, therefore, is to be regarded as the ulti-\n\n\u00b9 *Of Man*, Part I. chap. xiii.\n\u00b2 *De Corpore Politico*, Part I. chap. i. \u00a7 10.\nmate standard of right and wrong, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> to be listened to by every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITIZEN\">citizen</a> as the voice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>.\n\nNot many years afterwards, Hobbes pushed the argument for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> power of princes still further, in a work, to which he gave the name of Leviathan. Under this appellation he means the body politic; insinuating that man is an untameable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a> of prey, and that government is the strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> by which he is kept from mischief. The fundamental principles here maintained are the same as in the book De Cive; but as it inveighs more particularly against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> tyranny, with the view of subjecting the consciences of men to the civil authority, it lost the author the favour of some powerful protectors he had hitherto enjoyed among the English divines who attended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II. in France; and he even found it convenient to quit that kingdom, and to return to England, where Cromwell (to whose government his political tenets were now as favourable as they were meant to be to the royal claims) suffered him to remain unmolested. The same circumstances operated to his disadvantage after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESTORATION\">Restoration</a>, and obliged the King, who always retained for him a very strong attachment, to confer his marks of favour on him with the utmost reserve and circumspection.\n\nThe details which I have entered into, with respect to the history of Hobbes's political writings, will be found, by those who may peruse them, to throw much light on the author's reasonings. Indeed, it is only by thus considering them in their connection with the circumstances of the times, and the fortunes of the writer, that a just notion can be formed of their spirit and tendency.\n\nThe ethical principles of Hobbes are so completely interwoven with his political system, that all which has been said of the one may be applied to the other. It is very remarkable, that Descartes should have thought so highly of the former, as to pronounce Hobbes to be \"a much greater master of morality than of metaphysics;\" a judgment which is of itself sufficient to mark the very low state of ethical science in France about the middle of the seventeenth century. Mr Addison, on the other hand, gives a decided preference (among all the books written by Hobbes) to his Treatise on Human Nature; and to his opinion on this point I most implicitly subscribe; including, however, in the same commendation, some of his other philosophical essays on similar topics. They are the only part of his works which it is possible now to read with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>; and they everywhere evince in their author, even when he thinks most unsoundly himself, that power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> his reader a-thinking, which is one of the most unequivocal marks of original genius. They have plainly been studied with the utmost care both by Locke and Hume. To the former they have suggested some of his most important observations on the Association of Ideas, as well as much of the sophistry displayed in the first book of his Essay, on the Origin of our Knowledge, and on the factitious nature of our moral principles; to the latter (among a variety of hints of less consequence), his theory concerning the nature of those established connections among physical events, which it is the business of the natural philosopher to ascertain, and the substance of his argument against the scholastic doctrine of general conceptions. It is from the works of Hobbes, too, that our later Necessitarians have borrowed the most formidable of those weapons with which they have combated the doctrine of moral liberty; and from the same source has been derived the leading idea\n\n---\n\n1 In 1651.\n2 See Note H.\n3 The same doctrine, concerning the proper object of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural philosophy</a> (commonly ascribed to Mr Hume, both by his followers and by his opponents), is to be found in various writers contemporary with Hobbes. It is stated, with uncommon precision and clearness, in a book entitled Scepsis Scientifica, or Confessed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IGNORANCE\">Ignorance</a> the way to Science, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Glanvill, (printed in 1665). The whole work is strongly marked with the features of an acute, an original, and, in matters of science, a somewhat sceptical genius; and, when compared with the treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WITCHCRAFT\">witchcraft</a>, by the same author, adds another proof to those already mentioned, of the possible union of the highest intellectual gifts with the most degrading intellectual weaknesses.\n\nWith respect to the Scepsis Scientifica, it deserves to be noticed, that the doctrine maintained in it concerning physical causes and effects does not occur in the form of a detached observation, of the value of which the author might not have been fully aware, but is the very basis of the general argument running through all his discussions.\nwhich runs through the philological materialism of Mr Horne Tooke. It is probable, indeed, that this last author borrowed it, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>-hand, from a hint in Locke's Essay; but it is repeatedly stated by Hobbes, in the most explicit and confident terms. Of this idea (than which, in point of fact, nothing can be imagined more puerile and unsound), Mr Tooke's etymologies, when he applies them to the solution of metaphysical questions, are little more than an ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a>, adapted and levelled to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> of the multitude.\n\nThe speculations of Hobbes, however, concerning the theory of the understanding, do not seem to have been nearly so much attended to during his own life, as some of his other doctrines, which, having a more immediate reference to human affairs, were better adapted to the unsettled and revolutionary spirit of the times. It is by these doctrines, chiefly, that his name has since become so memorable in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANNALS\">annals</a> of modern literature; and although they now derive their whole interest from the extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> they exhibit of acuteness and subtlety with a dead-palsy in the powers of taste and of moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, yet they will be found, on an attentive examination, to have had a far more extensive influence on the subsequent history, both of political and of ethical sciences, than any other publication of the same period.","sp":258,"ep":269},{"h":"CLARKE","t":"Connected with Cudworth by principle, though separated by some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, was Dr Samuel Clarke, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> eminent at once as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a>, a mathematician, a metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, and a philologer; who, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INTERPRETER\">interpreter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> and Caesar, the scholar of Newton, and the antagonist of Leibnitz, approved himself not unworthy of correspondence with the highest order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> spirits.

Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the present Dissertation requires such an excuse; but perhaps it may be more necessary in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> like that of Clarke, where the alterations in both respects have been so insensible, and in some respects appear so limited, that they may escape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, than after those total revolutions in doc-\n\n---\n\n1 Moralist, Part ii. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. 3.\n2 Eternal and Immutable Morality, p. 11.

(Plut. Oper. I. 639. Franc. 1599.)\n3 Born in 1675; died in 1729.\n4 This admirable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> had so much candour as in effect to own his failure, and to recur to those other arguments in support of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, which have in all ages satisfied the most elevated minds. In Proposition viii. (Being and Attributes of God, p. 47) which affirms that the first cause must be \"intelligent,\" (where, as he truly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, \"lies the main question between us and the atheists\") he owns, that the proposition cannot be demonstrated strictly and properly a priori.\nSee Notes and Illustrations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> M.\ntrine, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of not measuring other times by our own standard must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> to the most undistinguishing.\n\nThe sum of his moral doctrine may be stated as follows. Man can conceive nothing without at the same time conceiving its relations to other things. He must ascribe the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of perception to every being to whom he ascribes thought. He cannot therefore doubt that all the relations of all things to all must have always been present to the Eternal Mind. The relations in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> are eternal, however recent the things may be between whom they subsist. The whole of these relations constitute truth. The knowledge of them is omniscience. These eternal different relations of things involve a consequent eternal fitness or unfitness in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of things one to another; with a regard to which, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> of God always chooses, and which ought likewise to determine the wills of all subordinate rational beings. These eternal differences make it fit and reasonable for the creatures so to act; they cause it to be their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>, or lay an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a> on them so to do, separate from the will of God, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANTECEDENT\">antecedent</a> to any prospect of advantage or reward. Nay, wilful wickedness is the same absurdity and insolence in morals, as it would be in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> things to pretend to alter the relations of numbers, or to take away the properties of mathematical figures. \"Morality,\" says one of his most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> scholars, \"is the practice of reason.\"\n\nClarke, like Cudworth, considered such a scheme as the only security against Hobbism, and probably against the Calvinistic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>, from which they were almost as averse. Not content, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a>, to attack Hobbes on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> which was in part his own, they thought it necessary to build on entirely new foundations. Clarke more especially, instead of substituting social and generous feeling for the selfish appetites, endeavoured to bestow on morality the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, by thus deriving it from reason. He made it more than disinterested; for he placed its seat in a region where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> never enters, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> never disturbs. By ranking her principles with the first truths of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, he seemed to render them pure and impartial, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFALLIBLE\">infallible</a> and unchangeable. It might be excusable to regret the failure of so noble an attempt, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol12.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> of such regrets did not betray an unworthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> that the same excellent ends could only be attained by such frail means; and that the dictates of the most severe reason would not finally prove reconcilable with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>.","sp":553,"ep":554},{"h":"CUDWORTH","t":"Cudworth, one of the eminent men educated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-OR\">or</a> promoted in the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">Universities</a> during the Puritan rule, was one of the most distinguished of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LATITUDINARIAN\">Latitudinarian</a> or Arminian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> who came forth at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESTORATION\">Restoration</a>, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> imbibed from their Calvinistic masters, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as from the writings of antiquity, yet tempered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of their own agitated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; and with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TOLERATION\">toleration</a> more impartial and mature, though less systematic and professedly comprehensive, than that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INDEPENDENTS\">Independents</a>, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> who preached that doctrine.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> was placed in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> by the revolution, and their influence was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> among its rulers and luminaries. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> of their scholars turned their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> too much from the cultivation of the heart to the mere government of outward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>; and in succeeding times the tolerant spirit, not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to an establishment, was with difficulty kept up by a government whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> depended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ON\">on</a> discouraging intolerant pretensions. No sooner had the first sketch of the Hobbian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> been privately circulated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, than Cudworth seized the earliest opportunity of sounding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> against the most justly odious of the modes of thinking which it cultivates, or forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> which it would introduce; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRELUDE\">prelude</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAR\">war</a> which occupied the remaining forty years of his life. The Intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">System</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> production, is directed against the atheistical opinions of Hobbes; it touches ethical questions but occasionally and incidentally. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of stupendous erudition, of much more acuteness than at first appears, of frequent mastery over diction and illustration on subjects where it is most rare; and it is distinguished, perhaps beyond any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of controversy, by that best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the deepest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s principles, a fearless statement of the most formidable objections to them; a fairness rarely practised but by him who is conscious of his power to answer them. In all his writings, it must be owned, that his learning obscures his reasonings, and seems even to oppress his powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>. It is an unfortunate effect of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REDUNDANT\">redundant</a> fulness of his mind, that it overflows in endless digressions, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of argument, and turn aside the thoughts of the reader from the main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>. He was educated before usage had limited the naturalization of new words from the learned languages; before the failure of those great men, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>, who laboured to follow a Latin order in their sentences,\u2014and the success of those men of inferior powers, from Cowley to Addison, who were content with the order, as well as the words, of pure and elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>,\u2014had, as it were, by a double <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of experiments, ascertained that the involutions and inversions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> languages are seldom reconcilable with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of ours; and, unless skilfully, as well as sparingly introduced, are at variance with the natural beauties of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>.

The earliest account of them is in a curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> pamphlet, entitled, An Account of the new Sect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">Latitude</a>-men at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, republished in the collection of tracts entitled, Phoenix Britanicus.

One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a> volume on morals was published by Dr Chandler, bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>, entitled, *A Treatise concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality*. But there is the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to regret (as far as relates to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>) that the larger treatises are still unpublished, because the above volume is not so much an ethical treatise as an introduction to one. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROTAGORAS\">Protagoras</a> of old, and Hobbes then alive, having concluded that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and wrong were unreal, because they were not perceived by the senses, and because all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> knowledge consists only in such perception, Cudworth endeavours to refute them, by disproving that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a> which forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a>-stated proposition. The mind has many conceptions (\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9) which are not cognizable by the senses; and though they are occasioned by sensible objects, yet could not be formed but by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> superior to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>. The conceptions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> he places among them. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of right from wrong is discerned by reason; and as soon as these words are defined, it becomes evident that it would be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> in terms to affirm that any power, human or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a>, could change their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; or, in other words, make the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and unjust at the same time. They had existed eternally, in the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which truths can be said to be eternal, in the Eternal Mind; and they were indestructible and unchangeable like that Supreme Intelligence.\n\nWhatever judgment may be formed of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>, it is manifest that it relates merely to the philosophy of the understanding, and does not attempt any explanation of what constitutes the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a> of morality, its relation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a>. That we perceive a distinction between right and wrong as much as between a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, is indeed true; and may possibly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to an explanation of the reason why men should adhere to the one and avoid the other. But it is not that reason. A command or a precept is not a proposition. It cannot be said that either is true or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>. Cudworth, as well as many who succeeded him, confounded the mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> by the understanding that right is different from wrong, with the practical authority of these important conceptions, exercised over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> actions, in a totally distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>.\n\nThough his life was devoted to the assertion of divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>, and though his philosophy was imbued with the religious spirit of Platonism, yet he had placed Christianity too purely in the love of God and man to be considered as having much regard for those controversies about rites and opinions with which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-ZEALOTS\">zealots</a> disturb the world. They represented him as having fallen into the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> with Milton and with Clarke; and some of them even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> him with atheism, for no other reason than that he was not afraid to state the atheistic difficulties in their fullest force. As <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> heaps inconsistent accusations on each other, they called him at least \"an Arian, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SOCINIAN\">Socinian</a>, or a Deist.\" The courtiers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II., who were delighted with every part of Hobbes but his in-\n\n---\n\n1 A curious account of the history of these MSS. by Dr Kippis, is to be found in the *Biographia Britannica*, IV. 549.\n2 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, 1731, &c.\n3 \"There are many objects of our mind which we can neither see, hear, feel, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and which did never enter into it by any sense; and therefore we can have no sensible pictures or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of them, drawn by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> of that inward linner or painter which borrows all his colours from sense, which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> Fancy: and if we reflect on our own cogitations of these things, we shall sensibly perceive that they are not phantastical, but acematical: as, for example, justice, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a>, duty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a>, cognition, opinion, intellect, volition, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, verity, falsity, cause, effect, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, nullity, contingency, possibility, impossibility, and innumerable others.\" (*Eternal and Immutable Morality*, p. 140.)

It is disfigured by the absurd affectation of mathematical forms then prevalent; and it is encumbered and deformed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of physiological speculations, groundless, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-OR\">or</a> at best uncertain, wholly foreign from its proper purpose, which repel the inquirer into mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> from its perusal, and lessen the respect of the physiologist for the author's judgment.

At that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, chemical phenomena were referred to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> principles; vegetable and animal life were subjected to mechanical or chemical laws; and while some physiologists ascribed the vital functions to the understanding, the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of metaphysicians were disposed, with a grosser <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, to derive the intellectual operations from bodily causes.

E. Stahl, born in 1660; died in 1734; a German physician and chemist of deserved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>.\nHartley and Condillac, who, much about the same time, but seemingly without any knowledge of each other's speculations, began in a very similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> to simplify, but also to mutilate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of Locke, stopped short of what is called Materialism, which consummates the confusion, but touched its threshold. Thither, it must be owned, their philosophy pointed, and thither their followers proceeded. Hartley and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BONNET\">Bonnet</a>, still more than Condillac, suffered themselves, like most of their contemporaries, to overlook the important truth, that all the changes in the organs which can be likened to other material phenomena, are nothing more than antecedents and prerequisites of perception, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> not the faintest likeness to it; as much outward in relation to the thinking principle, as if they occurred in any other part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>; and of which the entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a>, if it were attained, would not bring us a step nearer to the nature of thought. They who would have been the first to exclaim against the mistake of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, fell into the more unspeakable error of confounding the perception of objects, as outward, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of our own mental operations. Locke's doctrine, that Reflection was a separate source of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, left room for this greatest of all distinctions,\u2014though with much unhappiness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, and with no little variance from the course of his own speculations. Hartley, Condillac, and Bonnet, in hewing away this seeming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a> from the system of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, unwittingly struck off the part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> which, however unsightly, gave it the power of yielding some shelter and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> to truths, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> rendered it utterly untenable. They became consistent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOMINALISTS\">Nominalists</a>; a controversy on which Locke expresses himself with confusion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>; but on this subject they added nothing to what had been taught by Hobbes and Berkeley. Both Hartley and Condillac have the merit of having been unseated by the temptations either of scepticism or of useless idealism; which, even if Berkeley and Hume could have been unknown to them, must have been within sight. Both agree in referring all the intellectual operations to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> of ideas, and in representing that association as reducible to the single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, that ideas which enter the mind at the same time, acquire a tendency to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> up each other, which is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the frequency of their having entered together. In this important part of their doctrine they seem, whether unconsciously or otherwise, to have only repeated, and very much expanded, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of Hobbes. In its simplicity it is more agreeable than the system of Mr Hume, who admitted five independent laws of association; and it is in comprehension far superior to the views of the same subject by Mr Locke, whose ill-chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a> still retains its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOMENCLATURE\">nomenclature</a>, but who only appeals to the principle as explaining some fancies and whimsies of the human mind. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> fault of Hartley is that of a rash generalization, which may prove <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>, and which is at least premature. All attempts to explain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a> by this principle have hitherto been unavailing. Many of the most important processes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> have not hitherto been accounted for by it. It would appear by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, that even this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, simple as it appears, presupposes many facts relating to the mind, of which its authors\n\n1 Born in 1715; died in 1780.\n2 Trait\u00e9 sur l'Origine des Connaissances Humaines, 1746; Trait\u00e9 des Syst\u00e8mes, 1749; Trait\u00e9 des Sensations, 1754. Foreign books were then little and slowly known in England. Hartley's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, except on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>, seems confined to the physical and mathematical sciences; and his whole manner of thinking and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> is so different from that of Condillac, that there is not the least reason to suppose the work of the one to have been known to the other.\n3 The work of Hartley, as we learn from the sketch of his life by his son, prefixed to the edition of 1791, was begun in 1730, and finished in 1746.\n4 Born in 1729; died in 1793.\n5 The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> of Condillac will show how much he differed from Hartley in his mode of considering the Newtonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> of vibrations, and how far he was in that respect superior to him. \"Je suppose ici et ailleurs que les perceptions de l'\u00e2me ont pour cause physique l'\u00c9branlement des fibres du cerveau; non que je regarde <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CETTE\">cette</a> hypoth\u00e8se comme d\u00e9montr\u00e9e, mais parcequ'elle est la plus commode pour expliquer ma pens\u00e9e.\" (Oeuvres de Condillac, I. 60. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, 1793.)\n6 Human Nature, chap. iv. v. vi. For more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> statements, see Notes and Illustrations, note T.\n7 \"Ce que les logiciens ont dit des raisonnements dans bien des volumes, me paroit enti\u00e8rement superflu, et de nul usage\" (Condillac, I. 115); an assertion of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> absurdity will be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> to the readers of Dr Whately's Treatise on Logic, one of the most important works of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.\ndo not seem to have suspected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>. How many ultimate facts of that nature, for example, are contained and involved in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>'s celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the mind in its first state to a sheet of unwritten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>! The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> of the paper, even its colour, the sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> fit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on it, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> to receive and to retain impressions, all its differences, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WATER\">water</a> on the other, certainly presuppose some facts, and may imply many, without a distinct statement of which, the nature of writing could not be explained to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> wholly ignorant of it. How many more, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as greater laws, may be necessary to enable mind to perceive outward objects! If the power of perception may be thus dependent, why may not what is called the association of ideas, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> between thoughts, the power of one to suggest another, be affected by mental laws hitherto unexplored, perhaps unobserved?\n\nBut to return from digression into the intellectual part of man: It becomes proper to say, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between Hartley and Condillac, and the immeasurable superiority of the former, are chiefly to be found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> which Hartley first made of the law of association to that other unnamed portion of our nature with which morality more immediately deals; that which feels pain and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, is influenced by appetites and loathings, by desires and aversions, by affections and repugnances. Condillac's Treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SENSATION\">Sensation</a>, published five years after the work of Hartley, reproduces the doctrine of Hobbes with its root, namely, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> are but transformed sensations; by which he means perceptions of the senses; and its wide-spread branches, consisting in desires and passions, which are only modifications of self-love. \"The words goodness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>,\" says he, almost in the very words of Hobbes, \"express those qualities of things by which they contribute to our pleasures?\" In the whole of his philosophical works, we find no trace of any desire produced by association, of any disinterested principle, or indeed of any distinction between the percipient and what, perhaps, we may now venture to call the emotive or the pathematic part of human nature, until some more convenient and agreeable name shall be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> on by some luckier or more skilful adventurer, in such new terms as seem to be absolutely necessary.\n\nTo the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a>, humble, and anxiously conscientious character of Hartley, we owe the knowledge that, about the year 1730, he was informed that the Rev. Mr Gay of Sidney <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, then living in the west of England, asserted the possibility of deducing all our intellectual pleasures and pains from association; that this led him (Hartley) to consider the power of association; and that about that time Mr Gay published his sentiments on this matter in a dissertation prefixed to Bishop Law's Translation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s Origin of Evil. No writer deserves more the praise of abundant fairness than Hartley in this avowal. The dissertation of which he speaks is mentioned by no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> but himself. It suggested nothing apparently to any other reader. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> texture of it is that of homespun selfishness. The writer had the merit to see and to own that Hutcheson had established as a fact the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> of moral sentiments and disinterested affections. He blames, perhaps justly, that most ingenious man, for assuming that these sentiments and affections are implanted, and partake of the nature of instincts. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his dissertation is to reconcile the mental appearances described by Hutcheson with the\n\n---\n\n1 See Notes and Illustrations, note U.\n2 Condillac III. 21; more especially Trait\u00e9 des Sensations, part ii. chap. vii.\n3 Its love for outward objects is only an effect of love for itself.\n4 Trait\u00e9 des Sensations, part iv. chap. iii.\n5 Hartley's Preface to the Observations on Man. The word intellectual is too narrow. Even mental would be of very doubtful propriety. The theory in its full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> requires a word such as imagistic, (if no better can be discovered) extending to all gratification, not distinctly referred to some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> organ, or at least to some assignable part of the bodily frame.\n6 It has not been mentioned in its proper place, that Hutcheson appears nowhere to greater advantage than in Letters on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FABLE\">Fable</a> of the Bees, published when he was very young, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, in a publication called Hibernia. \"Private vices public benefits,\" says he, \"may signify any one of these five distinct propositions: 1. They are in themselves public benefits; or, 2. They naturally produce public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>; or, 3. They may be made to produce it; or, 4. They may naturally flow from it; or, 5. At least they may probably flow from it in our infirm nature.\" (See a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> containing Thoughts on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAUGHTER\">Laughter</a>, and Observations on the Fable of the Bees, Glasgow, 1786, in which these letters are republished.)\nfirst principle of the selfish system, that \"the true principle of all our actions is our own happiness.\" Moral feelings and social affections are, according to him, \"resolvable into reason, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> out our private happiness; and wherever this end is not perceived, they are to be accounted for from the association of ideas.\" Even in the single passage in which he shows a glimpse of the truth, he begins with confusion, advances with hesitation, and after holding in his grasp for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> the principle which sheds so strong a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> around it, suddenly drops it from his hand. Instead of receiving the statements of Hutcheson (his silence relating to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a> is unaccountable) as enlargements of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of man, he deals with them merely as difficulties to be reconciled with the received system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> selfishness. In the conclusion of his fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, he well exemplifies the power of association in forming the love of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, of power, &c.; but he still treats these effects of association as aberrations and infirmities, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of our forgetfulness and shortsightedness, and not at all as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> employed to sow and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REAR\">rear</a> the most important principles of a social and moral nature.\n\nThis precious mine may therefore be truly said to have been opened by Hartley; for he who did such superabundant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to the hints of Gay, would assuredly not have withheld the like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> from Hutcheson, had he observed the happy expression of \"secondary passions,\" which ought to have led that philosopher himself farther than he ventured to advance. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> value of this part of Hartley's system has been hidden by various causes, which have also enabled writers who borrow from it to decry it. The influence of his medical habits renders many of his examples displeasing, and sometimes disgusting. He has none of that knowledge of the world, of that familiarity with literature, of that delicate perception of the beauties of nature and art, which not only supply the most agreeable illustrations of mental philosophy, but afford the most obvious and striking instances of its happy application to subjects generally interesting. His particular applications of the general law are often mistaken, and seldom more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> notes and hasty suggestions; the germs of theories which, while some might adopt them without detection, others might discover without being aware that they were anticipated. To which it may be added, that in spite of the imposing forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, the work is not really distinguished by good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>, or even uniform adherence to that which had been chosen. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> is entitled to no praise but that of clearness, and a simplicity of diction, through which is visible a singular simplicity of mind. No book perhaps exists which, with so few of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> allurements, comes at last so much to please by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> it presents of the writer's character,\u2014a character which kept him pure from the pursuit, often from the consciousness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, and rendered him a discoverer in spite of his own modesty. In those singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> in which, amidst the profound internal tranquillity of all the European nations, he foretells <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> convulsions, to be followed by the overthrow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a> and churches, his quiet and gentle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>, elsewhere almost ready to inculcate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> obedience for the sake of peace, is supported under its awful forebodings by the hope of that general progress in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and happiness which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> through the preparatory confusion. A meek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, inclining towards mysticism, and sometimes indulging in visions which borrow a lustre from his fervid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, was beautifully, and perhaps singularly, blended in him with zeal for the most unbounded freedom of inquiry, flowing both from his own conscientious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> and his unmingled love of truth. Whoever can so far subdue his repugnance to petty or secondary faults as to bestow a careful perusal on the work, must be unfortunate if he does not see, feel, and own, that the writer was a great philosopher and a good man.\n\nTo those who thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the work, it will be apparent that Hartley, like other philosophers, either overlooked, or failed explicitly to announce, that distinction between perception and emotion, without which no system of mental philosophy is complete. Hence arose the partial and incomplete view of truth conveyed by the use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> \"association of ideas.\" If the word association, which rather indicates the connection between separate things, than the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> and fusion which occur in many operations of the mind, must, notwithstanding its inadequacy, still be retained, the phrase ought at least to be \"association of thoughts with emotions, as well as with each other.\" With that enlargement an objection to the Hartleian doctrine would have been avoided, and its originality, as well as superiority over that of Condillac, would have appeared indisputable. The examples of avarice and other factious passions are very well chosen; first, because few will be found to suppose that they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> principles of human nature; secondly, because the process by which they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a>, being subsequent to the age of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>, may be brought home to the understanding of all men; and, thirdly, because they afford the most striking instance of secondary passions, which not only become independent of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> principles from which they are derived, but hostile to them, and so superior in strength as to be capable of overpowering their parents. As soon as the mind becomes familiar with the frequent case of the man who first pursued money to purchase pleasure, but at last, when he becomes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MISER\">miser</a>, loves his hoard better than all that it could purchase, and sacrifices all pleasures for its increase, we are prepared to admit that, by a like process, the affections, when they are fixed on the happiness of others as their ultimate object, without any reflection on self, may not only be perfectly detached from self-regard or private desires, but may subdue these, and every other antagonist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> which can stand in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAY\">way</a>. As the miser loves money for its own sake, so may the benevolent man delight in the wellbeing of his fellows. His good-will becomes as disinterested as if it had been implanted and underived. The like process applied to what is called self-love, or the desire of permanent wellbeing, clearly explains the mode in which that principle is gradually formed from the separate appetites, without whose previous existence no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of wellbeing could be obtained. In like manner, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a>, perhaps itself the result of a transfer of our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> feelings by association to other sentient beings, and of a subsequent transfer of their feelings to our own minds, engenders the various social affections, which at last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> in most minds some regard to the wellbeing of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, of mankind, of all creatures capable of pleasure. Rational self-love controls and guides those far keener self-regarding passions of which it is the child, in the same manner as general benevolence balances and governs the variety of much warmer social affections from which it springs.\n\nIt is an ancient and obstinate error of philosophers to represent these two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> principles as being the source of the impelling passions and affections, instead of being among the last results of them. Each of them exercises a sort of authority in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, but the dominion of neither is co-existent with the whole nature of man. Though they have the power to quicken and check, they are both too feeble to impel; and if the primary principles were extinguished, they would both perish from want of nourishment. If indeed all appetites and desires were destroyed, no subject would exist on which either of these general principles could act.\n\nThe affections, desires, and emotions, having for their ultimate object the dispositions and actions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> agents, which alone, from the nature of their object, are co-extensive with the whole of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> nature, are, according to the same philosophy, necessarily formed in every human mind by the transfer of feeling which is effected by the principle of association. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">Gratitude</a>, pity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>, and shame, seem to be the simplest, the most active, and the most uniform elements in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>.\n\nIt is easy to perceive how the complacency inspired by a benefit may be transferred to a benefactor, thence to all beneficent beings and acts. The well-chosen instance of the nurse familiarly exemplifies the manner in which the child transfers his complacency from the gratification of his senses to the cause of it, and thus learns an affection for her who is the source of\n\n---\n\n1 A very ingenious man, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Kames, whose works had a great effect in rousing the mind of his contemporaries and countrymen, has indeed fancied that there is \"a hoarding instinct\" in man and other animals. But such conclusions are not so much objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a>, as ludicrous proofs of the absurdity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a> which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to them.\nhis enjoyment. With this simple process concur, in the case of a tender nurse, and far more of a mother, a thousand acts of relief and endearment, of which the complacency is fixed on the person from whom they flow, and in some degree extended by association to all who resemble that person. So much of the pleasure of early life depends on others, that the like process is almost constantly repeated. Hence the origin of benevolence may be understood, and the disposition to approve all benevolent, and disapprove all malevolent acts. Hence also the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> and disapprobation are extended to all acts which we clearly perceive to promote or obstruct the happiness of men.\n\nWhen the complacency is extended to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, benevolence may be said to be transformed into a part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>. The rise of sympathy may probably be explained by the process of association, which transfers the feelings of others to ourselves, and ascribes our own feelings to others;\u2014at first, and in some degree, always in proportion as the resemblance of ourselves to others is complete. The likeness in the outward signs of emotion is one of the widest channels in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of hearts. Pity thereby becomes one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> sources of benevolence, and perhaps contributes more largely than gratitude. It is indeed one of the first motives to the conferring of those benefits which inspire grateful affection. Sympathy with the sufferer, therefore, is also transformed into a real sentiment, directly approving benevolent actions and dispositions, and more remotely all actions that promote happiness. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> of the sufferer, first against all causes of pain, afterwards against all intentional agents who produce it, and finally against all those in whom the infliction of pain proceeds from a mischievous disposition, when it is communicated to others by sympathy, and is so far purified by gradual separation from selfish and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> as to be equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> against all wrong-doers, whether the wrong be done against ourselves, our friends, or our enemies, is the root out of which springs that\n\nwhich is commonly and well called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">Sense</a> of Justice\u2014the most indispensable, perhaps, of all the component parts of the moral faculties. It is the main guard against wrong. It relates to that portion of morality where many of the outward acts are capable of being reduced under certain rules, of which the violations, wherever the rule is sufficiently precise, and the mischief sufficiently great, may be guarded against by the terror of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of the rules of justice consists <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>; breaches of them we denominate crimes. An abhorrence of crimes, especially of those which indicate the absence of benevolence, as well as of regard to justice, is peculiarly strong; because well-framed penal laws, being the lasting declaration of the moral indignation of many generations of mankind, exceedingly strengthen the same feeling in every individual, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as they remain in unison with the sentiments of the age and country for which they are destined, and, indeed, wherever the laws do not so much deviate from the habitual feelings as to produce a struggle between law and sentiment, in which it is hard to say on which side success is most deplorable. A man who performs his duties may be esteemed, but is not admired; because it requires no more than ordinary virtue to act well where it is shameful and dangerous to do otherwise. The righteousness of those who act solely from such inferior motives, is little better than that \"of the Scribes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHARISEES\">Pharisees</a>.\" Those only are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> in the eye of the moralist who act justly from a constant disposition to render to every man his own. Acts of kindness, of generosity, of pity, of placability, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, when they are long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, can hardly fail mainly to flow from the pure fountain of an excellent nature. They are not reducible to rules; and the attempt to enforce them by punishment would destroy them. They are virtues of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a> consists in a good disposition of mind. As we gradually transfer our desire from praise to praiseworthiness, this principle also is adopted into consciousness. On the other hand,\n\n---\n\n1 \"Justitia est constans et perpetua voluntas suum cuique tribuendi;\" an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> in the mouth of the Stoical moralists, from whom it is borrowed, but altogether misplaced by the Roman Jurists in a body of laws which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> only with outward acts in their relation to the order and interest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>.\nwhen we are led by association to feel a painful contempt for those feelings and actions of our past self which we despise in others, there is developed in our hearts another element of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>. It is a remarkable instance of the power of the law of association, that the contempt or abhorrence which we feel for the bad actions of others may be transferred by it, in any degree of strength, to our own past actions of the like kind. And as the hatred of bad actions is transferred to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>, the same transfer may occur in our own case in a manner perfectly similar to that of which we are conscious in our feelings towards our fellow-creatures. There are many causes which render it generally feebler; but it is perfectly evident that it requires no more than a sufficient strength of moral feeling to make it equal; and that the most apparently hyperbolical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> used by penitents, in describing their remorse, may be justified by the principle of association.\n\nAt this step in our progress, it is proper to observe, that a most important consideration has escaped Hartley, as well as every other philosopher. The language of all mankind implies that the moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>, whatever it may be, and from what origin soever it may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, is intelligibly and properly spoken of as One. It is as common in mind as in matter for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> to have properties not to be found in any of its constituent parts. The truth of this proposition is as certain in the human feelings as in any material combination. It is therefore easily understood, that originally separate feelings may be so perfectly blended by a process performed in every mind, that they can no longer be disjoined from each other, but must always co-operate, and thus reach the only union which we can conceive. The sentiment of Moral Approbation, formed by association out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANTECEDENT\">antecedent</a> affections, may become so perfectly independent of them, that we are no longer conscious of the means by which it was formed, and never can in practice repeat; though we may in theory perceive, the process by which it was generated. It is in that mature and sound state of our nature that our emotions at the view of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">Right</a> and Wrong are ascribed to Conscience. But why, it may be asked, do these feelings, rather than others, run into each other, and constitute Conscience? The answer seems to be what has already been intimated, in the observations on Butler. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> between these feelings consists in this, that while all other feelings relate to outward objects, they alone contemplate exclusively the dispositions and actions of voluntary agents. When they are completely transferred from objects, and even persons, to dispositions and actions, they are fitted, by the perfect coincidence of their aim, for combining to form that one faculty which is directed only to that aim.\n\nThe words Duty and Virtue, and the word Ought, which most perfectly denotes Duty, but is also connected with Virtue, in every well-constituted mind, in this state become the fit language of the acquired, perhaps, but universally and necessarily acquired, faculty of Conscience. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of its peculiar nature has been attempted in the remarks on Butler;\u2014for others a fitter occasion will occur hereafter. Some light may however now be thrown on the subject by a short statement of the hitherto unobserved distinction between the moral sentiments and another class of feelings with which they have some qualities in common. The pleasures (so called) of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">Imagination</a> appear, at least in most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, to originate in association. But it is not till the original cause of the gratification is obliterated from the mind, that they acquire their proper character. Order and proportion may be at first chosen for their convenience; it is not until they are admired for their own sake that they become objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. Though all the proportions for which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> is valued may be indications of speed, safety, strength, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, it is not the less true that they only can be said to admire the animal for his beauty, who leave such considerations out of the account while they admire. The pleasure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> in these particulars of nature and art becomes universal and immediate, being entirely detached from all regard to individual beings. It contemplates neither use nor interest.\n\nSee supra, section on Butler.\nIn this important particular the pleasures of imagination agree with the moral sentiments. Hence the application of the same language to both in ancient and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times. Hence also it arises that they may contemplate the very same qualities and objects. There is certainly much beauty in the softer virtues\u2014much grandeur in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HERO\">Hero</a> or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MARTYR\">Martyr</a>. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> distinction still remains. The purest moral taste contemplates these qualities only with quiescent delight or reverence. It has no further view\u2014it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> towards no action. Conscience, on the contrary, containing in it a pleasure in the prospect of doing right, and an ardent desire to act well, having for its sole object the dispositions and acts of voluntary agents, is not, like moral taste, satisfied with passive contemplation, but constantly tends to act on the will and conduct of the man. Moral taste may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> it, may be absorbed into it, and usually contributes its part to the formation of the moral faculty; but it is distinct from that faculty, and may be disproportioned to it. Conscience, being by its nature confined to mental dispositions and voluntary acts, is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> excluded from the ordinary consideration of all things antecedent to these dispositions. The circumstances from which such states of mind may arise, are most important objects of consideration for the understanding; but they are without the sphere of conscience, which never ascends beyond the heart of the man. It is thus that in the eye of conscience man becomes amenable to its authority for all his inclinations as well as deeds; that some of them are approved, loved, and revered; and that all the outward effects of disesteem, contempt, or moral anger, are felt to be the just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> of others.\n\nBut, to return to Hartley, from this perhaps intrusive statement of what does not properly belong to him: He represents all the social affections of gratitude, veneration, and love, inspired by the virtues of our fellow-men, as capable of being transferred by association to the transcendent and unmingled goodness of the Ruler of the world, and thus to give rise to piety, to which he gives the name of the theopatheic affection. This principle, like all the former in the mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, is gradually detached from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> on which it grew: it takes separate root, and may altogether overshadow the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> stock. As such a being cannot be conceived without the most perfect and constant reference to his goodness, so piety may not only become a part of conscience, but its governing and animating principle, which, after long lending its own energy and authority to every other, is at last described by our philosopher as swallowing up all of them in order to perform the same functions more infallibly.\n\nIn every stage of this progress we are taught by Dr Hartley that a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> appears, which becomes perfectly distinct from the elements which formed it, which may be utterly dissimilar to them, and may attain any degree of vigour, however superior to theirs. Thus the objects of the private desires disappear when we are employed in the pursuit of our lasting welfare; that which was first sought only as a means, may come to be pursued as an end, and preferred to the original end; the good opinion of our fellows becomes more valued than the benefits for which it was at first courted; a man is ready to sacrifice his life for him who has shown generosity, even to others; and persons otherwise of common character are capable of cheerfully marching in a forlorn hope, or of almost instinctively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAPING\">leaping</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the life of an entire stranger. These last acts, often of almost unconscious virtue, so familiar to the soldier and the sailor, so unaccountable on certain systems of philosophy, often occur without a thought of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> and reward; too quickly for the thought of the latter, too obscurely for the hope of the former; and they are of such a nature that no man could be impelled to them by the mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of either.\n\nThe gratitude, sympathy, resentment, and shame, which are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> constituent parts of the Moral Sense, thus lose their separate agency, and constitute an entirely new faculty, co-extensive with all the dispositions and actions of voluntary agents; though some of them are more predominant in particular cases of moral sentiment than others, and though the aid of all continues to be necessary in their original character, as subordinate but distinct motives of action. Nothing more evidently points out the\ndistinction of the Hartleian system from all systems called selfish, not to say its superiority in respect to disinterestedness over all moral systems before Butler and Hutcheson, than that excellent part of it which relates to the Rule of Life. The various principles of human action rise in value according to the order in which they spring up after each other. We can then only be in a state of as much enjoyment as we are evidently capable of attaining, when we prefer interest to the original gratifications\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to interest\u2014the pleasures of imagination to those of sense\u2014the dictates of conscience to pleasure, interest, and reputation\u2014the well-being of fellow-creatures to our own indulgences; in a word, when we pursue moral good and social happiness chiefly and for their own sake.\n\n\"With self-interest,\" says Hartley, somewhat inaccurately in language, \"man must begin. He may end in self-annihilation. Theopathy, or piety, although the last result of the purified and exalted sentiments, may at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> swallow up every other principle, and absorb the whole man.\" Even if this last doctrine should be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAGGERATION\">exaggeration</a> unsuited to our present condition, it will the more strongly illustrate the compatibility, or rather the necessary connection, of this theory with the existence and power of perfectly disinterested principles of human action.\n\nIt is needless to remark on the secondary and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AUXILIARY\">auxiliary</a> causes which contribute to the formation of moral sentiment; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>, general opinion, laws and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. They all presuppose the moral faculty: in an improved state of society they contribute powerfully to strengthen it, and on some occasions they enfeeble, distort, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAIM\">maim</a> it; but in all cases they must themselves be tried by the test of an ethical standard.\n\nThe value of this doctrine will not be essentially affected by supposing a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of original principles than those assumed by Dr Hartley. The principle of association applies as much to a greater as to a smaller number. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> common to it with all theories, that the more simplicity it reaches consistently with truth, the more perfect it becomes. Causes are not to be multiplied without necessity. If by a considerable multiplication of primary desires the law of association were lowered nearly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of an auxiliary agent, the philosophy of human nature would still be under indelible obligations to the philosopher who, by his fortunate error, rendered the importance of that great principle obvious and conspicuous.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABRAHAM\">ABRAHAM</a> TUCKER\n\nIt has been the remarkable fortune of this writer to have been more prized by the cultivators of the same subjects, and more disregarded by the generality even of those who read books on such matters, than perhaps any other philosopher. He had many of the qualities which might be expected in an affluent country <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, living in a privacy undisturbed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> zeal, and with a leisure unbroken by the calls of a profession, at a time when England had not entirely renounced her old taste for metaphysical speculation. He was naturally endowed, not indeed with more than ordinary acuteness or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, nor with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of reach and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of mind, but with a singular capacity for careful observation and original reflection, and with a fancy perhaps unmatched in producing various and happy illustration. The most observable of his moral qualities appear to have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and cheerfulness, good-nature and easy temper. The influence of his situation and character is visible in his writings. Indulging his own tastes and fancies, like most English squires of his time, he became, like\n\n---\n\n1 Born in 1705; died in 1774.\n2 \"I have found in this writer more original thinking and observation upon the several subjects that he has taken in hand than in any other, not to say than in all others put together. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> also for illustration is unrivalled.\" (Paley, Preface to Moral and Political Philosophy.) See the excellent preface to an abridgement, by Mr Hazlitt, of Tucker's work, published in London in 1807. May I venture to refer also to my own discourse on the Law of Nature and Nations, London, 1799. Mr Stewart treats Tucker and Hartley with unwonted harshness.\nmany of them, a sort of humourist. Hence much of his originality and independence; hence the boldness with which he openly employs illustrations from homely objects. He wrote to please himself more than the public. He had too little regard for readers, either to sacrifice his sincerity to them, or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CURB\">curb</a> his own prolixity, repetition, and egotism, from the fear of fatiguing them. Hence he became as loose, as rambling, and as much an egotist as Montaigne; but not so agreeably so, notwithstanding a considerable resemblance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>; because he wrote on subjects where disorder and egotism are unseasonable, and for readers whom they disturb instead of amusing. His prolixity at last increased itself, when his work became so long, that repetition in the latter parts partly arose from forgetfulness of the former; and though his freedom from slavish deference to general opinion is very commendable, it must be owned, that his want of a wholesome fear of the public renders the perusal of a work which is extremely interesting, and even amusing in most of its parts, on the whole a laborious task. He was by early education a believer in Christianity, if not by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> character <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>. His calm good sense and accommodating temper led him rather to explain established doctrines in a manner agreeable to his philosophy, than to assail them. Hence he was represented as a time-server by free-thinkers, and as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HERETIC\">heretic</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORTHODOX\">orthodox</a>.\n\nLiving in a country where the secure tranquillity flowing from the Revolution was gradually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> forth all mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> towards practical pursuits and outward objects, he hastened from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of mental and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a>, to those branches of it which touch the business of men. Had he recast without changing his thoughts,\u2014had he detached those ethical observations for which he had so peculiar a vocation, from the disputes of his country and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>,\u2014he might have thrown many of his chapters into their proper form of essays, which might have been compared, though not likened, to those of Hume. But the country gentleman, philosophic as he was, had too much fondness for his own humours to engage in a course of drudgery and deference. It may, however, be confidently added, on the authority of all those who have fairly made the experiment, that whoever, unfettered by a previous system, undertakes the labour necessary to discover and relish the high excellencies of this metaphysical Montaigne, will find his toil lightened as he proceeds, by a growing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol12.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>, if not partiality, for the foibles of the humourist; and at last rewarded, in a greater degree perhaps than by any other writer on mixed and applied philosophy, by being led to commanding stations and new points of view, whence the mind of a moralist can hardly fail to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> some fresh prospects of nature and duty.\n\nIt is in mixed, not in pure philosophy, that his superiority consists. In the part of his work which relates to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>, he has adopted much from Hartley, hiding but aggravating the offence by a change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> terms; and he was ungrateful enough to countenance the vulgar sneer which involves the mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of that philosopher in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> to which his physiological hypothesis is liable. Thus, for the Hartleian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Association he substitutes that of Translation, when he adopts the same theory of the principles which move the mind to action. In the practical and applicable part of that inquiry he indeed far surpasses Hartley; and it is little to add, that he unspeakably exceeds that bare and naked thinker in the useful as well as admirable faculty of illustration. In the strictly theoretical\n\n---\n\n1 This disposition to compromise and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>, which is discoverable in Paley, was carried to its utmost length by Mr Hey, a man of much acuteness, Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIVINITY\">Divinity</a> at Cambridge.\n\n2 Perhaps no philosopher ever stated more justly, more naturally, or more modestly than Tucker, the ruling maxim of his life. \"My thoughts,\" says he, \"have taken a turn from my earliest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> towards searching into the foundations and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of right and wrong; my love for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a> has furnished me with continual leisure; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of my reason has been my daily employment.\"\n\n3 Light of Nature, I. c. xviii., of which the conclusion may be pointed out as a specimen of perhaps unmatched fruitfulness, vivacity, and felicity of illustration. The admirable sense of the conclusion of chap. xxv. seems to have suggested Paley's good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> on Happiness. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>'s comparison of reason to a charioteer, and the passions to the horses, in chap. xxvi. is of characteristic and transcendent excellence.\npart his exposition is considerably fuller; but the defect of his genius becomes conspicuous when he handles a very general principle. The very term Translation ought to have kept up in his mind a steady <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> that the secondary motives to action become as independent, and seek their own objects as exclusively, as the primary principles. His own examples are rich in proofs of this important truth. But there is a slippery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> in the Theory of Human Nature, by which he, like most of his forerunners, slid unawares into selfishness. He was not preserved from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> by seeing that all the deliberate principles which have self for their object are themselves of secondary formation; and he was led to the general error by the notion that Pleasure, or, as he calls it, Satisfaction, was the original and sole object of all appetites and desires; confounding this with the true but very different proposition, that the attainment of all the objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPETITE\">appetite</a> and desire is productive of pleasure. He did not see that, without presupposing Desires, the word Pleasure would have no signification; and that the representations by which he was seduced would leave only one appetite or desire in human nature. He had no adequate and constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, that the translation of Desire from the end to the means occasioned the formation of a new passion, which is perfectly distinct from, and altogether independent of, the original desire. Too frequently (for he was neither obstinate nor uniform in error) he considered these translations as accidental defects in human nature, not as the appointed means of supplying it with its variety of active principles. He was too apt to speak as if the selfish elements were not destroyed in the new combination, but remained still capable of being recalled, when convenient, like the links in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of reasoning, which we pass over from forgetfulness, or for brevity. Take him all in all, however, the neglect of his writings is the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the disinclination of the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, for the last half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, to Metaphysical Philosophy.","sp":588,"ep":598},{"h":"DAVID HUME","t":"The Life of Mr Hume, written by himself, is remarkable above most, if not all writings of that sort, for hitting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> between coldness and egotism which becomes a modest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in speaking of his private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>.

Very few men of so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> a character have been so warmly beloved. That he approached to the character of a perfectly good and wise man, is an affectionate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAGGERATION\">exaggeration</a>, for which his friend Dr Smith, in the first moments of his sorrow, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WELL\">well</a> be excused. But such a praise can never be earned without passing through either of the extremes of fortune; without standing the test of temptations, dangers, and sacrifices. It may be said with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that the private character of Mr Hume exhibited all the virtues which a man of reputable station, under a mild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, in the quiet times of a civilized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, has often the opportunity to practise. He showed no want of the qualities which fit men for more severe trials. Though others had warmer affections, no man was a kinder relation, a more unwearied friend, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-OR\">or</a> more free from meanness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MALICE\">malice</a>. His character was so simple, that he did not even affect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>; but neither his friendships nor his deportment were changed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> which filled all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. His good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> manners, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> kindness, procured him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> the enviable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> not so alive to goodness, as without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> it at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the qualities of a celebrated man. His whole character is faithfully and touchingly represented in the story of La Roche, where Mr Mackenzie, without concealing Mr Hume's opinions, brings him into contact with scenes of tender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, and yet preserves the interest inspired by genuine and unalloyed, though moderated feelings and affections. The amiable and venerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> of Scottish Literature was averse from the opinions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ON\">on</a> whom he has composed this best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a>. He tells us that he read the manuscript to Dr Smith, \"who declared he did not find a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to, but added, with his characteristic absence of mind, that he was surprised he had never heard of the anecdote before.\" So lively was the delineation thus sanctioned by the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> of all testimonies. Mr Mackenzie indulges his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> feelings by modestly intimating, that Dr Smith's answer seemed to justify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> words of the tale, \"that there were moments when the philosopher recalled to his mind the venerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the good La Roche, and wished that he had never doubted.\" To those who are strangers to the seductions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a>, to the intoxication of fame, and to the bewitchment of prohibited opinions, it must be unaccountable, that he who revered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> should, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> regret, cease to see it on the Throne of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSE\">Universe</a>. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of wonder that his habitual esteem for every fragment and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> of moral excellence should not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> him to envy those who contemplated its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> in that living and paternal character which gives it a power over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> heart.\n\nOn the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, if we had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>\n\n---\n\n1 Born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> in 1711; died there in 1776.\n2 Dr Smith's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LETTER\">Letter</a> to Mr Strahan, annexed to the Life of Hume.\n3 See Notes and Illustrations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> P.\n4 Mirror, Nos. 42, 43, 44.\n5 Mackenzie's Life of John Home, p. 21.\nof the power of opposite opinions in producing irreconcilable animosities, we might have hoped that those who retained such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> privileges would have looked with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPASSION\">compassion</a> than dislike on a virtuous man who had lost them. In such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> it is too little remembered, that repugnance to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOCRISY\">hypocrisy</a>, and impatience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> concealment, are the qualities of the best formed minds; and that, if the publication of some doctrines proves often painful and mischievous, the habitual suppression of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is injurious to reason, and very dangerous to sincerity. Practical questions thus arise, so difficult and perplexing, that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> generally depends on the boldness or timidity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>,\u2014on his tenderness for the feelings of the good, or his greater reverence for the free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of reason. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TIME\">time</a> is not yet come when the noble maxim of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, \"that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> is unwillingly deprived of truth,\" <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be practically and heartily applied by men to the honest opponents who differ from them most widely.\n\nIn his twenty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> year he published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> the Treatise of Human Nature, the first systematic attack on all the principles of knowledge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, and the most formidable, if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> scepticism could ever be more than a mere exercise of ingenuity.\u00b9 This memorable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WORK\">work</a> was reviewed in a Journal of that time,\u00b2 in a criticism not distinguished by ability, which affects to represent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of a very clear writer as unintelligible\u2014sometimes from a purpose to insult, but oftener from sheer dulness\u2014which is unaccountably silent respecting the consequences of a sceptical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>; and which concludes with a prophecy so much at variance with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> of the article, that it would seem to be added by a different hand. \"It bears incontestable marks of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, of a soaring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, but young, and not yet thoroughly practised. Time and use may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a> these qualities in the author, and we shall probably have reason to consider this, compared with his later productions, in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> as we view the juvenile works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>, or the first manner of Raphael.\"\n\nThe great speculator did not, in this work, amuse himself, like Bayle, with dialectical exercises, which only inspire a disposition towards doubt, by showing in detail the uncertainty of most opinions. He aimed at proving, not that nothing was known, but that nothing could be known;\u2014from the structure of the understanding to demonstrate, that we are doomed for ever to dwell in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> and universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>. It is true that such a system of universal scepticism never can be more than an intellectual amusement, an exercise of subtlety; of which the only use is to check dogmatism, but which perhaps oftener provokes and produces that much more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> evil. As those dictates of experience which regulate conduct must be the objects of belief, all objections which attack them in common with the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> must be utterly ineffectual. Whatever attacks every principle of belief can destroy none. As long as the foundations of knowledge are allowed to remain on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> (be it called of certainty or uncertainty) with the maxims of life, the whole system of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> must continue undisturbed. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCEPTIC\">sceptic</a> boasts of having involved the results of experience and the elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> in the same ruin with the doctrines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, he may be answered, That no dogmatist ever claimed more than the same degree of certainty for these various convictions and opinions; and that his scepticism, therefore, leaves them in the relative condition in which it found them. \"No man knew better, or owned more frankly than Mr Hume, that to\n\n\u00b9 Sextus, a physician of the empirical, i.e. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-ANTI\">anti</a>-theoretical school, who lived at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANTONINUS_PIUS\">Antoninus Pius</a>, has preserved the reasonings of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Sceptics as they were to be found in their most improved state, in the writings of \u00c6neidemus, a Cretan, who was a Professor in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, soon after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> into a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>. The greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the grounds of doubt are very shallow and popular. There are, among them, intimations of the argument against a necessary connection of causes with effects, afterwards better presented by Glanville in his Sceptis Scientifica. See Notes and Illustrations, note Q.\n\n\u00b2 History of the Works of the Learned, November and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1739, p. 353\u2013404. This Review is attributed by some (Chalmers, Biographical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>) to Warburton, but certainly without foundation.\nthis answer there is no serious reply. Universal scepticism involves a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> in terms. It is a belief that there can be no belief. It is an attempt of the mind to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> without its structure, and by other laws than those to which its nature has subjected its operations. To reason without assenting to the principles on which reasoning is founded, is not unlike an effort to feel without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>, or to move without muscles. No man can be allowed to be an opponent in reasoning, who does not set out with admitting all the principles, without the admission of which it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to reason. It is indeed a puerile, nay, in the eye of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, a childish play, to attempt either to establish or to confute principles by argument, which every step of that argument must presuppose. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the two cases is, that he who tries to prove them can do so only by first taking them for granted; and that he who attempts to impugn them falls at the very first step into a contradiction, from which he never can rise.\n\nIt must, however, be allowed, that universal scepticism has practical consequences of a very mischievous nature. This is because its universality is not steadily kept in view, and constantly borne in mind. If it were, the above short and plain remark would be an effectual antidote to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>. But in practice, it is an armory from which weapons are taken to be employed against some opinions, while it is hidden from notice that the same weapon would equally cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> every other conviction. It is thus that Mr Hume's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of causation is used as an answer to arguments for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, without warning the reader that it would equally lead him not to expect that the sun will rise to-morrow. It must also be added, that those who are early accustomed to dispute first principles are never likely to acquire, in a sufficient degree, that earnestness and that sincerity, that strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of truth, and that conscientious solicitude for the formation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> opinions, which are not the least virtues of men, but of which the cultivation is the more especial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> of all who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> themselves philosophers.\n\nIt is not an uninteresting fact, that Mr Hume having been introduced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Kames (then Mr Henry Home) to Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>, sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of his Treatise to that philosopher at the moment of his preferment to the bishopric of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>; and that the perusal of it did not deter the philosophic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRELATE\">prelate</a> from \"everywhere recommending Mr Hume's Moral and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> Essays,\" published two years afterwards;\u2014Essays which it would indeed have been unworthy of such a man not to have liberally commended, for they, and those which followed them, whatever may be thought of the contents of some of them, must be ever regarded as the best models in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, of the short but full, of the clear and agreeable, though deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of difficult questions.\n\nMr Hume considered his Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals as the best of his writings. It is very creditable to his character, that he should have looked back with most complacency on a Tract the least distinguished by originality, and the least tainted with paradox, among his philosophical works; but deserving of all commendation for the elegant perspicuity of the style, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> of illustration and inference with which he unfolded to general readers a doctrine too simple, too certain, and too important, to remain till his time undiscovered among philosophers. His diction has, indeed, neither the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> of Berkeley nor the strength of Hobbes; but it is without the verbosity of the former, or the rugged sternness of the latter. His manner is more lively, more easy, more ingratiating, and, if the word may\n\n---\n\n1 This maxim, which contains a sufficient answer to all universal scepticism, or, in other words, to all scepticism properly so called, is significantly conveyed in the quaint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of an old and rare book, entitled, Scivi, sive Sceptici et Scepticorum Juris Disputatios Exclusio, by Thomas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WHITE\">White</a>, the metaphysician of the English Catholics in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times.\u2014\"Fortunately,\" says the illustrious sceptic himself, \"since Reason is incapable of dispelling these clouds, Nature herself suffices for that purpose, and cures me of this philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DELIRIUM\">delirium</a>\" (Treatise of Human Nature, I. 467); almost in the sublime and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> words of Pascal: La Raison confond les Dogmatistes, et la Nature les Sceptiques.\n\n2 It would be an act of injustice to those readers who are not acquainted with that valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> entitled, Essays on the Formation of Opinions, not to refer them to it as enforcing that neglected part of morality. To it may be added, a masterly article in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> Review, occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a>.\n\n3 Woodhouselee's Life of Kames, I. 95, 104.\nbe so applied, more amusing, than that of any other metaphysical writer. He knew himself too well to be, as Dr Johnson asserted, an imitator of Voltaire; who, as it were, embodied in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and quickness and versatile ingenuity of a people which surpasses other nations in these brilliant qualities. If he must be supposed to have had an eye on any French writer, it would be a more plausible guess, that he sometimes copied, with a temperate hand, the unexpected thoughts and familiar expressions of Fontenelle. Though he carefully weeded his writings in their successive editions, yet they still contain Scotticisms and Gallicisms enough to employ the successors of such critics as those who exulted over the Pata- vinity of the Roman Historian. His own great and modest mind would have been satisfied with the praise which cannot be withheld from him, that there is no writer in our language who, through long works, is more agreeable; and it is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEROGATION\">derogation</a> from him, that, as a Scotsman, he did not reach those native and secret beauties, characteristic of a language, which are never attained, in elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, but by a very small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of those who familiarly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> in it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>.\n\nThe Enquiry affords perhaps the best specimen of his style. In substance, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> merit is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, from an abundant enumeration of particulars, that all the qualities and actions of the mind which are generally approved by mankind agree in the circumstance of being useful to society. In the proof, (scarcely necessary) that benevolent affections and actions have that tendency, he asserts the real existence of these affections with unusual warmth; and he well abridges some of the most forcible arguments of Butler, whom it is remarkable that he does not mention. To show the importance of his principles, he very unnecessarily distinguishes the comprehensive duty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, from other parts of morality, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, for which our respect is solely derived from notions of utility. If all things were in such plenty that there could never be a want, or if men were so benevolent as to provide for the wants of others as much as for their own, there would, says he, in neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> be any justice, because there would be no need for it. But it is evident that the same reasoning is applicable to every good affection and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. None of them could exist if there were no scope for their exercise. If there were no suffering, there could be no pity and no relief. If there were no offences, there could be no placability. If there were no crimes, there could be no mercy. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">Temperance</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>, are qualities of which the value depends on the evils by which they are respectively exercised.\n\nOn purity of manners, it must be owned that Mr Hume, though he controverts no rule, yet treats vice with too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol12.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>. It was his general disposition to distrust virtues which are liable to exaggeration, and may be easily counterfeited. The ascetic pursuit of purity, and hypocritical pretences to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a>, had too much withdrawn the respect of his equally calm and sincere nature from these excellent virtues; more especially as severity in both these respects was often at apparent variance with affection, which can neither be long assumed, nor ever overvalued. Yet it was singular that he who, in his Essay on Polygamy and Divorce, had so\n\n---\n\n1 These commendations are so far from being at variance with the remarks of the late most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> Dr Thomas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>, on Mr Hume's \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>,\" (Enquiry into the Relation of Cause and Effect, 3d ed. 327) that they may rather be regarded as descriptive of those excellencies of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> produced the faults of Mr Hume as a mere searcher and teacher; justly, though perhaps severely, animadverted on by Dr Brown.\n\n2 Enquiry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. ii. part i., especially the concluding paragraphs; those which precede being more his own.\n\n3 Si nobis, cum eum vitae migraverimus in locum sumum insulis, ut fabulas fertur, immortale sevum degere licet, quid opus esset eloquentia, cum judicia nulla fuerint? aut ipsas etiam virtutes? Nec enim fortitudinis indigentem, nullo proposito laboris aut periculis; nec prudentiae, quem esset nihil quod spectaretur alieni; nec temperantiae, quem regeret cas quem nullae essent illudiones; nec prudentiae quemdam sermocinis, nullo proposito delectu bonorum et malorum. Una igitur eassemus beatissimae cognitionis rerum et scientiae.\" (Prag. Ctc. Hortensia, apud Augustin. de Trinitate.) Cicero is more extensive, and therefore more consistent, than Hume; but his Enquiry errs both by excess and defect. He supposes knowledge to render beings happy in this imaginary state, without stooping to inquire how. He omits a virtue which might well exist in it, though we cannot conceive its formation in such a state\u2014the delight in each other's wellbeing; and he omits a conceivable though unknown vice, that of unmixed ill-will, which would render such a state a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HELL\">hell</a> to the wretch who harboured the malevolence.\n\n4 Essays and Treatises, vol. I.\nwell shown the connection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> ties with the outward order of society, should not have perceived their deeper and closer relation to all the social feelings of human nature. It cannot be enough regretted, that, in an Enquiry written with a very moral purpose, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of making truth attractive, by throwing over her the dress of paradox, should have given him for a moment the appearance of weighing the mere amusements of society and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> against domestic fidelity, which is the preserver of domestic affection, the source of parental fondness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> regard, and, indirectly, of all the kindness which exists between human beings. That families are schools where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> heart learns to love, and that pure manners are the cement which alone holds these schools together, are truths so certain, that it is wonderful he should not have betrayed a stronger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of their importance. No one could so well have proved that all the virtues of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, in their various orders and degrees, minister to the benevolent affections; and that every act which separates the senses from the affections tends, in some degree, to deprive kindness of its natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AUXILIARY\">auxiliary</a>, and to lessen its prevalence in the world. It did not require his sagacity to discover that the gentlest and tenderest feelings flourish only under the stern guardianship of these severe virtues. Perhaps his philosophy was loosened, though his life was untainted, by that universal and undistinguishing profligacy which prevailed on the Continent, from the regency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a> to the French revolution; the most dissolute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of European history, at least since the Roman emperors. At Rome, indeed, the connection of licentiousness with cruelty, which, though scarcely traceable in individuals, is generally very observable in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> masses, bore a fearful testimony to the value of austere purity. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> of these remote vices seemed to be broken in the time of Mr Hume. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">Pleasure</a>, in a more improved state of society, seemed to return to her more natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> with kindness and tenderness, as well as with refinement and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a>. Had he lived fourteen years longer, however, he would have seen, that the virtues which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the natural seminaries of the affections are their only true and lasting friends. The demand of all well-informed men for the improvement of civil institutions\u2014the demand of classes of men growing in intelligence, to be delivered from a degrading inferiority, and admitted to a share of political power proportioned to their new importance, being feebly yet violently resisted by those ruling Castes who neither knew how to yield nor how to withstand\u2014being also attended by very erroneous principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a>, having suddenly broken down the barriers (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> as these were) of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> and government, led to popular excesses, desolating wars, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> dictatorship, which for a long time threatened to defeat the reformation, and to disappoint the hopes of mankind. This tremendous convulsion threw a fearful light on the ferocity which lies hid under the arts and pleasures of corrupted nations; as earthquakes and volcanoes disclose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> which compose the deeper parts of our planet, beneath a fertile and flowery surface. A part of this dreadful result may be ascribed, not improbably, to that relaxation of domestic ties, unhappily natural to the populace of vast capitals, and at that time countenanced and aggravated by the example of their superiors. Another part doubtless arose from the barbarizing power of absolute government, or, in other words, of injustice in high places. A very large portion attests, as strongly as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMAN_HISTORY\">Roman history</a>, though in a somewhat different manner, the humanizing efficacy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> virtues, by the consequences of the want of them in the higher classes, whose profuse and ostentatious sensuality inspired the laborious and suffering portion of mankind with contempt, disgust, envy, and hatred.\n\nThe Enquiry is disfigured by another speck of more frivolous paradox. It consists in the attempt to give the name of virtue to qualities of the understanding; and it would not have deserved the single remark about to be made on it, had it been the paradox of an inferior man. He has altogether omitted the circumstance on which depends the difference of our sentiments regarding moral and intellectual qualities. We\n\n---\n\n1 See Notes and Illustrations, note R.\nadmire intellectual excellence, but we bestow no moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> on it. Such approbation has no tendency directly to increase it, because it is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a>. We cultivate our natural disposition to esteem and love benevolence and justice, because these moral sentiments, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of them, directly and materially dispose others, as well as ourselves, to cultivate these two virtues. We cultivate a natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> against oppression, which guards ourselves against the practice of that vice, and because the manifestation of it deters others from its exercise. The first rude <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a> of a child is against every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of hurt. We confine it to intentional hurt, when we are taught by experience that it prevents only that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of hurt; and at last it is still further limited to wrong done to ourselves or others, and in that case becomes a purely moral sentiment. We morally approve industry, desire of knowledge, love of truth, and all the habits by which the understanding is strengthened and rectified, because their formation is subject to the will. But we do not feel a moral anger against folly or ignorance, because they are involuntary. No one but the religious persecutor, a mischievous and overgrown child, wreaks his vengeance on involuntary, inevitable, compulsory acts or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the understanding, which are no more affected by blame than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> which the foolish child beats for hurting him. Reasonable men apply to every thing which they wish to move, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> which is capable of moving it;\u2014force to outward substances, arguments to the understanding, and blame, together with all other motives, whether moral or personal, to the will alone. It is as absurd to entertain an abhorrence of intellectual inferiority or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, however extensive or mischievous, as it would be to cherish a warm indignation against earthquakes or hurricanes. It is singular that a philosopher who needed the most liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TOLERATION\">toleration</a> should, by representing states of the understanding as moral or immoral, have offered the most philosophical apology for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>.\n\nThat general utility constitutes a uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> of moral distinctions, is a part of Mr Hume's ethical theory which never can be impugned, until some example can be produced of a virtue generally pernicious, or of a vice generally beneficial. The religious philosopher who, with Butler, holds that benevolence must be the actuating principle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">Divine</a> mind, will, with Berkeley, maintain that pure benevolence can prescribe no rules of human conduct but such as are beneficial to men; thus bestowing on the theory of Moral Distinctions the certainty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> in the eyes of all who believe in God.\n\nThe other question of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a> which relates to the theory of Moral Approbation, has been by no means so distinctly and satisfactorily handled by Mr Hume. His general doctrine is, that an interest in the wellbeing of others, implanted by nature, which he calls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYMPATHY\">Sympathy</a> in his Treatise of Human Nature, and much less happily Benevolence in his subsequent Enquiry, prompts us to be pleased with all generally beneficial actions. In this respect his doctrine nearly resembles that of Hutcheson. He does not trace his principle through the variety of forms which our moral sentiments assume. There are very important parts of them, of which it affords no solution. For example, though he truly represents our approbation, in others, of qualities useful to the individual, as a proof of benevolence, he makes no attempt to explain our moral approbation of such virtues as temperance and fortitude in ourselves. He entirely overlooks that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of the rightful supremacy of the moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> over every other principle of human action, without an explanation of which, ethical theory is wanting in one of its vital organs.\n\nNotwithstanding these considerable defects, his proof from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> of the beneficial tendency of virtue, his conclusive arguments for human disinterestedness, and his decisive observations on the respective provinces of reason and sentiment in morals, concur in ranking the\n\n---\n\n1 \"In hac questione primas tenet Voluntas, qua, ut ait Augustinus, peccator, et recte visitar.\" (Hyperaspistes; Districte adversus Servum Arbitrium Martini Lutheri, per Desiderium Erasmus Rotterdamensem.)\n\n2 Essays and Treatises, vol.

Were the history of any particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> to be continued for the whole of the busy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> which this second part embraces, it would leave the other sciences too far behind, and would make it difficult to perceive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> by which they have so much assisted the progress of one another.

He lived to see his disciples\n\n1 Born in 1753; died in 1823.\n2 Burns.\ndistinguished among the lights and ornaments of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of conveying scientific instruction to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> audience by lectures, from which the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> have in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> departed, renders his qualities as a lecturer a most important part of his merit in a Scottish university which still adheres to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of European education. Probably no modern ever exceeded him in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of eloquence which springs from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and moral excellence; which neither obscures <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> by prodigal ornament, nor disturbs the serenity of patient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>; but though it rather calms and soothes the feelings, yet exalts the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, and insensibly inspires a reasonable enthusiasm for whatever is good and fair.\n\nHe embraced the philosophy of Dr Reid, a patient, modest, and deep thinker, who, in his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WORK\">work</a> (Enquiry into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> Mind), deserves a commendation more descriptive of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> than that bestowed by Professor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUSIN\">Cousin</a>\u2014of having made \"a vigorous protest against scepticism on behalf of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>.\" His observations on suggestion, on natural signs, on the connection between what he calls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> and perception, though perhaps occasioned by Berkeley, whose idealism Reid had once adopted, are marked by the genuine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>. As there are too many who seem more wise than they are, so it was the more uncommon fault of Reid to appear less a philosopher than he really was. Indeed his temporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of Berkeleanism is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of an unprejudiced and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> mind. Perhaps no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> ever rose finally above the seductions of that simple and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> system, who had not sometimes tried their full effect by surrendering his whole mind to them.\n\nBut it is never with entire impunity that philosophers borrow vague and inappropriate terms from vulgar use. Never did man afford a stronger instance of the danger than Reid, in his two most unfortunate terms, Common Sense and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTINCT\">Instinct</a>. Common Sense is that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> portion of understanding, possessed by most men, which, as it is nearly always applied to conduct, has acquired an almost exclusively practical\n\n---\n\n1 An example of Mr Stewart's school may be mentioned Francis Horner, a favourite pupil, and, till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> moment, an affectionate friend.

Regret for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> was expressed with touching unanimity from every part of a divided assembly, unused to manifestations of sensibility, abhorrent from theatrical display, and whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> on such an occasion derived its peculiar value from their general coldness and sluggishness. The tears of those to whom he was unknown were shed over him; and, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of Chose by whom he was \"praised, wept, and honoured,\" was one, whose commendation would have been more enhanced in the eye of Mr Horner, by his discernment and veracity, than by the signal proof of the concurrence of all orders, as well as parties, which was afforded by the name of Howard.\n\n2 Those who may doubt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> do well to weigh the words of the most competent of judges, who, though candid and even indulgent, was not prodigal of praise. \"It is certainly very rare that a piece so deeply philosophical is wrote with so much spirit, and affords so much entertainment to the reader.

Royer Collard, who, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> of free debate, became the most philosophical orator of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, and now fills, with impartiality and dignity, the chair of the Chamber of Deputies. His ingenious and eloquent scholar, Professor Cousin, dissatisfied with what he calls \"the sage and timid\" doctrines of Edinburgh, which he considered as only a vigorous protest, on behalf of common sense, against the scepticism of Hume, sought in Germany for a philosophy of \"such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASCULINE\">masculine</a> and brilliant character as might command the attention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and be able to struggle with success on a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, against the genius of the adverse school.\" It may be questioned whether he found in Kant more than the same vigorous protest, under a more systematic form, with an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOMENCLATURE\">nomenclature</a>, and constituting a philosophical edifice of equal symmetry and vastness. The preference of the more boastful system, over a philosophy thus chiefly blamed for its modest pretensions, does not seem to be entirely justified by its permanent authority in the country which gave it birth; where, however powerful its influence still continues to be, its doctrines do not appear to have now many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a>: and, indeed, the accomplished Professor himself rapidly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> through Kantianism, and now appears to rest or to stop at the doctrines of Schelling and Hegel, at a point so high, that it is hard to desery from it any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> between objects,\u2014even that indispensable distinction between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REALITY\">Reality</a> and Illusion. As the works of Reid, and those of Kant, otherwise so different, appear to be simultaneous efforts of the conservative power of philosophy to expel the mortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> of scepticism, so the exertions of M. Royer Collard and M. Cousin, however at variance in metaphysical principles, seem to have been chiefly roused by the desire of delivering Ethics from that fatal taint of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a>, and, indeed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, which that science had received in France from the followers of Condillac, especially Helvetius, St Lambert, and Cabanis. The success of these attempts to render <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">Speculative</a> Philosophy once more popular in the country of Descartes, has already been considerable. The French youth, whose desire of knowledge and love of liberty afford an auspicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> of the succeeding age, have eagerly received doctrines, of which the moral part is so much more agreeable to their liberal spirit, than the selfish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in the stagnation of a corrupt, cruel, and dissolute tyranny.\n\nThese agreeable prospects bring us easily back to our subject; for though the restoration of Speculative Philosophy in the country of Descartes is due to the precise statement and vigorous logic of M. Royer Collard, the modifications introduced by him into the doctrine of Reid coincide with those of Mr Stewart, and would have appeared to agree more exactly, if the forms of the French philosopher had not been more dialectical, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of Mr Stewart had retained less of that oratorical character, which belonged to a justly celebrated speaker. Amidst excellencies of the highest order, his writings, it must be confessed, leave some room for criticism. He took precautions against offence to the feelings of his contemporaries, more anxious and frequent than the impatient searcher for truth may deem necessary. For the sake of promoting the favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-\n\n---\n\n1 Fragments of his lectures have been recently published in a French translation of Dr Reid, by M. Jonnroy: \u0152uvres Compl\u00e8tes de Thomas Reid, vol. IV. Paris, 1823.\n2 Cours de Philosophie, par M. Cousin, le\u00e7on xii. Paris, 1823.\nception of philosophy itself, he studies perhaps too visibly to avoid whatever might raise up prejudices against it. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> and native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> dictated a superabundant care in softening and excusing his dissent from those who had been his own instructors, or who were the objects of general reverence. Exposed by his station, both to the assaults of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> prejudice, and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> animosities of a country where a few sceptics attacked the slumbering zeal of a Calvinistic people, it would have been wonderful if he had not betrayed more wariness than would have been necessary or becoming in a very different position. The fulness of his literature seduced him too much into multiplied illustrations. Too many of the expedients happily used to allure the young may unnecessarily swell his volumes. Perhaps a successive publication in separate parts made him more voluminous than he would have been if the whole had been at once before his eyes.\n\nA peculiar susceptibility and delicacy of taste produced forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, in themselves extremely beautiful, but of which the habitual use is not easily reconcilable with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a> desirable in works necessarily so extensive. If, however, it must be owned that the caution <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INCIDENT\">incident</a> to his temper, his feelings, his philosophy, and his station, has somewhat lengthened his composition, it is not less true, that some of the same circumstances have contributed towards those peculiar beauties which place him at the head of the most adorned writers on philosophy in our language.\n\nFew writers rise with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> groundwork, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> which require greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a> or embellishment. He gives to narrative, according to the precept of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, by a selection of happy expressions from original writers. Among the secret arts by which he diffuses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> over his diction, may be remarked the skill which, by deepening or brightening a shade in a secondary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, by opening partial or preparatory glimpses of a thought to be afterwards unfolded, unobservedly heightens the import of a word, and gives it a new meaning, without any offence against old use. It is in this manner that philosophical originality may be reconciled to purity and stability of speech,\u2014that we may avoid new terms, which are the easy resource of the unskilful or the indolent, and often a characteristic mark of writers who love their language too little to feel its peculiar excellencies, or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the art of calling forth its powers.\n\nHe reminds us not unfrequently of the character given by Cicero to one of his contemporaries, \"who expressed refined and abstruse thought in soft and transparent diction.\" His writings are a proof that the mild sentiments have their eloquence as well as the vehement passions. It would be difficult to name works in which so much refined philosophy is joined with so fine a fancy,\u2014so much elegant literature, with such a delicate perception of the distinguishing excellencies of great writers, and with an estimate in general so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> of the services rendered to knowledge by a succession of philosophers. They are pervaded by a philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, which keeps up the ardour of his genius, without disturbing the serenity of his mind,\u2014which is felt in his reverence for knowledge, in the generosity of his praise, and in the tenderness of his censure. It is still more sensible in the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> with which he relates the successful progress of the human understanding, among many formidable enemies. Those readers are not to be envied who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> their admiration to particular parts, or to excellencies merely literary; without being warmed by the glow of that honest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> in the advancement of knowledge, and of that assured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> prevalence of truth and justice, which breathe through every page of them, and give the unity and dignity of a moral purpose to the whole of these classical works.\n\nHe has often quoted poetical passages, of which some throw much light on our mental operations. If he sometimes prized the moral common-places of Thomson and the speculative fancy of Akenside more highly than the higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> of their betters, it was not to be wondered at that the metaphysician and the moralist should sometimes prevail over the lover of poetry. His natural sensibility was perhaps occasionally cramped by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> criticism of an unpoetical age; and some of his remarks may be thought to indicate a more constant and exclusive regard\nto diction than is agreeable to the men of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> who have been trained by tremendous events to a passion for daring inventions, and to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> enthusiasm, impatient of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> elegancies and refinement. Many of those beauties which his generous criticism delighted to magnify in the works of his contemporaries, have already faded under the scorching rays of a fiercer sun.\n\nMr Stewart employed more skill in contriving, and more care in concealing, his very important reforms of Reid's doctrines, than others exert to maintain their claims to originality. Had his well-chosen language of \"laws of human thought or belief\" been at first adopted in that school, instead of \"instinct\" and \"common sense,\" it would have escaped much of the reproach (which Dr Reid himself did not merit) of shallowness and popularity. Expressions so exact, employed in the opening, could not have failed to influence the whole system, and to have given it, not only in the general estimation, but in the minds of its framers, a more scientific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>. In those parts of Mr Stewart's speculations in which he most departed from his general principles, he seems sometimes, as it were, to be suddenly driven back by what he unconsciously shrinks from as ungrateful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APOSTASY\">apostasy</a>; and to be desirous of making amends to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, by more harshness, than is otherwise natural to him, towards the writers whom he has insensibly approached. Hence perhaps the unwonted severity of his language towards Tucker and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a>. It is thus at the very time when he largely adopts the Principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">Association</a> in his excellent Essay on the Beautiful,\u00b9 that he treats most rigidly the latter of these writers, to whom, though neither the discoverer nor the sole advocate of that principle, it surely owes the greatest illustration and support.\n\nIn matters of far other importance, causes perhaps somewhat similar may have led to the like mistake. When he absolutely contradicts Dr Reid, by truly stating that \"it is more philosophical to resolve the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> into the association of ideas, than to resolve the association of ideas into habit,\"\u00b2 he, in the sequel of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>,\u00b3 refuses to go farther than to own, that \"the theory of Hartley concerning the origin of our affections, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>, is a most ingenious refinement on the selfish system, and that by means of it the force of many of the common reasonings against that system is eluded;\" though he somewhat inconsistently allows, that \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> principles which, arising from circumstances in which all the situations of mankind must agree, are therefore common to the whole species, at whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of life they may appear, are to be regarded as a part of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, no less than the instinct of suction; in the same manner as the acquired perception of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, by the eye, is to be ranked among the perceptive powers of man, no less than the original perceptions of the other senses.\"\u2074 In another place also he makes a remark on mere beauty, which might have led him to a more just conclusion respecting the theory of the origin of the affections and the moral sense: \"It is scarcely necessary for me to observe, that, in those instances where association operates in heightening (or he might have said creates) the pleasures we receive from sight, the pleasing emotion continues still to appear, to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a>, simple and uncompounded.\"\u2075 To this remark he might have added, that until all the separate pleasures be melted into one,\u2014as long as any of them are discerned and felt as distinct from each other,\u2014the associations are incomplete, and the qualities which gratify are not called by the name of beauty. In like manner, as has been repeatedly observed, it is only when all the separate feelings, pleasurable and painful, excited by the contemplation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, are lost in the general sentiments of ap-\n\n\u00b9 Stewart's Philosophical Essays, part ii. essay i. especially chap. vi.

The theory which thus ascribes the uniform formation of the moral faculty to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> and paramount laws, is not a refinement of the selfish system, nor is it any modification of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>. The partisans of selfishness maintain, that in acts of will the agent must have a view to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> or happiness which he hopes to reap from it. The philosophers who regard the social affections and the moral sentiments as formed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of association, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, contend that these affections and sentiments must work themselves clear from every particle of self-regard, before they deserve the names of benevolence and of conscience. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> state of human motives, the two systems are not to be likened, but to be contrasted to each other. It is remarkable that Mr Stewart, who admits the \"question respecting the origin of the affections to be rather curious than important,\" should have held a directly contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> respecting the moral sense; to which these words, in his sense of them, seem to be equally applicable. His meaning in the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> is, that if the affections be acquired, yet they are justly called natural; and if their origin be personal, yet their nature may and does become disinterested. What circumstance distinguishes the former from the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>? With respect to the origin of the affections, it must not be overlooked that his language is somewhat contradictory. For if the theory on that subject from which he dissents were merely \"a refinement on the selfish system,\" its truth or falsehood could not be represented as subordinate, since the controversy would continue to relate to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of disinterested motives of human conduct. It may also be observed, that he uniformly represents his opponents as deriving the affections from self-love, which, in its proper sense, is not the source to which they refer even avarice; and which is itself derived from other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANTECEDENT\">antecedent</a> principles, some of which are inherent, and some acquired. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of this theory of the rise of the most important feelings of human nature were, as our philosopher supposes, \"to elude objections against the selfish system,\" it would be at best worthless. Its positive merits are several. It affirms the actual disinterestedness of human motives, as strongly as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a> himself. The explanation of the mental law, of which benevolence and conscience are formed habitually, when it is contemplated deeply, impresses on the mind the truth that they not only are but must be disinterested. It confirms, as it were, the testimony of consciousness, by exhibiting to the understanding the means employed to insure the production of disinterestedness. It affords the only effectual answer to the prejudice against the disinterested theory, from the multiplication of ultimate facts and implanted principles, which, under all its other forms, it seems to require. No room is left for this prejudice by a representation of disinterestedness, which ultimately traces its formation to principles almost as simple as those of Hobbes himself. Lastly, every step in just generalization is an advance in philosophy. No one has yet shown, either that man is not actually disinterested, or that he may not have been destined to become so by such a process as has been described\u2014the cause to which the effects are ascribed is a real agent, which seems adequate to the appearance; and if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> observation should be found to require that the theory shall be confined within narrower limits, such a limitation will not destroy its value.\n\nThe acquiescence of Mr Stewart in Dr Reid's general representation of our mental constitu-\n\n---\n\n1 Outlines of Moral Philosophy, p. 93.\n2 Outlines, p. 117. \"This is the most important question that can be stated with respect to the Theory of Morals.\"\n3 In the Philosophy of the Active and Moral Powers of Man (vol. I, p. 164) Mr Stewart has done more manifest injustice to the Hartleian theory, by calling it \"a doctrine fundamentally the same\" with the selfish system, and especially by representing Hartley, who ought to be rather classed with Butler and Hume, as agreeing with Gay, Tucker, and Paley.\ntion, led him to indulge more freely the natural bent of his understanding, by applying it to theories of character and manners, of life and literature, of taste and the arts, more than to the consideration of those more simple principles which rule over human nature under every form. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> work, as he frankly owns, is indeed rather a collection of such theories, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> toward the common end of throwing light on the structure and functions of the mind, than a systematic treatise, such as might be expected from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of \"Elements.\" It is in essays of this kind that he has most surpassed other cultivators of mental philosophy. His remarks on the effects of casual associations may be quoted as a specimen of the most original and just thoughts, conveyed in the best manner. In this beautiful passage, he proceeds from their power of confusing speculation, to that of disturbing experience and of misleading practice; and ends with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> effect in bestowing on trivial, and even ludicrous circumstances, some portion of the dignity and sanctity of those sublime principles with which they are associated. The style, at first only clear, afterwards admitting the ornaments of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> elegance, at last rising to as high a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a> as philosophy will endure, and of which all the parts (various as their nature is) are held together by an invisible thread of gentle transition, affords a specimen of adaptation of manner to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which it will be hard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> in any philosophical writer.\n\nAnother very fine remark, which seems to be as original as it is just, may be quoted as a sample of those beauties with which his writings abound. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> coldness and selfishness of mankind may be traced, in a great measure, to a want of attention and a want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>. In the case of those misfortunes which happen to ourselves or our near connections, neither of these powers is necessary to make us acquainted with our situation. But without an uncommon degree of both, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> for any man to comprehend completely the situation of his neighbour, or to have an idea of the greater part of the distress which exists in the world. If we feel more for ourselves than for others, in the former case the facts are more fully before us than they can be in the latter.\"\n\nYet several parts of his writings afford the most satisfactory proof, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> from what is commonly called metaphysical speculation, arose from no inability to pursue it with signal success. As examples, his observations on General Terms, and on Causation, may be appealed to with perfect confidence. In the first two Dissertations of the volume <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the title of Philosophical Essays, he with equal boldness and acuteness grapples with the most extensive and abstruse questions of mental philosophy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out both the sources and the uttermost boundaries of human knowledge with a Verulamian hand. In another part of his writings, he calls what are denominated first principles of experience, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> laws of human belief, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> elements of human reason;\" which last form of expression has so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> a resemblance to the language of Kant, that it should have protected the latter from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPUTATION\">imputation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> jargon.\n\nMr Stewart's excellent volume entitled Outlines of Moral Philosophy, though composed only as a text-book for the use of his hearers, is one of the most decisive proofs that he was perfectly qualified to unite precision with ease, to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> with the utmost clearness, and to write with becoming elegance in a style where the meaning is not overloaded by ornaments. This volume contains his properly Ethical Theory, which is much expanded, but not substantially altered, in his Philosophy of the Active and Moral Powers,\u2014a work almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a>, and composed under circumstances which give it a deeper interest than can be inspired by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> in science. Though with his usual modesty, he manifests an anxiety to fasten his ethical theory to the kindred speculations of other philosophers of the Intellectual School, especially to those of Cudworth, recently clothed in more modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASEOLOGY\">phraseology</a> by Price, yet he still shows that independence and origin-\n\n---\n\n1 Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, vol.

Edinburgh, 1826.\nality which all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a> from parade could not entirely conceal. *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">Right</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>, virtue, moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a>,* and the like or the opposite forms of expression, represent, according to him, certain thoughts, which arise necessarily and instantaneously in the mind (or in the reason, if we take that word in the large sense in which it denotes all that is not emotive) at the contemplation of actions, and which are utterly incapable of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, consequently of all explanation, and which can be known only by being experienced. These thoughts or ideas, or by whatever other name they may be called, are followed as inexplicably, but as inevitably, by pleasurable and painful emotions, which suggest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of *moral beauty*; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of human actions distinct from their adherence to or deviation from rectitude, though generally coinciding with it. The question which a reflecting reader will here put is, whether any purpose is served by the introduction of the intermediate mental process between the particular thoughts and the moral emotions. How would the view be darkened or confused, or indeed in any degree changed, by withdrawing that process, or erasing the words which attempt to express it? No advocate of the *intellectual origin of the moral faculty* has yet stated a case in which a mere operation of reason or judgment, unattended by emotion, could, consistently with the universal opinion of mankind, as it is exhibited by the structure of language, be said to have the nature or to produce the effects of Conscience. Such an example would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to an *experimentum crucis* on the side of that celebrated theory. The failure to produce it, after long challenge, is at least a presumption against it, nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> to that sort of decisively discriminative experiment. It would be vain to restate what has already been too often repeated, that all the objections to the selfish philosophy turn upon the actual nature, not upon the original source of our principles of action; and that it is by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> of these very distinct questions alone that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a> of Hobbes can be made apparently to involve Hartley. Mr Stewart appears, like most other metaphysicians, to have blended the inquiry into the nature of our moral sentiments with that other which only seeks a criterion to distinguish moral from immoral habits of feeling and action; for he considers the appearance of moral sentiment at an early age, before the general tendency of actions could be ascertained, as a decisive objection to the origin of these sentiments in association,\u2014an objection which assumes that, if utility be the criterion of morality, associations with utility must be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> by which the moral sentiments are formed, which no skilful advocate of the theory of association will ever allow. That the main, if not sole object of conscience is to govern our voluntary exertions, is manifest. But how could it perform this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> if it did not impel the will? and how could it have the latter effect as a mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of reason, or indeed in any respect otherwise than as it is made up of emotions, by which alone its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> aim could in any degree be attained? Judgment and reason are therefore preparatory to conscience, not properly a part of it. That the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of reason reduces virtue to be a relative quality, is another instance of the confusion of the two questions in moral theory; for though a fitness to excite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> may be only a relation of objects to our susceptibility, yet the proposition that all virtuous actions are beneficial, is a proposition as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> as any other within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of our understanding.\n\nA delicate state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, and an ardent desire to devote himself exclusively to study and composition, induced Mr Stewart, while in the full blaze of his reputation as a lecturer, to retire, in 1810, from the labour of public instruction. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a>, as he himself describes it, was that of a quiet but active life. Three quarto and two octavo volumes, besides the magnificent Dissertations prefixed to this Encyclopedia, were among its happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>. These Dissertations are, perhaps, the most profusely ornamented of any of his compositions; a peculiarity which must in part have arisen from a principle of taste, which regarded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECORATION\">decoration</a> as more suitable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of philosophy than to philosophy itself. But the memorable instances of Cicero, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>, and still more those of Dryden and Burke, seem to show that there is some natural tendency in the fire of genius to burn more brightly or to blaze more fiercely in\nthe evening than in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of human life. Probably the materials which long experience supplies to the imagination, the boldness with which a more established reputation arms the mind, and the silence of the low but formidable rivals of the higher principles, may concur in producing this unexpected and little observed effect.\n\nIt was in the last years of his life, when suffering under the effects of a severe attack of palsy, with which he had been afflicted in 1822, that Mr Stewart most plentifully reaped the fruits of long virtue and a well-ordered mind. Happily for him, his own cultivation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of every kindly affection had laid up for him a store of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> consolation which none who deserve it ever want, and for the loss of which, nothing beyond the threshold can make amends. The same philosophy which he had cultivated from his youth upward employed his dying hand. Aspirations after higher and brighter scenes of excellence, always blended with his elevated morality, became more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> and deeper as worldly passions died away, and earthly objects vanished from his sight.","sp":612,"ep":620},{"h":"HUTCHESON","t":"This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> writer began to try his own strength by private Letters, written in his early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> to Dr Clarke, the metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ON\">on</a> whom young philosophers seem to have considered themselves as possessing a claim, which he had too much goodness to reject. His correspondence with Hutcheson is lost; but we may judge of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> by his answers to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>, and by one to Mr Henry Home, afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Kames, then a young adventurer in the prevalent speculations. Nearly at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> with Butler's first publication, the writings of Hutcheson began to show coincidences with him, indicative of the tendency of moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> to a new form, to which an impulse had been given by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SHAFTESBURY\">Shaftesbury</a>, and which was roused to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> by the adverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of Clarke. Lord Molesworth, the friend of Shaftesbury, patronised Hutcheson, and even criticised his manuscript. Though a Presbyterian, he was befriended by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-KING\">King</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, himself a metaphysician; and he was aided by Mr Synge, afterwards a bishop, to whom speculations somewhat similar to his own had occurred.\n\nButler and Hutcheson coincided in the two important positions, that disinterested affections, and a distinct moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. Hutcheson is a chaste and simple writer, who imbibed the opinions, without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> faults of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, Shaftesbury. He has a clearness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, and fulness of illustration, which are wanting in Butler. But he is inferior to both these writers in the appearance at least of originality, and to Butler especially in that philosophical courage which, when it discovers the fountains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and falsehood, leaves others to follow the streams. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a> as strongly as Butler, that \"the same cause which determines us to pursue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> for ourselves, determines us both to esteem and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> on their proper occasions\u2014even the very frame of our nature.\" It is vain, as he justly observes, for the patrons of a refined selfishness to pretend that we pursue the happiness of others for the sake of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> which we derive from it; since it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> that there could be no such pleasure if there had been no previous affection. \"Had we no affection distinct from self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, nothing could raise a desire of the happiness of others, but when viewed as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> of our own.\" He seems to have been the first who entertained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> notions of the formation of the secondary desires, which had been overlooked by Butler. \"There must arise, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> desires, secondary desires of every thing useful to gratify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> desire. Thus, as soon as we apprehend the use of wealth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-OR\">or</a> power to gratify our original desires, we also desire them. From their universality as means arises the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> prevalence of these desires of wealth and power.\" Proceeding farther in his zeal against the selfish system than Lord Shaftesbury, who seems ultimately to rest the reasonableness of benevolence on its subserviency to the happiness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>, he represents the moral faculty to be, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as self-love and benevolence, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> general impulse, which may and does impel a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> to sacrifice not only happiness, but even life itself, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>.\n\nAs Mr Locke had spoken of an internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>,\u2014Lord Shaftesbury once or twice of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REFLEX\">reflex</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, and once of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>,\u2014Hutcheson, who had a steadier, if not a clearer view of the nature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> than Butler, calls it a Moral Sense; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a> which quickly became popular, and continues to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. By sense, he understood a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of receiving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, together with pleasures and pains, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of\n\n---\n\n1 Born in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> in 1694; died at Glasgow in 1747.\n2 Woodhouselee's Life of Lord Kames, vol. I. Append. No. 3.\n3 The first edition of Butler's Sermons was published in 1726, in which year also appeared the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> edition of Hutcheson's Inquiry into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">Beauty</a> and Virtue. The Sermons had been preached some years before, though there is no likelihood that the contents could have reached a young teacher at Dublin. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of Hutcheson's birth is not mentioned in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> known to me. Ireland may be truly said to be \"incorrupta soverain.\"\n4 Inquiry, p. 162.\n5 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Passions, p. 17.\n6 Ibid. p. 8.\nobjects. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> moral was used to describe the particular class in question. It implied only that conscience was a separate element in our nature, and that it was not a state or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of the understanding. According to him, it also implied that it was an original and implanted principle; but every other part of his theory might be embraced by those who hold it to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DERIVATIVE\">derivative</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a>, according to him, is general benevolence; and he carries this generous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> so far as to deny that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as it regards ourselves, can be morally approved;\u2014an assertion contradicted by every man's feelings, and to which we owe the Dissertation on the Nature of Virtue which Butler annexed to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">Analogy</a>. By proving that all virtuous actions produce general good, he fancied that he had proved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of regarding the general good in every act of virtue;\u2014an instance of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> of the theory of moral sentiments with the criterion of moral actions, against which the reader was warned at the opening of this Dissertation, as fatal to Ethical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>. He is chargeable, like Butler, with a vicious circle, in describing virtuous acts as those which are approved by the moral sense, while he at the same time describes the moral sense as the faculty which perceives and feels the morality of actions.\n\nHe was the father of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> philosophy in Scotland, at least in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times; for though in the beginning of the sixteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> the Scotch are said to have been known throughout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> by their unmeasured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for dialectical subtleties,\u00b9 and though this metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> was nourished by the controversies which followed the Reformation, yet it languished, with every other intellectual taste and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a>, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESTORATION\">Restoration</a>, first silenced by civil disorders, and afterwards repressed by an exemplary but unlettered clergy, till the philosophy of Shaftesbury was brought by Hutcheson from Ireland. We are told by the writer of his Life, (a fine piece of philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BIOGRAPHY\">biography</a>) that \"he had a remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of rational enthusiasm for learning, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, virtue, and human happiness;\"\u00b2 that he taught in public with persuasive eloquence; that his instructive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> was at once lively and modest; that he united pure manners with a kind disposition. What wonder that such a man should have spread the love of knowledge and virtue around him, and should have rekindled in his adopted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> a relish for the sciences which he cultivated! To him may also be ascribed that proneness to multiply ultimate and original principles in human nature, which characterized the Scottish School till the second extinction of a passion for metaphysical speculation in Scotland. A careful perusal of the writings of this now little studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> satisfy the well-qualified reader, that Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Smith's ethical speculations are not so unsuggested as they are beautiful.\n\nBERKELEY.\u00b3\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> metaphysician was so little a moralist, that it requires the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of his name to excuse its introduction here. His Theory of Vision contains a great discovery in mental philosophy. His immaterialism is chiefly valuable as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TOUCHSTONE\">touchstone</a> of metaphysical sagacity; showing those to be altogether without it, who, like Johnson and Beattie, believed that his speculations were sceptical, that they implied any distrust in the senses, or that they had the smallest\n\n\u00b9 The character given of the Scotch by the famous and unfortunate Servetus, in his edition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, (1533) is in many respects curious. \"Gallis amicissimi, Anglorumque regi maxime infesti. Subita ingenia, et in ultimam proma, ferociaque. In bello fortes, indelis, vigilae, algoris patientissimi, decenti forma sed cultu negligentiori; invidi natura et ceterorum mortalium contemptores; ostentant plus nimio nobilitatem suam, et in summa etiam egestate summ genua <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AD\">ad</a> regiam stipem referunt, nec non dialecticis argutissi sibi blandiuntur.\"\u2014Subita ingenia is an expression <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to the \"Prefervidum Scotorum ingenium\" of Buchanan. Churchill almost agrees in words with Servetus:\n\nWhose lineage springs\n\nFrom great and glorious, though forgotten kings.\n\nAnd the strong antipathy of the late King George III. to what he called \"Scotch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">Metaphysics</a>,\" proves the permanency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> part of the national character.\n\n\u00b2 Life by Dr Leechman, prefixed to Hutcheson's System of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Moral Philosophy</a>, 1755.\n\n\u00b3 Born near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THOMASTOWN\">Thomastown</a> in Ireland, in 1684; died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> in 1753.\ntendency to disturb <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> or alter conduct. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> learning, exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, polished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, modern literature, and the fine arts, contributed to adorn and enrich the mind of this accomplished man. All his contemporaries agreed with the satirist in ascribing\n\nTo Berkeley every virtue under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>.\n\nAdverse factions and hostile wits concurred only in loving, admiring, and contributing to advance him. The severe sense of Swift endured his visions; the modest Addison endeavored to reconcile Clarke to his ambitious speculations. His character converted the satire of Pope into fervid praise. Even the discerning, fastidious, and turbulent Atterbury said, after an interview with him, \"So much understanding, so much knowledge, so much innocence, and such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-HUMILITY\">humility</a>, I did not think had been the portion of any but angels, till I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>.\"1 \"Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BATHURST\">Bathurst</a> told me, that the Members of the Scriblerus Club being met at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DINNER\">dinner</a>, they agreed to rally Berkeley, who was also his guest, on his scheme at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BERMUDAS\">Bermudas</a>. Berkeley, having listened to the many lively things they had to say, begged to be heard in his turn, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> with such an astonishing and animating force of eloquence and enthusiasm, that they were struck dumb, and after some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PAUSE\">pause</a>, rose all up together, with earnestness exclaiming, 'Let us set out with him immediately.'\"2 It was when thus beloved and celebrated that he conceived, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of forty-five, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of devoting his life to reclaim and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the natives of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>; and he employed as much influence and solicitation as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> men do for their most prized objects, in obtaining leave to resign his dignities and revenues, to quit his accomplished and affectionate friends, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> himself in what must have seemed an intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>. After four years' residence at Newport in Rhode <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a>, he was compelled, by the refusal of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a> to furnish him with funds for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, to forego his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of heroic, or rather godlike benevolence; though not without some consoling forethought of the fortune of the country where he had sojourned.\n\nWestward the course of empire takes its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAY\">way</a>,\nThe first four acts already past,\nA fifth shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DRAMA\">drama</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>,\nTime's noblest offspring is its last.\n\nThus disappointed in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> of keeping a School for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> children, at a salary of a hundred pounds by the year, he was received, on his return, with open arms by the philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>, at whose metaphysical parties he made one with Sherlock, who, as well as Smalridge, was his supporter, and with Hoadley, who, following Clarke, was his antagonist. By her influence, he was made bishop of Cloyne. It is one of his highest boasts, that though of English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>, he was a true Irishman, and the first eminent Protestant, after the unhappy contest at the Revolution, who avowed his love for all his countrymen. He asked, \"Whether their habitations and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a> were not more sordid than those of the savage Americans?\"3\n\n\"Whether a scheme for the welfare of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> should not take in the whole inhabitants?\"4 and,\n\n\"Whether it was a vain attempt, to project the flourishing of our Protestant gentry, exclusive of the bulk of the natives?\"5 He proceeds to promote the reformation suggested in this pregnant question by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of Queries, intimating, with the utmost skill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> that proves the necessity, and the safety, and the wisest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of adopting his suggestion. He contributed, by a truly Christian address to the Roman Catholics of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>, to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> quiet during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a> of 1745; and soon after published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to the clergy of that persuasion, beseeching them to inculcate industry among their flocks, for which he received their thanks. He tells them, that it was a saying among the negro slaves, \"if negro were not negro, Irishman would be negro.\" It is difficult to read these proofs of benevolence and foresight without emotion, at the moment when, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of near a century, his suggestions have been at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, at the close of a struggle of twenty-five years, adopted, by the admis-\n\n---\n\n1 Duncombe's Letters, 106, 107.\n2 Warton on Pope.\n3 See his Querist, 339; published in 1735.\n4 Ibid. 255.\n5 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1829.\nsion of the whole Irish nation to the privileges of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">Constitution</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a> of Berkeley was not, like that of Swift, tainted by disappointed ambition; nor was it, like Swift's, confined to a colony of English Protestants. Perhaps the *Querist* contains more hints, then original, still unapplied in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> economy, than are to be found in any equal space. From the writings of his advanced years, when he chose a medical Tract\\(^1\\) to be the vehicle of his philosophical reflections, though it cannot be said that he relinquished his early opinions, it is at least apparent that his mind had received a new bent, and was habitually turned from reasoning towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>. His immaterialism indeed modestly appears, but only to purify and elevate our thoughts, and to fix them on Mind, the paramount and primeval principle of all things. \"Perhaps,\" says he, \"the truth about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INNATE_IDEAS\">innate ideas</a> may be, that there are properly no ideas or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> objects in the mind but what are derived from sense;\" but that there are also, besides these, her own acts and operations\u2014such are notions;\" a statement which seems once more to admit general conceptions, and which might have served, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> passage of Leibnitz, as the basis of the modern philosophy of Germany. From these compositions of his old age, he appears then to have recurred with fondness to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> and the later Platonists; writers from whose mere reasonings an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a> so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> could hardly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> for an argumentative satisfaction of all its difficulties, and whom he probably rather studied as a means of inuring his mind to objects beyond the visible diurnal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, and of attaching it, through frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol11.html#article-MEDITATION\">meditation</a>, to that perfect and transcendent goodness to which his moral feelings always pointed, and which they incessantly strove to grasp. His mind, enlarging as it rose, at length receives every theist, however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> in its philosophic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>. \"Truth,\" he beautifully concludes, \"is the cry of all, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GAME\">game</a> of a few. Certainly, where it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> passion, it does not give way to vulgar cares, nor is it contented with a little ardour in the early time of life; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> perhaps to pursue, but not so fit to weigh and revise. He that would make a real progress in knowledge, must dedicate his age as well as youth, the later growth as well as first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, at the altar of Truth.\" So did Berkeley, and such were almost his latest words.\n\nHis general principles of Ethics may be shortly stated in his own words:\u2014\"As God is a being of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> goodness, his end is the good of his creatures. The general wellbeing of all men of all nations, of all ages of the world, is that which he designs should be procured by the concurring actions of each individual.\" Having stated that this end can be pursued only in one of two ways\u2014either by computing the consequences of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, or by obeying rules which generally tend to happiness\u2014and having shown the first to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, he rightly infers, \"that the end to which God requires the concurrence of human actions, must be carried on by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of certain determinate and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> rules or moral precepts, which in their own nature have a necessary tendency to promote the wellbeing of mankind, taking in all nations and ages, from the beginning to the end of the world.\"\\(^2\\) A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANCE\">romance</a>, of which a journey to an Utopia, in the centre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, forms the chief part, called *The Adventures of Signor Gaudentio di <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LUCCA\">Lucca</a>*, has been commonly ascribed to him; probably on no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> than its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of pleasing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> with benevolence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>.\\(^3\\) Of the exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> and beauty of his diction, no man accustomed to English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> can need to be informed. His works are, beyond dispute, the finest models of philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> since Cicero. Perhaps they surpass those of the orator, in the wonderful art by which the fullest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> is thrown on the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> and evanescent parts of the most subtile of human conceptions. Perhaps he also surpassed Cicero in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> of simplicity, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> eminently found in Irish writers before the end of the eighteenth century; conspicuous in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASCULINE\">masculine</a> severity of Swift,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Siris, or Reflections on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TAR\">Tar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WATER\">Water</a>.*\n\n\\(^2\\) Sermon in Trinity College Chapel, on Passive Obedience, 1712.\n\n\\(^3\\) Gentleman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1777.\nin the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLATONIC\">Platonic</a> fancy of Berkeley, in the native tenderness and elegance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOLDSMITH\">Goldsmith</a>, and not withholding its attractions from Hutcheson and Leland, writers of classical taste, though of inferior power. The two Irish philosophers of the eighteenth century may be said to have co-operated in calling forth the metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of Scotland; for, though Hutcheson spread the taste, and furnished the principles, yet Berkeley undoubtedly produced the skepticism of Hume, which stimulated the instinctive school to activity, and was thought incapable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a>, otherwise than by their doctrines.","sp":573,"ep":578},{"h":"JEREMY BENTHAM","t":"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> scheme of this Dissertation would be a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for omitting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of a living writer. The devoted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> and invincible repugnance which an impartial estimate of Mr Bentham has to encounter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ON\">on</a> either side, are a strong inducement not to deviate from that scheme in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. But the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> sketch of ethical controversy in England would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> without it; and perhaps the utter hopelessness of any expedient for satisfying his followers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-OR\">or</a> softening his opponents, may enable a writer to look steadily and solely at what he believes to be the dictates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>.

They are in general men of competent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, of superior understanding, who voluntarily embrace the laborious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of useful and noble sciences; who derive their opinions not so much from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> perusal of his writings, as from familiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> from whose lips these opinions are recommended by simplicity, disinterestedness, originality, and vivacity; aided rather than impeded by foibles not unamiable, enforced of late by the growing authority of years and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, and at all times strengthened by that undoubting reliance on his own judgment which mightily increases the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASCENDANT\">ascendant</a> of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> over those who approach him. As he and they deserve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of braving vulgar prejudices, so they must be content to incur the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPUTATION\">imputation</a> of falling into the neighbouring vices of seeking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> by singularity; of clinging to opinions because they are obnoxious; of wantonly wounding the most respectable feelings of mankind; of regarding an immense display of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOMENCLATURE\">nomenclature</a> as a sure token of a corresponding increase of knowledge; and of considering them-\nselves as a chosen few, whom an initiation into the most secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol12.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> entitles to look <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with pity, if not contempt, on the profane multitude. Viewed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a> or dread by the public, they become more bound to each other and to their master; while they are provoked into the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> which more and more exasperates opposition to them.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HERMIT\">hermit</a> in the greatest of cities, seeing only his disciples, and indignant that systems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> which he believes to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> are disregarded at once by the many and the powerful, Mr Bentham has at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> been betrayed into the most unphilosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, that all the ruling bodies who guide the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> have conspired to stifle and defeat his discoveries. He is too little acquainted with doubts to believe the honest doubts of others, and he is too angry to make allowance for their prejudices and habits. He has embraced the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> in practical politics; manifesting more dislike and contempt towards those who are more moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a> of popular principles than towards their most inflexible opponents. To the unpopularity of his philosophical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> doctrines he has added the more general and lasting obloquy which arises from an unseemly treatment of doctrines and principles which, if there were no other motives for reverential deference, even a regard to the feelings of the best men requires to be approached with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECORUM\">decorum</a> and respect.\n\nFifty-three years have passed since the publication of Mr Bentham's first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, *A Fragment on Government*,\u2014a considerable octavo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a> of Blackstone,\u2014unmatched in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> hypercriticism, but conducted with a severity which leads to an unjust estimate of the writer criticised, till the like experiment be repeated on other writings. It was a waste of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> power to employ it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> out flaws and patches in the robe occasionally stolen from the philosophical schools, which hung loosely and unbecomingly on the elegant commentator. This volume, and especially the preface, abounds in fine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>; it contains the germs of most of his subsequent productions, and it is an early example of that disregard for the method, proportions, and occasion of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> which, with all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> readers, deeply affects its power of interesting or instructing. Two years after, he published a most excellent tract on *The Hard Labour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BILL\">Bill</a>*, which, concurring with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> excited by Howard's inquiries, laid the foundation of just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> on Reformatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">Punishment</a>. The *Letters on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-USURY\">Usury</a>* are perhaps the best specimen of the exhaustive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of a moral or political question, leaving no objection, however feeble, unanswered, and no difficulty, however small, unexplained; remarkable also for the clearness and spirit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, for the full exposition which suits them to all intelligent readers, for the tender and skilful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> with which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> is touched, and for the urbanity of his admirable apology for projectors, addressed to Dr Smith, whose temper and manner he seems for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to have imbibed. The *Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Politics*, printed before the *Letters*, but published after them, was the first sketch of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, and is still the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of it by himself.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> merit of this work, and of his other writings in relation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">Jurisprudence</a> properly so called, is not within our present scope. To the Roman jurists belongs the praise of having allotted a separate portion of their Digest to the signification of the words of most frequent use.\n\n---\n\nThey were addressed to Mr George Wilson, who retired from the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> in 1816; an early friend of Mr Bentham, and afterwards an intimate friend of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Ellenborough, Sir Vicary Gibbs, and of all the most eminent of his professional contemporaries. The rectitude of judgment, purity of heart, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, the sternness only in integrity, the scorn of baseness, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol12.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> towards weakness, which were joined in him with a gravity exclusive neither of feeling nor of plenantry, contributed still more than his abilities and attainments of various sorts, to a moral authority with his friends, and in his profession, which few men more amply possessed, or more usefully exercised. The same character, somewhat softened, and the same influence, distinguished his closest friend, the late Mr Legs. Both were inflexible and incorruptible friends of civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, and both knew how to reconcile warmest zeal for that sacred cause, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> towards their opponents, which rarely was often more delicate than steady, treated as lukewarm. The present writer hopes that the good-natured reader will excuse him for having thus, perhaps unseasonably, bestowed heartfelt commendation on those who were above the pursuit of praise, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of whose good opinion and good-will help to support him under a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of faults and vices.\n\nDISS. II.\nin law and legal discussion. Bentham not only first perceived and taught the great value of an introductory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, composed of definitions of general terms, as subservient to brevity and precision in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CODE\">code</a>, but he also discovered the unspeakable importance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> arrangement in jurisprudence, by rendering the mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of a proposed law in such an arrangement a short and easy test of the fitness of the proposal. But here he does not distinguish between the value of arrangement as scaffolding, and the inferior convenience of its being the very frame-work of the structure. Mr Bentham, indeed, is much more remarkable for laying down desirable rules for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a>, and the punishment of wrongs, in general, than for weighing the various circumstances which require them to be modified in different countries and times in order to render them either more useful, more easily introduced, more generally respected, or more certainly executed. The art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a> consists in thus applying the principles of jurisprudence to the situation, wants, interests, feelings, opinions, and habits, of each distinct community at any given time. It bears the same relation to jurisprudence which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> arts bear to pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a>. Many of these considerations serve to show, that the sudden establishment of new codes can seldom be practicable or effectual for their purpose; and that reformations, though founded on the principles of jurisprudence, ought to be not only adapted to the peculiar interests of a people, but engrafted on their previous usages, and brought into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> with those national dispositions on which the execution of laws depends. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, under Justinian, adopted at least the true principle, if they did not apply it with sufficient freedom and boldness. They considered the multitude of occasional laws, and the still greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of usages, opinions, and determinations, as the materials of legislation, not precluding, but demanding a systematic arrangement of the whole by the supreme authority. Had the arrangement been more scientific, had there been a bolder examination and a more free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> of many particular branches, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> would have been offered for liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> by modern lawgivers. It cannot be denied, without injustice and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a>, that Mr Bentham has done more than any other writer to rouse the spirit of juridical reformation, which is now gradually examining every part of law, and, when further progress is facilitated by digesting the present laws, will doubtless proceed to the improvement of all. Greater praise it is given to few to earn. It ought to satisfy Mr Bentham, for the disappointment of hopes which were not reasonable, that Russia should receive a code from him, or that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> could be brought to renounce the variety of her laws and institutions, on the single authority of a foreign philosopher, whose opinions had not worked their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAY\">way</a> either into legislation or into general reception in his own country. It ought also to dispose his followers to do fuller justice to the Romillys and Broughams, without whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and energy, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as reason and eloquence, the best plans of reformation must have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> a dead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>,\u2014for whose sake it might have been fit to reconsider the obloquy heaped on their profession, and to show more general indulgence to all those whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> offence seems to consist in their doubts whether sudden changes, almost always imposed by violence on a community, be the surest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to lasting improvement.\n\nIt is unfortunate that Ethical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a>, with\n\n---\n\n1 Digest lib. i. tit. 16.

The steadiness with which he held the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> in weighing the merits of his friend against his unfortunate defects, is an example of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of the most commanding moral principle with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> so warm, that, if it had been released from that stern authority, it would not so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> have endured the coarseness and roughness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> concerns. From the tenderness of his feelings, and from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> never roused but by cruelty and baseness, as much as from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> and his pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, sprung that original and characteristic eloquence, which was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> of the afflicted as well as the terror of the oppressor. If his oratory had not flowed so largely from this moral source, which years do not dry up, he would not perhaps have been the only example of an orator who, after the age of sixty, daily increased in polish, in vigour, and in splendour.\n3 An excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> between those who absolutely require new codes, and those who obstinately adhere to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> usages, has been pointed out by M. Meyer, in his most justly celebrated work, Institutions Judiciaires des Principaux Pays de l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, tome I. Introduction, p. 8, 9. La Haye et Amst. 1819-23, 6 vols. 8vo.\nwhich we are now chiefly concerned, is not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> in which Mr Bentham has reached the most desirable distinction. It may be remarked, both in ancient and in modern times, that whatever modifications prudent followers may introduce into the system of an innovator, the principles of the Master continue to mould the habitual dispositions, and to influence the practical tendency of the School. Mr Bentham preaches the principle of utility with the zeal of a discoverer. Occupied more in reflection than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, he knew not, or forgot, how often it had been the basis, and how generally an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> part, of moral systems. That in which he really differs from others, is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> which he teaches, and the example which he sets, of constantly bringing that principle before us. This peculiarity appears to us to be his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RADICAL\">radical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. In an attempt, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> forbids the success, he seems to us to have been led into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> errors in moral theory, and to have given to his practical doctrine a dangerous taint.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> of moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> with the moral qualities which are its objects, common to Mr Bentham with many other philosophers, is much more uniform and prominent in him than in most others. This general error, already mentioned at the opening of this Dissertation, has led him more than others to assume, that because the principle of utility forms a necessary part of every moral theory, it ought therefore to be the chief motive of human conduct. Now it is evident that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a>, rather tacitly than avowedly made, is wholly gratuitous. No practical conclusion can be deduced from the principle, but that we ought to cultivate those habitual dispositions which are the most effectual motives to useful actions. But before a regard to our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, or a desire to promote the welfare of men in general, be allowed to be the exclusive, or even the chief regulators of human conduct, it must be shown that they are the most effectual motives to such useful actions. It is demonstrated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> that they are not. It is even owned by the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> writers of Mr Bentham's school, that desires which are pointed to general and distant objects, although they have their proper place and their due value, are commonly very faint and ineffectual inducements to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. A theory founded on utility, therefore, requires that we should cultivate, as excitements to practice, those other habitual dispositions which we know by experience to be generally the source of actions beneficial to ourselves and our fellows; habits of feeling productive of habits of virtuous conduct, and in their turn strengthened by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-action of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a>.\n\nWhat is the result of experience on the choice of the objects of moral culture? Beyond all dispute, that we should labour to attain that state of mind in which all the social affections are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> with the utmost warmth, giving birth to more comprehensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, but not supplanted by it; when the moral sentiments most strongly approve what is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and good, without being perplexed by a calculation of consequences, though not incapable of being gradually rectified by reason, whenever they are decisively proved by experience not to correspond in some of their parts to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> and perpetual effects of conduct. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> representation of human nature to affirm that \"courage\" is only \"prudence.\" They coincide in their effects, and it is always prudent to be courageous. But a man who fights because he thinks it more hazardous to yield, is not brave. He does not become brave till he feels cowardice to be base and painful, and till he is no longer in need of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> from prudence. Even if it were the interest of every man to be bold, it is clear that so cold a consideration cannot prevail over the fear of danger. Where it seems to do so, it must be by the unseen power either of the fear of shame, or of some other powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, to which it lends its name. It was long ago with striking\n\n---\n\n1 See Notes and Illustrations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> V.\n2 Mr Mill's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">Analysis</a> of the Human Mind, vol. II. p. 237. It would be unjust not to say that this book, partly perhaps from a larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a>, holds out fairer opportunities of negotiation with natural feelings and the doctrines of former philosophers, than any other production of the same school. But this very assertion about courage clearly shows at least a forgetfulness that courage, even if it were the offspring of prudence, would not for that reason be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of it.\njustice observed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, that he who abstains from present gratification, under a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of its painful consequences, is only prudent, and that he must acquire a disrelish for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> on its own account, before he deserves the name of a temperate man. It is only when the means are firmly and unalterably converted into ends, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of forming the mind is completed. Courage may then seek, instead of avoiding danger. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">Temperance</a> may prefer abstemiousness to indulgence. Prudence itself may choose an orderly government of conduct, according to certain rules, without regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> in which it promotes welfare. Benevolence must desire the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of others, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of the consideration how far it is connected with that of the benevolent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>; and those alone can be accounted just who obey the dictates of justice from having thoroughly learned an habitual veneration for its strict rules and for its larger precepts. In that complete state the mind possesses no power of dissolving the combinations of thought and feeling which impel it to action. Nothing in this argument turns on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between implanted and acquired principles. As no man can cease, by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of his, to see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, though the power of seeing it be universally acknowledged to be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a>, so no man has the power to extinguish the affections and the moral sentiments, however much they may be thought to be acquired, any more than that of eradicating the bodily appetites. The best writers of Mr Bentham's school overlook the indissolubility of these associations, and appear not to bear in mind that their strength and rapid action constitute the perfect state of a moral agent.\n\nThe pursuit of our own general welfare, or of that of mankind at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, though from their vagueness and coldness they are unfit habitual motives and unsafe ordinary guides of conduct, yet perform functions of essential importance in the moral system. The former, which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, preserves the balance of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> principles which regard ourselves ultimately, and contributes to subject them to the authority of the moral principles. The latter, which is general benevolence, regulates in like manner the equipoise of the narrower affections; quickens the languid, and checks the encroaching; borrows strength from pity, and even from indignation; receives some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPENSATION\">compensation</a>, as it enlarges, in the addition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and grandeur, for the weakness which arises from dispersion; enables us to look on all men as brethren, and overflows on every sentient being. The general interest of mankind, in truth, almost solely affects us through the affections of benevolence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a>; for the coincidence of general with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> interest, even where it is certain, is too dimly seen to produce any emotion which can impel to, or restrain from action. As a general truth, its value consists in its completing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> of morality, by demonstrating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> impossibility of forming any theory of human nature which does not preserve the superiority of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> over vice; a great, though not a directly practical advantage.\n\nThe followers of Mr Bentham have carried to an unusual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> the prevalent fault of the more modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol1.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> of utility, who have dwelt so exclusively on the outward advantages of virtue as to have lost sight of the delight which is a part of virtuous feeling, and of the beneficial influence of good actions upon the frame of the mind. \"Benevolence towards others,\" says Mr Mill, \"produces a return of benevolence from them.\" The fact is true, and ought to be stated. But how unimportant is it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with that which is passed over in silence, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of the affection itself, which, if it could become lasting and intense, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the heart into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>! No one who has ever felt kindness, if he could accurately recall his feelings, could hesitate about their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> superiority. The cause of the general neglect of this consideration is, that it is only when a gratification is something distinct from a state of mind, that we can easily learn to consider it as a pleasure. Hence the great error respecting the affections, where the inherent delight is not duly estimated, on account of that very peculiarity of being a part of a state of mind,\n\n---\n\n*See Notes and Illustrations, note W.*\n\n*Analysis of the Human Mind, vol. II.*\nwhich renders it unspeakably more valuable as independent of every thing without. The social affections are the only principles of human nature which have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> pains. To have any of these desires is to be in a state of happiness. The malevolent passions have properly no pleasures; for that attainment of their purpose which is improperly so called, consists only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEALING\">healing</a> or assuaging the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TORTURE\">torture</a> which envy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MALICE\">malice</a>, inflict on the malignant mind. It might with as much propriety be said that the toothache and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> have pleasures, because their removal is followed by an agreeable feeling. These bodily disorders, indeed, are often cured by the process which removes the suffering; but the mental distempers of envy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> are nourished by every act of odious indulgence which for a moment suspends their pain.\n\nThe same observation is applicable to every virtuous disposition, though not so obviously as to the benevolent affections. That a brave man is, on the whole, far less exposed to danger than a coward, is not the chief advantage of a courageous temper. Great dangers are rare; but the constant absence of such painful and mortifying sensations as those of fear, and the steady <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of superiority to what subdues ordinary men, are a perpetual source of inward enjoyment. No man who has ever been visited by a gleam of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a> can place any outward advantage of fortitude in comparison with the feeling of being always able fearlessly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> a righteous cause. Even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-HUMILITY\">Humility</a>, in spite of first appearances, is a remarkable example. It has of late been unwarrantably used to signify that painful consciousness of inferiority which is the first stage of envy. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> consecrated in Christian ethics to denote that disposition which, by inclining towards a modest estimate of our qualities, corrects the prevalent tendency of human nature to overvalue our merits and to overrate our claims. What can be a less doubtful or a much more considerable blessing than this constant sedative, which soothes and composes the irritable passions of vanity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>? What is more conducive to lasting peace of mind than the consciousness of proficiency in that most delicate species of equity which, in the secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>, labours to be impartial in the comparison of ourselves with others? What can so perfectly assure us of the purity of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of contemplating, not that excellence which we have reached, but that which is still to be pursued; of not considering how far we may outrun others, but how far we are from the goal?\n\nVirtue has often outward advantages, and always inward delights; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, though constant, strong, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a>, and inviolable, are not easily considered by the common observer as apart from the virtue with which they are blended. They are so subtile and evanescent as to escape the distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of all but the very few who meditate on the acts of mind. The outward advantages, on the other hand, cold, uncertain, dependent, and precarious as they are, yet stand out to the sense and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, may be handled and counted, and are perfectly on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the general apprehension. Hence they have become the almost exclusive theme of all moralists who profess to follow reason. There is room for suspecting that a very general illusion prevails on this subject. Probably the smallest part of the pleasure of virtue, because it is the most palpable, has become the sign and mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REPRESENTATIVE\">representative</a> of the whole. The outward and visible sign suggests insensibly the inward and mental delight. Those who display the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> benefits of magnanimity and kindness, would speak with far less fervour, and perhaps less confidence, if their feelings were not unconsciously affected by the mental state which they overlook in their statements, though they feel some part of it when they write or speak on it. When they speak of\n\n---\n\n1 According to Cicero's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of fortitude, \"Virtus pugnans pro aquitato.\" The remains of the original sense of Virtus, Manhood, give a beauty and force to these expressions, which cannot be preserved in our language. The Greek \u0391\u03b3\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, and the German Tugend, originally denoted Strength, afterwards Courage, and at last Virtue. But the happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DERIVATION\">derivation</a> of Virtus from Vir gives an energy to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> of Cicero, which illustrates the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of a skilful writer.\n\n2 Mr Mill's Analysis of the Human Mind, vol. II. p. 222.\n\n3 For a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of vanity, by a great orator, see the Rev. R. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>'s Sermon on Modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFIDELITY\">Infidelity</a>.\nwhat is without, they feel what was within, and their words excite the same feeling in others.\n\nIs it not probable that much of our love of praise may be thus ascribed to humane and sociable pleasure in the sympathy of others with us? Praise is the symbol which represents sympathy, and which the mind insensibly substitutes for it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> and in language. Does not the desire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a> fame, in like manner, manifest an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> for the fellow-feeling of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, when it is perfectly unproductive of any advantage to ourselves? In this point of view, it may be considered as the passion of which the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> proves the mighty power of disinterested desire. Every other pleasure from sympathy is confined to the men who are now alive. The love of fame alone seeks the sympathy of unborn generations, and stretches the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> which binds the race of man together, to an extent to which hope sets no bounds. There is a noble, even if unconscious, union of morality with genius in the mind of him who sympathizes with the masters who lived twenty centuries before him, in order that he may learn to command the sympathies of the countless generations who are to come.\n\nIn the most familiar, as well as in the highest instances, it would seem, that the inmost thoughts and sentiments of men are more pure than their language. Those who speak of \"a regard to character,\" if they be serious, generally infuse into that word, unawares, a large portion of that sense in which it denotes the frame of the mind. Those who speak of \"honour\" very often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> a more refined and delicate sort of conscience, which ought to render the more educated classes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> alive to such smaller wrongs as the laborious and the ignorant can scarcely feel. What heart does not warm at the noble exclamation of the ancient poet: \"Who is pleased by false honour, or frightened by lying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFAMY\">infamy</a>, but he who is false and depraved?\" Every uncorrupted mind feels unmerited praise as a bitter reproach, and regards a consciousness of demerit as a drop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> in the cup of honour. How different is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> which truly delights us all, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the consciences of others are in harmony with our own! \"What,\" says Cicero, \"is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> but the concurring praise of the good, the unbought approbation of those who judge aright of excellent virtue?\" A far greater than Cicero rises from the purest praise of man, to more sublime contemplations.\n\nFame is no plant that grows on mortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>,\nBut lives and spreads aloft, by those pure eyes\nAnd perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a> of all-judging Jove.\n\nThose who have most inculcated the doctrine of utility have given another notable example of the very vulgar prejudice which treats the unseen as insignificant. Tucker is the only one of them who occasionally considers that most important effect of human conduct which consists in its action on the frame of the mind, by fitting its faculties and sensibilities for their appointed purpose. A razor or a penknife would well enough cut cloth or meat; but if they were often so used, they would be entirely spoiled. The same sort of observation is much more strongly applicable to habitual dispositions, which, if they be spoiled, we have no certain means of replacing or mending. Whatever act, therefore, decomposes the moral machinery of mind, is more injurious to the welfare of the agent than most disasters from without can be; for the latter are commonly limited and temporary; the evil of the former spreads through the whole of life. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">Health</a> of mind, as well as of body, is not only productive in itself of a greater sum of enjoyment than arises from other sources, but is the only condition of our frame in which we are capable of receiving pleasure from without. Hence it appears how incredibly absurd it is to prefer, on grounds of calculation, a present interest to the preservation of those mental habits on which our wellbeing depends. When they are most moral, they may often prevent us from obtaining advantages. It would be as absurd to desire to lower them for that reason, as it would be to weaken the body, lest its strength should render it more liable to contagious disorders of rare occurrence.\n\nIt is, on the other hand, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to combine the benefit of the general habit with the advantages of occasional deviation; for every such deviation either produces remorse, or weakens the habit, and prepares the way for its gradual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>. He who obtains a fortune by the undetected forgery of a will, may indeed be\nhonest in his other acts; but if he had such a scorn of fraud before as he must himself allow to be generally useful, he must suffer a severe punishment from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTRITION\">contrition</a>; and he will be haunted with the fears of one who has lost his own security for his good conduct. In all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, if they be well examined, his loss by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a> of his mental frame will outweigh the profits of his vice.\n\nBy repeating the like observation on similar occasions, it will be manifest that the infirmity of recollection, aggravated by the defects of language, gives an appearance of more selfishness to man than truly belongs to his nature; and that the effect of active agents upon the habitual state of mind, one of the considerations to which the epithet \"sentimental\" has of late been applied in derision, is really among the most serious and reasonable objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a>. When the internal pleasures and pains which accompany good and bad feelings, or rather form a part of them, and the internal advantages and disadvantages which follow good and bad actions, are sufficiently considered, the comparative importance of outward consequences will be more and more narrowed; so that the Stoical philosopher may be thought almost excusable for rejecting it altogether, were it not an indispensably necessary consideration for those in whom right habits of feeling are not sufficiently strong. They alone are happy, or even truly virtuous, who have little need of it.\n\nThe later moralists who adopt the principle of utility, have so misplaced it, that in their hands it has as great a tendency as any theoretical error can have, to lessen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> pleasure of virtue, and to unfit our habitual feelings for being the most effectual inducements to good conduct. This is the natural tendency of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> which brings utility too closely and frequently into contact with action. By this habit, in its best state, an essentially weaker motive is gradually substituted for others which must always be of more force. The frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to utility as the standard of action tends to introduce an uncertainty with respect to the conduct of other men, which would render all intercourse insupportable. It affords also so fair a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> for selfish and malignant passions, as often to hide their nature from him who is their prey. Some taint of these mean and evil principles will at least creep in, and by their venom give an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a> not its own to the cold desire of utility. The moralists who take an active part in those affairs which often call out unamiable passions, ought to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> with peculiar watchfulness against such self-delusions. The sin that must most easily beset them, is that of sliding from general to particular consequences,\u2014that of trying single actions, instead of dispositions, habits, and rules, by the standard of utility,\u2014that of authorizing too great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> for discretion and policy in moral conduct,\u2014that of readily allowing exceptions to the most important rules,\u2014that of too lenient a censure of the use of doubtful means when the end seems to them good,\u2014and that of believing unphilosophically, as well as dangerously, that there can be any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> or scheme so useful to the world as the existence of men who would not do a base thing for any public advantage. It was said of Andrew Fletcher, \"he would lose his life to serve his country, but would not do a base thing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> it.\" Let those preachers of utility who suppose that such a man sacrifices ends to means, consider whether the scorn of baseness be not akin to the contempt of danger, and whether a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> composed of such men would not be invincible. But theoretical principles are counteracted by a thousand causes, which confine their mischief as well as circumscribe their benefits. Men are never so good or so bad as their opinions. All that can be with reason apprehended is, that they may always produce some part of their natural evil, and that the mischief will be greatest among the many who seek excuses for these passions. Aristippus found in the Socratic representation of the union of virtue and happiness a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> for sensuality; and many Epicureans became voluptuaries in spite of the example of their master; easily dropping by degrees the limitations by which he guarded his doctrines. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as a man accustoms himself to be influenced by the utility of particular acts, without regard to rules, he approaches to the casuistry of the Jesuits, and to the practical maxims of Caesar Borgia.\n\nInjury on this as on other occasions has been\nsuffered by Ethics, from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to Jurisprudence. The true and eminent merit of Mr Bentham is that of a reformer of jurisprudence. He is only a moralist with a view to being a jurist; and he sometimes becomes for a few hurried moments a metaphysician with a view to laying the foundation of both the moral sciences. Both he and his followers have treated Ethics too juridically. They do not seem to be aware, or at least they do not bear constantly in mind, that there is an essential difference in the subjects of these two sciences.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of law is the prevention of actions injurious to the community. It considers the dispositions from which they flow only indirectly, to ascertain the likelihood of their recurrence, and thus to determine the necessity and the means of preventing them. The direct object of Ethics is only mental disposition. It considers actions indirectly as the signs by which such dispositions are manifested. If it were possible for the mere moralist to see that a moral and amiable temper was the mental source of a bad action, he could not cease to approve and love the temper, as we sometimes presume to suppose may be true of the judgments of the Searcher of Hearts. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RELIGION\">Religion</a> necessarily coincides with morality in this respect; and it is the peculiar distinction of Christianity that it places the seat of virtue in the heart. Law and Ethics are necessarily so much blended, that in many intricate combinations the distinction becomes obscure. But in all strong cases the difference is evident. Thus, law punishes the most sincerely repentant; but wherever the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> of the penitent can be thought to be thoroughly purified, religion and morality receive him with open arms.\n\nIt is needless, after these remarks, to observe, that those whose habitual contemplation is directed to the rules of action, are likely to underrate the importance of feeling and disposition; an error of very unfortunate consequences, since the far greater part of human actions flow from these neglected sources; while the law interposes only in cases which may be called exceptions, which are now rare, and ought to be less frequent.\n\nThe coincidence of Mr Bentham's school with the ancient Epicureans in the disregard of the pleasures of taste and of the arts dependent on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, is a proof both of the inevitable adherence of much of the popular sense of the words \"interest\" and \"pleasure,\" to the same words in their philosophical acceptation, and of the pernicious influence of narrowing \"utility\" to mere visible and tangible objects, to the exclusion of those which form the larger part of human enjoyment.\n\nThe mechanical philosophers who, under Descartes and Gassendi, began to reform Physics in the seventeenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, attempted to explain all the appearances of nature by an immediate reference to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of particles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> impelling each other in various directions, and with unequal force, but in all other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> alike. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> by impulse they conceived to be perfectly simple and intelligible. It never occurred to them, that the movement of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> when another is driven against it, is a fact of which no explanation can be given which will amount to more than a statement of its constant occurrence. That no body can act where it is not, appeared to them as self-evident as that the whole is equal to all the parts. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a> they understood that no body moves another without touching it. They did not perceive, that it was only self-evident where it means that no body can act where it has not the power of acting; and that if it be understood more largely, it is a mere assumption of the proposition on which their whole system rested.\n\nSir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton reformed Physics, not by simplifying that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, but by rendering it much more complicated. He introduced into it the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a>, of which he ascertained many laws, but which even he did not dare to represent as being as intelligible and as conceivably ultimate as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPULSION\">impulsion</a> itself. It was necessary for Laplace to introduce intermediate laws, and to calculate disturbing forces, before the phenomena of the heavenly bodies could be reconciled even to Newton's more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> theory. In the present state of physical and chemical knowledge, a man who should attempt to refer all the immense variety of facts to the simple impulse of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CARTESIANS\">Cartesians</a>, would have no chance of serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of laws augments with the progress of knowledge. The\nspeculations of the followers of Mr Bentham are not unlike the unsuccessful attempt of the Cartesians. Mr Mill, for example, derives the whole theory of Government from the single fact, that every man pursues his interest when he knows it; which he assumes to be a sort of self-evident practical principle, if such a phrase be not contradictory. That a man's pursuing the interest of another, or indeed any other object in nature, is just as conceivable as that he should pursue his own interest, is a proposition which seems never to have occurred to this acute and ingenious writer. Nothing, however, can be more certain than its truth, if the term \"interest\" be employed in its proper sense of general wellbeing, which is the only acceptation in which it can serve the purpose of his arguments. If, indeed, the term be employed to denote the gratification of a predominant desire, his proposition is self-evident, but wholly unserviceable in his argument; for it is clear that individuals and multitudes often desire what they know to be most inconsistent with their general welfare. A nation, as much as an individual, and sometimes more, may not only mistake its interest, but, perceiving it clearly, may prefer the gratification of a strong passion to it. The whole fabric of his political reasoning seems to be overthrown by this single observation; and instead of attempting to explain the immense variety of political facts by the simple principle of a contest of interests, we are reduced to the necessity of once more referring them to that variety of passions, habits, opinions, and prejudices, which we discover only by experience. Mr Mill's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">Education</a> affords another example of the inconvenience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAPING\">leaping</a> at once from the most general laws, to a multiplicity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> appearances. Having assumed, or at least inferred from insufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a>, that the intellectual and moral character is entirely formed by circumstances, he proceeds, in the latter part of the essay, as if it were a necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of that doctrine that we might easily acquire the power of combining and directing circumstances in such a manner as to produce the best possible character. Without disputing for the present the theoretical proposition, let us consider what would be the reasonableness of similar expectations in a more easily intelligible case. The general theory of the winds is pretty well understood; we know that they proceed from the rushing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> from those portions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> which are more condensed, into those which are more rarefied; but how great a chasm is there between that simple law and the great variety of facts which experience teaches us respecting winds! The constant winds between the tropics are large and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> enough to be in some measure capable of explanation; but who can tell why, in variable climates, the wind blows to-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, to-morrow from the west? Who can foretell what its shifting and variations are to be? Who can account for a tempest on one day, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> on another? Even if we could foretell the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and infinite variations, how far might we not still be from the power of combining and guiding their causes? No man but the lunatic in the story of Rasselas ever dreamt that he could command the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. The difficulty plainly consists in the multiplicity and minuteness of the circumstances which act on the atmosphere. Are those which influence the formation of the human character likely to be less minute and multiplied?\n\nThe style of Mr Bentham underwent a more remarkable revolution than perhaps befell that of any other celebrated writer. In his early works, it was clear, free, spirited, often and seasonably eloquent. Many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of his later writings retain the inimitable stamp of genius; but he seems to have been oppressed by the vastness of his projected works,\u2014to have thought that he had no longer more than leisure to preserve the heads of them,\u2014to have been impelled by a fruitful mind to new plans before he had completed the old. In this state of things, he\n\n---\n\n1 Essay on Government, originally printed in the Supplement to the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n2 The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of reasoning has been adopted by the writer of a late criticism on Mr Mill's Essay. See Edinburgh Review, No. 97, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1829.\n3 In the Supplement to the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\ngradually ceased to use words for conveying his thoughts to others, but merely employed them as a short-hand to preserve his meaning for his own purpose. It was no wonder that his language should thus become obscure and repulsive. Though many of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> terms are in themselves exact and pithy, yet the overflow of his vast nomenclature was enough to darken his whole diction.\n\nIt was at this critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> that the arrangement and translation of his manuscripts were undertaken by M. Dumont, a generous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a>, who devoted a genius formed for original and lasting works, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> the principles and promote the fame of his master. He whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> Mirabeau did not disdain to borrow,\u2014who, in the same school with Romilly, had studiously pursued the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> as well as the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>,\u2014was perfectly qualified to strip of its uncouthness a philosophy which he understood and admired. As he wrote in a general language, he propagated its doctrines throughout Europe, where they were beneficial to jurisprudence, but perhaps injurious to the cause of reformation in government. That they became more popular abroad than at home, is partly to be ascribed to the taste and skill of M. Dumont; partly to that tendency towards free speculation and bold reform which was more prevalent among nations newly freed, or impatiently aspiring to freedom, than in a people long satisfied with the possession of a system of government like that which others were struggling to obtain, and not yet aware of the imperfections and abuses in their laws, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMENDMENT\">amendment</a> of which a cautious consideration of Mr Bentham's works will undoubtedly most materially contribute.","sp":602,"ep":612},{"h":"JONATHAN EDWARDS","t":"This remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, the metaphysician of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, was formed among the Calvinists of New England, when their stern doctrine retained its rigorous authority.

He can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> only from regard to himself, and his end in creation can only be to manifest his whole nature, which is called acting for his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>.\n\nAs far as Edwards confines himself to created beings, and while his theory is perfectly intelligible, it coincides with that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> benevolence, hereafter to be considered. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> being is a mere encumbrance, which serves indeed to give it a mysterious outside, but brings with it from the schools nothing except their obscurity. He was betrayed into it by the cloak which it threw over his really unmeaning assertion or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a>, that there are degrees of existence; without which that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> which relates to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a> would have appeared to be as baseless as it really is. When we try such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> by applying it to matters within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, we see that it means nothing but degrees of certain faculties and powers. But the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of the term being to all things, shows that the least perfect has as much being as the most perfect; or rather that there can be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, so far as that word is concerned, between two things to which it is alike applicable. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> proportion on which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> virtue is made to depend, is capable of being tried by an easy test. If we suppose the greatest of evil spirits to have a hundred times the bad passions of Marcus Aurelius, and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TIME\">time</a> a hundred times his faculties, or, in Edwards's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, a hundred times his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of being, it follows from this moral theory, that we ought to esteem and love the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a> exactly in the same degree as we esteem and love Marcus Aurelius.\n\nThe chief circumstance which justifies so much being said on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> two writers, is their concurrence in a point towards which Ethical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a> had been slowly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a>, from the time of the controversies raised up by Hobbes. They both indicate the increase of this tendency, by introducing an element into their theory, foreign from those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> systems of ethical abstraction, with which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in other respects to have much in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>. Malebranche makes virtue consist in the love of order, Edwards in the love of being. In this language we perceive a step beyond the representation of Clarke, which made it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> to the relations of things; but a step which cannot be made without passing into a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>;\u2014without confessing, by the use of the word love, that not only perception and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, but emotion and sentiment, are among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> principles of morals.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a> Z.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, France, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, have ever since his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TIME\">time</a> had a decided leaning. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> question, indeed, concerning the Origin of our Knowledge, the philosophers of the Continent (with the exception of the Germans, and a few eminent individuals in other countries) have, in general, sided with Locke, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-OR\">or</a> rather with Gassendi; but, in most other instances, a partiality for the opinions, and a deference for the authority of Leibnitz, may be traced in their speculations, both on metaphysical and physical subjects. Hence a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> between the characteristical features of the continental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, and those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> systems which have succeeded each other in our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>; the great proportion of our most noted writers, notwithstanding the opposition of their sentiments on particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, having either attached themselves, or professed to attach themselves, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of inquiry recommended and exemplified by Locke.\n\nBut the circumstance which chiefly induced me to assign to Leibnitz so prominent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in this historical sketch, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> influence of his industry and zeal, in uniting, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of intellectual lights and of moral sympathies, the most powerful and leading minds scattered over Christendom. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> steps towards such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> had been already taken by Wallis in England, and by Mersenne in France; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, of which they were the centres, was confined almost exclusively to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a> and to Physics; while the comprehensive correspondence of Leibnitz extended alike to every pursuit interesting to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, either as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> or as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> being. From this time forward, accordingly, the history of philosophy involves, in a far greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> than at any former period, the general history of the human mind; and we shall find, in our attempts to trace its farther progress, our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> more and more irresistibly withdrawn from local details to more enlarged views of the globe which we inhabit. A striking change in this literary commerce among nations took place, at least in the western parts of Europe, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Leibnitz; but, during the remainder of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> century, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to proceed with an accelerated rapidity over the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the civilised world. A multitude of causes, undoubtedly, conspired to produce it; but I know of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> whose name is better entitled than that of Leibnitz, to mark the era of its commencement.\n\nI have already, in treating of the philosophy of Locke, said enough, and perhaps more than enough, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of Leibnitz concerning the origin of our knowledge. Although expressed in a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASEOLOGY\">phraseology</a>, it agrees in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> points with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INNATE_IDEAS\">innate <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CARTESIANS\">Cartesians</a>; but it approaches still more nearly to some of the mystical speculations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>. The very exact coincidence between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Leibnitz on this question, and that of his contemporary Cudworth, whose mind, like his own, was deeply tinctured with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLATONIC\">Platonic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">Metaphysics</a>, is not unworthy of notice here, as an historical fact; and it is the only remark on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> which I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to add at present to those in the preceding history.\n\n\"The seeds of our acquired knowledge,\" says Leibnitz, \"or, in other words, our ideas, and the eternal truths which are derived from them, are contained in the mind itself; nor is this wonderful, since we know by our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a>, that we possess within ourselves the ideas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>, of unity, of substance, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, and other ideas of a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.\" To the same purpose, we are told by Cudworth, that \"the mind contains in itself virtually (as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> plant or tree is contained in the seed) general notions of all things which unfold and discover themselves as occasions invite, and proper circumstances occur.\"\n\nThe metaphysical theories, to the establish-\n\n---\n\n1 The following maxims of Leibnitz deserve the serious attention of all who have at heart the improvement of mankind: \"On trouve dans le monde plusieurs personnes bien intentionn\u00e9es; mais le mal est, qu'elles ne s'entendent point, et ne travaillent point de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a>. S'il y avoit moyen de trouver une esp\u00e8ce de glu pour les reunir, on ferait quelque chose. Le mal est souvent que les gens de bien ont quelques caprices ou opinions particuli\u00e8res, qui font qu'ils sont contraires entre eux.............L'esprit sectaire consiste proprement dans <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CETTE\">cette</a> pr\u00e9tention de vouloir que les autres se reglent sur nos maximes, au lieu qu'on se devroit contenter de voir qu'on aille au but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a>.\"\u2014(Leib. Op. Tom. I. p. 740.)\nment of which Leibnitz chiefly directed the force of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, are the doctrine of Pre-established <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">Harmony</a>; and the scheme of Optimism, as new modelled by himself. On neither of these heads <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> it be necessary for me <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> to detain my readers.\n\n1. According to the system of Pre-established Harmony, the human mind and human body are two independent but constantly correspondent machines;\u2014adjusted to each other like two unconnected clocks, so constructed, that, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>, the one should point the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>; and the other strike it. Of this system the following summary and illustration are given by Leibnitz himself, in his Essay entitled Theodicea:\n\n\"I cannot help coming into this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a>, that God created the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> in such manner at first, that it should represent within itself all the simultaneous changes in the body; and that he has made the body also in such manner, as that it must of itself do what the soul wills:\u2014So that the laws which make the thoughts of the soul follow each other in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> succession, must produce images which shall be coincident with the impressions made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> objects upon our organs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>; while the laws by which the motions of the body follow each other, are likewise so coincident with the thoughts of the soul, as to give to our volitions and actions the very same appearance, as if the latter were really the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and the necessary consequences of the former.\"\u2014(Leib. Op. I. p. 163.) Upon another occasion he observes, that \"every thing goes on in the soul as if it had no body, and that every thing goes on in the body as if it had no soul.\" (Ibid. II. p. 44.)\n\nTo convey his meaning still more fully, Leibnitz borrows from Mr Jaquelot\u00b9 a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>, which, whatever may be thought of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a>, must be at least allowed some merit in point of ingenuity. \"Suppose that an intelligent and powerful being, who knew, beforehand, every particular thing that I should order my footman to do to-morrow, should make a machine to resemble my footman exactly, and punctually to perform, all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, whatever I directed. On this supposition, would not my will in issuing all the details of my orders, remain, in every respect, in the same circumstances as before? And would not my machine-footman, in performing his different movements, have the appearance of acting only in obedience to my commands?\" The inference to be drawn from this comparison is, that the movements of my body have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> dependence whatever on the volitions of my mind, any more than the actions of my machine-footman would have on the words issuing from my lips. The same inference is to be extended to the relation which the impressions made on my different senses bear to the co-existent perceptions arising in my mind. The impressions and perceptions have no mutual connection, resembling that of physical causes with their effects; but the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of events is made to correspond invariably with the other, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of an eternal harmony between them pre-established by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> Creator.\n\nFrom this outline of the scheme of Pre-established Harmony, it is manifest, that it took its rise from the very same train of thinking which produced Malebranche's doctrine of Occasional Causes. The authors of both theories <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> clearly the impossibility of tracing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which mind acts on body, or body on mind; and hence were led rashly to conclude, that the connection or union which seems to exist between them is not real, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>. The inferences, however, which they drew from this common principle were directly opposite; Malebranche maintaining, that the communication between mind and body was carried on by the immediate and incessant agency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>; while Leibnitz conceived, that the agency of God was employed only in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> contrivance and mutual adjustment of the two machines;\u2014all the subsequent phenomena of each being the necessary results of its own independent mechanism, and, at the same time, the progressive evolutions of a comprehensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, harmonising the laws of the one with those of the other.\n\nOf these two opposite hypotheses, that of Leibnitz is by far the more unphilosophical and untenable. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> objection to the doctrine of\n\n\u00b9 Author of a Book entitled Conformit\u00e9 de la Foi avec la Raison.\noccasional causes is; that it presumes to decide upon a question of which human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> is altogether incompetent to judge;\u2014our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the mode in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> acts upon mind, or mind upon matter, furnishing not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the one may not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> directly and immediately on the other, in some way incomprehensible by our faculties. But the doctrine of Pre-established Harmony, besides being equally liable to this objection, labours under the additional disadvantage of involving a perplexed and totally inconsistent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the nature of Mechanism;\u2014an inconsistency, by the way, with which all those philosophers are justly chargeable, who imagine that, by likening the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a> to a machine, they get rid of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of admitting the constant agency of powers essentially different from the known qualities of matter. The word Mechanism properly expresses a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of natural powers to produce a certain effect. When such a combination is successful, a machine, once set a-going, will sometimes continue to perform its office for a considerable time, without requiring the interposition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>: And hence we are led to conclude, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> may perhaps be similar with respect to the universe, when once put into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> by the Deity. This idea Leibnitz carried so far as to exclude the supposition of any subsequent agency in the first contriver and mover, excepting in the case of a miracle. But the falseness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> appears from this, that the moving force in every machine is some natural power, such as gravity or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>; and, consequently, the very idea of mechanism assumes the existence of those active powers, of which it is the professed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the universe to give an explanation. Whether, therefore, with Malebranche, we resolve every effect into the immediate agency of God, or suppose, with the great majority of Newtonians, that he employs the instrumentality of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> causes to accomplish his purposes, we are equally forced to admit with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, the necessity not only of a first contriver and mover, but of his constant and efficient concurrence (either immediately or mediately) in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> his design into execution:\n\n\"Opus (says Bacon) quod operatur Deus a primordio usque <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AD\">ad</a> finem.\"\n\nIn what I have now said I have confined myself to the idea of Mechanism as it applies to the material universe; for, as to this word, when\n\n---\n\n1 The mutual action, or (as it was called in the schools) the mutual influence (influence) of soul and body, was, till the time of Descartes, the prevailing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, both among the learned and the vulgar. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> of this influece, if not positively denied by Descartes, was at least mentioned by him as a subject of doubt; but by Malebranche and Leibnitz it was confidently rejected as absurd and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>. (See their works posthum.) Gravinaude, who had a very strong leaning towards the doctrines of Leibnitz, had yet the good sense to perceive the inconclusiveness of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> in this particular instance, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a> in opposition to it the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> and decisive remarks: \"Non concipio, quonodo mens in corpore agere possit; non etiam video, quonodo ex motu nervi receptio sequatur; non tamen inde sequi mihi appareat, omnem influece esse reiciendum.\n\n\"Substantiae incognitae sunt. Jam videmus naturam mentis nos latere; scimus hanc esse aliquid, quod ideas habet, has confert, &c. sed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IGNORAMUS\">ignoramus</a> quid sit subiectum, cui ha proprietates conveniant.\n\n\"Hoc idem de corpore diciusum: est extensum, impenetrabile, &c. sed quid est quod habet hase proprietates? Nulla nobis vis aperta est, qua ad hanc cognitionem pervenire possimmo.\n\n\"Inde conclusio, multa nos latere, quae proprietates mentis et corporis spectant.\n\n\"Invia demonstratione constat, non mentem in corpore, neque hoc in illam agere, ut corpus in corpus agit; sed mihi non videtur inde conclaudi posse, omnem influece esse impossibilem.\n\n\"Moto suo corpore non agit in aliud corpus, sine resistente; sed an non <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIO\">actio</a>, omnino diversa, et cujus ideam non habemus, in aliis substantiis dura possit, et ita tamen, ut causa efficiendi respondeat, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a> adeo obscura, determinare non ausim. Difficile certe est influece negare, quando exacte perpendimus, quonodo in minimis quae mens percipit, relatio detur cum agitatioibus in corpore, et quonodo hujus motus cum mens determinationibus convenient. Attendo ad illa que medici, et anatomici, nos de his docent.\n\n\"Nihil, ergo, de systemate influece determino, praeter hoc, mihi nondum hujus impossibilitatem satis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLARE\">clare</a> demonstratum esse videri.\"\u2014(Introductio ad Philosophiam.) See Note A A.\n\nWith respect to the manner in which the intercourse between Mind and Matter is carried on, a very rash assertion escaped Mr Locke in the first edition of his Essay. \"The next thing to be considered is, how bodies produce ideas in us, and that is manifestly by impulse, the only way which we can conceive bodies operate in.\"\u2014(Essay, B. II. ch. viii. \u00a7 11.)\n\nIn the course of Locke's controversial discussions with the Bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WORCESTER\">Worcester</a>, he afterwards became fully sensible of this important oversight; and he had the candour to acknowledge his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in the following terms: \"Tis true, I have said, that bodies operate by impulse, and nothing else. And so I thought when I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRIT\">writ</a> it, and can yet conceive no other way of their operations. But I am since convinced, by the judicious Mr Newton's incomparable book, that it is too bold a presumption to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> God's power in this point by my narrow conceptions. * * * * * And, therefore, in the next edition of my book, I will take care to have that passage rectified.\"\n\nIt is a circumstance that can only be accounted for by the variety of Mr Locke's other pursuits, that in all the later editions of the Essay which have fallen in my way, the proposition in question has been allowed to remain as it originally stood.\napplied by Leibnitz to the mind, which he calls a Spiritual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AUTOMATON\">Automaton</a>, I confess myself quite unable to annex a meaning to it: I shall not, therefore, offer any remarks on this part of his system.\n\nTo these visionary speculations of Leibnitz, a strong and instructive contrast is exhibited in the philosophy of Locke; a philosophy, the main object of which is less to enlarge our knowledge, than to make us sensible of our ignorance; or (as the author himself expresses it) \"to prevail with the busy mind of man to be cautious in meddling with things exceeding its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a>; to stop when it is at the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of its tether; and to sit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in a quiet ignorance of those things, which, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, are found to be beyond the reach of our capacities.\"\n\n\"My <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> writes,\" says Locke, in another part of his Essay, \"whilst my left hand is still. What causes rest in one, and motion in the other? Nothing but my will, a thought of my mind; my thought only changing, my right hand rests, and the left-hand moves. This is matter of fact which cannot be denied. Explain this and make it intelligible, and then the next step will be to understand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREATION\">Creation</a>.... In the meantime, it is an overvaluing ourselves, to reduce all to the narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of our capacities; and to conclude all things impossible to be done, whose manner of doing exceeds our comprehension..... If you do not understand the operations of your own finite Mind, that thinking thing within you, do not deem it strange that you cannot comprehend the operations of that eternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> Mind, who made and governs all things, and whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> of heavens cannot contain.\"\u2014(Vol. II. pp. 249, 250.)\n\nThis contrast between the philosophical characters of Locke and of Leibnitz is the more deserving of notice, as something of the same sort has ever since continued to mark and to discriminate the metaphysical researches of the English and of the German schools. Various exceptions to this remark may, no doubt, be mentioned; but these exceptions will be found of trifling moment, when compared with the indisputable extent of its general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>.\n\nThe theory of pre-established harmony led, by a natural and obvious transition, to the scheme of Optimism. As it represented all events, both in the physical and moral worlds, as the necessary effects of a mechanism originally contrived and set a-going by the Deity, it reduced its author to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> of either calling in question the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">Divine</a> power, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, and goodness, or of asserting that the universe which he had called into being was the best of all possible systems. This last opinion, accordingly, was eagerly embraced by Leibnitz; and forms the subject of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled Theodicea, in which are combined together, in an extraordinary degree, the acuteness of the logician, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> of the poet, and the impenetrable, yet sublime darkness, of the metaphysical theologian.\n\nThe modification of Optimism, however, adopted by Leibnitz, was, in some essential respects, peculiar to himself. It differed from that of Plato, and of some other sages of antiquity, in considering the human mind in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of a spiritual machine, and, of consequence, in posi-\n\n---\n\n1 Absurd as the hypothesis of a Pre-established Harmony may now appear, not many years have elapsed since it was the prevailing, or rather universal creed, among the philosophers of Germany. \"Il fut un temps\" (says the celebrated Euler) \"o\u00f9 le syst\u00e8me de l'harmonie pr\u00e9-\u00e9tablie \u00e9tait tellement en vogue dans toute l'Allemagne, que ceux qui en doutaient, passaient pour des ignorants, ou des esprits born\u00e9s.\"\u2014(Lettres de M. Euler \u00e0 une Princesse d'Allemagne, 83e Lettre.) It would be amusing to reckon up the succession of metaphysical creeds which have been since swallowed with the same implicit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> by this learned and speculative, and (in all those branches of knowledge where imagination has no influence over the judgment) profound and inventive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>.\n\n2 That this is a fair representation of the scope of Locke's philosophy, according to the author's own view of it, is demonstrated by the two mottoes prefixed to the Essay on Human Understanding. The one is a passage of the book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ECCLESIASTES\">Ecclesiastes</a>, which, from the place it occupies in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of his work, may be presumed to express what he himself regarded as the most important moral to be drawn from his speculations. \"As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> do grow in the womb of her that is with child; even so, thou knowest not the works of God, who maketh all things.\" The other motto (from Cicero) strongly expresses a sentiment which every competent judge must feel on comparing the above quotations from Locke, with the monads and the pre-established harmony of Leibnitz. \"Quam bellum est velle confiteri potius necire quod nescias, quam ista effluentem nauseare, atque ipsum sibi displicere!\" See Note B.B.\n\n3 \"La Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e seule (says Fontenelle) suffirait pour repr\u00e9senter tout Leibnitz. Une lecture immense, des anecdotes curieuses sur les livres ou les personnes, beaucoup d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et m\u00eame de faveur pour tous les auteurs cit\u00e9s, fut ce en les combattant; des vues sublimes et lumineuses, des raisonnements au fond desquels on sent toujours l'esprit g\u00e9om\u00e9trique, un <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> o\u00f9 la force domine, et o\u00f9 cependant sont admis les agr\u00e9ments d'une imagination heureuse.\"\u2014\u00c9loge de Leibnitz.\ntively denying the freedom of human actions. According to Plato, every thing is right, so far as it is the work of God;\u2014the creation of beings endowed with free will, and consequently liable to moral delinquency\u2014and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the world by general laws, from which occasional evils must result,\u2014furnishing no objection to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> of the universe, to which a satisfactory reply may not be found in the partial and narrow views of it, to which our faculties are at present confined. But he held at the same time, that, although the permission of moral evil does not detract from the goodness of God, it is nevertheless imputable to man as a fault, and renders him justly obnoxious to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. This system (under a variety of forms) has been in all ages maintained by the wisest and best philosophers, who, while they were anxious to vindicate the perfections of God, saw the importance of stating their doctrine in a manner not inconsistent with man's free will and moral agency.\n\nThe scheme of Optimism, on the contrary, as proposed by Leibnitz, is completely subversive of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> truths. It was, indeed, viewed by the great and excellent author in a very different light; but in the judgment of the most impartial and profound inquirers, it leads, by a short and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATIVE\">demonstrative</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, to the annihilation of all moral distinctions.*\n\nIt is of great importance to attend to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> between these two systems; because it has, of late, become customary among sceptical writers, to confound them studiously together, in order to extend to both that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> to which the latter is justly entitled. This, in particular, was the case with Voltaire, who, in many parts of his later works, and more especially in his Candide, has, under the pretence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> the extravagancies of Leibnitz, indulged his satirical raillery against the order of the universe. The success of his attempt was much aided by the confused and inaccurate manner in which the scheme of optimism had been recently stated by various writers, who, in their zeal to \"vindicate the ways of God,\" had been\n\n---\n\n* It is observed by Dr Akenside, that \"the Theory of Optimism has been delivered of late, especially abroad, in a manner which subverts the freedom of human actions; whereas Plato appears very careful to preserve it, and has been in that respect imitated by the best of his followers.\"\u2014(Notes on the 24 Book of the Pleasures of the Imagination.)\n\nI am perfectly aware, at the same time, that different opinions have been entertained of Plato's real sentiments on this subject; and I readily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> with respect to Fate and Necessity may be collected from his works, which it would be very difficult to reconcile with any one consistent scheme.\u2014(See the Notes of Mosheim on his Latin Version of Cudworth's Intellectual System, Tome I. pp. 10, 310, et seq. Ludg. Batav. 1773.)\n\nWithout entering at all into this question, I may be permitted here to avail myself, for the sake of conciseness, of Plato's name, to distinguish that modification of optimism which I have opposed in the text to the optimism of Leibnitz. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, in the 10th Book De Republica, seems sufficient of itself to authorise this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>:\u2014Agrum hic diversum, in quo non simul diversae, sed diversae simul, in eo simul. Virtus inviolabilis ac <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIBERA\">libera</a> quam prout honerabit quis aut negligat, uta plus minus ex eo possit. Eligentis quidem culpa est omnium. Deus vero extra culpam.\n\nA short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of the allegory with which Leibnitz concludes his Theodicea, will convey a clearer idea of the scope of that work, than I could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> to do by any metaphysical comment. The groundwork of this allegory is taken from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> on Free-Will, written by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAURENTIUS\">Laurentius</a> Valla, in opposition to Boetius;\u2014in which dialogue, Sextus, the son of Tarquinius the Proud, is introduced as consulting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a> about his destiny. Apollo predicts to him that he is to violate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LUCRETIA\">Lucretia</a>, and afterwards, with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, to be expelled from Rome. (Exul inopinque <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADET\">cadet</a> irata pulsa ub urbe.) Sextus complains of the prediction. Apollo replies, that the fault is not his; that he has only the gift of seeing into futurity; * that all things are regulated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>; and that it is to him his complaint should be addressed. (Here finishes the allegory of Valla, which Leibnitz thus continues, agreeably to his own principles.) In consequence of the advice of the Oracle, Sextus goes to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DODONA\">Dodona</a> to complain to Jupiter of the crime which he is destined to perpetrate. \"Why (says he), oh Jupiter! have you made me wicked and miserable? Either change my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> and my will, or admit that the fault is yours, not mine.\" Jupiter replies to him: \"Renounce all thoughts of Rome and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>; be wise, and you shall be happy. If you return to Rome you are undone.\" Sextus, unwilling to submit to such a sacrifice, quits the Temple, and abandons himself to his fate.\n\nAfter his departure, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, Theodorus, asks Jupiter why he had not given another Will to Sextus. Jupiter sends Theodorus to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> to consult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a> shows him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PALACE\">Palace</a> of the Destinies, where are representations of all possible worlds; each of them containing a Sextus Tarquinius with a different Will, leading to a catastrophe more or less happy. In the last and best of these worlds, forming the summit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> composed by the others, the high priest sees Sextus go to Rome, through every thing into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, and violate the wife of his friend. \"You see\" (says the Goddess of Wisdom) \"it was not my father that made Sextus wicked. He was wicked from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ETERNITY\">eternity</a>, and he was always so in consequence of his own will.\" Jupiter has only bestowed on him that existence which he could not refuse him in the best of all possible worlds. He only transferred him from the region of possible to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> beings. What great\n\n---\n\n* \"Futura <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOVI\">novi</a>, non facio.\"\n\n\u2020 World (it must be remembered) is here <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> with Universe.\n\n\u2021 \"Vides Sextum a Patre meo non fuisse factum improbum, talis quippe ab omni aeternitate fuit, et guidem semper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LIBER\">liber</a>; existere tantum ei concedisset Jupiter, quod ipsum profecto ejus sapientia mundo, in quo ille continetur, denegare non poterat: ergo Sextum e regione possibilem ad rerum existentium classem transtulit.\"\nled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAZARD\">hazard</a> principles more dangerous in their consequences, than the prejudices and errors which it was their aim to correct.\n\nThe zeal of Leibnitz in propagating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOGMA\">dogma</a> of Necessity is not easily reconcilable with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOSTILITY\">hostility</a> which, as I have already remarked, he uniformly displays against the congenial doctrine of Materialism. Such, however, is the fact, and I believe it to be quite unprecedented in the previous history of philosophy. Spinoza himself has not pushed the argument for necessity further than Leibnitz,\u2014the reasonings of both concluding not less forcibly against the free-will of God than against the free-will of man, and, of consequence, terminating ultimately in this position, that no event in the universe could possibly have been different from what has actually taken place. The distinguishing feature of this article of the Leibnitzian creed is, that, while the Hobbists and Spinozists were employing their ingenuity in connecting together Materialism and Necessity, as branches springing from one common root, Leibnitz always speaks of the soul as a machine purely spiritual,\u2014a machine, however, as necessarily regulated by pre-ordained and immutable laws, as the movements of a clock or the revolutions of the planets. In consequence of holding this language, he seemed to represent Man in a less degrading light than other necessitarians; but, in as far as such speculative te-\n\nevents does the crime of Sextus draw after it? The liberty of Rome\u2014the rise of a government fertile in civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> virtues, and of an empire destined to conquer and to civilise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>.\" Theodorus returns thanks to the goddess, and acknowledges the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of Jupiter.\n\nAmong this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> must be included the author of the Essay on Man, who, from a want of precision in his metaphysical ideas, has unconsciously fallen into various expressions, equally inconsistent with each other and with his own avowed opinions:\n\nIf plagues and earthquakes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> not Heaven's design,\nWhy then a Borgis or a Catiline?\nWho knows but He whose hand the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> forms,\nWho heaves old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OCEAN\">Ocean</a>, and who wings the storms,\nPours fierce ambition on a Caesar's mind,\nOr turns young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMMON\">Ammon</a> loose to scourge mankind?\n\n\u2014The general order since the whole began,\nIs kept in Nature, and is kept in Man.\n\nThis approaches very nearly to the optimism of Leibnitz, and has certainly nothing in common with the optimism of Plato. Nor is it possible to reconcile it with the sentiments inculcated by Pope in other parts of the same poem.\n\nWhat makes all physical and moral ill?\n\nThere deviates Nature, and there wanders Will.\n\nIn this last couplet he seems to admit, not only that Will may wander, but that Nature herself may deviate from the general order; whereas the doctrine of his universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> is, that, while the material world is subjected to established laws, man is left to be the arbiter of his own destiny:\n\nYet gav'st me in this dark <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a>\nTo know the good from ill,\nAnd, binding Nature fast in fate,\nLeft free the human will.\n\nIn the Dunciad, too, the scheme of Necessity is coupled with that of Materialism, as one of the favourite doctrines of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> of free-thinkers.\n\nOf nought so certain as our Reason still,\nOf nought so doubtful as of Soul and Will.\n\n\"Two things\" (says Warburton, who professes to speak Pope's sentiments) \"the most self-evident, the existence of our souls and the freedom of our will.\"\n\nSo completely, indeed, and so mathematically linked, did Leibnitz conceive all truths, both physical and moral, to be with each other, that he represents the eternal geometrician as incessantly occupied in the solution of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>,\u2014The State of one Moment (or elementary atom) being given, to determine the state, past, present, and future, of the whole universe.\n\n\"Cuncta itaque in homine certa sunt, et in antecedentia determinata, uti in ceteris <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REBUS\">rebus</a> omnibus, et anima humana est spiritalis quoddam automatum.\"\u2014L. XIII. Op. Tom. I. p. 156.\n\nIn a note on this sentence, the editor quotes a passage from Bilfinger, a learned German, in which an attempt is made to vindicate the propriety of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a>, by a reference to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a> of the word automaton. This word, it is observed, when traced to its source, literally expresses something which contains within itself its principle of motion, and, consequently, it applies still more literally to Mind than to a machine. The remark, considered in a philological point of view, is indisputably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a>; but it is not evident, that it leads to a conclusion precisely contrary to what this author would deduce from it? Whatever may have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> meaning of the word, its common, or rather its universal meaning, even among scientific writers, is a material machine, moving without any foreign impulse; and, that this was the idea annexed to it by Leibnitz, appears from his distinguishing it by the epithet spiritualis,\u2014an epithet which would have been altogether superfluous had he intended to convey the opinion ascribed to him by Bilfinger. In applying, therefore, this language to the mind, we may conclude, with confidence, that Leibnitz had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> to contrast together mind and body, in respect of their moving or actuating principles, but only to contrast them in respect of the substances of which they are composed. In a word, he conceived both of them to be equally machines, made and wound up by the Supreme Being; but the machinery in the one case to be material, and in the other spiritual.\nnets may be supposed to have any practical effect on human conduct, the tendency of his doctrines is not less dangerous than that of the most obnoxious systems avowed by his predecessors.\n\nThe scheme of necessity was still farther adorned and sublimed in the Theodicea of Leibnitz, by an imagination nurtured and trained in the school of Plato. \"May there not exist,\" he asks on one occasion, \"an immense space beyond the region of the stars? and may not this empyreal heaven be filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>? It may be conceived to resemble an ocean, where the rivers of all those created beings that are destined for bliss shall finish their course, when arrived in the starry system, at the perfection of their respective natures.\" \u2014 (Leib. Op. Tom. I. p. 135.)\n\nIn various other instances, he rises from the deep and seemingly hopeless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABYSS\">abyss</a> of Fatalism, to the same lofty conceptions of the universe; and has thus invested the most humiliating article of the atheistic creed, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of Platonic mysticism. The influence of his example appears to me to have contributed much to corrupt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and to bewilder the speculations of his countrymen; giving birth, in the last result, to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> combination of all that is pernicious in Spinozism, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRANSCENDENTAL\">transcendental</a> eccentricities of a heated and exalted fancy, which, for many years past, has so deeply tinctured both their philosophy and their works of fiction.\n\nIn other parts of Europe, the effects of the Theodicea have not been equally unfavourable. In France, more particularly, it has furnished to the few who have cultivated with success the Philosophy of Mind, new weapons for combating the materialism of the Gassendists and Hobbits; and, in England, we are indebted to it for the irresistible reasonings by which Clarke subverted the foundations on which the whole superstructure of Fatalism rests.\n\nIt may be justly regarded as a proof of the\n\n---\n\n1 The following remark in Madame de Sta\u00ebl's interesting and eloquent review of German philosophy bears marks of a haste and precipitation with which her criticisms are seldom chargeable: \"Les opinions de Leibnitz tendent surtout au perfectionnement moral, s'il est vrai, comme les philosophes Allemands ont t\u00e2ch\u00e9 de le prouver, que le libre arbitre repose sur la doctrine qui affranchit l'\u00e2me des objets ext\u00e9rieurs, et que la vertu ne puisse exister sans la parfaite ind\u00e9pendance du vouloir.\"\n\n2 The celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BONNET\">Bonnet</a>, in his work entitled, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">Contemplation</a> de la Nature, has indulged his imagination so far, in following out the above conjecture of Leibnitz, as to rival some of the wildest flights of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a> Behmen. \"Mais l'\u00e9chelle de la cr\u00e9ation ne se termine point au plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s des mondes plan\u00e9taires.

Boyle, et d'autres excellens hommes qui fleurissaient en Angleterre sous Charles II. on n'aurait pas os\u00e9 nous d\u00e9hiter des notions si creuses. (The notions here added to are those of Newton concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>.)\" J'esp\u00e8re que le beautemps reviendra sous un aussi bon gouvernement que celui d'au present.

Mais c'est un malheur des hommes, de se d\u00e9gotter enfin de la raison m\u00eame, et de s'ennuyer de la lumi\u00e8re. Les chambres commencent \u00e0 revenir, et plaisent parce qu'elles ont quelque chose de merveilleux. Il arrive dans le pays philosophique ce qui est arriv\u00e9 dans le pays po\u00e9tique. On s'est lasse des <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">romans</a> raisonnables, tel que la C\u00e9lle Fran\u00e7oise ou l'Arm\u00e9nie Allemande ; et on est revenu depuis quelque temps aux Contes des F\u00e9es.\" \u2014 (Cinqui\u00e8me \u00c9crit de M. Leibnitz, p. 266.)\n\nFrom this passage it would seem, that Leibnitz looked forward to the period, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NEWTONIAN_PHILOSOPHY\">Newtonian philosophy</a> would give way to some of the exploded mechanical theories of the universe; and when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FAIRY\">Fairy</a>-tales then in fashion (among which number must have been included those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Anthony <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>) would be supplanted by the revival of such reasonable Romances as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> C\u00e9lia. In neither of these instances does there seem to be much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, at present, that his prediction will be ever verified.\n\nThe German writers who, of late years, have made the greatest noise among the sciolists of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, will be found less indebted for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> to the new lights which they have struck out, than to the unexpected and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROTESQUE\">grotesque</a> forms in which they have combined together the materials supplied by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of former ages, and of other nations. It is this combination of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and error in their philosophical systems, and of right and wrong in their works of fiction, which has enabled them to perplex the understandings, and to unsettle the principles of so many, both in Metaphysics and Ethics. In point of profound and extensive erudition, the scholars of Germany still continue to maintain their long established superiority over the rest of Europe.\n\nA very interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> is given by Leibnitz, of the circumstances which gave occasion to his Theodicea, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> DISS. I. PART II.\nprogress of reason and good sense among the Metaphysicians of this country since the time of Leibnitz, that the two theories of which I have been speaking, and which, not more than a century ago, were honoured by the opposition of such an antagonist as Clarke, are now remembered only as subjects of literary history.\u2014In the arguments, however, alleged in support of these theories, there are some logical principles involved, which still continue to have an extensive influence over the reasonings of the learned, on questions seemingly the most remote from all metaphysical conclusions. The two most prominent of these are, the principle of the Sufficient Reason, and the Law of Continuity; both of them so intimately connected with some of the most celebrated disputes of the last century, as to require a more particular notice than may, at first sight, seem due to their importance.\n\nI. Of the principle of the Sufficient Reason, the following succinct account is given by Leibnitz himself, in his controversial correspondence with Dr Clarke: \"The great foundation of Mathematics is the principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a>; that is, that a proposition cannot be true and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> at the same time. But, in order to proceed from Mathematics to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Natural Philosophy</a>, another principle is requisite (as I have observed in my Theodicea); I mean, the principle of the Sufficient Reason; or, in other words, that nothing happens without a reason why it should be so, rather than otherwise: And, accordingly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a> was obliged, in his book De Equilibrio, to take for granted, that if there be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a>, in which every thing is alike on both sides, and if equal weights are hung on the two ends of that balance, the whole will be at rest. It is because no reason can be given why one side should weigh down rather than the other. Now, by this single principle of the Sufficient Reason, may be demonstrated the being of a God, and all the other parts of Metaphysics or Natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-THEOLOGY\">Theology</a>; and even, in some measure, those physical truths that are independent of Mathematics, such as the Dynamical Principles, or the Principles of Forces.\"\n\nIn another letter to the same correspondent, he expresses himself thus:\n\n\"La plupart de mes sentiments ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enfin arr\u00eat\u00e9s apr\u00e8s une d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration de 20 ans; car j'ai commenc\u00e9 bien jeune \u00e0 m\u00e9diter, et je n'avais pas encore 15 ans, quand je me promenais des journ\u00e9es enti\u00e8res dans un bois, pour prendre part entre Aristote et Democrite. Cependant j'ai chang\u00e9 et r\u00e9chag\u00e9 sur des nouvelles lumi\u00e8res, etc. Ce n'est que depuis environ 12 ans que je me trouve satisfait, et que je suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 des d\u00e9monstrations sur ces mati\u00e8res qui n'en paraissent point esp\u00e9r\u00e9es: Cependant de la mani\u00e8re que je m'y prends, ces d\u00e9monstrations peuvent \u00eatre sensibles comme celles des nombres, quoique le sujet passe l'imagination.\"\u2014(Leibnitz, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OPERA\">Opera</a>, Tom. VI. p. 264.)\n\nThe letter from which this last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a> is taken is dated in the year 1697.\n\nMy chief reason for introducing these extracts, was to do away an absurd suspicion, which has been countenanced by some respectable writers (among others by Le Clerc), that the opinions maintained in the Theodicea of Leibnitz were not his real sentiments, and that his own creed, on the most important questions there discussed, was not very different from that of Bayle. Gibbon has even gone so far as to say, that \"in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the attributes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a> of the Deity, he was suspected of a secret correspondence with his adversary.\"\u2014(Antiquities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRUNSWICK\">Brunswick</a>.) In support of this very improbable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, I do not know that any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> has ever been produced, except the following passage, in a letter of his, addressed to a Professor of Theology in the University of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-TUBINGEN\">Tubingen</a> (Pfaffius):\u2014\"Ita proorsus est, vir summe reverende, uti scribis, de Theodicea mea. Rem aci tetigisti; et miror, neminem hactenus fuisse, qui sensum hunc meum senserit. Neque enim Philosophorum est rem sio semper agere; qui in fingendis hypothesibus, uti bene mones, ingenii sui vires experiuntur. Tu, qui Theologus, in refutandis erroribus Theologum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGIS\">agis</a>.\" In reply to this it is observed, by the learned editor of Leibnitz's works, that it is much more probable that Leibnitz should have expressed himself on this particular occasion in jocular and ironical terms, than that he should have wasted so much ingenuity and learning in support of an hypothesis to which he attached no faith whatever; an hypothesis, he might have added, with which the whole principles of his philosophy are systematically, and, as he conceived, mathematically connected. It is difficult to believe, that among the innumerable correspondents of Leibnitz, he should have selected a Professor of Theology at Tubingen, as the sole depository of a secret which he was anxious to conceal from all the rest of the world.\n\nSurely a solitary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOCUMENT\">document</a> such as this weighs less than nothing, when opposed to the details quoted in the beginning of this note; not to mention its complete inconsistency with the character of Leibnitz, and with the whole tenor of his writings.\n\nFor my own part, I cannot help thinking, that the passage in question has far more the air of periphrase provoked by the vanity of Pfaffius, than of a serious compliment to his sagacity and penetration. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INJUNCTION\">injunction</a> to secrecy, it is to be observed, is here given by Leibnitz to his correspondent.\nSome of the inferences deduced by Leibnitz from this almost gratuitous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> are so paradoxical, that one cannot help wondering he was not a little staggered about its certainty. Not only was he led to conclude, that the mind is necessarily determined in all its elections by the influence of motives, insomuch that it would be impossible for it to make a choice between two things perfectly alike; but he had the boldness to extend this conclusion to the Deity, and to assert, that two things perfectly alike could not have been produced even by Divine Power. It was upon this ground that he rejected a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a>, because all the parts of it would be perfectly like to each other; and that he also rejected the supposition of atoms, or similar particles of matter, and ascribed to each particle a monad, or active principle, by which it is discriminated from every other particle. The application of his principle, however, on which he evidently valued himself the most, was that to which I have already alluded; the demonstrative evidence with which he conceived it to establish the impossibility of free-agency, not only in man, but in any other intelligent being: a conclusion which, under whatever form of words it may be disguised, is liable to every objection which can be urged against the system of Spinoza.\n\nWith respect to the principle from which these important consequences were deduced, it is observable, that it is stated by Leibnitz in terms so general and vague, as to extend to all the different departments of our knowledge; for he tells us, that there must be a sufficient reason for every existence, for every event, and for every truth. This use of the word reason is so extremely equivocal, that it is quite impossible to annex any precise idea to the proposition. Of this it is unnecessary to produce any other proof than the application which is here made of it to things so very different as existences, events, and truths; in all of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, it must of necessity have different meanings. It would be a vain attempt, therefore, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> the maxim in the form in which it is commonly appealed to: Nor, indeed, can we either adopt or reject it, without considering particularly how far it holds in the various instances to which it may be applied.\n\nThe multifarious discussions, however, of a physical, a metaphysical, and a theological nature, necessarily involved in so detailed an examination, would, in the present times (even if this were a proper place for introducing them), be equally useless and uninteresting; the peculiar opinions of Leibnitz on most questions connected with these sciences having already fallen into complete neglect. But as the maxim still continues to be quoted by the latest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol1.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for the scheme of necessity, it may not be altogether superfluous to observe, that, when understood to refer to the changes that take place in the material universe, it coincides entirely with the common maxim, that \"every change implies the operation of a cause;\" and that it is in consequence of its intuitive evidence in this particular case, that so many have been led to acquiesce in it, in the unlimited terms in which Leibnitz has announced it. One thing will be readily\n\n---\n\n1 See Note C.C.\n2 The following comment on this part of the Leibnitzian system is from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> of one of his greatest admirers, Charles Bonnet: \"Cette M\u00e9taphysique transcendantale deviendra un peu plus intelligible, si l'on fait attention qu'en vertu du principe de la raison suffisante, tout est n\u00e9cessairement li\u00e9 dans l'univers. Toutes les Actions des \u00catres Simples sont harmoniques, ou subordonn\u00e9es les unes aux autres. L'exercice actuel de l'activit\u00e9 d'une monade donn\u00e9e, est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par l'exercice actuel de l'activit\u00e9 des monades auxquelles elle correspond imm\u00e9diatement. Cette correspondance continue d'un point quelconque de l'univers jusqu'\u00e0 ses extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s. Repr\u00e9sentez-vous les ordres circulaires et concentriques qu'une pierre excite dans une eau dormante : Elles vont toujours en s'\u00e9largissant et en s'\u00e9loignant.\"\n3 Mais, l'\u00e9tat actuel d'une monade est n\u00e9cessairement d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par son \u00e9tat ant\u00e9c\u00e9dent : Celui-ci par un \u00e9tat qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, et ainsi en remontant jusqu'\u00e0 l'instant de la cr\u00e9ation.\n4 Ainsi le pass\u00e9, le pr\u00e9sent, et le futur ne forment dans la m\u00eame monade qu'une seule cha\u00eene. Notre philosophie disait ing\u00e9nieusement, que le pr\u00e9sent est toujours gros de l'avenir.\n5 Il disoit encore que l'Eternel G\u00e9om\u00e8tre r\u00e9solvot sans cesse ce Probl\u00e8me : l'\u00e9tat d'une monade \u00e9tant donn\u00e9, en d\u00e9terminer l'\u00e9tat pass\u00e9, pr\u00e9sent, et futur de tout l'univers.\"\u2014Bonnet, Tom. VIII. p. 303, 304, 305.)\n6 Since the time of Leibnitz, the principle of the sufficient reason has been adopted by some mathematicians as a legitimate mode of reasoning in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>; in which case, the application made of it has been in general just and logical, notwithstanding the vague and loose manner in which it is expressed. In this science, however, the use of it can never be attended with much advantage; except perhaps in demonstrating a few elementary truths (such as the 5th and 6th propositions of Euclid's first book), which are commonly established by a more circuitous process; and, even in these instances, the spirit of the reasoning might easily be preserved under a different form, much less exceptionable in point of phraseology.\ngranted, that the maxim, when applied to the determinations of intelligent and moral agents, is not quite so obvious and indisputable, as when applied to the changes that take place in things altogether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a>.\n\nWhat then, it may be asked, induced Leibnitz, in the enunciation of his maxim, to depart from the form in which it has generally been stated, and to substitute, instead of the word cause, the word reason, which is certainly not only the more unusual, but the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMBIGUOUS\">ambiguous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of the two? Was it not evidently a perception of the impropriety of calling the motives from which we act the causes of our actions; or, at least of the inconsistency of this language with the common ideas and feelings of mankind? The word reason is here much less suspicious, and much more likely to pass current without examination. It was therefore with no small dexterity, that Leibnitz contrived to express his general principle in such a manner, that the impropriety of his language should be most apparent in that case in which the proposition is instantaneously admitted by every reader as self-evident; and to adapt it, in its most precise and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITE\">definite</a> shape, to the case in which it was in the greatest danger of undergoing a severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCRUTINY\">scrutiny</a>. In this respect, he has managed his argument with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> than Collins, or Edwards, or Hume, all of whom have applied the maxim to mind, in the very same words in which it is usually applied to inanimate matter.\n\nBut on this article of Leibnitz's philosophy, which gave occasion to his celebrated controversy with Clarke, I shall have a more convenient opportunity to offer some strictures, when I come to take notice of another antagonist, more formidable still, whom Clarke had soon after to contend with on the same ground. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> I allude to is Anthony Collins; a writer certainly not once to be compared with Leibnitz, in the grasp of his intellectual powers; but who seems to have studied this particular question with greater attention and accuracy, and who is universally allowed to have defended his opinions concerning it in a manner far more likely to mislead the opinions of the multitude.\n\nII. The same remark which has been already made on the principle of the Sufficient Reason may be extended to that of the Law of Continuity. In both instances the phraseology is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a>, that it may be interpreted in various senses essentially different from each other; and, accordingly, it would be idle to argue against either principle as a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a>, without attending separately to the specialties of the manifold cases which it may be understood to comprehend. Where such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> is taken in the enunciation of a proposition, which, so far as it is true, must have been inferred from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> of particulars, it is at least possible that, while it holds in some of its applications, it may yet be far from possessing any claim to that universality which seems necessarily to belong to it, when considered in the light of a metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a>, resting on its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> evidence.\n\nWhether this vagueness of language was the effect of artifice, or of a real vagueness in the author's notions, may perhaps be doubted; but that it has contributed greatly to extend his reputation among a very numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of readers, may be confidently asserted. The possession of a general maxim, sanctioned by the authority of an illustrious name, and in which, as in those of the schoolmen, more seems to be meant than meets the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, affords of itself no slight gratification to the vanity of many; nor is it inconvenient for a disputant, that the maxims to which he is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> should be stated in so dubious a shape, as to enable him, when pressed in an argument, to shift his ground at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, from one interpretation to another. The extraordinary popularity which, in our own times, the philosophy of Kant enjoyed, for a few years, among the countrymen of Leibnitz, may, in like manner, be in a great degree ascribed to the imposing aspect of his enigmatical oracles, and to the consequent facility of arguing without end, in defence of a system so transmutable and so elusive in its forms.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>, however, given to the Law of Continuity, in the later publications of Leibnitz, and still more by some of his successors, has been far greater than there is any reason to think was originally in the author's contemplation. It first occurred to him in the course of one of his physical controversies, and was probably\nsuggested by the beautiful exemplifications of it which occur in pure geometry. At that time it does not appear that he had the slightest idea of its being susceptible of any application to the objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a>; far less to the succession of events in the intellectual and moral worlds. The supposition of bodies perfectly hard, having been shown to be inconsistent with two of his leading doctrines, that of the constant maintenance of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of force in the Universe, and that of the proportionality of forces to the squares of the velocities,\u2014he found himself reduced to the necessity of asserting, that all changes are produced by insensible gradations, so as to render it impossible for a body to have its state changed from motion to rest, or from rest to motion, without passing through all the intermediate states of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>. From this assumption he argued, with much ingenuity, that the existence of atoms, or of perfectly hard bodies, is impossible; because, if two of them should meet with equal and opposite motions, they would necessarily stop at once, in violation of the law of continuity. It would, perhaps, have been still more logical, had he argued against the universality of a law so gratuitously assumed, from its incompatibility with an hypothesis, which, whether true or false, certainly involves nothing either contradictory or improbable: but as this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INVERSION\">inversion</a> of the argument would have undermined some of the fundamental principles of his physical system, he chose rather to adopt the other alternative, and to announce the law of continuity as a metaphysical truth, which admitted of no exception whatever.\n\nThe facility with which this law has been adopted by subsequent philosophers is not easily explicable; more especially, as it has been maintained by many who reject those physical errors, in defence of which Leibnitz was first led to advance it.\n\nOne of the earliest, and certainly the most illustrious, of all the partizans and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEFENDERS\">defenders</a> of this principle, was John Bernouilli, whose discourse on motion first appeared at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in 1727, having been previously communicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy of Sciences, in 1724 and 1726. It was from this period it began to attract the general attention of the learned; although many years were yet to elapse, before it was to acquire that authority which it now possesses among our most eminent mathematicians.\n\nMr Maclaurin, whose Memoir on the Perceussion of Bodies gained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> from the Royal Academy of Sciences, in 1724, continued from that time, till his death, the steady opposer of this new law. In his Treatise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLUXIONS\">Fluxions</a>, published in 1742, he observes, that \"the existence of hard bodies void of elasticity has been rejected for the sake of what is called the Law of Continuity; a law which has been supposed to be general, without sufficient ground.\" And still more explicitly, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">Posthumous</a> Account of Newton's Philosophical Discoveries, he complains of those who \"have rejected hard bodies as impossible, from far-fetched and metaphysical considerations;\" proposing to his adversaries this unanswerable question, \"Upon what grounds is the law of continuity assumed as an universal law of nature?\"\n\n---\n\n1 \"En effet (says Bernouilli), un pareil principe de duret\u00e9 (the supposition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> of bodies perfectly hard) ne serait pas possible; c'est une chim\u00e8re qui r\u00e9pugne \u00e0 cette loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que la nature observe constamment dans toutes ses op\u00e9rations; je parle de cet ordre immuable et perp\u00e9tuel \u00e9tabli depuis la cr\u00e9ation de l'univers, qu'on peut appeler loi de continuit\u00e9, en vertu de laquelle tout ce qui s'ex\u00e9cute, s'ex\u00e9cute par des degr\u00e9s infiniment petits. Il semble que le bon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SENS\">sens</a> dicte, qu'aucun changement ne peut se faire par saut; nature non operatur per saltum; rien ne peut passer d'une extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'autre, sans passer par tous les degr\u00e9s du milieu,\" &c. The continuation of this passage (which I have not room to quote) is curious, as it suggests an argument, in proof of the law of continuity, from the principle of the sufficient reason.\n\nIt may be worth while to observe here, that though, in the above quotations, Bernouilli speaks of the law of continuity as an arbitrary arrangement of the Creator, he represents, in the preceding paragraph, the idea of perfectly hard bodies, as involving a manifest contradiction.\n\n2 Macdonald's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a>, Vol. II. p. 438.\n\n3 Nearly to the same purpose Mr Robins, a mathematician and philosopher of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>, expresses himself thus: \"M. Bernouilli (in his Discours sur les Lois de la Communication du Mouvement,) in order to prove that there are no bodies perfectly hard and inflexible, lays it down as an immutable law of nature, that no body can pass from motion to rest instantaneously, or without having its velocity gradually diminished. That this is a law of nature, M. Bernouilli thinks is evident from that principle, Nature non operatur per saltum, and from good sense. But how good sense can, of itself, without experiment, determine any of the laws of nature, is to me very astonishing. Indeed, from anything M. Bernouilli has said, it would have been altogether as conclusive to have begun at the other end, and have disput-\nIn the speculations hitherto mentioned, the law of continuity is applied merely to such successive events in the material world as are connected together by the relation of cause and effect; and, indeed, chiefly to the changes which take place in the state of bodies with respect to motion and rest. But in the philosophy of Leibnitz, we find the same law appealed to as an indisputable principle in all his various researches, physical, metaphysical, and theological. He extends it with the same confidence to mind as to matter, urging it as a demonstrative proof, in opposition to Locke, that the soul never ceases to think even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> or in deliquium; nay, inferring from it the impossibility that, in the case of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> being, there should be such a thing as death, in the literal sense of that word. It is by no means probable that the author was at all aware, when he first introduced this principle into the theory of motion, how far it was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> him in his researches concerning other questions of greater moment; nor does it appear that it attracted much notice from the learned, but as a new mechanical axiom, till a considerable time after his death.\n\nCharles Bonnet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a>, a man of unquestionable talents and of most exemplary worth, was, as far as I know, the first who entered fully into the views of Leibnitz on this point; perceiving how inseparably the law of continuity (as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the principle of the sufficient reason) was interwoven with his scheme of universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCATENATION\">concatenation</a> and mechanism; and inferring from thence not only all the paradoxical corollaries deduced from it by its author, but some equally bold conclusions of his own, which Leibnitz either did not foresee in their full extent, or to which the course of his inquiries did not particularly attract his attention. The most remarkable of these conclusions was, that all the various beings which compose the universe, form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> descending downwards without any chasm or salus, from the Deity to the simplest forms of unorganised matter; a proposition not altogether new in the history of philosophy, but which I do not know that any writer before Bonnet had ventured to assert as a metaphysical and necessary truth. With what important limitations and exceptions it must be received, even when confined to the compa-\n\ned, that no body can pass instantaneously from motion to rest; because it is an immutable law of nature that all bodies shall be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a>.\"\u2014(Roxius, Vol. II. p. 174. 175.)\n\nIn quoting these passages, I would not wish to be understood as calling in question the universality of the Law of Continuity in the phenomena of moving bodies; a point on which I am not led by the subject of this discourse to offer any opinion; but on which I intend to hazard some remarks in a Note at the end of it.\u2014See Note D D. All that I would here assert is, that it is a law, the truth of which can be inferred only by an induction from the phenomena; and to which, accordingly, we are not entitled to say that there cannot possibly exist any exceptions.\n\n1 \"Je tiens que l'\u00e2me, et m\u00eame le corps, n'est jamais sans action, et que l'\u00e2me n'est jamais sans quelque perception; m\u00eame en <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DORMANT\">dormant</a> ou \u00e0 quelque sentiment confus et sombre du lieu o\u00f9 l'on est, et d'autres choses.

Itaque in hominis quaque specie invenimus divinos, humanos, ferros.\u2014Scaliger, (prefixed as a motto to Mr. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WHITE\">White</a>'s Essay on the regular gradation in Man.) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, 1799.)\nrative anatomy of animals, has been fully demonstrated by Cuvier; and it is of material consequence to remark, that these exceptions, how few soever, to a metaphysical principle, are not less fatal to its truth than if they exceeded in number the instances which are quoted in support of the general rule.\n\nAt a period somewhat later, an attempt has been made to connect the same law of continuity with the history of human improvement, and more particularly with the progress of invention in the sciences and arts. Helvetius is the most noted writer in whom I have observed this last extension of the Leibnitzian principle; and I have little doubt, from his known opinions, that, when it occurred to him, he conceived it to afford a new illustration of the scheme of necessity, and of the mechanical concatenation of all the phenomena of human life. Arguing in support of his favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a> concerning the original equality of all men in point of mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, he represents the successive advances made by different individuals in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of discovery, as so many imperceptible or infinitesimal steps, each individual surpassing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a> by a trifle, till at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> nothing is wanting but an additional mind, not superior to the others in natural powers, to combine together, and to turn to its own account, their accumulated labours. \"It is upon this mind,\" he observes, \"that the world is always ready to bestow the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> of genius. From the tragedies of The Passion, to the poets Hardy and Rotrou, and to the Mariamne of Tristan, the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> was always acquiring successively an infinite number of inconsiderable improvements. Corneille was born at a moment, when the addition he made to the art could not fail to form an epoch; and accordingly Corneille is universally regarded as a Genius. I am far from wishing,\" Helvetius adds, \"to detract from the glory of this great poet. I wish only to prove, that Nature never proceeds per saltum, and that the Law of Continuity is always exactly observed. The remarks, therefore, now made on the dramatic art, may also be applied to the sciences which rest on observation.\"\u2014(De l'Esprit, Dis. IV. Chap. I.)\n\nWith this last extension of the Law of Continuity, as well as with that of Bonnet, a careless reader is the more apt to be dazzled, as there is a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> in both of unquestionable truth. The mistake of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> writers lay in pushing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> cases a doctrine, which,\n\n---\n\n1 L\u00e9onard d'Anatomie Compar\u00e9e.\n\nWhile Bonnet was thus employing his ingenuity in generalising, still farther than his predecessors had done, the law of continuity, one of the most distinguished of his fellow citizens, with whom he appears to have been connected in the closest and most confidential friendship (the very ingenious M. Le Sage), was led, in the course of his researches concerning the physical cause of gravitation, to deny the existence of the law, even in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of heavy bodies. \"The action of gravity (according to him) is not continuous.\" In other words, \"each of its impressions is finite; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of time which separates it from the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> is of a finite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>.\" Of this proposition he offers a proof, which he considers as demonstrative; and thence deduces the following very paradoxical corollary, That \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROJECTILES\">Projectiles</a> do not move in curvilinear paths, but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RECTILINEAR\">rectilinear</a> polygons.\"\u2014\"C'est ainsi qu'on pr\u00e9tend que les corps qui se trouvent en mouvement rectiligne, sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des points fixes, et que la ligne droite est la plus courte <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> entre deux points fixes.\" (Essai de Chimie M\u00e9canique, p. 94.)\n\n2 It may, perhaps, be alleged, that the above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALLUSION\">allusion</a> to the Law of Continuity was introduced merely for the sake of illustration, and that the author did not mean his words to be strictly interpreted; but this remark will not be made by those who are acquainted with the philosophy of Helvetius.\n\nLet me add, that, in selecting Corneille as the only exemplification of this theory, Helvetius has been singularly unfortunate. It would have been difficult to have named any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> poet, in whose works, when compared with those of his immediate predecessors, the Law of Continuity has been more remarkably violated. Corneille (says a most judicious French critic) est, pour ainsi dire, de notre temps; mais ses contemporains n'en sont pas. Le Cl\u00e9, les Horaces, Cinna, Polyeucte, forment le commencement de cette cha\u00eene brillante qui r\u00e9unit notre litt\u00e9rature actuelle de celle du r\u00e8gne de Richelieu et de la minorit\u00e9 de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV.; mais autour de ces points lumineux r\u00e8gne encore une nuit profonde; leur \u00e9clat les rapproche en apparence de nos yeux; le reste, repouss\u00e9 dans l'obscurit\u00e9, semble bien loin de nous. Pour nous Corneille est moderne, et Rotrou ancien.\" &c. (For detailed illustrations and proofs of these positions, see a slight but masterly historical sketch of the French Theatre, by M. Suard.)\n\n3 \"Ullas vero curvas in rerum natura esse negavere multi. Nominabo tantum, qui nunc occurrunt: Labium, Baroenum, Regium, Biomarem, et quem parum abest, quin addam Hobberium.\"\u2014(Leibnitz, Op. Tom. II. p. 47.)\nwhen kept within certain limits, is not only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> but important; a mode of reasoning, which, although it may be always safely followed out in pure Mathematics (where the principles on which we proceed are mere definitions), is a never-failing source of error in all the other sciences; and which, when practically applied to the concerns of life, may be regarded as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFALLIBLE\">infallible</a> symptom of an understanding better fitted for the subtle contentions of the schools, than for those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> estimates of what is expedient and practicable in the conduct of affairs, which form the chief elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> sagacity and of moral wisdom.\n\nIf on these two celebrated principles of Leibnitz, I have enlarged at greater length than may appear to some of my readers to be necessary, I must remind them, 1st, Of the illustration they afford of what Locke has so forcibly urged with respect to the danger of adopting, upon the faith of reasonings *a priori*, metaphysical conclusions concerning the laws by which the universe is governed: 2dly, Of the proof they exhibit of the strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BIAS\">bias</a> of the human mind, even in the present advanced stage of experimental knowledge, to grasp at general maxims, without a careful examination of the grounds on which they rest; and of that less frequent, but not less unfortunate bias, which has led some of our most eminent mathematicians to transfer to sciences, resting ultimately on an appeal to *facts*, those habits of thinking which have been formed amidst the hypothetical abstractions of pure geometry: Lastly, Of the light they throw on the mighty influence which the name and authority of Leibnitz have, for more than a century past, exercised over the strongest and acutest understandings in the most enlightened countries of Europe.\n\nIt would be improper to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> these reflections on the philosophical speculations of Leibnitz, without taking some notice of his very ingenious and original thoughts on the etymological <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of languages, considered as a guide to our conclusions concerning the origin and migrations of different tribes of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>. These thoughts were published in 1710, in the Memoirs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> Academy; and form the first article of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of that justly celebrated collection. I do not recollect any author of an earlier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, who seems to have been completely aware of the important consequences to which the prosecution of this inquiry is likely to lead; nor, indeed, was much progress made in it by any of Leibnitz's successors, till towards the end of the last century; when it became a favourite object of pursuit to some very learned and ingenious men, both in France, Germany, and England. Now, however, when our knowledge of the globe, and of its inhabitants, is so wonderfully enlarged by commerce, and by conquest; and when so great advances have been made in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of languages, the names of which, till very lately, were unheard of in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the world;\u2014there is every reason to hope for a series of farther discoveries, strengthening progressively, by the multiplication of their mutual points of contact, the common evidence of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> results; and tending more and more to dissipate the darkness in which the primeval history of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RACE\">race</a> is involved. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, of which only detached corners have hitherto been explored; and in which, it may be confidently presumed, that unthought of treasures still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> hid, to reward sooner or later the researches of our posterity.\n\nMy present subject does not lead me to speak of the mathematical and physical researches,\n\n---\n\n1 Locke has fallen into a train of thought very similar to that of Bonnet, concerning the Scale of Beings; but has expressed himself with far greater caution\u2014stating it modestly as an inference deduced from an induction of particulars, not as the result of any abstract or metaphysical principle.\u2014(See Locke's Works, Vol. III. p. 101.) In one instance, indeed, he avails himself of an allusion, which, at first sight, may appear to favour the extension of the mathematical Laws of Continuity to the works of creation; but it is evident, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEXT\">context</a>, that he meant this allusion merely as a popular illustration of a fact in Natural History; not as the rigorous enunciation of a theorem applicable alike to all truths, mathematical, physical, and moral. \"It is a hard matter to say where sensible and rational begin, and where insensible and irrational end; and who is there quick-sighted enough to determine precisely, which is the lowest species of living things, and which is the first of those who have no life? Things, as far as we can observe, lessen and augment, as the quantity does in a regular cone, where, though there be a manifest odds betwixt the bigness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> at a remote distance, yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the upper and under, where they touch one another, is hardly discernible.\"\u2014(Ibid.)\n\nSee some Reflections on this speculation of Locke's in the Spectator, No. 319.\n\n2 See Note F.F.\nwhich have associated so closely the name of Leibnitz with that of Newton, in the history of modern science; of the inexhaustible treasures of his erudition, both classical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCHOLASTIC\">scholastic</a>; of his vast and manifold contributions towards the elucidation of German antiquities and of Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a>; or of those theological controversies, in which, while he combated with one hand the enemies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>, he defended, with the other, the orthodoxy of his own dogmas against the profoundest and most learned divines of Europe. Nor would I have digressed so far as to allude here to these particulars, were it not for the unparalleled example they display, of what a vigorous and versatile genius, seconded by habits of persevering industry, may accomplish, within the short span of human life. Even the relaxations with which he was accustomed to fill up his moments of leisure, partook of the general character of his more serious engagements. By early and long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, he had acquired a singular facility in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of Latin verses; and he seems to have delighted in loading his muse with new fetters of his own contrivance, in addition to those imposed by the laws of classical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROSODY\">prosody</a>.\u00b9 The number, besides, of his literary correspondents was immense; including all that was most illustrious in Europe: and the rich materials everywhere scattered over his letters are sufficient of themselves to show, that his amusements consisted rather in a change of objects, than in a suspension of his mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>. Yet while we admire these stupendous monuments of his intellectual energy, we must not forget (if I may borrow the language of Gibbon) that \"even the powers of Leibnitz were dissipated by the multiplicity of his pursuits. He attempted more than he could finish; he designed more than he could execute; his imagination was too easily satisfied with a bold and rapid glance on the subject which he was impatient to leave; and he may be compared to those heroes whose empire has been lost in the ambition of universal conquest.\"\n\nFrom some expressions which Leibnitz has occasionally dropped, I think it probable, that he himself became sensible, as he advanced in life, that his time might have been more profitably employed, had his studies been more confined in their aim. \"If the whole earth (he has observed on one occasion) had continued to be of one language and of one speech, human life might be considered as extended beyond its present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, by the addition of all that part of it which is devoted to the acquisition of dead and foreign tongues. Many other branches of knowledge, too, may, in this respect, be classed with the languages; such as Positive Laws, Ceremonies, the Styles of Courts, and a great proportion of what is called critical erudition. The utility of all these arises merely from opinion; nor is there to be found, in the innumerable volumes that have been written to illustrate them, a hundredth part, which contains anything subservient to the happiness or improvement of mankind.\"\n\nThe most instructive lesson, however, to be drawn from the history of Leibnitz, is the incompetency of the most splendid gifts of the understanding, to advance essentially the interests either of Metaphysical or of Ethical Science, unless accompanied with that rare devotion to truth, which may be regarded, if not as the basis, at least as one of the most indispensable elements, of moral genius. The chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> to the study of philosophy, in his mind, seems to have been (what many French critics have considered as a chief source of the charms of the imitative arts) the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of conquering difficulties: a feature of his character which he had probably in his own eye, when he remarked (not without some degree of conscious vanity), as a peculiarity in the turn or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>, that to him \"all difficult things were easy, and all easy things\n\n\u00b9 A remarkable instance of this is mentioned by himself in one of his letters. \"Annos natus tredecim una die trecentos versus hexametros effludi, sine elisione annes, quod hoc fieri facile posse forte affirmarem.\"\u2014Leibn. Op. Tom. V. p. 304.) He also amused himself occasionally with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> verses in German and in French.\n\n\u00b2 May I presume to remark farther, that the native powers of Leibnitz's mind, astonishing and preternatural as they certainly were, seem sometimes oppressed and overlaid under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of his still more astonishing erudition? The influence of his scholastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-READING\">reading</a> is more peculiarly apparent in warping his judgment, and clouding his reason, on all questions connected with Metaphysical Theology.\n\nDiss. I. Part. II.\nHence the disregard manifested in his writings to the simple and obvious conclusions of experience and common sense; and the perpetual effort to unriddle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol12.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> over which an impenetrable veil is drawn. \"Scilicet sublime et erectum ingenium, pulchritudinem ac speciem excelsae magnaeque gloriae vehementius quam caute appetebat.\" It is to be regretted, that the sequel of this fine eulogy does not equally apply to him. \"Mox mitigavit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> et retinas; retinuitque, quod est difficillimum, et in sapientia modum.\" How happily does this last expression characterise the temperate wisdom of Locke, when contrasted with that towering, but impotent ambition, which, in the Theories of Optimism and of Pre-established Harmony, seemed to realize the fabled revolt of the giants against the sovereignty of the gods!\n\nAfter all, a similarity may be traced between these two great men in one intellectual weakness common to both; a facility in the admission of facts, stamped sufficiently (as we should now think) by their own intrinsic evidence, with the marks of incredibility. The observation has been often made with respect to Locke; but it would be difficult to find in Locke's writings, anything so absurd as an account gravely transmitted by Leibnitz to the Abb\u00e9 de St Pierre, and by him communicated to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, of a dog who spoke.\n\nNo person liberally educated could, I believe, be found at present in any Protestant country of Christendom, capable of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a>. By what causes so extraordinary a revolution in the minds of men has been effected, within the short space of a hundred years, I must not here stop to inquire. Much, I apprehend, must be ascribed to our enlarged knowledge of nature, and more particularly to those scientific voyages and travels which have annihilated so many of the prodigies which exercised the wonder and subdued the reason of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>. But, in whatever manner the revolution is to be explained, there can be no doubt, that this growing disposition to weigh scrupulously the probability of alleged facts against the faith due to the testimonies brought to attest them, and, even in some cases, against the apparent evidence of our own senses, enters largely and essentially into the composition of that philosophical spirit or temper, which so strongly distinguishes the eighteenth century from all those which preceded it. It is no small consolation to reflect, that some important maxims of good sense have been thus familiarised to the most ordinary understandings, which, at so very recent a period, failed in producing their due effect on two of the most powerful minds in Europe.\n\nOn reviewing the foregoing paragraphs, I am almost tempted to retract part of what I have written, when I reflect on the benefits which the world has derived even from the errors of Leibnitz. It has been well and justly said, that \"every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DESIDERATUM\">desideratum</a> is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> discovery;\" to which it may be added, that every new problem which is started, and still more every attempt, however abortive, towards its solution, strikes out a new path, which must sooner or later lead to the truth. If the problem be solvable, a solution will in due time be obtained; if insolvable, it will soon be abandoned as hopeless by general consent; and the legitimate field of scientific research will become more fertile, in proportion as a more accurate survey of its boundaries adapts it better to the limited resources of the cultivators.\n\nIn this point of view, what individual in modern times can be compared to Leibnitz! To how many of those researches, which still usefully employ the talents and industry of the learned, did he not point out and open the way! From how many more did he not warn the wise to withhold their curiosity, by his bold and fruitless attempts to burst the barriers of the invisible world!\n\nThe best eloge of Leibnitz is furnished by the literary history of the eighteenth century\u2014a history which, whoever takes the pains to compare with his works, and with his epistolary correspondence, will find reason to doubt\n\n---\n\n1 \"Sentio paucos esse mei characteris, et omnia facilia mihi difficilis, omnia contra difficilis mihi facilia esse.\"\u2014Leibnitz, Op. Tom. VI. p. 302.\n2 Tacitus, Agricola.\n3 See Note G.G.\n4 See Note H.H.\nwhether, at the singular era when he appeared, he could have more accelerated the advancement of knowledge by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCENTRATION\">concentration</a> of his studies, than he has actually done by the universality of his aims; and whether he does not afford one of the few instances to which the words of the poet may literally be applied:\n\n\"Si non errasset, fecerat ille minus.\"","sp":348,"ep":365},{"h":"LEIBNITZ","t":"There is a singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> between the form of Leibnitz's writings and the character of his mind. The latter was systematical, even to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a>. It was the vice of his prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ON\">on</a> every subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> where it was not bound by geometrical chains, to confine his view to those most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> principles, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WELL\">well</a> called by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a> \"merely notional;\" which render it, indeed, easy to build a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, but, only because they may be alike adapted to every state of appearances, and become thereby really inapplicable to any. Though his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> was thus naturally turned to system, his writings were, generally, occasional and miscellaneous. The fragments of his doctrines are scattered in Reviews; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-OR\">or</a> over a voluminous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LITERARY\">Literary</a> Correspondence; or in the Prefaces and Introductions to those compilations to which this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> was obliged by his situation to descend. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> and disorderly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of publication arose partly from the jars between business and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, inevitable in his course of life; but probably yet more from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of his system, which, while it widely deviates from the most general principles of former philosophers, is ready to embrace their particular doctrines under its own generalities, and thus to reconcile them to each other, as well as to accommodate itself to popular or established opinions, and compromise with them, according to his favourite and oft-repeated maxim, \"that most received doctrines are capable of a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>;\" by which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> words our philosopher meant a sense reconcilable with his own principles. Partial and occasional exhibitions of these principles suited better that constant negotiation with opinions, establishments, and prejudices, to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> generalities are well adapted, than a full and methodical statement of the whole at once. It is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> of every philosopher who attempts to make his principles extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a>, that they become like those tools which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> so easily as to penetrate nothing. Yet his manner of publication perhaps led him to those wide intuitions, as comprehensive as those of Bacon, of which he expressed the result as briefly and pithily as Hobbes. The fragment which contains his ethical principles is the Preface to a collection of documents illustrative of international <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HANOVER\">Hanover</a> in 1693; to which he often referred as his standard afterwards, especially when he speaks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SHAFTESBURY\">Shaftesbury</a>, or of the controversy between the two great theologians of France. \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">Right</a>,\" says he, \"is moral power; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a> moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>.

It is due to the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> author of this forgotten book to add, that it is still of praise of his adversary, which, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, was in the answerer generous; and that it contains an assertion of the admirable right of public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>, unusual even at the tolerant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of its appearance.\n\n2 Born in 1646; died in 1716.\n\n3 Nouveaux Essais sur l'Entendement Humain, liv. i. chap. ii. p. 57.

Hanov. 1695. DISS. II.\nis the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> of a wise man. *To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> is to be pleased with the happiness of another; or, in other words, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the happiness of another into a part of one's own.* Hence is explained the possibility of a disinterested love. When we are pleased with the happiness of any being, his happiness becomes one of our enjoyments. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">Wisdom</a> is the science of happiness.\"\n\n**REMARKS.**\n\nIt is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> from the above passage, that Leibnitz had touched the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> on the subject of disinterested affection; and that he was more near clinging to it than any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> philosopher, except Lord Shaftesbury. It is evident, however, from the latter part of it, that, like Shaftesbury, he shrunk from his own just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>; under the influence of that most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and far-spread <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of the schools, which assumed that such an abstraction as *Happiness* could be the object of love, and that the desire of so faint, distant, and refined an object, was the first principle of all moral nature, of which every other desire was only a modification or a fruit. Both he and Shaftesbury, however, when they relapsed into the selfish system, embraced it in its most refined form; considering the benevolent affections as valuable parts of our own happiness, not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of any of their effects or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRINSIC\">extrinsic</a> advantages, but of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> delightfulness which was inherent in their very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a>. But Leibnitz considered this refined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> as the object in the view of the benevolent man; an absurdity, or rather a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>, which, at least in the *Inquiry concerning Virtue*, Shaftesbury avoids. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be seen from Leibnitz's limitation, taken together with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of Wisdom, that he regarded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of the moral sentiments from the social affections, and the just subordination of the latter, as entirely founded on the tendency of general happiness to increase that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>, not merely as being real, but as being present to the agent's mind when he acts. In a subsequent passage he lowers his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> not a little.\n\n\"As for the sacrifice of life, or the endurance of the greatest pain for others, these things are rather generously enjoined than solidly demonstrated by philosophers. For <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, and self-congratulation, to which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Virtue, are indeed mental pleasures, and of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, but not to all, nor outweighing every bitterness of suffering; since all cannot imagine them with equal vivacity, and that power is little possessed by those whom neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, nor situation, nor the doctrines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, have taught to value mental gratifications.\" He concludes very truly, that morality is completed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. But the *Inquiry concerning Virtue* had reached that conclusion by a better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>. It entirely escaped his sagacity, as it has that of nearly all other moralists, that the coincidence of morality with well-understood <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> in our outward actions, is very far from being the most important part of the question; for these actions flow from habitual dispositions, from affections and sensibilities, which determine their nature. There may be, and there are many immoral acts, which, in the sense in which words are commonly used, are advantageous to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTOR\">actor</a>. But the whole sagacity and ingenuity of the world may be safely challenged to point out a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> in which virtuous dispositions, habits, and feelings, are not conducive in the highest degree to the happiness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>; or to maintain that he is not the happiest, whose moral sentiments and affections are such as to prevent the possibility of the prospect of advantage through unlawful means from presenting itself to his mind. It would indeed have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to prove to Regulus that it was his interest to return to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TORTURE\">torture</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>. But what if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> had been easy? The most thorough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> on such a point would not have enabled him to set this example, if he had not been supported by his own integrity and generosity, by love of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and reverence for his pledged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>. What could the conviction add to that greatness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, and to these glorious attributes? With such virtues he could not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> otherwise than he\n\n---\n\n1 See Notes and Illustrations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> N.\n\n* Ibid., note N.\ndid. Would a father affectionately interested in a son's happiness, of very lukewarm feelings of morality, but of good sense enough to weigh gratifications and sufferings exactly, be really desirous that his son should have these virtues in a less degree than Regulus, merely because they might expose him to the fate which Regulus chose? On the coldest calculation he would surely perceive, that the high and glowing feelings of such a mind during life, altogether throw into shade a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> of agony in leaving it. And, if he himself were so unfortunate that no more generous sentiment arose in his mind to silence such calculations, would it not be a reproach to his understanding not to discover, that though in one case out of millions such a character might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> a Regulus to torture, yet, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> course of nature, it is the source not only of happiness in life, but of quiet and honour in death. A case so extreme as that of Regulus will not perplex, if we bear in mind, that though we cannot prove the act of heroic virtue to be conducive to the interest of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>, yet we may perceive at once, that nothing is so conducive to his interest as to have a mind so formed that it could not shrink from it, but must rather embrace it with gladness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a>. Men of vigorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> are said sometimes to suffer most in a pestilence. No man was ever so absurd as for that reason to wish that he were more infirm. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a> might return once in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. If he were then alive, he might escape it; and even if he fell, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> of advantage would be in most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> greatly on the side of robust health. In estimating beforehand the value of a strong bodily frame, a man of sense would throw the small chance of a rare and short evil entirely out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>. So must the coldest and most selfish moral calculator, who, if he be sagacious and exact, must pronounce, that the inconveniences to which a man may be sometimes exposed by a pure and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> mind, are no reasons for regretting that we do not escape them by possessing minds more enfeebled and distempered. Other occasions will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, in the sequel, to this important part of the subject. But the great name of Leibnitz seemed to require that his grading statement should not be cited without warning the reader against its egregious fallacy.\n\nMALEBRANCHE\n\nThis ingenious philosopher and beautiful writer is the only celebrated Cartesian who has professedly handled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a> of Morals. His theory has in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of view a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> to the doctrine of Clarke; while in others it has given occasion to his English follower Norris to say, that if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUAKERS\">Quakers</a> understood their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the illumination of all men, they would explain it on the principles of Malebranche. \"There is,\" says he, \"one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> virtue, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> virtue, the virtue which renders us just and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a>, the virtue which will one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> render us happy. It is the only virtue. It is the love of the universal order, as it eternally existed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">Divine</a> reason, where every created reason contemplates it. This order is composed of practical as well as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> truth.\n\nReason perceives the moral superiority of one being over another, as immediately as the equality of the radii of the same circle. The relative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> of beings is that part of the immovable order to which men must conform their minds and their conduct. The love of order is the whole of virtue, and conformity to order constitutes the morality of actions.\" It is not difficult to discover, that in spite of the singular skill employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WEAVING\">weaving</a> this web, it answers no other purpose than that of hiding the whole difficulty. The love of universal order, says Malebranche, requires that we should value an animal more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, because it is more valuable; and love God infinitely more than man, because he is infinitely better. But without presupposing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> of moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DIS\">dis</a>-\n\n---\n\n1 Born in 1638; died in 1715.\n2 Trait\u00e9 de Morale. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROTTERDAM\">Rotterdam</a>, 1694.\n3 Author of the Theory of the Ideal World, who well copied, though he did not equal the clearness and choice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> which belonged to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>.\ntinctions, and the power of moral feelings, the two points to be proved, how can either of these propositions be evident, or even intelligible? To say that a love of the eternal order will produce the love and practice of every virtue, is an assertion untenable unless we take morality for granted, and useless if we do.\n\nIn his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on Morals, all the incidental and secondary remarks are equally well considered and well expressed. The manner in which he applied his principle to the particulars of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>, is excellent. He is perhaps the first philosopher who has precisely laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> and rigidly adhered to the great principle, that virtue consists in pure intentions and dispositions of mind, without which, actions, however conformable to rules, are not truly moral; a truth of the highest importance, which, in the theological form, may be said to have been the main principle of the first Protestant Reformers. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, according to him, is the conformity of the attributes of God to those moral qualities which we irresistibly love and revere.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">Sovereign</a> princes,\" says he, \"have no right to use their authority without reason.

Though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the Mathematics had never been entirely abandoned, it had been reduced to matters of very simple and easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a>, such as were merely subservient to practice. There had been men who could compute the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>, draw a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MERIDIAN\">meridian</a> line, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-OR\">or</a> even construct a sun-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a>, in the worst of times; but between such skill, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> to understand or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> to relish the demonstrations of Euclid, Apollonius, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, there was a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, and many difficulties were to be overcome, for which much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and much subsidiary knowledge, were necessary. The repositories of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> treasures were to be opened, and made accessible; the knowledge of the languages was to be acquired; the manuscripts were to be deciphered; and the skill of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAMMARIAN\">grammarian</a> and the critic were to precede, in a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that of the geometrician or the astronomer. The obligations which we have to those who undertook this laborious and irksome task, and who rescued the ancient books from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRISONS\">prisons</a> to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BARBARISM\">barbarism</a> had condemned them, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> by which they must soon have been overtaken, are such as we can never sufficiently acknowledge; and indeed we shall never know even the names of many of the benefactors to whom our thanks are due. In the midst of the wars, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, and bloodshed, which overwhelmed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> during the middle ages, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> houses and monasteries afforded to the remains of ancient learning an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a>, which a salutary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> forced even the most lawless to respect; and the authors who have given the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the revival of letters, agree that it is in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> to those establishments\nthat we owe the safety of the books which have kept alive the scientific and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> attainments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome.\n\nThe study of the remains of antiquity gradually produced men of taste and intelligence, who were able to correct the faults of the manuscripts they copied, and to explain the difficulties of the authors they translated. Such were Purbach, Regiomontanus, Commandine, Maurolucus, and many others. By their means, the writings of Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, and Pappus, became known and accessible to men of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a> contributed its share towards this great renovation, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> was derived the knowledge of many Greek books, of the originals of which, some were not found till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> afterwards, and others have never yet been discovered.\n\nIn nothing, perhaps, is the inventive and elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of the Greeks better exemplified than in their geometry. The elementary truths of that science were connected by Euclid into one great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a>, beginning from the axioms, and extending to the properties of the five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> solids; the whole digested into such admirable order, and explained with such clearness and precision, that no similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of superior excellence has appeared, even in the present advanced state of mathematical science.\n\nArchimedes had assailed the more difficult problems of geometry, and, by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXHAUSTIONS\">Exhaustions</a>, had demonstrated many curious and important theorems with regard to the lengths and areas of curves and the contents of solids. The same great geometer had given a beginning to physico-mathematical science, by investigating several propositions, and resolving several problems in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">Hydrostatics</a>.\n\nApollonius had treated of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONIC_SECTIONS\">Conic Sections</a>,\u2014the curves which, after the circle, are the most simple and important in geometry; and, by his elaborate and profound researches, had laid the foundation of discoveries which were to illustrate very distant ages.\n\nAnother great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, the Geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">Analysis</a>, ascribed very generally to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLATONIC\">Platonic</a> school, but most successfully cultivated by the geometer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> named, is one of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> and beautiful contrivances in the Mathematics. It is a method of discovering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> concerning things unknown, or propositions merely supposed, as if the one were given, or the other were really true. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> that is unknown, is only to be found from the relations which it bears to quantities that are known. By reasoning on these relations, we come at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> to some one so simple, that the thing sought is thereby determined. By this analytical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, therefore, the thing required is discovered, and we are at the same time put in possession of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> by which new truths may be found out, and which, when skill in using it has been acquired by practice, may be applied to an unlimited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>.\n\nA similar process enables us to discover the demonstrations of propositions, supposed to be true, or, if not true, to discover that they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>.\n\nThis method, to the consideration of which we shall again have an opportunity of returning, was perhaps the most valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the ancient Mathematics, inasmuch as a method of discovering truth is more valuable than the truths it has already discovered. Unfortunately, however, the fragments containing this precious remnant had suffered more from the injuries of time than almost any other.\n\nIn the fifteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, Regiomontanus, already mentioned, is the mathematician who holds the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>. To him we owe many translations and commentaries, together with several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> and valuable works of his own. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">Trigonometry</a>, which had never been known to the Greeks as a separate science, and which took that form in Arabia, advanced, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of Regiomontanus, to a great degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>, and approached very near to the condition which it has attained at the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. He also introduced the use of decimal fractions into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a>, and thereby gave to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> its full extent, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NUMERICAL\">numerical</a> computation the utmost degree of simplicity and enlargement which it seems capable of attaining.\n\nThis eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was cut off in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> of life; and his untimely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, says Mr Smith, amidst innumerable projects for the advance-\nment of science, is even at this day a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of regret. He was buried in the Pantheon at Rome; and the honours paid to him at his death prove that science had now become a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> which the great were disposed to recognise.\n\nWerner, who lived in the end of this century, is the first among the moderns who appears to have been acquainted with the geometrical analysis. His writings are very rare, and I have never had an opportunity of examining them. What I here assert is on the authority of Montucla, whose judgment in this matter may be safely relied on, as he has shown, by many instances, that he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WELL\">well</a> acquainted with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the analysis referred to. It is not a little remarkable that Werner should have understood this subject, when we find many eminent mathematicians, long after his time, entirely unacquainted with it, and continually expressing their astonishment how the ancient geometers found out those simple and elegant constructions and demonstrations, of which they have given so many examples. In the days of Werner there was no ancient book known, except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">Data</a> of Euclid, from which any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> concerning the geometrical analysis could be collected; and it is highly to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, that, without any other help, he should have come to the knowledge of a method not a little recondite in its principles, and among the finest inventions either of ancient or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> science. Werner resolved, by means of it, Archimedes's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> into two segments, having a given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> to one another. He proposed also to translate, from the Arabic, the work of Apollonius, entitled Sectio Rationis, rightly judging it to be an elementary work in that analysis, and to come next after the Data of Euclid.\n\nBenedetto, an Italian mathematician, appears also to have been very early acquainted with the principles of the same ingenious method, as he published a book on the geometrical analysis at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TURIN\">Turin</a> in 1585.\n\nMaurolycus of Messina flourished in the middle of the sixteenth century, and is justly regarded as the first geometer of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. Beside furnishing many valuable translations and commentaries, he wrote a treatise on the Conic Sections, which is highly esteemed. He endeavoured also to restore the fifth book of the Conics of Apollonius, in which that geometer treated of the maxima and minima of the conic sections. His writings all indicate a man of clear conceptions, and of a strong understanding; though he is taxed with having dealt in astrological prediction.\n\nIn the early part of the seventeenth century, Cavalieri was particularly distinguished, and made an advance in the higher geometry, which occupies the middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> between the discoveries of Archimedes and those of Newton.\n\nFor the purpose of determining the lengths and areas of curves, and the contents of solids contained within curve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERFICIES\">superficies</a>, the ancients had invented a method, to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Exhaustions has been given; and in nothing, perhaps, have they more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> their powers of mathematical invention.\n\nWhenever it is required to measure the space bounded by curve lines, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of a curve, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> contained within a curve superficies, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of elementary geometry. Rectilineal figures are compared, on the principle of superposition, by help of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of equality which is derived from the coincidence of magnitudes both similar and equal. Two rectangles of equal bases and equal altitudes are held to be equal, because they can perfectly coincide. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> and an oblique angled parallelogram, having equal bases and altitudes, are shown to be equal, because the same triangle, taken from the rectangle on one side, and added to it on the other, converts it into the parallelogram; and thus two magnitudes which are not similar, are shown to have equal areas. In like manner, if a triangle and a parallelogram have the same base and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a>, the triangle is shown to be half the parallelogram; because, if to the triangle there be added another, similar and equal to itself, but in the reverse position, the two together <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> compose\n\n---\n\n1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>, p. 90. Regiomontanus was born in 1436, and died in 1476.\n2 See Montucla, Histoire des Math\u00e9matiques, vol. I. p. 531.\na parallelogram, having the same base and altitude with the given triangle. The same is true of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of all other rectilineal figures; and if the reasoning be carefully analyzed, it will always be found to be reducible to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> and original idea of equality, derived from things that coincide or occupy the same space; that is to say, the areas which are proved equal are always such as, by the addition or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUBTRACTION\">subtraction</a> of equal and similar parts, may be rendered capable of coinciding with one another.\n\nThis principle, which is quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> with respect to rectilineal figures, must fail, when we would compare curvilineal and rectilineal spaces with one another, and make the latter serve as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of the former; because no addition or subtraction of rectilineal figures can ever produce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> which is curvilineal. It is possible, indeed, to combine curvilineal figures, so as to produce one that is rectilineal; but this principle is of very limited extent; it led to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUADRATURE\">quadrature</a> of the lunulae of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a>, but has hardly furnished any other result which can be considered as valuable in science.\n\nIn the difficulty to which geometers were thus reduced, it might occur, that by inscribing a rectilineal figure within a curve, and circumscribing another round it, two limits could be obtained, one greater and the other less than the area required. It was also evident, that by increasing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and diminishing the sides of those figures, the two limits might be brought continually nearer to one another, and of course nearer to the curvilineal area, which was always intermediate between them. In prosecuting this sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a>, a result was at length found out, which must have occasioned no less surprise than delight to the mathematician who first encountered it. The result I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> is, that, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> figures was continually increased, by multiplying the number of the sides, and diminishing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, there was an assignable rectilineal area, to which they continually approached, so as to come nearer it than any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> that could be supposed. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> would also be observed to belong to the circumscribed figures, and therefore it could be no other than the curvilineal area required.\n\nIt appears to have been to Archimedes that a truth of this sort first occurred, when he found that two-thirds of the rectangle, under the ordinate and abscissa of a parabola, was a limit always greater than the inscribed rectilineal figure, and less than the circumscribed. In some other curves, a similar conclusion was found; and Archimedes contrived to show that it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to suppose that the area of the curve could differ from the said limit, without admitting that the circumscribed figure might become less, or the inscribed figure greater than the curve itself. The method of Exhaustions was the name given to the indirect demonstrations thus formed. Though few things more ingenious than this method have been devised, and though nothing could be more conclusive than the demonstrations resulting from it, yet it laboured under two very considerable defects. In the first place, the process by which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> was obtained was long and difficult; and, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> place, it was indirect, giving no insight into the principle on which the investigation was founded. Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, it did not enable one to find out similar demonstrations, nor increase one's power of making more discoveries of the same kind. It was a demonstration purely synthetical, and required, as all indirect reasoning must do, that the conclusion should be known before the reasoning is begun. A more compendious, and a more analytical method, was therefore much to be wished for, and was an improvement which, at a moment when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of mathematical science was enlarging so fast, seemed particularly to be required.\n\nCavalleri, born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a> in the year 1598, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> by whom this great improvement was made. The principle on which he proceeded was, that areas may be considered as made up of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> lines; solids of an infinite number of parallel planes; and even lines themselves, whether curve or straight, of an infinite number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. The cubature of a solid being thus reduced to the summation of a series of planes, and the quadrature of a curve to the summation of a series of ordinates, each of the investigations was reduced to something more simple. It added to this simplicity not a little, that the sums of se-\nries are often more easily found when the number of terms is infinitely great, than when it is finite, and actually assigned.\n\nIt appears that a tract on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-STEREOMETRY\">Stereometry</a>, written by Kepler, whose name will hereafter be often mentioned, first led Cavalleri to take this view of geometrical magnitudes. In that tract, which was published in 1615, the measurement of many solids was proposed, which had not before fallen under the consideration of mathematicians. Such, for example, was that of the solids <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the revolution of a curve, not about its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, but about any line whatsoever. Solids of that kind, on account of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> with the figure of casks, and vessels actually employed for containing liquids, appeared to Kepler to offer both curious and useful subjects of investigation. There were no less than eighty-four such solids, which he proposed for the consideration of mathematicians. He was, however, himself unequal to the task of resolving any but a small number of the simplest of these problems. In these solutions, he was bold enough to introduce into geometry, for the first time, the idea of infinitely great and infinitely small quantities; and by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> departure from the rigour of the science, he rendered it in fact a most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. Kepler conceived a circle to be composed of an infinite number of triangles, having their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> in the centre of the circle, and their infinitely small bases in the circumference. It is to be remarked, that Galileo had also introduced the notion of infinitely small quantities, in his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a>, *De Mechanica*, where he treats of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> cut out of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEMISPHERE\">hemisphere</a>; and he has done the same in treating of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> of falling bodies. Cavalleri was the friend and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Galileo, but much more profound in the Mathematics. In his hands the idea took a more regular and systematic form, and was explained in his work on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVISIBLES\">Indivisibles</a>, published in 1635.\n\nThe rule for summing an infinite series of terms in arithmetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROGRESSION\">progression</a> had been long known, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of it to find the area of a triangle, according to the method of indivisibles, was a matter of no difficulty. The next step was, supposing a series of lines in arithmetical progression, and squares to be described on each of them, to find what ratio the sum of all these squares bears to the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, taken as often as there are terms in the progression. Cavalleri showed, that when the number of terms is infinitely great, the first of these sums is just one-third of the second. This evidently led to the cubature of many solids.\n\nProceeding one step farther, he sought for the sum of the cubes of the same lines, and found it to be one-fourth of the greatest, taken as often as there are terms; and, continuing this investigation, he was able to assign the sum of the nth powers of a series in arithmetical progression, supposing always the difference of the terms to be infinitely small, and their number to be infinitely great. The number of curious results obtained from these investigations may be easily conceived. It gave, over geometrical problems of the higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, the same power which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEGRAL\">integral</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a>, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLUXIONS\">fluxions</a> does, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> when the exponent of the variable quantity is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEGER\">integer</a>. The method of indivisibles, however, was not without difficulties, and could not but be liable to objection, with those accustomed to the rigorous exactness of the ancient geometry. In strictness, lines, however multiplied, can never make an area, or any thing but a line; nor can areas, however they may be added together, compose a solid, or any thing but an area. This is certainly true, and yet the conclusions of Cavalleri, deduced on a contrary supposition, are true also. This happened, because, though the suppositions that a certain series of lines, infinite in number, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to one another, may compose a certain area, and that another series may compose another area, are neither of them true; yet is it strictly true, that the one of these areas must have to the other the same ratio which the sum of the one series of lines has to the sum of the other series. Thus, it is the ratios of the areas, and not the areas absolutely considered, which are determined by the reasonings of Cavalleri; and that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of their ratios is quite accurate, can very readily be demonstrated by the method of exhaustion.\n\nThe method of indivisibles, from the great\nfacility with which it could be managed, furnished a most ready method of ascertaining the ratios of areas and solids to one another, and, therefore, scarcely seems to deserve the epithet which Newton himself bestows upon it, of involving in its conceptions something harsh, (durum) and not easy to be admitted. It was the doctrine of infinitely small quantities carried to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a>, and gave at once the result of an infinite series of successive approximations. Nothing, perhaps, more ingenious, and certainly nothing more happy, ever was contrived, than to arrive at the conclusion of all these approximations, without going through the approximations themselves. This is the purpose served by introducing into Mathematics the consideration of quantities infinitely small in size, and infinitely great in number; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> which, however inaccurate they may seem, yet, when carefully and analogically reasoned upon, have never led into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>.\n\nGeometry owes to Cavalleri, not only the general method just described, but many particular theorems, which that method was the instrument of discovering. Among these is the very remarkable proposition, that as four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of the three angles of any spherical triangle, above two right angles, so is the superficies of the hemisphere to the area of the triangle. At that time, however, science was advancing so fast, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind was everywhere expanding itself with so much energy, that the same discovery was likely to be made by more individuals than one at the same time. It was not known in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> in 1632, when this determination of the area of a spherical triangle was given by Cavalleri, that it had been published three years before by Albert Girard, a mathematician of the Low Countries, of whose inventive powers we shall soon have more occasion to speak.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYCLOID\">Cycloid</a> afforded a number of problems, well calculated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> the proficients in the geometry of indivisibles, or of infinites. It is the curve described by a point in the circumference of a circle, while the circle itself rolls in a straight line along a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>. It is not quite certain when this curve, so remarkable for its curious properties, and for the place which it occupies in the history of geometry, first drew the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of mathematicians. In the year 1639, Galileo informed his friend Torricelli, that, forty years before that time, he had thought of this curve, on account of its shape, and the graceful form it would give to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> had endeavoured to find the area of the cycloid; but though he was one of those who first introduced the consideration of infinites into geometry, he was not expert enough in the use of that doctrine, to be able to resolve this problem. It is still more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a>, that the same problem proved too difficult for Cavalleri, though he certainly was in complete possession of the principles by which it was to be resolved. It is, however, not easy to determine whether it be to Torricelli, the scholar of Cavalleri, and his successor in genius and talents, or to Roberval, a French mathematician of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, and a man also of great originality and invention, that science is indebted for the first quadrature of the cycloid, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that its area is three times that of its generating circle. Both these mathematicians laid claim to it. The French and Italians each took the part of their own countryman; and in their zeal have so perplexed the question, that it is hard to say on which side the truth is to be found. Torricelli, however, was a man of a mild, amiable, and candid disposition; Roberval of a temper irritable, violent, and envious; so that, in as far as the testimony of the individuals themselves is concerned, there is no doubt which ought to preponderate. They had both the skill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> which fitted them for this, or even for more difficult researches.\n\nThe other properties of this curve, those that respect its tangents, its length, its curvature, &c. exercised the ingenuity, not only of the geometers just mentioned, but of Wren, Wallis, Huygens, and, even after the invention of the integral calculus, of Newton, Leibnitz, and Bernoulli.\n\nRoberval also improved the method of quadratures invented by Cavalleri, and extended his solutions to the case, when the powers of the terms in the arithmetical progression of which the sum was to be found were fractional; and\nWallis added the case when they were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>. Fermat, who, in his inventive resources, as well as in the correctness of his mathematical taste, yielded to none of his contemporaries, applied the consideration of infinitely small quantities to determine the maxima and minima of the ordinates of curves, as also their tangents. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BARROW\">Barrow</a>, somewhat later, did the same in England. Afterwards the geometry of infinites fell into the hands of Leibnitz and Newton, and acquired that new character which marks so distinguished an era in the mathematical sciences.\n\n2. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALGEBRA\">ALGEBRA</a>.\n\nIt was not from Greece alone that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> proceeded which dispelled the darkness of the middle ages; for, with the first dawn of that light, a mathematical science, of a name and character unknown to the geometers of antiquity, was received in Europe from Arabia. As early as the beginning of the thirteenth century, Leonardo, a merchant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a>, having made frequent visits to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EAST\">East</a>, in the course of commercial adventure, returned to Italy enriched by the traffic, and instructed by the science of those countries. He brought with him the knowledge of Algebra; and a late writer quotes a manuscript of his, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of 1202, and another that of 1228. The importation of algebra into Europe is thus carried back nearly 200 years farther than has generally been supposed; for Leonardo has been represented as flourishing in the end of the fourteenth century, instead of the very beginning of the thirteenth. It appears, by an extract from his manuscript, published by the above author, that his knowledge of algebra extended as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUADRATIC_EQUATIONS\">quadratic equations</a>. The language was very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>, corresponding to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a> of the science; the quantities and the operations being expressed in words, with the help only of a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABBREVIATIONS\">abbreviations</a>. The rule for resolving quadratics by completing the square, is demonstrated geometrically.\n\nThough algebra was brought into Europe from Arabia, it is by no means certain that this last is its native country. There is, indeed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to think that its invention must be sought for much farther to the East, and probably not nearer than Indostan. We are assured by the Arabian writers, that Mahomet Ben <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MUSA\">Musa</a> of Chorasan, distinguished for his mathematical knowledge, travelled, about the year 959, into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, for the purpose of receiving further instruction in the science which he cultivated. It is likewise certain, that some books, which have lately been brought from India into this country, treat of algebra in a manner that has every appearance of originality, or at least of being derived from no source with which we are at all acquainted.\n\nBefore the time of Leonardo of Pisa, an important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a>, also from the East, had greatly improved the science of arithmetic. This was the use of the Arabic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTATION\">notation</a>, and the contrivance of making the same character change its signification, according to a fixed rule, when it changed its position, being increased tenfold for every place that it advanced towards the left. The knowledge of this simple but refined artifice was learned from the Moors by Gerbert, a monk of the Low Countries, in the tenth century, and by him made known in Europe. Gerbert was afterwards Pope, by the name of Silvester the Second, but from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> derived much less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> than from having instructed his countrymen in the decimal notation.\n\nThe writings of Leonardo, above mentioned, have remained in manuscript; and the first printed book in algebra is that of Lucas de Burgo, a Franciscan, who, towards the end of the fifteenth century, travelled, like Leonardo, into the East, and was there instructed in the principles of algebra. The characters employed in his work, as in those of Leonardo, are mere abbreviations of words. The letters $p$ and $m$\n\n---\n\n1 He also was very skilful in the geometric analysis, and seems to have more thoroughly imbibed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of that ingenious invention than any of the moderns before Halley.\n2 M. Cossali of Pisa, in a tract on the Origin of Algebra, 1797.\ndenote plus and minus; and the rule is laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, that, in multiplication, plus into minus gives minus, but minus into minus gives plus. Thus the first appearance of algebra is merely that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of short-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, or an abbreviation of common language, applied to the solution of arithmetical problems. It was a contrivance merely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> trouble; and yet to this contrivance we are indebted for the most philosophical and refined art which men have yet employed for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of their thoughts. This scientific language, therefore, like those in common use, has grown up slowly, from a very weak and imperfect state, till it has reached the condition in which it is now found.\n\nThough in all this the moderns received none of their information from the Greeks, yet a work in the Greek language, treating of arithmetical questions, in a manner that may be accounted algebraic, was discovered in the course of the next century, and given to the world, in a Latin translation, by Xylander, in 1575. This is the work of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DIOPHANTUS\">Diophantus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, who had composed thirteen books of Arithmetical Questions, and is supposed to have flourished about 150 years after the Christian era. The questions he resolves are often of considerable difficulty; and a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> is displayed in stating them, so as to bring out equations of such a form as to involve only one power of the unknown quantity. The expression is that of common language, abbreviated and assisted by a few symbols. The investigations do not extend beyond quadratic equations; they are, however, extremely ingenious, and prove the author to have been a man of talent, though the instrument he worked with was weak and imperfect.\n\nThe name of Cardan is famous in the history of algebra. He was born at Milan in 1501, and was a man in whose character good and ill, strength and weakness, were mixed up in singular profusion. With great talents and industry, he was capricious, insincere, and vain-glorious to excess. Though a man of real science, he professed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>, and was such a believer in the influence of the stars, that he died to accomplish an astrological prediction. He remains, accordingly, a melancholy proof, that there is no folly or weakness too great to be united to high intellectual attainments.\n\nBefore his time very little advance had been made in the solution of any equations higher than the second degree; except that, as we are told, about the year 1508, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIPIO\">Scipio</a> Ferrei, Professor of Mathematics at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, had found out a rule for resolving one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of cubic equations, which, however, he concealed, or communicated only to a few of his scholars. One of these, Florido, on the strength of the secret he possessed, agreeably to a practice then common among mathematicians, challenged Tartalea of Brescia, to contend with him in the solution of algebraic problems. Florido had at first the advantage; but Tartalea, being a man of ingenuity, soon discovered his rule, and also another much more general, in consequence of which he came off at last victorious. By the report of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a>, the curiosity of Cardan was strongly excited; for, though he was himself much versed in the Mathematics, he had not been able to discover a method of resolving equations higher than the second degree. By the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> and importunate solicitation, he wrung from Tartalea the secret of his rules, but not till he had bound himself, by promises and oaths, never to divulge them. Tartalea did not communicate the demonstrations, which, however, Cardan soon found out, and extended, in a very ingenious and systematic manner, to all cubic equations whatsoever. Thus possessed of an important discovery, which was at least in a great part his own, he soon forgot his promises to Tartalea; and published the whole in 1545, not concealing, however, what he owed to the latter. Though a proceeding so directly contrary to an express <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STIPULATION\">stipulation</a> cannot be defended, one does not much regret the disappointment of any man who would make a mystery of knowledge, or keep his discoveries a secret, for purposes merely selfish.\n\nThus was first published the rule which still bears the name of Cardan, and which, at this day, marks a point in the progress of algebraic investigation, which all the efforts of succeeding analysts have hardly been able to go beyond. As to the general doctrine of equations, it ap-\npears that Cardan was acquainted both with the negative and positive roots, the former of which he called by the name of false roots. He also knew that the number of positive, or, as he called them, true roots, is equal to the number of the changes of the signs of the terms; and that the coefficient of the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> is the difference between the sum of the true and the false roots. He also had perceived the difficulty of that case of cubic equations, which cannot be reduced to his own rule. He was not able to overcome the difficulty, but showed how, in all cases, an approximation to the roots might be obtained.\n\nThere is the more merit in these discoveries, that the language of algebra still remained very imperfect, and consisted merely of abbreviations of words. Mathematicians were then in the practice of putting their rules into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>. Cardan has given his a poetical dress, in which, as may be supposed, they are very awkward and obscure; for whatever assistance in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAY\">way</a> is given to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, must be entirely at the expense of the understanding. It is, at the same time, a proof that the language of algebra was very imperfect. Nobody now thinks of translating an algebraic formula into verse; because, if one has acquired any familiarity with the language of the science, the formula will be more easily remembered than any thing that can be substituted in its room.\n\nItaly was not the only country into which the algebraic analysis had by this time found its way: in Germany it had also made considerable progress; and Stiphelius, in a book of algebra, published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-NUREMBERG\">Nuremberg</a> in 1544, employed the same numeral exponents of powers, both positive and negative, which we now use, as far as integer numbers are concerned; but he did not carry the solution of equations farther than the second degree. He introduced the same characters for plus and minus which are at present employed.\n\nRobert Recorde, an English mathematician, published about this time, or a few years later, the first English treatise on Algebra, and he there introduced the same sign of equality which is now in use.\n\nThe properties of algebraic equations were discovered, however, very slowly. Pelitarius, a French mathematician, in a treatise which bears the date of 1558, is the first who observed that the root of an equation is a divisor of the last term; and he remarked also this curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of numbers, that the sum of the cubes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> numbers is the square of the sum of the numbers themselves.\n\nThe knowledge of the solution of cubic equations was still confined to Italy. Bombelli, a mathematician of that country, gave a regular treatise on Algebra, and considered, with very particular attention, the irreducible case of Cardan's rule. He was the first who made the remark, that the problems belonging to that case can always be resolved by the trisection of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>.\n\nVieta was a very learned man, and an excellent mathematician, remarkable both for industry and invention. He was the first who employed letters to denote the known as well as the unknown quantities; so that it was with him that the language of algebra first became capable of expressing general truths, and attained to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> which has since rendered it such a powerful instrument of investigation. He has also given new demonstrations of the rule for resolving cubic, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BIQUADRATIC\">biquadratic</a> equations. He also discovered the relation between the roots of an equation of any degree, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COEFFICIENTS\">coefficients</a> of its terms, though only in the case where none of the terms are wanting, and where all the roots are real or positive. It is, indeed, extremely curious to remark, how gradually the truths of this\n\n---\n\n1 A passage in Bombelli's book, relative to the algebra of India, has become more interesting, from the information concerning the science of that country, which has reached Europe within the last twenty years. He tells us, that he had seen in the Vatican library, a manuscript of a certain Diophantus, a Greek author, which he admired so much, that he had formed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of translating it. He adds, that in this manuscript he had found the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> authors often quoted; from which it appeared that algebra was known to the Indians before it was known to the Arabs. Nothing, however, of all this is to be found in the work of Diophantus, which was published about three years after the time when Bombelli wrote. As it is, at the same time, impossible that he could be so much mistaken about a manuscript which he had particularly examined, this passage remains a mystery, which those who are curious about the ancient history of science would be very glad to have unravelled. See Hutton's History of Algebra.\nsort came in sight. This proposition belonged to a general truth, the greater part of which remained yet to be discovered. Vieta's treatises were originally published about the year 1600, and were afterwards collected into one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> by Schooten, in 1646.\n\nIn speaking of this illustrious man, Vieta, we must not omit his improvements in trigonometry, and still less his treatise on Angular Sections, which was a most important application of algebra to investigate the theorems, and resolve the problems of geometry. He also restored some of the books of Apollonius, in a manner highly creditable to his own ingenuity, but not perfectly in the taste of the Greek geometry; because, though the constructions are elegant, the demonstrations are all synthetical.\n\nAbout the same period, algebra became greatly indebted to Albert Girard, a Flemish mathematician, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> work, *Invention Nouvelle en Algebre*, was printed in 1669. This ingenious author perceived a greater extent, but not yet the whole of the truth, partially discovered by Vieta, viz. the successive formation of the coefficients of an equation from the sum of the roots; the sum of their products taken two and two; the same taken three and three, &c. whether the roots be positive or negative. He appears also to have been the first who understood the use of negative roots in the solution of geometrical problems, and is the author of the figurative expression, which gives to negative quantities the name of quantities less than nothing; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> that has been severely censured by those who forget that there are correct ideas, which correct language can hardly be made to express. The same mathematician conceived the notion of imaginary roots, and showed that the number of the roots of an equation could not exceed the exponent of the highest power of the unknown quantity. He was also in possession of the very refined and difficult rule, which forms the sums of the powers of the roots of an equation from the coefficients of its terms. This is the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of discoveries which the history of any algebraist could yet furnish.\n\nThe person next in order, as an inventor in algebra, is Thomas Harriot, an English mathematician, whose book, *Artis Analyticae Praxis*, was published after his death, in 1631. This book contains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENESIS\">genesis</a> of all equations, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> multiplication of simple equations; that is to say, it explains the truth in its full extent, to which Vieta and Girard had been approximating. By Harriot also, the method of extracting the roots of equations was greatly improved; the smaller letters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>, instead of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> letters employed by Vieta, were introduced; and by this improvement, trifling, indeed, compared with the rest, the form and exterior of algebraic expression were brought nearer to those which are now in use.\n\nI have been the more careful to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> very particularly the degrees by which the properties of equations were thus unfolded, because I think it forms an instance hardly paralleled in science, where a succession of able men, without going wrong, advanced, nevertheless, so slowly in the discovery of a truth which, when known, does not seem to be of a very hidden and abstruse nature. Their slow progress arose from this, that they worked with an instrument, the use of which they did not fully comprehend, and employed a language which expressed more than they were prepared to understand;\u2014a language which, under the notion, first of negative and then of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMAGINARY_QUANTITIES\">imaginary quantities</a>, seemed to involve such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol12.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> as the accuracy of mathematical science must necessarily refuse to admit.\n\nThe distinguished author of whom I have just been speaking was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> in 1560. He was employed in the second expedition sent out by Sir Walter Raleigh to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>, and on his return published an account of that country. He afterwards devoted himself entirely to the study of the Mathematics; and it appears from some of his manuscripts, lately discovered, that he observed the spots of the sun as early as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1610, not more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> later than Galileo. He also made observations on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>'s satellites, and on the comets of 1607 and of 1618.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 The manuscripts which contain these observations, and probably many other things of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, are preserved in the collection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EGREMONT\">Egremont</a>, having come into the possession of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> from Henry Percy, Earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a>, a most liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of science, with whom Harriot appears to have chiefly lived after his return from Virginia.\nThe succession of discoveries above related brought the algebraic analysis, abstractly considered, into a state of perfection little short of that which it has attained at the present moment. It was thus prepared for the step which was about to be taken by Descartes, and which forms one of the most important epochs in the history of the mathematical sciences. This was the application of the algebraic analysis, to define the nature, and investigate the properties, of curve lines, and, consequently, to represent the notion of variable quantity. It is often said that Descartes was the first who applied algebra to geometry; but this is inaccurate; for such applications had been made before, particularly by Vieta, in his treatise on Angular Sections.\n\nThe invention just mentioned is the undisputed property of Descartes, and opened up vast fields of discovery for those who were to come after him.\n\nThe work in which this was contained is a tract of no more than 106 quarto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>; and there is probably no book of the same size which has conferred so much and so just celebrity on its author. It was first published in 1637.\n\nIn the first of the three books into which the tract just mentioned is divided, the author begins with the consideration of such geometrical problems as may be resolved by circles and straight lines; and explains the method of constructing algebraic formulas, or of translating a truth from the language of algebra into that of geometry. He then proceeds to the consideration of the problem, known among the ancients by the name of the locus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AD\">ad</a> quatuor rectas, and treated of by Apollonius and Pappus. The algebraic analysis afforded a method of resolving this problem in its full extent; and the consideration of it is again resumed in the second book. The thing required is, to find the locus of a point, from which, if perpendiculars be drawn to four lines given in position, a given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of these perpendiculars, in which the variable quantities are only of two dimensions, shall be always of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>.\\(^1\\) Descartes shows the locus, on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, to be always a conic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>; and he distinguishes the cases in which it is a circle, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELLIPSIS\">ellipsis</a>, a parabola, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPERBOLA\">hyperbola</a>.\n\nIt was an instance of the most extensive investigation which had yet been undertaken in geometry, though, to render it a complete solution of the problem, much more detail was doubtless necessary. The investigation is extended to the cases where the function, which remains the same, is of three, four, or five dimensions, and where the locus is a line of a higher order, though it may, in certain circumstances, become a conic section. The lines given in position may be more than four, or than any given number; and the lines drawn to them may either be perpendiculars, or lines making given angles with them. The same analysis applies to all the cases; and this problem, therefore, afforded an excellent example of the use of algebra in the investigation of geometrical propositions. The author takes notice of the unwillingness of the ancients to transfer the language of arithmetic into geometry, so that they were forced to have recourse to very circuitous methods of expressing those relations of quantity in which powers beyond the third are introduced. Indeed, to deliver investigation from those modes of expression which involve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of ratios, and to substitute in their room the multiplication of the numerical measures, is of itself a very great advantage, arising from the introduction of algebra into geometry.\n\nIn this book also, an ingenious method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> tangents to curves is proposed by Descartes, as following from his general principles; and it is an invention with which he appears to have been particularly pleased. He says, \"Nec verebor dicere, problema hoc non modo, eorum qua scio utilissimum et generalissimum esse, sed etiam eorum qua in geometria scire unquam desideraverim.\"\\(^2\\) This passage is not a little characteristic of Descartes, who was very much disposed to think well of what he had done himself, and even to suppose that it could not easily\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It will easily be perceived, that the word function is not contained in the original enunciation of the problem. It is a term but lately introduced into mathematical language, and affords here, as on many other occasions, a more general and more concise expression than could be otherwise obtained.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cartesi Geometria, p. 49.\nbe rendered more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a>. The truth, however, is, that his method of drawing tangents is extremely operose, and is one of those hasty views which, though ingenious and even profound, require to be vastly simplified, before they can be reduced to practice. Fermat, the rival and sometimes the superior of Descartes, was far more fortunate with regard to this problem, and his method of drawing tangents to curves is the same in effect that has been followed by all the geometers since his time; while that of Descartes, which could only be valued when the other was unknown, has been long since entirely abandoned. The remainder of the second book is occupied with the consideration of the curves, which have been called the Ovals of Descartes, and with some investigations concerning the centres of lenses; the whole indicating the hand of a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, and deserving the most diligent study of those who would become acquainted with this great enlargement of mathematical science.\n\nThe third book of the geometry treats of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of equations by geometric curves, and it also contains a new method of resolving biquadratic equations.\n\nThe leading principles of algebra were now unfolded, and the notation was brought, from a mere contrivance for abridging common language, to a system of symbolical writing, admirably fitted to assist the mind in the exercise of thought.\n\nThe happy idea, indeed, of expressing quantity, and the operations on quantity, by conventional symbols, instead of representing the first by real magnitudes, and enunciating the second in words, could not but make a great change on the nature of mathematical investigation. The language of Mathematics, whatever may be its form, must always consist of two parts; the one denoting quantities simply, and the other denoting the manner in which the quantities are combined, or the operations understood to be performed on them. Geometry expresses the first of these by real magnitudes, or by what may be called natural signs; a line by a line, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> by an angle, an area by an area, &c.; and it describes the latter by words. Algebra, on the other hand, denotes both quantity, and the operations on quantity, by the same system of conventional symbols. Thus, in the expression $x^3 - <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AX\">ax</a>^2 + bx = 0$, the letters $a$, $b$, $x$, denote quantities, but the terms $x^3$, $ax^2$, &c. denote certain operations performed on those quantities, as well as the quantities themselves; $x^3$ is the quantity $x$ raised to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>; and $ax^2$ the same quantity $x$ raised to the square, and then multiplied into $a$, &c.; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>, by addition or subtraction, being also expressed by the signs $+$ and $-$.\n\nNow, it is when applied to this latter purpose that the algebraic language possesses such exclusive excellence. The mere magnitudes themselves might be represented by figures, as in geometry, as well as in any way whatever; but the operations they are to be subjected to, if described in words, must be set before the mind slowly, and in succession, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> is weakened, and the clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> rendered difficult. In the algebraic expression, on the other hand, so much meaning is concentrated into a narrow space, and the impression made by all the parts is so simultaneous, that nothing can be more favourable to the exertion of the reasoning powers, to the continuance of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, and their security against error. Another advantage resulting from the use of the same notation, consists in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of all the different relations among quantities to the simplest of those relations, that of equality, and the expression of it by equations. This gives a great facility of generalization, and of comparing quantities with one another. A third arises from the substitution of the arithmetical operations of multiplication and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, for the geometrical method of the composition and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of ratios. Of the first of these, the idea is so clear, and the work so simple; of the second, the idea is comparatively so obscure, and the process so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a>, that the substitution of the former for the latter could not but be accompanied with great advantage. This is, indeed, what constitutes the great difference in practice between the algebraic and the geometric method of treating quantity. When the quantities are of a complex nature, so as to go beyond what in algebra is called the third power, the geometrical expression is so circuit-\nous and involved, that it renders the reasoning most laborious and intricate. The great facility of generalization in algebra, of deducing one thing from another, and of adapting the analysis to every kind of research, whether the quantities be constant or variable, finite or infinite, depends on this principle more than any other. Few of the early algebraists seem to have been aware of these advantages.\n\nThe use of the signs plus and minus has given rise to some dispute. These signs were at first used, the one to denote addition, the other subtraction, and for a long time were applied to no other purpose. But as, in the multiplication of a quantity, consisting of parts connected by those signs, into another quantity similarly composed, it was always found, and could be universally demonstrated, that, in uniting the particular products of which the total was made up, those of which both the factors had the sign minus before them, must be added into one sum with those of which all the factors had the sign plus, while those of which one of the factors had the sign plus, and the other the sign minus, must be subtracted from the same,\u2014this general rule came to be more simply expressed by saying, that in multiplication like signs gave plus, and that unlike signs gave minus.\n\nHence the signs plus and minus were considered, not as merely denoting the relation of one quantity to another placed before it, but, by a kind of fiction, they were considered as denoting qualities inherent in the quantities to the names of which they were prefixed. This fiction was found extremely useful, and it was evident that no error could arise from it. It was necessary to have a rule for determining the sign belonging to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a>, from the signs of the factors composing that product, independently of every other consideration; and this was precisely the purpose for which the above fiction was introduced. So necessary is this rule in the generalizations of algebra, that we meet with it in Diophantus, notwithstanding the imperfection of the language he employed; for he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, that $\\Delta\\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALPHA\">alpha</a>\\psi\\sigma$ into $\\Delta\\alpha\\psi\\sigma$ gives $\\gamma\\tau\\omega\\zeta\\sigma$, &c. The reduction, therefore, of the operations on quantity to an arithmetical form, necessarily involves this use of the signs plus or minus; that is, their application to denote something like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> qualities in the objects they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> together. The attempts to free algebra from this use of the signs have of course failed, and must ever do so, if we would preserve to that science the extent and facility of its operations.\n\nEven the most scrupulous purist in mathematical language must admit, that no real error is ever introduced by employing the signs in this most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>. If the equation $x^5 + px^2 + qx + r = 0$, be said to have one positive and two negative roots, this is certainly as exceptionable an application of the term negative as any that can be proposed; yet, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>, it means nothing but this intelligible and simple truth, that $x^5 + px^2 + qx + r = (x - a)(x + b)(x + c)$; or that the former of these quantities is produced by the multiplication of the three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BINOMIAL\">binomial</a> factors, $x - a$, $x + b$, $x + c$. We might say the same nearly as to imaginary roots: they show that the simple factors cannot be found, but that the quadratic factors may be found; and they also point out the means of discovering them.\n\nThe aptitude of these same signs to denote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">contrariety</a> of position among geometric magnitudes, makes the foregoing application of them infinitely more extensive and more indispensable.\n\nFrom the same source arises the great simplicity introduced into many of the theorems and rules of the mathematical sciences. Thus, the rule for finding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> of a place from the sun's meridian altitude, if we employ the signs plus and minus for indicating the position of the sun and of the place relatively to the equator, is enunciated in one simple proposition, which includes every case, without any thing either complex or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMBIGUOUS\">ambiguous</a>. But if this is not done,\u2014if the signs plus and minus are not employed, there must be at least two rules; one when the sun and place are on the same side of the equator, and another when they are on different sides. In the more complicated calculations of spherical trigonometry, this holds still more remarkably. When one would accommodate such rules to those who are unacquainted with the use of the algebraic signs, they are perhaps not to be expressed in less than four, or even six\ndifferent propositions; whereas, if the use of these signs is supposed, the whole is comprehended in a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>. In such cases, it is obvious that both the memory and understanding derive great advantage from the use of the signs, and profit by a simplification, which is the work entirely of the algebraic language, and cannot be imitated by any other.\n\nThat I might not interrupt the view of improvements so closely connected with one another, I have passed over one of the discoveries, which does the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to the seventeenth century, and which took place near the beginning of it.\n\nAs the accuracy of astronomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> had been continually advancing, it was necessary that the correctness of trigonometrical calculation, and of course its difficulty, should advance in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>. The signs and tangents of angles could not be expressed with sufficient correctness without decimal fractions, extending to five or six places below unity; and when to three such numbers a fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> was to be found, the work of multiplication and division became extremely laborious. Accordingly, in the end of the sixteenth century, the time and labour consumed in such calculations had become excessive, and were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> as extremely burdensome by the mathematicians and astronomers all over Europe. Napier of Merchiston, whose mind seems to have been peculiarly turned to arithmetical researches, and who was also devoted to the study of astronomy, had early sought for the means of relieving himself and others from this difficulty. He had viewed the subject in a variety of lights, and a number of ingenious devices had occurred to him, by which the tediousness of arithmetical operations might, more or less completely, be avoided. In the course of these attempts, he did not fail to observe, that whenever the numbers to be multiplied or divided were terms of a geometrical progression, the product or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUOTIENT\">quotient</a> must also be a term of that progression, and must occupy a place in it pointed out by the places of the given numbers, so that it might be found from mere inspection, if the progression were far enough continued. If, for instance, the third term of the progression were to be multiplied by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a>, the product must be the tenth; and if the twelfth were to be divided by the fourth, the quotient must be the eighth; so that the multiplication and division of such terms was reduced to the addition and subtraction of the numbers which indicated their places in the progression.\n\nThis observation, or one very similar to it, was made by Archimedes, and was employed by that great geometer to convey an idea of a number too vast to be correctly expressed by the arithmetical notation of the Greeks. Thus far, however, there was no difficulty; and the discovery might certainly have been made by men much inferior either to Napier or Archimedes. What remained to be done, what Archimedes did not attempt, and what Napier completely performed, involved two great difficulties. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, that the resource of the geometrical progression was sufficient, when the given numbers were terms of that progression; but if they were not, it did not seem that any advantage could be derived from it. Napier, however, perceived, and it was by no means obvious, that all numbers whatsoever might be inserted in the progression, and have their places assigned in it. After conceiving the possibility of this, the next difficulty was, to discover the principle, and to execute the arithmetical process, by which these places were to be ascertained. It is in these two points that the peculiar merit of his invention consists; and at a period when the nature of series, and when every other resource of which he could avail himself, were so little known, his success argues a depth and originality of thought which, I am persuaded, have rarely been surpassed.\n\nThe way in which he satisfied himself that all numbers might be intercalated between the terms of the given progression, and by which he found the places they must occupy, was founded on a most ingenious supposition; that of two points describing two different lines, the one with a constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>, and the other with a velocity always increasing in the ratio of the space the point had already gone over: the first of these would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> magnitudes in arithmetical, and the second magnitudes in geometrical progression. It is plain, that all numbers whatsoever would find their places among the magnitudes so gene-\nrated; and, indeed, this view of the subject is as simple and profound as any which, after two hundred years, has yet presented itself to mathematicians. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of deducing the results has been simplified; but it can hardly be said that the principle has been more clearly developed.\n\nI need not observe, that the numbers which indicate the places of the terms of the geometrical progression are called by Napier the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a> of those terms.\n\nVarious systems of logarithms, it is evident, may be constructed according to the geometrical progression assumed; and of these, that which was first contrived by Napier, though the simplest, and the foundation of the rest, was not so convenient for the purposes of calculation, as one which soon afterwards occurred, both to himself and his friend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIGGS\">Briggs</a>, by whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> calculation was performed. The new system of logarithms was an improvement, practically considered; but in as far as it was connected with the principle of the invention, it is only of secondary consideration. The original tables had been also somewhat embarrassed by too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> a connection between them and trigonometry. The new tables were free from this inconvenience.\n\nIt is probable, however, that the greatest inventor in science was never able to do more than to accelerate the progress of discovery, and to anticipate what time, \"the author of authors,\" would have gradually brought to light. Though logarithms had not been invented by Napier, they would have been discovered in the progress of the algebraic analysis, when the arithmetic of powers and exponents, both integral and fractional, came to be fully understood. The idea of considering all numbers as powers of one given number would then have readily occurred, and the doctrine of series would have greatly facilitated the calculations which it was necessary to undertake. Napier had none of these advantages, and they were all supplied by the resources of his own mind. Indeed, as there never was any invention for which the state of knowledge had less prepared the way, there never was anywhere more merit fell to the share of the inventor.\n\nHis good fortune, also, not less than his great sagacity, may be remarked. Had the invention of logarithms been delayed to the end of the seventeenth century, it would have come about without effort, and would not have conferred on the author the high celebrity which Napier so justly derives from it. In another respect he has also been fortunate. Many inventions have been eclipsed or obscured by new discoveries; or they have been so altered by subsequent improvements, that their original form can hardly be recognised, and, in some instances, has been entirely forgotten. This has almost always happened to the discoveries made at an early period in the progress of science, and before their principles were fully unfolded. It has been quite otherwise with the invention of logarithms, which came out of the hands of the author so perfect, that it has never received but one material improvement,\u2014that which it derived, as has just been said, from the ingenuity of his friend in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> with his own. Subsequent improvements in science, instead of offering anything that could supplant this invention, have only enlarged the circle to which its utility extended. Logarithms have been applied to numberless purposes, which were not thought of at the time of their first construction. Even the sagacity of their author did not see the immense fertility of the principle he had discovered: he calculated his tables merely to facilitate arithmetical, and chiefly trigonometrical computation; and little imagined that he was at the same time constructing a scale whereon to measure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, and the heights of mountains; that he was actually computing the areas and the lengths of innumerable curves, and was preparing for a calculus which was yet to be discovered, many of the most refined and most valuable of its resources. Of Napier, therefore, if of any man, it may safely be pronounced, that his name will never be eclipsed by any one more conspicuous, or his invention superseded by any thing more valuable.\n\nAs a geometrician, Napier has left behind him a noble monument in the two trigonometrical theorems, which are known by his name, and which appear first to have been communicated\nin writing to Cavalleri, who has mentioned them with great eulogy.\\(^1\\) They are theorems not a little difficult, and of much use, as being particularly adapted to logarithmic calculation. They were published in the *Canon Mirificus Logarithmorum*, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, in 1614.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n**SECTION II.**\n\n**EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION.**\n\nIn this section I shall begin with a short view of the state of Physical Knowledge before the introduction of the Inductive Method; I shall next endeavour to explain that method by an analysis of the *Novum Organum*; and shall then inquire how far the principles established in that work have actually contributed to the advancement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>.\n\n---\n\n**1. ANCIENT PHYSICS.**\n\nThough the phenomena of the material world could not but early excite the curiosity of a being who, like man, receives his strongest impressions from without, yet an accurate knowledge of those phenomena, and their laws, was not to be speedily acquired. The mere extent and variety of the objects were, indeed, such obstacles to that acquisition, as could not be surmounted but in the course of many ages. Man could not at first perceive from what point he must begin his inquiries, in what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> he must carry them on, or by what rules he must be guided. He was like a traveller going forth to explore a vast and unknown wilderness, in which a multitude of great and interesting objects presented themselves on every side, while there was no path for him to follow, no rule to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> his survey, and where the art of observing, and the instruments of observation, must equally be the work of his own invention. In these circumstances, the selection of the objects to be studied was the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a> rather than of reason, or of the passions and emotions, more than of the understanding. When things new, and unlike those which occurred in the course of every day's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, presented themselves, they excited wonder or surprise, and created an anxiety to discover some principle which might connect them with the appearances commonly observed. About these last, men felt no desire to be further informed; but when the common order of things was violated, and something new or singular was produced, they began to examine into the fact, and attempted to inquire into the cause. Nobody sought to know why a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> fell to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, why <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> ascended, or why the stars revolved round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. But if a fiery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METEOR\">meteor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> across the heavens,\u2014if the flames of a volcano burst forth,\u2014or if an earthquake shook the foundations of the world, terror and curiosity were both awakened; and when the former emotion had subsided, the latter was sure to become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>. Thus, to trace a resemblance between the events with which the observer was most familiar, and those to which he was less accustomed, and which had excited his wonder, was the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of inquiry, and produced the first advances towards generalization and philosophy.\\(^3\\)\n\nThis principle, which it were easy to trace,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Wallis, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OPERA\">Opera</a> Math.*, tom.

See *Scriptores Logarithmitici*, 4to. vol. VI. p. 475.\n\n\\(^3\\) La maraviglia Dell' ignoranza \u00e8 la figlia, E del sapere La madre.\nfrom tribes the most rude and barbarous, to nations the most highly refined, was what yielded the first attempts toward classification and arrangement, and enabled man, out of individuals subject to perpetual change, to form certain fixed and permanent objects of knowledge,\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, genera, orders, and classes, into which he has distributed these individuals. By this effort of mental abstraction, he has created to himself a new and intellectual world, free from those changes and vicissitudes to which all material things are destined. This, too, is a work not peculiar to the philosopher, but, in a certain degree, is performed by every man who compares one thing with another, and who employs the terms of ordinary language.\n\nAnother great branch of knowledge is occupied, not about the mere arrangement and classification of objects, but about events or changes, the laws which those changes observe, and the causes by which they are produced. In a science which treated of events and of change, the nature and properties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> came of course to be studied, and the ancient philosophers naturally enough began their inquiries with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of motion, or the determination of that in which it consists. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>'s definition is highly characteristic of the vagueness and obscurity of his physical speculations. He calls motion \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of a being in power, as far as in power;\" words to which it is impossible that any distinct idea can ever have been annexed.\n\nThe truth is, however, that the best definition of motion can be of very little service in Physics. Epicurus defined it to be the \"change of place,\" which is, no doubt, the simplest and best definition that can be given; but it must, at the same time, be confessed, that neither he, nor the moderns who have retained his definition, have derived the least advantage from it in their subsequent researches. The properties, or, as they are called, the laws of motion, cannot be derived from mere definition; they must be sought for in experience and observation, and are not to be found without a diligent comparison, and scrupulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of facts. Of such an examination, neither Aristotle, nor any other of the ancients, ever conceived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>; and hence those laws remained quite unknown throughout all antiquity.\n\nWhen the laws of motion were unknown, the other parts of Natural Philosophy could make no great advances. Instead of conceiving that there resides in body a natural and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> tendency to persevere in the same state, whether of rest or of motion, they believed that terrestrial bodies tended naturally either to fall to the ground, or to ascend from it, till they attained their own place; but that, if they were impelled by an oblique force, then their motion became unnatural or violent, and tended continually to decay. With the heavenly bodies, again, the natural motion was circular and uniform, eternal in its course, but perpetually varying in its direction. Thus, by the distinction between natural and violent motion among the bodies of the earth, and the distinction between what we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> the laws of motion in terrestrial and celestial bodies, the ancients threw into all their reasonings upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> subject a confusion and perplexity, from which their philosophy never was delivered.\n\nThere was, however, one part of physical knowledge in which their endeavours were attended with much better success, and in which they made important discoveries. This was in the branch of mechanics which treats of the action of forces in equilibrium, and producing not motion but rest; a subject which may be understood, though the laws of motion are unknown.\n\nThe first writer on this subject is Archimedes. He treated of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a>, and of the centre of gravity; and has shown that there will be an equilibrium between two heavy bodies connected by an inflexible rod or lever, when the point in which the lever is supported is so placed between the bodies, that their distances from it are inversely as their weights. Great ingenuity is displayed in this demonstration; and it is remarkable, that the author borrows no principle from experiment, but establishes his conclusion entirely by reasoning a priori. He assumes, indeed, that equal bodies, at the ends of the equal arms of a lever, will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> one another; and also, that a cylinder, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARALLELOPIPED\">parallelopiped</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOMOGENEOUS\">homogeneous</a> matter, will be balanced about its centre of magnitude. These, however, are not inferences\nfrom experience; they are, properly speaking, conclusions deduced from the principle of the sufficient reason.\n\nThe same great geometer gave a beginning to the science of hydrostatics, and discovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> which determines the loss of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> sustained by a body on being immersed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, or in any other fluid. His demonstration rests on a principle, which he lays down as a postulatum, that, in water, the parts which are less pressed are always ready to yield in any direction to those that are more pressed; and from this, by the application of mathematical reasoning, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of floating bodies is derived. The above is the same principle on which the modern writers on hydrostatics proceed; they give it, not as a postulatum, but as constituting the definition of a fluid.\n\nArchimedes, therefore, is the person who first made the application of Mathematics to Natural Philosophy. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>, perhaps, ever laid the foundation of more great discoveries than that geometer, of whom Wallis has said with so much truth, \"Vir stupende sagacitatis, qui prima fundamenta posuit inventionum fere omnium, in quibus promovendis retas nostra gloriarunt.\"\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> inquiries, begun by the geometer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>, were extended by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CTESIBIUS\">Ctesibius</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HERO\">Hero</a>; by Anthemius of Tralles; and, lastly, by Pappus Alexandrinus. Ctesibius and Hero were the first who analyzed mechanical engines, reducing them all to combinations of five simple mechanical contrivances, to which they gave the name of \u0394\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, or Powers, the same which they retain at the present moment.\n\nEven in mechanics, however, the success of these investigations was limited; and failed in those cases where the resolution of forces is necessary, that principle being then entirely unknown. Hence the force necessary to sustain a body on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol9.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined plane</a>, is incorrectly determined by Pappus, and serves to mark a point to which the mechanical theories of antiquity did not extend.\n\nIn another department of physical knowledge, astronomy, the endeavours of the ancients were also accompanied with success. I do not here speak of their astronomical theories, which were, indeed, very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a>, but of their discovery of the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies, from the observations begun by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HIPPARCHUS\">Hipparchus</a>, and continued by Ptolemy. In this their success was great; and while the earth was supposed to be at rest, and while the instruments of observation had but a very limited degree of accuracy, a nearer approach to the truth was probably not within the power of human ingenuity. Mathematical reasoning was very skilfully applied; and no men whatever, in the same circumstances, are likely to have performed more than the ancient astronomers. They succeeded, because they were observers, and examined carefully the motions which they treated of. The philosophers, again, who studied the motion of terrestrial bodies, either did not observe at all, or observed so slightly, that they could obtain no accurate knowledge; and in general they knew just enough of the facts to be misled by them.\n\nThe opposite ways which the ancients thus took to study the Heavens and the Earth, observing the one, and dreaming, as one may say, over the other, though a striking inconsistency, is not difficult to be explained.\n\nNo information at all could be obtained in astronomy, without regular and assiduous observation, and without instruments capable of measuring angles, and of measuring time, either directly or indirectly. The steadiness and regularity of the celestial motions seemed to invite the most scrupulous attention. On the other hand, as terrestrial objects were always at hand, and spontaneously falling under men's view, it seemed unnecessary to take much trouble to become acquainted with them; and as for applying measures, their irregularity appeared to render every idea of such proceeding nugatory. The Aristotelian philosophy particularly favoured this prejudice, by representing the earth, and all things on its surface, as full of irregularity and confusion, while the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, dryness and moisture, were in a state of perpetual warfare. The unfortunate division of motion into natural and violent, and the distinction, still more unfortunate, between the properties of motion and of body, in the heavens and on the earth, prevented all intercourse between the astronomer and the naturalist, and all trans-\nference of the maxims of the one to the speculations of the other.\n\nThough, on account of this inattention to experiment, nothing like the true system of Natural Philosophy was known to the ancients, there are, nevertheless, to be found in their writings many brilliant conceptions, several fortunate conjectures, and gleams of the light which was afterwards to be so generally diffused.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANAXAGORAS\">Anaxagoras</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEDOCLES\">Empedocles</a>, for example, taught that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> shines by light borrowed from the sun, and were led to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, not only from the phases of the moon, but from its light being weak, and unaccompanied by heat. That it was a habitable body, like the earth, appears to be a doctrine as old as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORPHEUS\">Orpheus</a>; some lines, ascribed to that poet, representing the moon as an earth, with mountains and cities on its surface.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMOCRITUS\">Democritus</a> supposed the spots on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the moon to arise from the inequalities of the surface, and from the shadows of the more elevated parts projected on the plains. Every one knows how conformable this is to the discoveries made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a> considers the velocity of the moon's motion as the cause which prevents that body from falling to the earth, just as the motion of a stone in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SLING\">sling</a> prevents it from falling to the ground. The comparison is, in a certain degree, just, and clearly implies the notion of centrifugal force; and gravity may also be considered as pointed at for the cause which gives the moon a tendency to the earth. Here, therefore, a foundation was laid for the true philosophy of the celestial motions; but it was laid without effect. It was merely the conjecture of an ingenious mind, wandering through the regions of possibility, guided by no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, and having no principle which could give stability to its opinions. Democritus, and the authors of that physical system which Lucretius has so beautifully illustrated, were still more fortunate in some of their conjectures. They taught that the Milky Way is the light of a great number of small stars, very close to one another; a magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, which the latest improvements of the telescope have fully verified. Yet, as if to convince us that they derived this knowledge from no pure or certain source, the same philosophers maintained, that the sun and the moon are bodies no larger than they appear to us to be.\n\nVery just notions concerning comets were entertained by some of the ancients. The Chaldeans considered those bodies as belonging to the same order with the planets; and this was also the opinion of Anaxagoras, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>, and Democritus. The remark of Seneca on this subject is truly philosophical, and contains a prediction which has been fully accomplished: \"Why do we wonder that comets, which are so rare a spectacle in the world, observe laws which to us are yet unknown, and that the beginning and end of motions, so seldom observed, are not yet fully understood?\"\u2014Veniet tempus, quo ista quae nunc latent, in lucem dies extrahat, et longioris \u00e6vi diligentia: ad inquisitionem tantorum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATLAS\">atlas</a> una non sufficit. Veniet tempus, quo posteri nostri tam aperta nos nescisse mirentur.\n\nIt was, however, often the fate of such truths to give way to error. The comets, which these ancient philosophers had ranked so justly with the stars, were degraded by Aristotle into meteors floating in the earth's atmosphere; and this was the opinion concerning them which ultimately prevailed.\n\nBut, notwithstanding the above, and a few other splendid conceptions which shine through the obscurity of the ancient Physics, the system, taken on the whole, was full of error and inconsistency. Truth and falsehood met almost on terms of equality; the former, separated from its root, experience, found no preference above the latter; to the latter, in fact, it was generally forced to give way, and the dominion of error was finally established.\n\nOne ought to listen, therefore, with caution to the encomiums sometimes bestowed on the philosophy of those early ages. If these encomiums respected only the talents, the genius, the taste of the great masters of antiquity, we would subscribe to them without any apprehen-\n\n1 Nat. Qu\u00e6st. lib. vii. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. xxv.\nsion of going beyond the truth. But if they extend to the methods of philosophizing, and the discoveries actually made, we must be excused for entering our dissent, and exchanging the language of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a> for that of apology. The infancy of science could not be the time when its attainments were the highest; and before we suffer ourselves to be guided by the veneration of antiquity, we ought to consider in what real antiquity consists. With regard to the progress of knowledge and improvement, \"we are more ancient than those who went before us.\"1\n\nThe human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RACE\">race</a> has now more experience than in the generations that are past, and of course may be expected to have made higher attainments in science and philosophy. Compared with Natural Philosophy, as it now exists, the ancient Physics are rude and imperfect. The speculations contained in them are vague and unsatisfactory, and of little value, but as they elucidate the history of the errors and illusions to which the human mind is subject. Science was not merely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, but often retrograde; the earliest opinions were frequently the best; and the reasonings of Democritus and Anaxagoras were in many instances more solid than those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> and Aristotle. Extreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a> disgraced the speculations of men who, however ingenious, were little acquainted with the laws of nature, and unprovided with the great criterion by which the evidence of testimony can alone be examined. Though observations were sometimes made, experiments were never instituted; and philosophers who were little attentive to the facts which spontaneously offered, did not seek to increase their number by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> combinations. Experience, in those ages, was a light which darted a few tremulous and uncertain rays on some small portions of the field of science; but men had not acquired the power over that light which now enables them to concentrate its beams, and to fix them steadily on whatever object they wish to examine. This power is what distinguishes the modern Physics, and is the cause why later philosophers, without being more ingenious than their predecessors, have been infinitely more successful in the study of nature.\n\n2. NOVUM ORGANUM.\n\nThe defects which have been ascribed to the ancient Physics were not likely to be corrected in the course of the middle ages. It is true, that during those ages a science of pure experiment had made its appearance in the world, and might have been expected to remedy the greatest of these defects, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the attention of philosophers to experience and observation. This effect, however, was far from being immediately produced; and none who professed to be in search of truth ever wandered over the regions of fancy, in paths more devious and eccentric, than the first experimenters in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>. They had become acquainted with a series of facts so unlike to any thing already known, that the ordinary principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> were shaken or subverted, and the mind laid open to a degree of credulity far beyond any with which the philosophers of antiquity could be reproached. An unlooked-for extension of human power had taken place; its limits were yet unknown; and the boundary between the possible and the impossible was no longer to be distinguished. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ADVENTURERS\">adventurers</a> in an unexplored country, given up to the guidance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, pursued objects which the kindness, no less than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of nature, has rendered unattainable by man; and in their speculations peopled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, the earth, and all the elements, with spirits and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENII\">genii</a>, the invisible agents destined to connect together all the facts which they knew, and all those which they hoped to discover. Chemistry, in this state, might be said to have an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELECTIVE\">elective</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> for all that was most absurd and extravagant in the other parts of knowledge; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALCHEMY\">alchemy</a> was its immediate offspring, and it allied itself in succession with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CABALISTS\">Cabalists</a>, the Rosicrucians, and the Theosophers. Thus a science, founded in experiment, and destined one day to afford\n\n1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>.\nsuch noble examples of its use, exhibited for several ages little else than a series of illusory pursuits, or visionary speculations, while now and then a fact was accidentally discovered.\n\nUnder the influence of these circumstances arose Paracelsus, Van Helmont, Fludd, Cardan, and several others, conspicuous no less for the weakness than the force of their understandings; men who united extreme credulity, the most extravagant pretensions, and the most excessive vanity, with considerable powers of invention, a complete contempt for authority, and a desire to consult experience; but destitute of the judgment, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, and comprehensive views, without which the responses of that oracle are never to be understood. Though they appealed to experience, and disclaimed subjection to the old legislators of science, they were in too great haste to become legislators themselves, and to deduce an explanation of the whole phenomena of nature from a few facts, observed without accuracy, arranged without skill, and never compared or confronted with one another. Fortunately, however, from the turn which their inquiries had taken, the ill done by them has passed away, and the good has become permanent. The reveries of Paracelsus have disappeared, but his application of Chemistry to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHARMACY\">Pharmacy</a> has conferred a lasting benefit on the world. The Archaus of Van Helmont, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of spiritual agents with which the discovery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluids had filled the imagination of that celebrated empiric, are laughed at, or forgotten; but the fluids which he had the sagacity to distinguish, form, at the present moment, the connecting principles of the new Chemistry.\n\nEarlier than any of the authors just named, but in a great measure under the influence of the same delusions, Roger Bacon appears to have been more fully aware than any of them of the use of experiment, and of mathematical reasoning, in physical and mechanical inquiries. But, in the thirteenth century, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> from the authority of the schools, even to nature herself, could not be made with impunity. Bacon, accordingly, incurred the displeasure both of the University and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a>; and this forms one of his claims to the respect of posterity, as it is but fair to consider <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> inflicted by the ignorant and bigoted as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to praise bestowed by the liberal and enlightened.\n\nMuch more recently, Gilbert, in his treatise on the Magnet, had given an example of an experimental inquiry, carried on with more correctness, and more enlarged views, than had been done by any of his predecessors. Nevertheless, in the end of the sixteenth century, it might still be affirmed, that the situation of the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AVENUE\">avenue</a> to knowledge was fully understood by none, and that its existence, to the bulk of philosophers, was utterly unknown.\n\nIt was about this time that Francis Bacon (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Verulam) began to turn his powerful and creative mind to contemplate the state of human knowledge, to mark its imperfections, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> its improvement. One of the considerations which appears to have impressed his mind most forcibly, was the vagueness and uncertainty of all the physical speculations then existing, and the entire want of connection between the sciences and the arts.\n\nThough these two things are in their nature so closely united, that the same truth which is a principle in science becomes a rule in art, yet there was at that time hardly any practical improvement which had arisen from a theoretical discovery. The natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> between the knowledge and the power of man seemed entirely interrupted; nothing was to be seen of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> support which they ought to afford to one another; the improvement of art was left to the slow and precarious operation of chance, and that of science to the collision of opposite opinions.\n\n\"But whence,\" said Bacon, \"can arise such vagueness and sterility in all the physical systems which have hitherto existed in the world? It is not certainly from any thing in nature itself; for the steadiness and regularity of the laws by which it is governed, clearly mark them out as objects of certain and precise knowledge. Neither can it arise from any want of ability in those who have pursued such inquiries, many of whom have been men of the highest talent and genius of the ages in which they lived; and it can, therefore, arise from nothing else but the perverseness and insufficiency of the methods\nthat have been pursued. Men have sought to make a world from their own conceptions, and to draw from their own minds all the materials which they employed; but if, instead of doing so, they had consulted experience and observation, they would have had facts, and not opinions, to reason about, and might have ultimately arrived at the knowledge of the laws which govern the material world.\"\n\n\"As things are at present conducted,\" he adds, \"a sudden transition is made from sensible objects and particular facts to general propositions, which are accounted principles, and round which, as round so many fixed poles, disputation and argument continually revolve. From the propositions thus hastily assumed, all things are derived, by a process compendious and precipitate, ill suited to discovery, but wonderfully accommodated to debate. The way that promises success is the reverse of this. It requires that we should generalize slowly, going from particular things to those that are but one step more general; from those to others of still greater extent, and so on to such as are universal. By such means, we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> to arrive at principles, not vague and obscure, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> and well defined, such as nature herself will not refuse to acknowledge.\"\n\nBefore laying down the rules to be observed in this inductive process, Bacon proceeds to enumerate the causes of error,\u2014the Idols, as he terms them, in his figurative language, or false divinities, to which the mind had so long been accustomed to bow. He considered this enumeration as the more necessary, that the same idols were likely to return, even after the reformation of science, and to avail themselves of the real discoveries that might have been made, for giving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> to their deceptions.\n\nThese idols he divides into four classes, to which he gives names, fantastical, no doubt, but, at the same time, abundantly significant:\n\n- **Idola Tribus**, Idols of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBE\">Tribe</a>;\n- **Specus**, Idols of the Den;\n- **Fori**, Idols of the Forum;\n- **Theatri**, Idols of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEATRE\">Theatre</a>.\n\n1. The *Idols of the Tribe*, or of the race, are the causes of error founded on human nature in general, or on principles common to all mankind. \"The mind,\" he observes, \"is not like a plain mirror, which reflects the images of things exactly as they are; it is like a mirror of an uneven surface, which combines its own figure with the figures of the object it represents.\"\u00b9\n\nAmong the idols of this class, we may reckon the propensity which there is in all men to find in nature a greater degree of order, simplicity, and regularity, than is actually indicated by observation. Thus, as soon as men perceived the orbits of the planets to return into themselves, they immediately supposed them to be perfect circles, and the motion in those circles to be uniform; and to these hypotheses, so rashly and gratuitously assumed, the astronomers and mathematicians of all antiquity laboured incessantly to reconcile their observations.\n\nThe propensity which Bacon has here characterized so well, is the same that has been, since his time, known by the name of the *spirit of system*. The prediction, that the sources of error would return, and were likely to infest science in its most flourishing condition, has been fully verified with respect to this illusion, and in the case of sciences which had no existence at the time when Bacon wrote. When it was ascertained, by observation, that a considerable part of the earth's surface consists of minerals, disposed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> strata, it was immediately concluded, that the whole exterior crust of the earth is composed, or has been composed, of such strata, continued all round without interruption; and on this, as on a certain and general fact, entire theories of the earth have been constructed.\n\nThere is no greater enemy which science has to struggle with than this propensity of the mind; and it is a struggle from which science is never likely to be entirely relieved; because, unfortunately, the illusion is founded on the same principle from which our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of knowledge takes its rise.\n\n2. The *Idols of the Den* are those that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 *Novum Organum*, lib. i. aph. 41.\nfrom the peculiar character of the individual. Besides the causes of error which are common to all mankind, each individual, according to Bacon, has his own dark cavern or den, into which the light is imperfectly admitted, and in the obscurity of which a tutelary idol lurks, at whose shrine the truth is often sacrificed.\n\nOne great and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RADICAL\">radical</a> distinction in the capacities of men is derived from this, that some minds are best adapted to mark the differences, others to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> the resemblances, of things. Steady and profound understandings are disposed to attend carefully, to proceed slowly, and to examine the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> differences; while those that are sublime and active are ready to lay hold of the slightest resemblances. Each of these easily runs into excess; the one by catching continually at distinctions, the other at affinities.\n\nThe studies, also, to which a man is addicted, have a great effect in influencing his opinions. Bacon complains, that the chemists of his time, from a few experiments with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a> and the crucible, thought that they were furnished with principles sufficient to explain the structure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>; and he censures Aristotle for having depraved his Physics so much with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIALECTICS\">Dialectics</a>, as to render the former entirely a science of words and controversy. In like manner, he blames a philosopher of his own age, Gilbert, who had studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a> to good purpose, for having proceeded to form out of it a general system of philosophy. Such things have occurred in every period of science. Thus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> has been applied to explain the motion of the heavenly bodies; and, of late, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol9.html#article-GALVANISM\">galvanism</a> and electricity together have been held out as explaining not only the affinities of Chemistry, but the phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>, and the laws of vegetable and animal life. It were a good caution for a man who studies nature, to distrust those things with which he is particularly conversant, and which he is accustomed to contemplate with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>.\n\n3. The Idols of the Forum are those that arise out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> or intercourse of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, and especially from language, or the means by which men communicate their thoughts to one another.\n\nMen believe that their thoughts govern their words; but it also happens, by a certain kind of reaction, that their words frequently govern their thoughts. This is the more pernicious, that words, being generally the work of the multitude, divide things according to the lines most conspicuous to vulgar apprehensions. Hence, when words are examined, few instances are found in which, if at all abstract, they convey ideas tolerably precise and well defined. For such imperfections there seems to be no remedy, but by having recourse to particular instances, and diligently comparing the meanings of words with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> archetypes from which they are derived.\n\n4. The Idols of the Theatre are the last, and are the deceptions which have taken their rise from the systems or dogmas of the different schools of philosophy. In the opinion of Bacon, as many of these systems as had been invented, so many representations of imaginary worlds had been brought upon the stage. Hence the name of idola theatri. They do not enter the mind imperceptibly, like the other three; a man must labour to acquire them, and they are often the result of great learning and study.\n\n\"Philosophy,\" said he, \"as hitherto pursued, has taken much from a few things, or a little from a great many; and, in both cases, has too narrow a basis to be of much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> or utility.\" The Aristotelian philosophy is of the latter kind; it has taken its principles from common experience, but without due attention to the evidence or the precise nature of the facts; the philosopher is left to work out the rest from his own invention. Of this kind, called by Bacon the sophistical, were almost all the physical systems of antiquity.\n\nWhen philosophy takes all its principles from a few facts, he calls it empirical,\u2014such as was that of Gilbert, and of the chemists.\n\nIt should be observed, that Bacon does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> the Physics of antiquity with being absolutely regardless of experiment. No system, indeed, however fantastical, has ever existed, to which that reproach could be applied in its full extent; because, without some regard to fact, no theory can ever become in the least degree plausible. The fault lies not, therefore, in the\nabsolute rejection of experience, but in the unskilful use of it; in taking up principles lightly from an inaccurate and careless observation of many things; or, if the observations have been more accurate, from those made on a few facts, unwarrantably generalized.\n\nBacon proceeds to point out the circumstances, in the history of the world, which had hitherto favoured these perverse modes of philosophizing. He observes, that the periods during which science had been cultivated were not many, nor of long duration. They might be reduced to three; the first with the Greeks; the second with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>; and the third with the western nations, after the revival of letters. In none of all these periods had much attention been paid to Natural Philosophy, the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> of the sciences.\n\nWith the Greeks, the time was very short during which physical science flourished in any degree. The seven Sages, with the exception of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THALES\">Thales</a>, applied themselves entirely to morals and politics; and in later times, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a> had brought down philosophy from the heavens to the earth, the study of nature was generally abandoned. In the Roman republic, the knowledge most cultivated, as might be expected among a martial and ambitious people, was such as had a direct reference to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAR\">war</a> and politics. During the empire, the introduction and establishment of the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> drew the attention of men to theological studies, and the important interests which were then at stake left but a small share of talent and ability to be occupied in inferior pursuits. The vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HIERARCHY\">hierarchy</a> which assumed the command both of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCEPTRE\">sceptre</a>, while it occupied and enslaved the minds of men, looked with suspicion on sciences which could not easily be subjected to its control.\n\nAt the time, therefore, when Bacon wrote, it might truly be said, that a small portion even of the learned ages, and of the abilities of learned men, had been dedicated to the study of Natural Philosophy. This served, in his opinion, to account for the imperfect state in which he found human knowledge in general; for he thought it certain, that no part of knowledge could attain much excellence without having its foundation laid in physical science.\n\nHe goes on to observe, that the end and object of knowledge had been very generally mistaken; that many, instead of seeking through it to improve the condition of human life, by new inventions and new resources, had aimed only at popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a>, and had satisfied themselves with the knowledge of words more than of things; while others, who were exceptions to this rule, had gone still farther wrong, by directing their pursuits to objects imaginary and unattainable. The alchemists, for example, alternately the dupes of their own credulity and of their own imposture, had amazed and tormented the world with hopes which were never to be realized. Others, if possible more visionary, had promised to prolong life, to extinguish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> and infirmity, and to give man a command over the world of spirits, by means of mystic incantations. \"All this,\" says he, \"is the mere boasting of ignorance; for, when the knowledge of nature shall be rightly pursued, it will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to discoveries that will as far excel the pretended powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a>, as the real exploits of Cesar and Alexander exceed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a> adventures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, or Amadis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>.\"\n\nAgain, the reverence for antiquity, and the authority of great names, have contributed much to retard the progress of science. Indeed, the notion of antiquity which men have taken up seems to be erroneous and inconsistent. It is the duration of the world, or of the human race, as reckoned from the extremity that is past, and not from the point of time which is present, that constitutes the true antiquity to which the advancement of science may be conceived to bear some proportion; and just as we expect more wisdom and experience in an old than in a young man, we may expect more knowledge of nature from the present than from any of the ages that are past.\n\n\"It is not to be esteemed a small matter in this estimate, that, by the voyages and travels of these later times, so much more of nature has\nbeen discovered than was known at any former period. It would, indeed, be disgraceful to mankind, if, after such tracts of the material world have been laid open, which were unknown in former times,\u2014so many seas traversed,\u2014so many countries explored,\u2014so many stars discovered,\u2014philosophy, or the intelligible world, should be circumscribed by the same boundaries as before.\"\n\nAnother cause has greatly obstructed the progress of philosophy, viz. that men inquire only into the causes of rare, extraordinary, and great phenomena, without troubling themselves about the explanation of such as are common, and make a part of the general course of nature. It is, however, certain, that no judgment can be formed concerning the extraordinary and singular phenomena of nature, without comparing them with those that are ordinary and frequent.\n\nThe laws which are every day in action, are those which it is most important for us to understand; and this is well illustrated by what has happened in the scientific world since the time when Bacon wrote. The simple falling of a stone to the ground has been found to involve principles which are the basis of all we know in mechanical philosophy. Without accurate experiments on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of bodies at the surface of the earth, the objections against the earth's motion could not have been answered, the inertia of body would have remained unknown, and the nature of the force which retains the planets in their orbits could never have been investigated. Nothing, therefore, can be more out of its place than the fastidiousness of those philosophers who suppose things to be unworthy of study, because, with respect to ordinary life, they are trivial and unimportant. It is an error of the same sort which leads men to consider experiment, and the actual application of the hands, as unworthy of them, and unbecoming the dignity of science. \"There are some,\" says Bacon, \"who, delighting in mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>, are offended with our frequent reference to experiments and operations to be performed by the hand, things which appear to them mean and mechanical; but these men do in fact oppose the attainment of the object they profess to pursue, since the exercise of contemplation, and the construction and invention of experiments, are supported on the same principles, and perfected by the same means.\"\n\nAfter these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> discussions, the great restorer of philosophy proceeds, in the second book of the Novum Organum, to describe and exemplify the nature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDUCTION\">Induction</a>, which he deems essential to the right interpretation of nature.\n\nThe first object must be to prepare a history of the phenomena to be explained, in all their modifications and varieties. This history is to comprehend not only all such facts as spontaneously offer themselves, but all the experiments instituted for the sake of discovery, or for any of the purposes of the useful arts. It ought to be composed with great care; the facts accurately related, and distinctly arranged; their authenticity diligently examined; those that rest on doubtful evidence, though not rejected, being noted as uncertain, with the grounds of the judgment so formed. This last is very necessary; for facts often appear incredible, only because we are ill informed, and cease to appear marvellous, when our knowledge is farther extended.\n\nAll such facts, however, as appear contrary to the ordinary course of our experience, though thus noted down and preserved, must have no weight allowed them in the first steps of investigation, and are to be used only when the general principle, as it emerges from the inductive process, serves to increase their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>.\n\nThis record of facts is what Bacon calls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">Natural History</a>; and it is material to take notice of the comprehensive sense in which that term is understood through all his writings. According to the arrangement of the sciences, which he has explained in his treatise on the Advancement of Knowledge, all learning is classed relatively to the three intellectual faculties of Memory, Reason, and Imagination. Under the\n\n---\n\n1 Novum Organum, lib. i. aph. 119.\n2 Impetus Philosophici: Opera, p. 681, Franc. ad Mon. 1665, folio.\nfirst of these divisions is contained all that is merely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NARRATION\">Narration</a>, or History, of whatever kind it may be. Under the second are contained the different sciences, whether they respect the Intellectual or the Material world. Under the third are comprehended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-POETRY\">Poetry</a> and the Fine Arts. It is with the first of these classes only that we are at present concerned. The first two divisions of it are Sacred and Civil History, the meaning of which is sufficiently understood. The third division is Natural History, which comprehends the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the facts relative to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> matter, and to all animals, except man. Natural History is again subdivided into three parts: 1. The history of the phenomena of nature, which are uniform; 2. Of the facts which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANOMALOUS\">anomalous</a> or extraordinary; 3. Of the processes in the different arts.\n\nWe are not to wonder at finding the processes of the arts thus enrolled among the materials of Natural History. The powers which act in the processes of nature and in those of art are precisely the same, and are only directed, in the latter case, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> of man, toward particular objects. In art, as Bacon elsewhere observes, man does nothing more than bring things nearer to one another, or carry them farther off; the rest is performed by nature, and, on most occasions, by means of which we are quite ignorant.\n\nThus, when a man fires a pistol, he does nothing but make a piece of flint approach a plate of hardened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>, with a certain velocity. It is nature that does the rest\u2014that makes the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RED\">red</a>-hot and fluid globules of steel, which the flint had struck off, communicate their fire to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, and, by a process but little understood, set loose the elastic fluid contained in it; so that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a> is produced, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> propelled with astonishing velocity. It is obvious that, in this instance, art only gives certain powers of nature a particular direction.\n\nTo the rules which have been given from Bacon, for the composition of Natural History, I may be permitted to add this other\u2014that theoretical language should, as much as possible, be avoided. Appearances ought to be described in terms which involve no opinion with respect to their causes. These last are the objects of separate examination, and will be best understood if the facts are given fairly, without any dependence on what should yet be considered as unknown. This rule is very essential where the facts are in a certain degree complicated; for it is then much easier to describe with a reference to theory than without it. It is only from a skilful physician that you can expect a description of a disease which is not full of opinions concerning its cause. A similar observation might be made with respect to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>; and with respect to no science more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol9.html#article-GEOLOGY\">geology</a>.\n\nThe natural history of any phenomenon, or class of phenomena, being thus prepared, the next object is, by a comparison of the different facts, to find out the cause of the phenomenon, its form, in the language of Bacon, or its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a>. The form of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> in body is something convertible with that quality; that is, where it exists, the quality is present, and where the quality is present, the form must be so likewise. Thus, if transparency in bodies be the thing inquired after, the form of it is something in which, wherever it is found, there is transparency; and, vice versa, wherever there is transparency, that which we have called the form is likewise present.\n\nThe form, then, differs in nothing from the cause; only we apply the word cause where it is event or change that is the effect. When the effect or result is a permanent quality, we speak of the form or essence.\n\nTwo other objects, subordinate to forms, but often essential to the knowledge of them, are also occasionally subjects of investigation. These are the latent process, and the latent schematism; latens processus, et latens schematismus. The former is the secret and invisible progress by which sensible changes are brought about, and seems, in Bacon's acceptation, to involve the principle, since called the law of continuity, according to which, no change, however small, can be effected but in time. To know the relation between the time and the change effected in it, would be to have a perfect knowledge of the latent process. In the firing of a cannon, for example, the succession of events during the short interval between the application of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> and the expulsion of the ball, constitutes\na latent process of a very remarkable and complicated nature, which, however, we can now trace with some degree of accuracy. In mechanical operations, we can often follow this process still more completely. When motion is communicated from any body to another, it is distributed through all the parts of that other, by a law quite beyond the reach of sense to perceive directly, but yet subject to investigation, and determined by a principle which, though late in being discovered, is now generally recognised. The applications of this mechanical principle are perhaps the instances in which a latent, and, indeed, a very recondite process, has been most completely analyzed.\n\nThe latent schematism is that invisible structure of bodies, on which so many of their properties depend. When we inquire into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CRYSTALS\">crystals</a>, or into the internal structure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, &c., we are examining into the latent schematism. We do the same when we attempt to explain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, magnetism, gravitation, &c., by any peculiar structure of bodies, or any arrangement of the particles of matter.\n\nIn order to inquire into the form or cause of anything by induction, having brought together the facts, we are to begin with considering what things are thereby excluded from the number of possible forms. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> is the first part of the process of induction: it confines the field of hypothesis, and brings the true explanation within narrower limits. Thus, if we were inquiring into the quality which is the cause of transparency in bodies; from the fact that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a> is transparent, we immediately exclude rarity or porosity, as well as fluidity, from those causes, the diamond being a very solid and dense body.\n\nNegative instances, or those where the given form is wanting, are also to be collected.\n\nThat glass, when pounded, is not transparent, is a negative fact, and of considerable importance when the form of transparency is inquired into; also, that collections of vapour, such as clouds and fogs, have not transparency, are negative facts of the same kind. The facts thus collected, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATIVE\">affirmative</a> and negative, may, for the sake of reference, be reduced into tables.\n\nBacon exemplifies his method on the subject of Heat; and, though his collection of facts be imperfect, his method of treating them is extremely judicious, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISQUISITION\">disquisition</a> highly interesting. He here proposes, as an experiment, to try the reflection of the heat of opaque bodies. He mentions also the vitrum calendarum, or thermometer, which was just then coming into use. His reflections, after finishing his enumeration of facts, show how sensible he was of the imperfect state of his own knowledge.\n\nAfter a great number of exclusions have left but a few principles, common to every case, one of these is to be assumed as the cause; and, by reasoning from it synthetically, we are to try if it will account for the phenomena.\n\nSo necessary did this exclusive process appear to Bacon, that he says, \"It may perhaps be competent to angels, or superior intelligences, to determine the form or essence directly, by affirmations from the first consideration of the subject. But it is certainly beyond the power of man, to whom it is only given to proceed at first by negatives, and, in the last place, to end in an affirmative, after the exclusion of every thing else.\"\n\nThe method of induction, as laid down here, is to be considered as applicable to all investigations where experience is the guide, whether in the moral or natural world. \"Some may doubt whether we propose to apply our method of investigation to natural philosophy only, or to other sciences, such as logic, ethics, politics. We answer, that we mean it to be so applied. And as the common logic, which proceeds by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYLLOGISM\">syllogism</a>, belongs not only to natural philosophy, but to all the sciences, so our logic, which proceeds by induction, embraces every thing.\"\n\nThough this process had been pursued by a person of much inferior penetration and sagacity to Bacon, he could not but have discovered that all facts, even supposing them truly and accurately recorded, are not of equal value in\n\n---\n\n1 *Novum Organum*, lib. ii. aph. 5, 6, &c.\n2 Ibid. aph. 11.\n3 Ibid. lib. ii. aph. 15.\n4 Ibid. aph. 18, 20, &c.\n5 Ibid. aph. 14.\n6 Ibid. lib. i. aph. 127.\nthe discovery of truth. Some of them show the thing sought for in its highest degree, some in its lowest; some exhibit it simple and uncombined, in others it appears confused with a variety of circumstances. Some facts are easily interpreted, others are very obscure, and are understood only in consequence of the light thrown on them by the former. This led our author to consider what he calls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">Prerogative</a> Instantiarum, the comparative value of facts as means of discovery, or as instruments of investigation. He enumerates twenty-seven different species, and enters at some length into the peculiar properties of each. I must content myself, in this sketch, with describing a few of the most important, subjoining, as illustrations, sometimes the examples which the author himself has given, but more frequently such as have been furnished by later discoveries in science.\n\nI. The first place in this classification is assigned to what are called instantiae solitariae, which are either examples of the same quality existing in two bodies which have nothing in common but that quality, or of a quality differing in two bodies which are in all other respects the same. In the first instance, the bodies differ in all things but one; in the second, they agree in all but one. The hypotheses that in either case can be entertained, concerning the cause or form of the said quality, are reduced to a small number; for, in the first, they can involve none of the things in which the bodies differ; and, in the second, none of those in which they agree.\n\nThus, of the cause or form of colour now inquired into, instantiae solitariae are found in crystals, prisms of glass, drops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEW\">dew</a>, which occasionally exhibit colour, and yet have nothing in common with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, flowers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, which possess colour permanently, except the colour itself. Hence Bacon concludes, that colour is nothing else than a modification of the rays of light, produced, in the first case, by the different degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a>; and, in the second, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> or constitution of the surfaces of bodies. He may be considered as very fortunate in fixing on these examples; for it was by means of them that Newton afterwards found out the composition of light.\n\nOf the second kind of instantiae solitariae, Bacon mentions the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> or coloured veins which occur in limestone or marble, and yet hardly differ in substance or in structure from the ground of the stone. He concludes, very justly, from this, that colour has not much to do with the essential properties of body.\n\nII. The instantiae migrantes exhibit some nature or property of body, passing from one condition to another, either from less to greater, or from greater to less; arriving nearer perfection in the first case, or verging towards extinction in the second.\n\nSuppose the thing inquired into were the cause of whiteness in bodies; an instantia migrans is found in glass, which, when entire, is without colour, but, when pulverized, becomes white. The same is the case with water unbroken, and water dashed into foam. In both cases, the separation into particles produces whiteness. So also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of fluidity to metals by the application of heat, and the destruction of that fluidity by the abstraction of heat, are examples of both kinds of the instantia migrans. Instances of this kind are very powerful for reducing the cause inquired after into a narrow space, and for removing all the accidental circumstances. It is necessary, however, as Bacon very justly remarks, that we should consider not merely the case when a certain quality is lost, and another produced, but the gradual changes made in those qualities during their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MIGRATION\">migration</a>, viz. the increase of the one, and the corresponding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of the other. The quantity which changes proportionally to another, is connected with it either as cause and effect, or as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLLATERAL\">collateral</a> effect of the same cause. When, again, we find two qualities which do not increase proportionally, they afford a negative instance, and assure us that the two are not connected simply as cause and effect.\n\nThe mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> is the great theatre of the instantiae migrantes, where the same nature is seen in all gradations, from the most perfect\nstate, till it become entirely evanescent. Such are the shells which we see so perfect in figure and structure in limestone, and gradually losing themselves in the finer marbles, till they can no longer be distinguished. The use, also, of one such fact to explain or interpret another, is nowhere so well seen as in the history of the mineral kingdom.\n\nIII. In the third place are the *instantiae ostensae*, which Bacon also calls *elucescentiae* and *predominantiae*. They are the facts which show some particular nature in its highest state of power and energy, when it is either freed from the impediments which usually counteract it, or is itself of such force as entirely to repress those impediments. For as every body is susceptible of many different conditions, and has many different forms combined in it, one of them often confines, depresses, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a> another entirely, so that it is not easily distinguished. There are found, however, some subjects in which the nature inquired into is completely displayed, either by the absence of impediments, or by the predominance of its own power.\n\nBacon instances the thermometer, or *vitrum calendarum*, as exhibiting the expansive power of heat, in a manner more distinct and measurable than in common cases. To this example, which is well chosen, the present state of science enables us to add many others.\n\nIf the weight of the air were inquired into, the Torricellian experiment, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a>, affords an *ostensive instance*, where the circumstance which conceals the weight of the atmosphere in common cases, namely, the pressure of it in all directions, being entirely removed, that weight produces its full effect, and sustains the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> in the tube. The barometer affords also an example of the *instantia migrans*, when the change is not total, but only partial or progressive. If it be the weight of the air which supports the mercury in the tube of the barometer, when that weight is diminished, the mercury ought to stand lower. On going to the top of a mountain, the weight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> air is diminished, because a shorter column of air is to be sustained; the mercury in the barometer ought therefore to sink, and it is found to do so accordingly.\n\nThese are instances in which the action of certain principles is rendered visible by the removal of all the opposing forces. One may be given where it is the distinct and decisive nature of the fact which leads to the result.\n\nSuppose it were inquired, whether the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> had ever been covered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. If we look at the stratified form of so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> a portion of the earth's surface, we cannot but conclude it to be very probable that such land was formed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the sea. But the decisive proof is afforded by the shells and corals, or bodies having the perfect shape of shells and corals, and of other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> exuviae, which are found imbedded in masses of the most solid rock, and often on the tops of very high mountains. This leaves no doubt of the formation of the land under the sea, though it does not determine whether the land, since its formation, has been elevated to its present height, or the sea depressed to its present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>. The decision of that question requires other facts to be consulted.\n\nIV. The *instantia clandestina*, which is, as it were, opposed to the preceding, and shows some power or quality just as it is beginning to exist, and in its weakest state, is often very useful in the generalization of facts. Bacon also gave to this the fanciful name of *instantia crepusculi*.\n\nAn example of this may be given from hydrostatics. If the suspension of water in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> tubes be inquired into, it becomes very useful to view that effect when it is least, or when the tube ceases to be capillary, and becomes a vessel of a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>. The column is then reduced to a slender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of water, which goes all round the vessel; and this, though now so inconsiderable, has the property of being independent of the size of the vessel, so as to be in all cases the same when the materials are the same. As there can be no doubt that this ring proceeds from the attraction of the sides, and of the part immediately above the water, so there can be no doubt that the capillary suspension, in part at least, is derived from the same cause. An effect of the opposite kind takes place when a glass vessel is filled with mercury.\n\nV. Next to these may be placed what are called *instantiae manipulares*, or collective instances,\nthat is, general facts, or such as comprehend a great number of particular cases. As human knowledge can but seldom reach the most general cause or form, such collective instances are often the utmost extent to which our generalization can be carried. They have great value on this account, as they likewise have on account of the assistance which they give to further generalization.\n\nOf this we have a remarkable instance in one of the most important steps ever taken in any part of human knowledge. The laws of Kepler are facts of the kind now treated of, and consist of three general truths, each belonging to the whole planetary system; and it was by means of them that Newton discovered the principle of gravitation. The first is, that the planets all move in elliptical orbits, having the sun for their common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>; the next, that about this focus the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a> vector of each planet describes equal areas in equal times; the third and last, that the squares of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERIODIC\">periodic</a> times of the planets are as the cubes of their mean distances from the sun. The knowledge of each of these was the result of much research, and of the comparison of a vast multitude of observations, insomuch that it may be doubted if ever three truths in science were discovered at the expense of so much labour and patience, or with the exertion of more ingenuity and invention in imagining and combining observations. These discoveries were all made before Bacon wrote, but he is silent concerning them; for the want of mathematical knowledge concealed from his view some of the most splendid and interesting parts of science.\n\nAstronomy is full of such collective instances, and affords them, indeed, of the second and third order, that is to say, two or three times generalized. The astronomer observes nothing but that a certain luminous disk, or perhaps merely a luminous point, is in a certain position, in respect of the planes of the meridian and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>, at a certain moment of time. By comparing a number of such observations, he finds that this luminous point moves in a certain plane, with a certain velocity, and performs a revolution in a certain time. Thus, the periodic time of a planet is itself a collective fact, or a single fact expressing the result of many hundred observations. This holds with respect to each planet, and with respect to each element, as it is called, of the planet's orbit, every one of which is a general fact, expressing the result of an indefinite number of particulars. This holds still more remarkably of the inferences which extend to the distances of the planet from the earth, or from the sun. The laws of Kepler are therefore collective facts of the second, or even a higher order; or such as comprehend a great number of general facts, each of which is itself a general fact, including many particulars. It is much to the credit of astronomy, that, in all this process, no degree of truth or certainty is sacrificed; and that the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATIVE\">demonstrative</a> evidence is preserved from the lowest to the highest point. Nothing but the use of mathematical reasoning could secure this advantage to any of the sciences.\n\nVI. In the next place may be ranked the instances which Bacon calls analogous, or parallel. These consist of facts, between which an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> or resemblance is visible in some particulars, notwithstanding great diversity in all the rest. Such are the telescope and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>, in the works of art, compared with the eye in the works of nature. This, indeed, is an analogy which goes much beyond the mere exterior; it extends to the internal structure, and to the principle of action, which is the same in the eye and in the telescope,\u2014to the latent schematism, in the language of Bacon, as far as material substance is concerned. It was the experiment of the camera obscura which led to the discovery of the formation of the images of external objects in the bottom of the eye by the action of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CRYSTALLINE\">crystalline</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENS\">lens</a>, and the other humours of which the eye is formed.\n\nAmong the instances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a>, those are the most useful which enable us to compare productions of an unknown formation, with similar productions of which the formation is well understood. Such are basalt, and the other trap rocks, compared with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a> thrown out from volcanoes. They have a structure so exactly similar, that it is hardly possible to doubt that their origin is the same, and that they are both produced by the action of subterraneous fire. There are, however, amid their similarity, some very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-\nremarkable differences in the substances which they contain, the trap rocks containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALCAREOUS_SPAR\">calcareous <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPAR\">spar</a>, and the lava never containing any. On the supposition that they are both of igneous origin, is there any circumstance, in the conditions in which heat may have been applied to them, which can account for this difference? Sir James <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>, in a train of most philosophical and happily-contrived experiments, has explained the nature of those conditions, and has shown that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of calcareous spar, or the want of it, may arise from the greater or less compression under which the fusion of the basalt was performed. This has served to explain a great difficulty in the history of the mineral kingdom.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPARATIVE_ANATOMY\">Comparative anatomy</a> is full of analogies of this kind, which are most instructive, and useful guides to discovery. It was by remarking in the blood-vessels a contrivance similar to the valves used in hydraulic engines, for preventing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a>-current of a fluid, that Harvey was led to the discovery of the circulation of the blood. The analogies between natural and artificial productions are always highly deserving of notice.\n\nThe facts of this class, however, unless the analogy be very close, are apt to mislead, by representing accidental regularity as if it were constant. Of this we have an example in the supposed analogy between the colours in the prismatic spectrum and the divisions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MONOCHORD\">monochord</a>. The colours in the prismatic spectrum do not occupy the same proportion of it in all cases; the analogy depends on the particular kind of glass, not on anything that is common to all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REFRACTION\">refraction</a>. The tendency of man to find more order in things than there actually exists, is here to be cautiously watched over.\n\nVII. Monodic, or singular facts, are the next in order. They comprehend the instances which are particularly distinguished from all those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> or species to which they belong. Such is the sun among the stars, the magnet among stones, mercury among metals, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> fountains among springs, the elephant among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a>. So also among the planets, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a> is singular from his ring; the new planets are so likewise from their small size, from being extrazodiacal, &c.\n\nConnected with these are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and deviating instances, in which nature seems to depart from her ordinary course. Earthquakes, extraordinary tempests, years of great scarcity, winters of singular severity, &c. are of this number. All such facts ought to be carefully collected; and there should be added an account of all monstrous productions, and of everything remarkable for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> and its rareness. Here, however, the most severe criticism must be applied; every thing connected with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> is suspicious, as well as whatever relates to alchemy or magic.\n\nA set of facts, which belongs to this class, consists of the instances in which stones have so often of late years been observed to fall from the heavens. Those stones are so unlike other atmospherical productions, and their origin must be so different from that of other minerals, that it is scarcely possible to imagine anything more anomalous, and more inconsistent with the ordinary course of our experience. Yet the existence of this phenomenon is so well authenticated by testimony, and by the evidence arising from certain physical considerations, that no doubt with respect to it can be entertained, and it must therefore be received, as making a part of the natural history of meteors. But as every fact, or class of facts, which is perfectly singular, must be incapable of explanation, and can only be understood when its resemblance to other things has been discovered; so at present we are unable to assign the cause of these phenomena, and have no right to offer any theory of their origin.\n\nVIII. Another class of facts is composed of what Bacon calls instantia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMITATUS\">comitatus</a>, or examples of certain qualities which always accompany one another. Such are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> and heat,\u2014flame being always accompanied by heat, and the same degree of heat in a given substance being always accompanied with flame. So also heat and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a>,\u2014an increase of heat being accompanied with an increase of volume, except in a very few cases, and in circumstances very particular.\n\nThe most perfect instantia comitatus known, as being without any negative, is that of body and weight. Whatever is impenetrable and inert, is also heavy in a degree proportional to\nits inertia. To this there is no exception, though we do not perceive the connection as necessary.\n\nHostile instances, or those of perpetual separation, are the reverse of the former.\n\nExamples of this are found in air, and the other elastic fluids, which cannot have a solid form induced on them by any known means, when not combined with other substances. So also in solids, transparency and malleability are never joined, and appear to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a>, though it is not obvious for what reason.\n\nIX. Passing over several classes which seem of inferior importance, we come to the *instantia crucis*, the division of this experimental logic which is most frequently resorted to in the practice of inductive investigation. When, in such an investigation, the understanding is placed in *equilibrio*, as it were, between two or more causes, each of which accounts equally well for the appearances, as far as they are known, nothing remains to be done but to look out for a fact which can be explained by the one of these causes, and not by the other: if such a one can be found, the uncertainty is removed, and the true cause is determined. Such facts perform the office of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, erected at the separation of two roads, to direct the traveller which he is to take; and, on this account, Bacon gave them the name of *instantia crucis*.\n\nSuppose that the subject inquired into were the motion of the planets, and that the phenomena which first present themselves, or the motion of these bodies in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>, could be explained equally on the Ptolemaic and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-COPERNICAN_SYSTEM\">Copernican system</a>, that is, either on the system which makes the earth, or that which makes the sun, the centre of the planetary motions; a cautious philosopher would hesitate about which of the two he should adopt, and notwithstanding that one of them was recommended by its superior simplicity, he might not think himself authorized to give to it a decided preference above the other. If, however, he consider the motion of these bodies in latitude, that is to say, their digressions from the plane of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ECLIPTIC\">ecliptic</a>, he will find a set of phenomena which cannot be reconciled with the supposition that the earth is the centre of the planetary motions; but which receive the most simple and satisfactory expla-\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> from supposing that the sun is at rest, and is the centre of those motions. The latter phenomena would therefore serve as *instantia crucis*, by which the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREDIBILITY\">credibility</a> of the Copernican system was fully evinced.\n\nAnother example which I shall give of an *instantia crucis* is taken from Chemistry, and is, indeed, one of the most remarkable experiments which has been made in that science.\n\nIt is a general fact observed in Chemistry, that metals are always rendered heavier by calcination. When a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of tin or lead, for instance, is calcined in the fire, though every precaution is taken to prevent any addition from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>, coals, &c. the absolute weight of the mass is always found to be increased. It was long before the cause of this phenomenon was understood. There might be some heavy substance added, though what it was could not easily be imagined; or some substance might have escaped, which was in its nature light, and possessed a tendency upwards. Other phenomena, into the nature of which it is at present unnecessary to inquire, induced chemists to suppose, that in calcination a certain substance actually escapes, being present in the regulus, but not in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CALX\">calx</a> of the metal. This substance, to which they gave the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHLOGISTON\">phlogiston</a>, was probably that which, by its escape, rendered the metal heavier, and must, therefore, be itself ended with absolute levity.\n\nThe *instantia crucis* which extricated philosophers from this difficulty, was furnished by an experiment of the celebrated Lavoisier. That excellent chemist included a quantity of tin in a glass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RETORT\">retort</a>, hermetically sealed, and accurately weighed together with its contents; he then applied the necessary heat, and when the calcination of the tin was finished, he found the weight of the whole precisely the same as before. This proved that no substance, which was either light or heavy, in a sensible degree, had made its way through the glass. The experiment went still farther. When the retort was cooled and opened, the air rushed in; so that it was evident that a part of the air had disappeared, or had lost its elasticity. On weighing the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, it was now found that its weight was increased by ten grains; so that ten\ngrains of air had entered into the retort when it was opened. The calx was next taken out, and weighed separately, and it was found to have become heavier by ten grains precisely. The ten grains of air then which had disappeared, and which had made way for the ten grains that rushed into the retort, had combined with the metal during the process of calcination.\n\nThe further prosecution of this very decisive experiment led to the knowledge of that species of air which combines with metals when they are calcined. The doctrine of phlogiston was of course exploded, and a creature of the imagination replaced by a real existence.\n\nThe principle which conduces to the contrivance of an experimentum crucis is not difficult to be understood. Taking either of the hypotheses, its consequences must be attempted to be traced, supposing a different experiment to be made. This must be done with respect to the other hypothesis, and a case will probably at last occur, where the two hypotheses would give different results. The experiment made in those circumstances will furnish an instantia crucis.\n\nThus, if the experiment of calcination be performed in a close vessel, and if phlogiston be the cause of the increase of weight, it must either escape through the vessel, or it must remain in the vessel after separation from the calx. If the former be the case, the apparatus will be increased in weight; if the latter, the phlogiston must make its escape on opening the vessel. If neither of these be the case, it is plain that the theory of phlogiston is insufficient to explain the facts.\n\nThe experimentum crucis is of such weight in matters of induction, that in all those branches of science where it cannot easily be resorted to, (the circumstances of an experiment being out of our power, and incapable of being varied at pleasure) there is often a great want of conclusive evidence. This holds of agriculture, medicine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> economy, &c. To make one experiment, similar to another in all respects but one, is what the experimentum crucis, and, in general, the process of induction, principally requires; but it is what, in the sciences just named, can seldom be accomplished. Hence the great difficulty of separating the causes, and allotting to each its due proportion of the effect.\n\nMen deceive themselves in consequence of this continually, and think they are reasoning from fact and experience, when, in reality, they are only reasoning from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of truth and falsehood. The only end answered by facts so incorrectly apprehended, is that of making error more incorrigible.\n\nOf the twenty-seven classes into which instantiae are arranged by the author of the Novum Organum, fifteen immediately address themselves to the Understanding; five serve to correct or to inform the Senses; and seven to direct the hand in raising the superstructure of Art on the foundation of Science. The examples given above are from the first of these divisions, and will suffice for a summary. To the five that follow next, the general name of instantia lampadis is given, from their office of assisting or informing the senses.\n\nOf these the instantiae januae assist the immediate action of the senses, and especially of sight. The examples quoted by Bacon are the microscope and telescope, (which last he mentions as the invention of Galileo) and he speaks of them with great admiration, but with some doubt of their reality.\n\nThe instantiae citantes enable us to perceive things which are in themselves insensible, or not at all the objects of perception. They cite or place things, as it were, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of the senses, and from this analogy to judicial proceedings is derived the name of instantiae citantes. Such, to employ examples which the progress of science has unfolded since the time of Bacon, are the air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a> and the barometer for manifesting the weight and elasticity of air; the measurement of the velocity of light, by means of the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter, and the aberration of the fixed stars; the experiments in electricity and galvanism, and in the greater part of pneumatic chemistry. In all these instances things are made known which before had entirely escaped the senses.\n\nThe instantiae viae are facts which manifest the continuous progress of nature in her operations. There is a propensity in men to view nature as it were at intervals, or at the ends of fixed periods, without regarding her gradual and un-\nceasing action. The desire of making observation easy is the great source of this propensity. Men wish for knowledge, but would obtain it at the least expense of time and labour. As there is no time, however, at which the hand of nature ceases to work, there ought to be none at which observation ceases to be made.\n\nThe instantiae perscantes, or vellicantes, are those which force us to attend to things which, from their subtilty and minuteness, escape common observation.\n\nSome of Bacon's remarks on this subtilty are such as would do credit to the most advanced state of science, and show how much his mind was fitted for distinguishing and observing the great and admirable in the works of nature.\n\nThe last division contains seven classes, of which I mention only two. The experiments of this division are those most immediately tending to produce the improvement of art from the extension of science. \"Now there are,\" says Bacon, \"two ways in which knowledge, even when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> in itself, may fail of becoming a safe guide to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>; and these are either when it is not sufficiently precise, or when it leads to more complicated means of producing an effect than can be employed in practice. There are therefore two kinds of experiments which are of great value in promoting the alliance between knowledge and power;\u2014those which tend to give accurate and exact measures of objects, and those which disencumber the processes deduced from scientific principles, of all unnecessary operations.\"\n\nIn the instantiae radii we measure objects by lines and angles; in the instantiae curriculi, by time or by motion.\n\nTo the former of these classes are to be referred a number of instruments which now constitute the greater part of the apparatus of Natural Philosophy. Though Bacon had a just idea of their utility in general, he was unacquainted with most of them. The most remarkable at present are those that follow:\n\n1. Astronomical instruments, or, more generally, all instruments for measuring lines and angles.\n\n2. Instruments for measuring weight or force; such are the common balance, the hydrostatic balance, the barometer, the instruments used in England by Cavendish, and in France by Coulomb, which measure small and almost insensible actions by the force of torsion.\n\nThese last rather belong to the class of the instantiae lucidae, where force is applied as the measure of force, than to the instantiae radii.\n\n3. The thermometer, newly invented in the time of Bacon, and mentioned by him under the name of Vitrum Calendare, an instrument to which we owe nearly all the knowledge we have of one of the most powerful agents in nature, viz. Heat.\n\n4. The hygrometer, an instrument for measuring the quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMIDITY\">humidity</a> contained in the air; and in the construction of which, after repeated failures by the most skilful experimenters, the invention of Professor Leslie now promises success. Almost every one of these instruments, to which several more might be added, has brought in sight a new country, and has enriched science not only with new facts, but with new principles.\n\nAmong the remarks of Bacon on the experimenta radii, some are very remarkable for the extent of view which they display even in the infancy of physical science. He mentions the forces by which bodies act on one another at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, and throws out some hints at the attraction which the heavenly bodies exert on one another.\n\n\"Inquirendum est,\" says he, \"si sit vis aliqua magnetica quae operetur per consensum inter globum terrae et ponderosa, aut inter globum lune et aquas maris, aut inter c\u00e6lum stellatum et planetas, per quam avocentur et attollantur ad sua apogea; h\u00e6c omnia operantur ad distantias admodum longinquas.\"*\n\nUnder the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the instantiae curriculi, or the measuring of things by time; after remarking that every change and every motion requires time, and illustrating this by a variety of instances, he has the following very curious anticipation of facts, which appeared then doubtful, but which subsequent discovery has ascertained:\n\n---\n\n* Novum Organum, lib. ii. aph. 41.\n* Ibid. aph. 45.\n\"The consideration of those things produced in me a doubt altogether astonishing, viz. Whether the face of the serene and starry heavens be seen at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> it really exists, or not till some time later; and whether there be not, with respect to the heavenly bodies, a true time and an apparent time, no less than a true place and an apparent place, as astronomers say, on account of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a>. For it seems incredible that the species or rays of the celestial bodies can pass through the immense interval between them and us in an instant, or that they do not even require some considerable portion of time.\"\n\nThe measurement of the velocity of light, and the wonderful consequences arising from it, are the best commentaries on this passage, and the highest eulogy on its author.\n\nSuch were the speculations of Bacon, and the rules he laid down for the conduct of experimental inquiries, before any such inquiries had yet been instituted. The power and compass of a mind which could form such a plan beforehand, and trace not merely the outline, but many of the most minute ramifications, of sciences which did not yet exist, must be an object of admiration to all succeeding ages. He is destined, if indeed any thing in the world be so destined, to remain an instantia singularis among men, and as he has had no rival in the times which are past, so is he likely to have none in those which are to come. Before any parallel to him can be found, not only must a man of the same talents be produced, but he must be placed in the same circumstances; the memory of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a> must be effaced, and the light of science, after being entirely extinguished, must be again beginning to revive. If a second Bacon is ever to arise, he must be ignorant of the first.\n\nBacon is often compared with two great men who lived nearly about the same time with himself, and who were both eminent reformers of philosophy, Descartes and Galileo.\n\nDescartes flourished about forty years later than Bacon, but does not seem to have been acquainted with his writings. Like him, however, he was forcibly struck with the defects of the ancient philosophy, and the total inaptitude of the methods which it followed, for all the purposes of physical investigation. Like him, too, he felt himself strongly impelled to undertake the reformation of this erroneous system; but the resemblance between them goes no farther; for it is impossible that two men could pursue the same end by methods more diametrically opposite.\n\nDescartes never proposed to himself any thing which had the least resemblance to induction. He began with establishing principles, and from the existence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a> and his perfections, he proposed to deduce the explanation of all the phenomena of the world, by reasoning a priori. Instead of proceeding upward from the effect to the cause, he proceeded continually downward from the cause to the effect. It was in this manner that he sought to determine the laws of motion, and of the collision of bodies, in which last all his conclusions were erroneous. From the same source he deduced the existence of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLENUM\">plenum</a>, and the continual preservation of the same quantity of motion in the universe; a proposition which, in a certain sense, is true, but in the sense in which he understood it, is altogether false. Reasonings of the kind which he employed may possibly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a>, as Bacon observed, with intelligences of a higher order than man, but to his case they are quite inapplicable. Of the fruit of this tree nature has forbidden him to eat, and has ordained that, with the sweat of his brow, and the labour of his hands, he should earn his knowledge as well as his subsistence.\n\nDescartes, however, did not reject experiment altogether, though he assigned it a very subordinate place in his philosophy. By reasoning down from first principles, he tells us that he was always able to discover the effects; but the number of different shapes which those effects might assume was so great, that he could not determine, without having recourse to experiment, which of them nature had preferred to the rest. \"We employ experiment,\" says he, \"not as a reason by which any thing is proved, for we wish to deduce effects from their causes, and not conversely causes from their effects. We\n\n---\n\n1 Novum Organum, lib. ii. aph. 46.\nappeal to experience only, that out of innumerable effects which may be produced from the same cause, we may direct our attention to one rather than another.\" It is wonderful, that Descartes did not see what a severe censure he was here passing on himself; of how little value the speculations must be that led to conclusions so vague and indefinite; and how much more philosophy is disgraced by affording an explanation of things which are not, than by not affording an explanation of things which are.\n\nAs a system of philosophy and philosophic investigation, the method of Descartes can, therefore, stand in no comparison with that of Bacon. Yet his Physics contributed to the advancement of science, but did so, much more by that which they demolished, than by that which they built up. In some particular branches the French philosopher far excelled the English. He greatly improved the science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>, and in the pure mathematics, as has been already shown, he left behind him many marks of a great and original genius. He will, therefore, be always numbered among those who have essentially contributed to the advancement of knowledge, though nothing could be more perverse than his method of philosophizing, and nothing more likely to impede the progress of science, had not an impulse been at that time given to the human mind which nothing could resist.\n\nGalileo, the other rival and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> of Bacon, is, in truth, one of those to whom human knowledge is under the greatest obligations. His discoveries in the theory of motion, in the laws of the descent of heavy bodies, and in the motion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROJECTILES\">projectiles</a>, laid the foundation of all the great improvements which have since been made by the application of Mathematics to Natural Philosophy. If to this we add the invention of the telescope, the discoveries made by that instrument, the confirmations of the Copernican system which these discoveries afforded, and, lastly, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and argument with which he combated and exposed the prejudice and presumption of the schools, we must admit that the history of human knowledge contains few greater names than that of Galileo. On comparing him with Bacon, however, I have no hesitation in saying, that the latter has given indications of a genius of a still higher order. In this I know that I differ from a historian who was himself a philosopher, and whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUFFRAGE\">suffrage</a>, of consequence, is here of more than ordinary weight.\n\n\"The great glory of literature,\" says Hume, \"in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, during the reign of James, was Lord Bacon. If we consider the variety of talents displayed by this man, as a public speaker, a man of business, a wit, a courtier, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, an author, a philosopher, he is justly entitled to great admiration. If we consider him merely as an author and a philosopher, the light in which we view him at present, though very estimable, he was yet inferior to his contemporary Galileo, perhaps even to Kepler. Bacon pointed out, at a distance, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to philosophy; Galileo both pointed it out to others, and made himself considerable advances in it. The Englishman was ignorant of geometry; the Florentine revived that science, excelled in it, and was the first who applied it, together with experiment, to natural philosophy. The former rejected, with the most positive disdain, the system of Copernicus; the latter fortified it with new proofs, derived both from reason and the senses. Bacon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> is stiff and rigid; his wit, though often brilliant, is also often unnatural and far-fetched. Galileo is a lively and agreeable, though somewhat a prolix writer.\"\n\nThough it cannot be denied that there is considerable truth in these remarks, yet it seems to me that the comparison is not made with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a> and discrimination which might have been expected from Hume, who appears studiously to have contrasted what is most excellent in Galileo with what is most defective in Bacon. It is true that Galileo showed the way in the application of mathematics and of geometry to physical investigation, and that the immediate utility of his performance was greater than that of Bacon's, as it impressed more movement on the age in which he lived; example being always so much more powerful than precept. Bacon, indeed, wrote for an age more enlightened than\n\n* History of England, vol. VI. Appendix.\nhis own, and it was long before the full merit of his work was understood. But though Galileo was a geometer, and Bacon unacquainted with the mathematics,\u2014though Galileo added new proofs to the system of the earth's motion, which Bacon rejected altogether,\u2014yet is it certain, I think, that the former has more fellows or equals in the world of science than the latter, and that his excellence, though so high, is less unrivalled. The range which Bacon's speculations embraced was altogether immense. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> a penetrating eye on the whole of science, from its feeblest and most infantine state, to that strength and perfection from which it was then so remote, and which it is perhaps destined to approach to continually, but never to attain. More substitutes might be found for Galileo than for Bacon. More than one could be mentioned, who, in the place of the former, would probably have done what he did; but the history of human knowledge points out nobody of whom it can be said, that, placed in the situation of Bacon, he would have done what Bacon did;\u2014no man whose prophetic genius would have enabled him to delineate a system of science which had not yet begun to exist\u2014who could have derived the knowledge of what ought to be from what was not, and who could have become so rich in wisdom, though he received from his predecessors no inheritance but their errors. I am inclined, therefore, to agree with D'Alembert, \"that when one considers the sound and enlarged views of this great man, the multitude of the objects to which his mind was turned, and the boldness of his style, which unites the most sublime images with the most rigorous precision, one is disposed to regard him as the greatest, the most universal, and the most eloquent of philosophers.\"\n\n3. REMARKS, &c.\n\nIt will hardly be doubted by any one who attentively considers the method explained in the Novum Organum, which we have now attempted to sketch, that it contains a most comprehensive and rigorous plan of inductive investigation. A question, however, may occur, How far has this method been really carried into practice by those who have made the great discoveries in Natural Philosophy, and who have raised physical science to its present height in the scale of human knowledge? Is the whole method necessary, or have not circumstances occurred, which have rendered experimental investigation easier in practice than it appears to be in theory? To answer these questions completely, would require more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> than is consistent with the limits of this Dissertation: I shall, therefore, attempt no more than to point out the principles on which such an answer may be founded.\n\nIn a very extensive department of physical science, it cannot be doubted that investigation has been carried on, not perhaps more easily, but with a less frequent appeal to experience, than the rules of the Novum Organum would seem to require. In all the physical inquiries where mathematical reasoning has been employed, after a few principles have been established by experience, a vast multitude of truths, equally certain with the principles themselves, have been deduced from them by the mere application of geometry and algebra.\n\nIn mechanics, for example, after the laws of motion were discovered, which was done by experiment, the rest of the science, to a great extent, was carried on by reasoning from those laws, in the same manner that the geometer makes his discoveries by reasoning on the definitions, by help of a few axioms, or self-evident propositions. The only difference is, that, in the one case, the definitions and axioms are supplied solely from the mind itself, while, in the other, all the definitions and axioms which are not those of pure geometry, are furnished by experience.*\n\nBacon certainly was not fully aware of the advantages that were thus to accrue to the physical sciences. He was not ignorant, that the introduction of mathematical reasoning into those sciences is not only possible, but that, un-\n\n---\n\n1 Discours Pr\u00e9liminaire de l'Encyclop\u00e9die.\n2 The part of Mechanics which involves only statical considerations, or the equilibrium of forces, is capable of being treated by reasoning a priori entirely, without any appeal to experience. This will appear, when the subject of Mechanics is more particularly treated of.\nder certain conditions, it may be attended with the greatest advantage. He knew also in what manner this application had been abused by the Platonists, who had attempted, by means of geometry, to establish the first principles of Physics, or had used them, in axiomatis constitutio, which is exactly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> belonging exclusively to experience. At the same time, he pointed out, with great precision, the place which the Mathematics may legitimately occupy, as serving to measure and compare the objects of physical inquiry. He did not, however, perceive beforehand, nor was it possible that he should, the vast extent to which the application of that science was capable of being carried. In the book De Augmentis, he has made many excellent remarks on this subject, full of the sagacity which penetrated so far into futurity; but, nevertheless, could only perceive a small part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> which the genius of Newton was afterwards to unfold.\n\nHence, the route which leads to many of the richest and most fertile fields of science, is not precisely that which Bacon pointed out; it is safer and easier; so that the voyager finds he can trust to his chart and compass alone, without constantly looking out, or having the sounding-line perpetually in his hand.\n\nAnother remark I must make on Bacon's method is, that it does not give sufficient importance to the instantiae radii, or those which furnish us with accurate measures of physical quantities. The experiments of this class are introduced as only subservient to practice; they are, however, of infinite value in the theoretical part of induction, or for ascertaining the causes and essences of the things inquired into. We have an instance of this in the discovery of that important truth in physical astronomy, that the moon is retained in her orbit by the force of gravity, or the same which, at the earth's surface, makes a stone fall to the ground. This proposition, however it might have been suspected to be true, could never have been demonstrated but by such observations and experiments as assigned accurate geometrical measures to the quantities compared. The semidiameter of the earth; the velocity of falling bodies at the earth's surface; the distance of the moon, and her velocity in her orbit\u2014all these four elements must have been determined with great precision, and afterwards compared together by certain theorems deduced from the laws of motion, before the relation between the force which retains the moon in her orbit, and that which draws a stone to the ground, could possibly be discovered. The discovery also, when made, carried with it the evidence of demonstration; so that here, as in many other cases, the instantiae radii are of the utmost importance in the theoretical part of Physics.\n\nAnother thing to be observed is, that, in many cases, the result of a number of particular facts, or the collective instance arising from them, can only be found out by geometry, which, therefore, becomes a necessary instrument in completing the work of induction. An example, which the science of optics furnishes, will make this clearer than any general description. When light passes from one transparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> to another, it is refracted, that is, it ceases to go on in a straight line, and the angle which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INCIDENT\">incident</a> ray makes with the superficies which bounds the two media, determines that which the refracted ray makes with the same superficies. Now, if we would learn anything about the relation which these angles bear to one another, we must have recourse to experiment; and all that experiment can do is, for any particular angle of incidence, to determine the corresponding angle of refraction. This may be done in innumerable cases; but, with respect to the general rule which, in every possible case, determines the one of those angles from the other, or expresses the constant and invariable relation which subsists between them,\u2014with respect to it, experiment gives no direct information. The methods of geometry must therefore be called in to our assistance, which, when a constant though unknown relation subsists between two angles, or two variable quantities of any kind, and when an indefinite number of values of those quantities are given, furnishes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFALLIBLE\">infallible</a> means of discovering that unknown relation, either accurately, or at least by approximation. In this way it has been found, that, when the two media remain the same, the cosines of the angles above mentioned have a constant ratio to one another. Thus\nit appears, that, after experiment has done its utmost, geometry must be applied before the business of induction can be completed. This can only happen when the experiments afford accurate measures of the quantities concerned, like the instantiae radii, curriculi, &c.; and this advantage of admitting generalization with so much certainty is one of their properties, of which it does not appear that even Bacon himself was aware.\n\nAgain, from the intimate connection which prevails among the principles of science, the success of one investigation must often contribute to the success of another, in such a degree as to make it unnecessary to employ the complete apparatus of induction from the beginning. When certain leading principles have been once established, they serve, in new investigations, to narrow the limits within which the thing sought for is contained, and enable the inquirer to arrive more speedily at the truth.\n\nThus, suppose that, after the nature of the reflection and refraction of light, and particularly of the colours produced by the latter, had been discovered by experiment, the cause of the rainbow were to be inquired into. It would, after a little consideration, appear probable, that the phenomenon to be explained depends on the reflection and refraction of light by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> falling from a cloud opposite to the sun. Now, since the nature of reflection and refraction are supposed known, we have the principles previously ascertained which are likely to assist in the explanation of the rainbow. We have no occasion, therefore, to enter on the inquiry, as if the powers to be investigated were wholly unknown. It is the combination of them only which is unknown, and our business is to seek so to combine them, that the result may correspond with the appearances. This last is precisely what Newton accomplished, when, by deducing from the known laws of refraction and reflection the breadth of the coloured arch, the diameter of the circle of which it is a part, and the relation of the latter to the place of the spectator and of the sun, he found all these to come out from his calculus, just as they are observed in nature. Thus he proved the truth of his solution by the most clear and irresistible evidence.\n\nThe strict method of Bacon is therefore only necessary where the thing to be explained is new, and where we have no knowledge, or next to none, of the powers employed. This is but rarely the case, at least in some of the branches of Physics; and, therefore, it occurs most commonly in actual investigation, that the inquirer finds himself limited, almost from the first outset, to two or three hypotheses, all other suppositions involving inconsistencies which cannot for a moment be admitted. His business, therefore, is to compare the results of these hypotheses, and to consider what consequences may in any case arise from the one that would not arise from the other. If any such difference can be found, and if the matter is a subject of experiment, we have then an instantia crucis which must decide the question.\n\nThus, the instantia crucis comes in real practice to be the experiment most frequently appealed to, and that from which the most valuable information is derived.\n\nIn executing the method here referred to, the application of much reasoning, and frequently of much mathematical reasoning, is necessary, before any appeal to the experiment can be made, in order to deduce from each of the hypotheses an exact estimate of the consequences to which it leads. Suppose, for instance, that the law by which the magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> decreases in its intensity, as we recede from its poles, were to be inquired into. It is obvious that the number of hypotheses is here indefinite; and that we have hardly any choice but to begin with the simplest, or with that which is most analogous to the law of other forces propagated from a centre. Whatever law we assume, we must enter into a good deal of geometric reasoning, before a conclusion can be obtained, capable of being brought to the test of experience. The force itself, like all other forces, is not directly perceived, and its effects are not the result of its mere intensity, but of that intensity combined with the figure and magnitude of the body on which it acts; and, therefore, the calculus must be employed to express the measure of the effect, in terms of the intensity and the distance only. This being done, the hypothesis which gives results most nearly corresponding to the facts observed, when the mag-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NET\">net</a> acts on the same body, at different distances, must be taken as the nearest approximation to the truth. We have here an instance of the use of hypothesis in inductive investigation, and, indeed, of the only legitimate use to which it can ever be applied.\n\nIt also appears that Bacon placed the ultimate object of philosophy too high, and too much out of the reach of man, even when his exertions are most skilfully conducted. He seems to have thought, that, by giving a proper direction to our researches, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> them on according to the inductive method, we should arrive at the knowledge of the essences of the powers and qualities residing in bodies; that we should, for instance, become acquainted with the essence of heat, of cold, of colour, of transparency. The fact however is, that, in as far as science has yet advanced, no one essence has been discovered, either as to matter in general, or as to any of its more extensive modifications. We are yet in doubt, whether heat is a peculiar motion of the minute parts of bodies, as Bacon himself conceived it to be; or something emitted or radiated from their surfaces; or lastly, the vibrations of an elastic medium, by which they are penetrated and surrounded. Yet whatever be the form or essence of heat, we have discovered a great number of its properties and its laws; and have done so, by pursuing with more or less accuracy the method of induction. We have also this consolation for the imperfection of our theoretical knowledge, that, in as much as art is concerned, or the possession of power over heat, we have perhaps all the advantages that could be obtained from a complete knowledge of its essence.\n\nAn equal degree of mystery hangs over the other properties and modifications of body; light, electricity, magnetism, elasticity, gravity, are all in the same circumstances; and the only advance that philosophy has made toward the discovery of the essences of these qualities or substances is, by exploding some theories, rather than by establishing any,\u2014so true is Bacon's maxim, that the first steps in philosophy necessarily consist in negative propositions. Besides this, in all the above instances the laws of action have been ascertained; the phenomena have been reduced to a few general facts, and in some cases, as in that of gravity, to one only; and for aught that yet appears, this is the highest point which our science is destined to reach.\n\nIn consequence of supposing a greater perfection in knowledge than is ever likely to be attained, Bacon appears, in some respects, to have misapprehended the way in which it is ultimately to become applicable to art. He conceives that, if the form of any quality were known, we should be able, by inducing that form on any body, to communicate to it the said quality. It is not probable, however, that this would often lead to a more easy and simple process than that which art has already invented. In the case of colour, for example, though ignorant of its form, or of the construction of surface which enables bodies to reflect only light of a particular species, yet we know how to communicate that power from one body to another. Nor is it likely, though this structure were known with ever so great precision, that we should be able to impart it to bodies by any means so simple and easy, as by the common process of immersing them in a liquid of a given colour.\n\nIn some instances, however, the theories of Chemistry have led to improvements of art very conformable to the anticipations of the Novum Organum. A remarkable instance of this occurs in the process for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BLEACHING\">bleaching</a>, invented by Berthollet. It had been for some time known, that the combination of the chemical principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> with the colouring matter in bodies, destroyed or discharged the colour; and that, in the common process of bleaching, it was chiefly by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of the oxygen of the air with the colouring matter in the cloth that this effect was produced. The excellent chemist just named conceived, therefore, that if the oxygen could be presented to the cloth in a dense state, and, at the same time, feebly combined with any other body, it might unite itself to the colouring matter so readily, that the process of bleaching would by that means be greatly accelerated. His skill in Chemistry suggested to him a way in which this might easily be done, by immersing the cloth in a liquid containing much oxygen in a loose state, or one in which it was\nslightly combined with other substances; and the effect followed so exactly, that he was able to perform in a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> what required weeks, and even months, according to the common process. This improvement, therefore, was a real gift from the sciences to the arts; and came nearly, though not altogether, up to the ideas of Bacon. I suspect not altogether, because the manner in which oxygen destroys the colour of bodies, or alters the structure of their surfaces, remains quite unknown.\n\nIt was natural, however, that Bacon, who studied these subjects theoretically, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> nowhere any practical result in which he could confide, should listen to the inspirations of his own genius, and ascribe to philosophy a perfection which it may be destined never to attain. He knew, that from what it had not yet done, he could conclude nothing against what it might hereafter accomplish. But after his method has been followed, as it has now been, with greater or less accuracy, for more than two hundred years, circumstances are greatly changed, and the impediments which, during all that time, have not yielded in the least to any effort, are perhaps never likely to be removed. This may, however, be a rash inference; Bacon, after all, may be in the right; and we may be judging under the influence of the vulgar prejudice, which has convinced men in every age, that they had nearly reached the farthest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-VERGE\">verge</a> of human knowledge. This must be left for the decision of posterity; and we should rejoice to think, that judgment will hereafter be given against the opinion which at this moment appears most probable.","sp":660,"ep":700},{"h":"NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a> A, p. 305.\n\nThe remarks of Cicero <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ON\">on</a> the Stoicism of Cato are perhaps the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> specimen of that refined raillery which attains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of the orator without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> injustice to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> whose authority is for the moment to be abated.\n\n\"Accessit his doctrina non moderata, nec mitis, sed, ut mihi videtur, paulo asperior et durior quam aut veritas aut natura patiatur.\" After an enumeration of the Stoical paradoxes, he adds: \"Haec homo ingeniosissimus M.

I extract also the introduction as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of the manner in which an historian may state a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> dispute which has influenced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> affairs; but far more because it is an unparalleled example of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a> and forbearance in the narrative of a contest of which the historian was himself a victim.\n\n\"Habuit hic annus (1608) haud spernendi quoque mali semina, vix ut arma desierant, exorto publice religionis dissidio, latentibus initis, sed ut paulatim in majus crumeret. Lugduni sacras literas docebat viri eruditione prestantes Gomarus et Arminius, quorum ille \u00e6terna Dei lege fixum memorabat, cui hominum salus destinaretur, quis in exitium tenderet; inde alios ad pietatem trahi, et tractos custodiri ne elabantur; reliqui alios communi humanitatis vitio et suis crimibus involutos: hic vero contra integram judicem, sed eundem optimum patrem, id reorum fecisse discrimen, ut peccandi pert\u00e6sis fiduciamque in Christum reponentibus veniam ac vitam daret, contumacibus poenam; Deoque gratum, ut omnes resipiscant, ac meliora edocti retineant; sed cogi neminem. Accusatabantque invicem; Arminius Gomaram, quod peccandi causas Deo ascriberet, ac fati persuasione teneret immobiles animos; Gomarus Arminium, quod longius ipsis Romanensium scitis hominem arrogantia impleret, nec patetur soli Deo acceptam ferri, rem maximam, bonam mentem. Constat his quies cura legere veterum libros, antiquos Christianorum tribuisse hominum voluntati vim liberam, tam in acceptanda, quam in retinenda disciplina; unde sua praemiis ac suppliciis aquitas. Neque idem tamen omisere cuncta divinam ad bonitatem referre, cujus munere salutare semen ad nos pervenisset, ac cujus singulari auxilio pericula nostra indigerent. Primus omnium Augustinus, ex quo ipsi cum Pelagio et eum secutis certamen (nam <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANTE\">ante</a> aliter et ipse senserat), acer disputandi, ita libertatis vocem reliquere, ut ei decreta quedam Dei praeponeret, quae vim ipsam destruere videbantur. At per Graeciam quidem Asiamque retenta vetus illa ae simplicior sententia. Per occidentem magnum Augustini nomen multos traxit in consensum, repertis tamen per Galliam et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALIBI\">alibi</a> qui se opponerent. Posterioribus s\u00e6cu-\nlis, cum schola non alio magis quam Augustino doctore uteretur, quis ipsi sensus, quis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEXTER\">dexter</a> pugnare visa conciliandi modus, diu inter Francisci et Dominici familiae disputato, doctissimi Jesuitarum, cum exactiori subtilitate nodum solvere laborassent, Romae accusati regre damnationem effugerent. At Protestantium princeps, Lutherus, egressus monasterio quod Augustini ut nomen, ita sensus sequebatur, parte Augustini arrepta, id quod est reliquerat, libertatis nomen, coepit excendere; quod tam <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> Erasmo visum, ut cum cetera ipsius aut probaret aut silentio transmitteret, hic objicat sese: cujus argumentis motus Philippus Melanchthon, Lutheri adjutor, quae prius scripserat immutavit, auctorique fuit Luthero, quod multi volunt, certe quod constat Lutheranis, deserendi decreta rigida et conditionem respuentia; sic tamen ut libertatis vocabulum quam rem magis perhorrescere. At in altera Protestantium parte dux Calvinus, primis Lutheri dictis in hac controversia inhaerescens, novis ea fulsit praesidiis, addiditique intactum Augustino, veram ae salutarem fidem rem esse perpetuam et amitti nesciam: cujus proinde qui sibi essent consci, eos aeternae felicitatis jam nunc certos esse, quos <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTERIM\">interim</a> in crimina, quantumvis gravis, prolabi posse non diffitebatur. Auxit sententiae rigorem Genevae Beza, per Germaniam Zanchius, Ursinus, Piscator, saepe eo usque provecti, ut, quod alii anxie vitaverant, apertius nonnunquam tradere, etiam peccandi necessitatem a prima causa pendere: quae ampla Lutheranis criminandi materia.\u201d (H. Grotti Hist. lib. xvii. p. 552.)\n\nNote C, p. 309.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALVINISM\">Calvinism</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-OR\">or</a> rather Augustinianism, of Aquinas, is placed beyond all doubt by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>:\u2014\u201cPr\u00e6destinatio est causa gratiae et gloriae.\u201d (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OPERA\">Opera</a>, VII. 356, edit. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. 1664.)\n\u201cNumerus pr\u00e6destinatorum certus est.\u201d (Ibid. 363.)\n\u201cPr\u00e6scientia meritorum nullo modo est causa pr\u00e6destinationis divinis.\u201d (Ibid. 370.)\n\u201cLiberrum arbitrium est facultas qua bonum eligitur, gratia assistente, vel malum, eadem desistente.\u201d (Ibid. VIII. 222.)\n\n\u201cDeus inclinat ad bonum administrando virtutem agendi et monendo ad bonum. Sed ad malum dicitur inclinare in quantum gratiam non praebet, per quam aliquis a malo retrahere tur.\u201d (Ibid. 364.)\n\nOn the other side:\n\u201cAccipitur <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FIDES\">fides</a> pro eo quo creditur, et est virtus, et pro eo quo creditur, et non est virtus. Fides qua creditur, si cum caritate sit, virtus est.\u201d (Ibid. IX. 236.)\n\n\u201cDivina bonitas est primum principium communicationis totius quam Deus creaturis largitur.\u201d\n\u201cQuamvis omne quod Deus vult justum sit, non tamen ex hoc justum dicitur quod Deus illud vult.\u201d (Ibid. 697.)\n\nNote D, p. 309.\n\nThe Augustinian doctrine is, with some hesitation and reluctance, acquiesced in by Scotus, in that milder form which ascribes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> to an express <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a>, and considers the rest of mankind as only left to the deserved penalties of their transgressions. \u201cIn hujus questionis solutione mallem alios audire quam docere.\u201d (Scotii Opera, V. 1329. Lugd. 1639.) This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> is foreign from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DOGMATICAL\">dogmatical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of a Schoolman; and these qualities are still more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> in the very remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> which he applies to the tremendous doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REPROBATION\">reprobation</a>. \u201cEorum autem non miseretur (sic. Deus) quibus gratiam non praebendam esse aquilate occultissima et ab humanis sensibus remotissima judicat.\u201d (Ibid. 1329.) In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> on Scotus which follows, it appears that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> Ockham disputed very freely against the opinions of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>. \u201cMala fieri bonum est\u201d is a startling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a>, quoted by Scotus from Augustin. (Ibid. 1381.) It appears that Ockham <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between election and reprobation, and considered those who embraced only the former as at variance with themselves. (Ibid. 1313.)\n\nScotus, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, contends that our thoughts (consequently our opinions) are not subject to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a>. (VI. 1054\u20131056.) One step more would have led him to acknowledge that all erroneous judgment is involuntary, and there-\nfore inculpable and unpunishable, however pernicious.\n\nHis attempt to reconcile foreknowledge with contingency (V. 1309\u20131327), is a remarkable example of the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> subtlety to keep up the appearance of a struggle where it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to make one real effort.\n\nBut the most dangerous of all the deviations of Scotus from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of Aquinas is, that he opened the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and wrong depends on the mere will of the Eternal Mind. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> power of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, according to him, extends to all but contradictions. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> power (ordinata) is exercised conformably to an order established by himself; \"si placet voluntati, sub qua <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIBERA\">libera</a> est, recta est lex.\" (Scot. V. 1368, et seq.)\n\nNote E, p. 309.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> is quoted on this subject by Marcus Aurelius, in a manner which shows, if there had been any doubt, the meaning to be, that all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> is involuntary.\n\nAugustin closes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> line of ancient testimony to the involuntary character of error: \"Quis est qui velit decipi? Fallere nolunt boni; falli autem nec boni volunt nec mali.\" (Aug. Serm. de Verbo.)\n\nNote F, p. 310.\n\nFrom a long, able, and instructive dissertation by the commentator on Scotus, it appears that this immoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOGMA\">dogma</a> was propounded in terms more bold and startling by Ockham, who openly affirmed, that \"moral evil was only evil because it was prohibited.\" \"Ockhamus, qui putat quod nihil posset esse malum sine voluntate prohibitive Dei, haneque voluntatem esse liberam; sic ut posset eam non habere, et consequenter ut posset fieri quod nul-\n\nla prorsus essent mala.\" (Scot. VII. p. 859.)\n\nBut, says the commentator, \"Dico primo legem naturalem non consistere in jussione ulla que sit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTUS\">actus</a> voluntatis Dei. Haec est communissima theologorum sententia.\" (Scot. VII. p. 858.)\n\nAnd indeed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> urged against Ockham completely justifies this approach to unanimity. \"For,\" he asks, \"why is it right to obey the will of God? Is it because our moral faculties perceive it to be right? But they equally perceive and feel the authority of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> principles of morality; and if this answer be made, it is obvious that those who make it do in effect admit the independence of moral distinctions on the will of God.\"\n\n\"If God,\" said Ockham, \"had commanded his creatures to hate himself, hatred of God would have been praiseworthy.\" (Domin. Soto de Justitia et Jure, lib. ii. quest. 3, \"Utrum precepta Decalogi sint dispensabilia;\" a book dedicated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Carlos, the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> II.) Suarez, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCHOLASTIC\">scholastic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, rejected the Ockhamical doctrine, but allowed will to be a part of the foundation of morality. \"Voluntas Dei non est tota <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> bonitatis aut mali\u00e6.\" (Suarez de Legibus, lib. ii. 66, p. 71. edit. Lond. 1679.)\n\nAs the great majority of the Schoolmen supported their opinion of this subject by the consideration of eternal and immutable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of right and wrong in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>, it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOMINALISTS\">Nominalists</a>, of whom Ockham was the founder, who rejected all general ideas, should also have rejected those moral distinctions which were then supposed to originate in such ideas. Gerson was a celebrated Nominalist; and he was the more disposed to follow the opinions of his master, because they agreed in maintaining the independence of the State on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a>, and the superiority of the Church over the Pope.\n\nNote G, p. 310.\n\nIt must be premised that Charitas among the ancient divines corresponded with \u0395\u1f30\u03c3\u03af\u03c2 of the Platonists, and with the \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1 of later philosophers, as comprehending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of all that is lovable in the Creator or his creatures. It is the theological <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>, and corre-\nsponds with no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> in use among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> moralists. \"Cum objectum amoris sit bonum, dupliciter potest aliquis tendere in bonum aliquius rei; uno modo, quod bonum illius rei ad alterum referat, sicut amat quis vinnum in quantum dulcedinem vini peropit; et hic amor vocatur a quibusdam amor concupiscentiae. Amor autem iste non terminatur ad rem qua dicitur amari, sed reflectitur ad rem illam cui optatur bonum illius rei. Alio modo amor fortior in bonum aliquius rei, ita quod ad rem ipsam TERMINATUR; et hic est amor benevolentiae. Qua bonum nostrum in Deo perfectum est, sic ut in causa universali bonorum; ideo bonum in ipso esse magis naturaliter complacet quam in nobis ipsis: et ideo etiam amore amicitiae naturaliter Deus ab homine plus seipso dilitur.\"\n\nThe above quotations from Aquinas will probably be sufficient for those who are acquainted with these questions, and they will certainly be thought too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> by those who are not. In the next question he inquires, whether in the love of God there can be any view to reward. He appears to consider himself as bound by authority to answer in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATIVE\">affirmative</a>; and he employs much ingenuity in reconciling a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of reward with the disinterested character ascribed by him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with all the affections which terminate in other beings.\n\n\"Nihil aliud est merces nostra quam perfraui Deo. Ergo caritas non solum non excludit, sed etiam facit habere oculum ad mercedem.\" In this answer he seems to have anticipated the representations of Jeremy Taylor (Sermon on Growth in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">Grace</a>); of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SHAFTESBURY\">Shaftesbury</a> (Inquiry concerning Virtue, book i. part iii. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. 3); of Mr T. Erskine (Freeness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOSPEL\">Gospel</a>, Edinb. 1828); and more especially of Mr John Smith (Discourses, Lond. 1660). No extracts could convey a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the observations which follow, unless they were accompanied by a longer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> language of the Schoolmen than would be warranted on this occasion. It is clear that he distinguishes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WELL\">well</a> the affection of piety from the happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, which, as he cautiously expresses it, \"are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of a reward,\" just as the consideration of the pleasures and advantages of friendship may enter into the affection and strengthen it, though they are not its objects, and never could inspire such a feeling. It seems to me also that he had a dimmer view of another doctrine, by which we are taught, that though our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> be not the end which we pursue in loving others, yet it may be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> cause of the insertion of disinterested affections into the nature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. \"Ponere mercedem aliquam finem amoris ex parte amati, est contra rationem amicitiae. Sed ponere mercedem esse finem amoris ex parte amantis, non tamen ultimum, prout scilicet ipse amor est quadam operatione amantis, non est contra rationem amicitiae. Possim operationem amoris amare propter aliquid aliud, salva amicitia. Poteat habeas charitatem habere oculum ad mercedem, uti ponat beatitudinem creatam finem amoris, non autem finem amati.\" Upon the last words my interpretation chiefly depends. The immediately preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> must be owned to have been founded on a distinction between viewing the good fruits of our own affections as enhancing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> pleasures, and feeling love for another on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the advantage to be derived from him; which last is inconceivable.\n\nNOTE H, p. 310.\n\n\"Potestas spiritualis et secularis utraque deducitur a potestate divina; ideo in tantum secularis est sub spirituali, in quantum est a Deo supposita; scilicet, in his quae ad salutem animae pertinent. In his autem quae ad bonum civile spectant, est magis obediendum potestati seculari; sic ut illud Matthaei, 'Reddite quae sunt Caesaris Cesari.'\" What follows is more doubtful. \"Nisi forte potestati spirituali etiam potestas secularis conjungatur, ut in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PAPA\">Papa</a>, qui utriusque potestatis apicem tenet.\" (VIII.435.) Here, says the French editor, it may be doubted whether Aquinas means the Pope's temporal power in his own dominions, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> authority indirectly extending over all for the sake of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. My reasons for adopting the more rational <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> are shortly these:\u20141. The text of Matthew is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> an assertion of the independence of both powers, that it would be the height of extravagance to quote it as an authority for the dependence of the state. At\nmost it could only be represented as reconcilable with such a dependence in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>.\n\n2. The word *forte* seems manifestly to refer to the territorial sovereignty acquired by the Popes. If they have a general power in secular affairs, it must be because it is necessary to their spiritual authority; and in that case to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> it fortuitous would be to ascribe to it an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADJUNCT\">adjunct</a> destructive of its nature. 3. His former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> on the same question seems to be decisive. The power of the Pope over bishops, he says, is not founded merely in his superior nature, but in their authority being altogether derived from his, as the proconsular power from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a>. Therefore he infers that this case is not analogous to the relation between the civil and spiritual power, which are alike derived from God. 4. Had an Italian monk of the twelfth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> really intended to affirm the Pope's temporal authority, he probably would have laid it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in terms more explicit and more acceptable at Rome. Hesitation and ambiguity are here indications of unbelief. Mere veneration for the apostolical see might present a more precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> against it, as it caused the quotation which follows, respecting the primacy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>. (*Aquin. Opera*, VIII. 434, 435.)\n\nA mere abridgement of these very curious passages might excite a suspicion that I had tinctured Aquinas unconsciously with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of my own opinions. Extracts are very difficult, from the scholastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of stating objections and answers, as well as from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of theological authorities with philosophical reasons.\n\n**Note I**, p. 312.\n\nThe debates in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a> (1546), between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOMINICANS\">Dominicans</a> who adhered to Aquinas, and the Franciscans who followed Scotus on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> sin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a>, and grace, are to be found in Fra Paolo, *Istoria del Concilio Tridentino*, lib. ii. They show how much metaphysical controversy is hid in a theological form, how many disputes of our times are of no very ancient origin, and how strongly the whole western church, through all the divisions into which it has been separated, has manifested the same unwillingness to avow the Augustinian system, and the same fear of contradicting it. To his admirably clear and short statement of these abstruse controversies, must be added that of his accomplished opponent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Pallavicino (lib. vii. and viii.), who shows still more evidently the strength of the Augustinian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a>, and the disposition of the Council to tolerate opinions almost Lutheran, if not accompanied by revolt from the Church. A little more compromising disposition in the Reformers might have betrayed reason to a prolonged thraldom. We must esteem Erasmus and Melanchthon, but we should reserve our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a> and Calvin. The Scotists maintained their doctrine of merit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONGRUITY\">congruity</a>, waived by the Council, and soon after condemned by the Church of England; by which they meant that they who had good dispositions always received the divine grace, not indeed as a reward of which they were worthy, but as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> which they were fit and willing to receive. The Franciscans denied that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> was in the power of man. \"I Francescani lo negavano seguendo Scoeto, qual vuole che siccome dalle dimostrazioni per necessit\u00e0 nasce la scienza, cos\u00ec dalle persuasioni nasca la fede; e ch'essa \u00e8 nell'intelletto, il quale \u00e8 agente naturale, e mosso naturalmente dall'oggetto.

(See a criticism on Mr Stewart's\nDissertation, Edinb. Review, XXXVI. 255.)\nMore careful reflection has corrected a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>\ncommon to him with most writers on the sub-\nject. What is called Sublapsarian Calvinism,\nwhich was the doctrine of the most eminent\nmen, including Augustin and Calvin himself,\nascribed to God, and to man before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, what\nis called free-will, which they even own still to\nexist in all the ordinary acts of life, though it\nbe lost with respect to religious morality. The\ndecree of election, on this scheme, arises from\nGod's foreknowledge that man was to fall, and\nthat all men became thereby with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> liable\nto eternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. The election of some to\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of divine goodness, and the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRETERITION\">preterition</a> of the rest was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> and justice.\n\nThis sublapsarian predestination is evidently irreconcilable with the doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, which considers free-will, or volitions not caused by motives, as absolutely inconsistent with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of an intelligent being, which is, that he acts from a motive, or, in other words, with a purpose.\n\nThe supralapsarian scheme, which represents the fall itself as fore-ordained, may indeed be built on necessitarian principles. But on that scheme original sin seems wholly to lose that importance which the former system gives it as a revolution in the state of the world, requiring an interposition of divine power to remedy a part of its fatal effects. It becomes no more than the first link in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of predestined offences. Yet both Catholic and Protestant predestinarians have borrowed the arguments and distinctions of philosophical necessitarians.\n\nOne of the propositions of Jansenius, condemned by the bull of Innocent X. in 1653, is, that \"to merit or demerit in a state of lapsed nature, it is not necessary that there should be in man a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> free from necessity; it is sufficient that there be a liberty free from constraint.\" (Dupin, Histoire de l'\u00c9glise en abr\u00e9g\u00e9, si\u00e8cle xvii, livre iv, chap. viii, p. 193.) Luther, in his once famous treatise de Servo Arbitrio against Erasmus (printed in 1526), expresses himself as follows: \"Hic est fidei summus gradus, credere illum esse elementem qui tam paucos salvat, tam multos damnat; credere justum qui sua voluntate nos necessario damnabiles facit, ut videatur, ut Erasmus refert, delectari cruciatiibus miserorum, et odio potius quam amore dignus.\" My <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of this stern and abusive book is not paged. In another passage, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a> the distinction between co-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> and necessity as familiar a hundred and thirty years before it was proposed by Hobbes, or condemned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JANSENISTS\">Jansenists</a>. \"Necessario dico, non coacte, sed, ut illi dicunt, necessitate immutabilitatis, non coactionis; hoc est, homo, cum vocat Spiritus Dei, non quidem violentia, velut raptus obtorto collo, nolens facit malum, quemadmodum fur aut latro nolens ad penam ducitur, sed sponte et libera voluntate facit.\" He uses also the illustration of Hobbes, from the difference between a stream forced out of its course and freely flowing in its channel.\n\nNote P, p. 352.\n\nThough some parts of the substance of the following letter have already appeared in various forms, perhaps the account of Mr Hume's illness, in the words of his friend and physician Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>, will be acceptable to many readers. I owe it to the kindness of Mrs Baillie, who had the goodness to copy it from the original, in the collection of her late learned and excellent husband, Dr Baillie. Some portion of what has been formerly published I do not think it necessary to reprint.\n\nFrom Dr Cullen to Dr Hunter.\n\n\"My Dear Friend,\u2014I was favoured with yours by Mr Halket on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a>, and have answered some part of it by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> whom I was otherwise obliged to write by; but as I was not certain how soon that might come to your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, I did not answer your postscript; in doing which, if I can oblige you, a part of the merit must be that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> being early, and I therefore give it you as soon as I possibly could. You desire an account of Mr Hume's last days, and I give it you with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; for though I could not look upon him in his illness without much concern, yet the tranquillity and pleasantry which he constantly discovered did even then give me satisfaction, and, now that the curtain is dropped, allows me to indulge the less allayed reflection. He was truly an example des grands hommes qui sont morts en plaisantant....For many weeks before his death he was very sensible of his gradual decay; and his answer to inquiries after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> was, several times, that he was going as fast as his enemies could wish, and as easily as his friends could desire. He was not, however, without a frequent recurrence of pain and uneasiness; but he passed most part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>-room, admitted the visits of his friends, and, with his usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>, conversed with them upon literature, politics, or whatever else was accidentally started. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> he seemed to be per-\nfectly at ease, and to the last abounded with that pleasantry; and those curious and entertaining anecdotes, which ever distinguished him. This, however, I always considered rather as an effort to be agreeable; and he at length acknowledged that it became too much for his strength. For a few days before his death, he became more averse to receive visits; speaking became more and more difficult for him, and for twelve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> before his death his speech failed altogether. His senses and judgment did not fail till the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of his life. He constantly discovered a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> and care of his friends; and, amidst great uneasiness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANGUOR\">languor</a>, never betrayed any peevishness or impatience. This is a general account of his last days; but a particular fact or two may perhaps convey to you a still better idea of them.\n\nAbout a fortnight before his death, he added a codicil to his will, in which he fully discovered his attention to his friends, as well as his own pleasantry. What little wine he himself drank was generally port, a wine for which his friend the poet [John Home] had ever declared the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> bequeaths to his friend John one bottle of port; and, upon condition of his drinking this even at two down-sittings, bestows upon him twelve dozen of his best claret. He pleasantly adds, that this subject of wine was the only one upon which they had ever differed. In the codicil there are several other strokes of raillery and pleasantry, highly expressive of the cheerfulness which he then enjoyed. He even turned his attention to some of the simple amusements with which he had been formerly pleased. In the neighbourhood of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol4.html#article-BERWICKSHIRE\">Berwickshire</a> is a brook, by which the access in time of floods is frequently interrupted. Mr Hume bequeaths L.100 for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> over this brook; but upon the express condition that none of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> for that purpose shall be taken from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a> in the neighbourhood, which forms part of a romantic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> in which, in his earlier days, Mr Hume took particular delight. Otherwise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> to go to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>.\n\n\"These are a few particulars which may perhaps appear trifling; but to me no particulars seem trifling that relate to so great a man. It is perhaps from trifles that we can best distinguish the tranquillity and cheerfulness of the philosopher, at a time when the most part of mankind are under disquiet, anxiety, and sometimes even horror....I had gone so far when I was called to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and I have returned only so long before the post as to say, that I am most affectionately yours,\n\n\"William Cullen.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, 17th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 1776.\"\n\nNote Q, p. 353.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PYRRHO\">Pyrrho</a> was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> his scepticism so far as not to avoid a carriage if it was driven against him. \u00c6nesidemus, the most famous of ancient sceptics, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> vindicates the more ancient doubter from such lunacy, of which indeed his having lived to the age of ninety seems sufficient to acquit him. (Diog. Laert. lib. ix. sect. 62.)\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">Brief</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> as our accounts of ancient scepticism are, it does appear that their reasoning on the subject of causation had some resemblance to that of Mr Hume. (Ibid. ix. sect. 97.) It is perhaps impossible to translate the important technical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> \u03c4\u03b1 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b5\u03be\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1. It comprehends two or more things as related to each other\u2014both the relative and correlative taken together as such. Fire considered as having the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> wood is \u03c4\u03bf \u1f10\u03c0\u03b5\u03be\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1. The words of Laertius may therefore be nearly rendered into the language of modern philosophy as follows: \"Causation they take away thus. A cause is so only in relation to an effect. What is relative is only conceived, but does not exist. Therefore cause is a mere conception.\"\n\nThe first attempt to prove the necessity of belief in a divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>, by demonstrating that natural reason leads to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> scepticism, was made by Algazel, a professor at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BAGDAD\">Bagdad</a>, in\nthe beginning of the twelfth century of our era; whose work entitled *The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">Destruction</a> of the Philosopher* is known to us only by the answer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AVERROES\">Averroes</a>, called *Destruction of the Destruction*. He denied a necessary connection between cause and effect; for of two separate things, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of one does not necessarily contain the affirmation of the existence of the other; and the same may be said of denial. It is curious enough that this argument was more especially pointed against those Arabian philosophers who, from the necessary connection of causes and effects, reasoned against the possibility of miracles; thus anticipating one doctrine of Mr Hume, to impugn another. (*Tenneman, Gesch. der Phil.* VIII. 387.)\n\nThe same attempt was made by the learned but unphilosophical Huet, bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AVRANCHES\">Avranches</a> (*Questiones Alenanae*, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAEN\">Caen</a>, 1690, and *Trait\u00e9 de la Foiblisse de l'Esprit Humain*, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a>, 1723). A similar motive urged Berkeley to his attack on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLUXIONS\">Fluxions</a>. The attempt of Huet has been lately renewed by the Abb\u00e9 Lamennais, in his treatise on *Religious Indifference*; a fine writer, whose apparent reasonings amount to little more than well-varied assertions, and well-disguised assumptions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> to be proved.\n\nTo build religion upon scepticism is the most extravagant of all attempts; for it destroys the proofs of a divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MISSION\">mission</a>, and leaves no natural means of distinguishing between revelation and imposture. The Abb\u00e9 Lamennais represents authority as the sole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> of belief. Why? If any reason can be given, the proposition must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>; if none, it is obviously a mere groundless assertion.\n\n**Note R**, p. 356.\n\nCasanova, a Venetian doomed to solitary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPRISONMENT\">imprisonment</a> in the dungeons at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> in 1755, thus speaks of the only books which for a time he was allowed to read.

They are also the most conspicuous landmarks in the progress of the sciences to which they relate. It is remarkable that the defects of all these great works are very similar. The leading notions of none of them can, in the strictest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, be said to be original, though Locke and Smith in that respect surpass their illustrious rivals. All of them employ great care in ascertaining those laws which are immediately deduced from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, or directly applicable to practice; but apply metaphysical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> principles with considerable negligence. None pursues the order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, beginning with first elements, and advancing to more and more complicated conclusions; though Locke is perhaps less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> in method than the rest. All admit digressions which, though often intrinsically excellent, distract attention, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the chain of thought. None of them is happy in the choice, or constant in the use, of technical terms; and in none do we find much of that rigorous precision which is the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of philosophical language. Grotius and Montesquieu were imitators of Tacitus,\u2014the first with more gravity, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> with more vivacity; but both were tempted to forsake the simple diction of science, in pursuit of the poignant brevity which that great historian has carried to a vicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a>. Locke and Smith chose an easy, clear, and free, but somewhat loose and verbose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>\u2014more concise in Locke\u2014more elegant in Smith,\u2014in both exempt from pedantry, but not void of ambiguity and repetition.

(Ibid. II. 86.) If the latter word be applied to time as well as space, and considered as comprehending causation, the enumeration will coincide with that of Hume. The term \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7 is as significant as if it had been chosen by Hobbes. But it is to be observed, that these principles are applied only to explain memory.\n\nSomething has been said on the subject, and something on the present writer, by Mr Coleridge, in his unfortunately unfinished work called Biographia Literaria, chap. v., which seems to justify, if not to require, a few remarks. That learned gentleman seems to have been guilty of an oversight in quoting as a distinct work the Parva Naturalia, which is the collective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a> given by the scholastic translators to those treatises of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> which form the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of Duval's edition of his works, published at Paris in 1639. I have already acknowledged the striking resemblance of Mr Hume's principles of association to those of Aristotle. In answer, however, to a remark of Mr Coleridge, I must add, that the manuscript of a part of Aquinas which I bought many years ago (on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of a bookseller's catalogue) as being written by Mr Hume, was not a copy of the Commentary on the Parva Naturalia, but of Aquinas's own Secunda Secundae; and that, on examination, it proves not to be the handwriting of Mr Hume, and to contain nothing written by him. It is certain that, in the passages immediately preceding the quotation, Aristotle explains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> as depending on a general law,\u2014that the idea of\nan object will remind us of the objects which immediately preceded or followed when originally perceived. But what Mr Coleridge has not told us is, that the Stagyrite confines the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of this law exclusively to the phenomena of recollection alone, without any glimpse of a more general operation extending to all connections of thought and feeling,\u2014a wonderful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, indeed, even so limited, of the sagacity of the great philosopher, but which for many ages <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> barren of further consequences. The illustrations of Aquinas throw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the original doctrine, and show that it was unenlarged in his time. \"When we recollect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>, the thought of Plato occurs 'as like him.' When we remember <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HECTOR\">Hector</a>, the thought of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACHILLES\">Achilles</a> occurs 'as contrary.' The idea of a father is followed by that of a son 'as near.'\" (Aquinas Opera, I. pars ii. p. 62, et seq.) Those of Ludovicus Vives, as quoted by Mr Coleridge, extend no farther.\n\nBut if Mr Coleridge will compare the parts of Hobbes on Human Nature which relate to this subject, with those which explain general terms, he will perceive that the philosopher of Malmesbury builds on these two foundations a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the human understanding, of which reasoning is only a particular case. In consequence of the assertion of Mr Coleridge, that Hobbes was anticipated by Descartes in his excellent and interesting discourse on Method, I have twice reperused that work in quest of this remarkable anticipation, though, as I thought, well acquainted by my old studies with the writings of that great philosopher. My labour has, however, been vain. I have discovered no trace of that or of any similar speculation. My edition is in Latin by Elzevir, at Amsterdam, in 1650, the year of Descartes's death. I am obliged, therefore, to conjecture that Mr Coleridge, having mislaid his references, has, by mistake, quoted the discourse on Method, instead of another work; which would affect his inference from the priority of Descartes to Hobbes. It is not to be denied, that the opinion of Aristotle, repeated by so many commentators, may have found its way into the mind of Hobbes, and also of Hume; though neither might be aware of its source, or even conscious that it was not originally his own. Yet the very narrow view of association by Locke, his apparently treating it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, and the silence of common books respecting it, afford a presumption that the Peripatetic doctrine was so little known, that it might have escaped the notice of these philosophers, one of whom boasted that he was unread, and the other is not liable to the suspicion of unacknowledged borrowing.\n\nTo Mr Coleridge, who distrusts his own power of building a bridge by which his ideas may pass into a mind so differently trained as mine, I venture to suggest, with that sense of his genius which no circumstance has hindered me from seizing every fit occasion to manifest, that more of my early years were employed in contemplations of an abstract nature, than of those of the majority of his readers; that there are not, even now, many of them less likely to be repelled from doctrines by singularity or uncouthness; more willing to allow that every system has caught an advantageous glimpse of some side or corner of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>; more desirous of exhibiting this dispersion of the fragments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> by attempts to translate the doctrine of one school into the language of another;\u2014who, when he cannot discover a reason for an opinion, considers it as important to discover the causes of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> by the philosopher; believing, in the most unfavourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, that one of the most arduous and useful researches of mental philosophy is to explore the subtle illusions which enable great minds to satisfy themselves by mere words, before they deceive others by payment in the same counterfeit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>. These habits, together with the natural influence of my age and avocations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> me to suspect that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> philosophy I am nearer to indifference than to an exclusive spirit. I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> that it can neither be thought presumptuous nor offensive in me to doubt, whether the circumstance of its being found difficult to convey a metaphysical doctrine to a person who, at one part of his life, made such studies his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> pursuit, may not imply either error in the opinion, or defect in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>.\nA very late writer, who seems to speak for Mr Bentham with authority, tells us that \"the first time the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> of 'the principle of utility' was brought decidedly into notice, was in the 'Essays, by David Hume,' published about the year 1742. In that work it is mentioned as the name of a principle which might be made the foundation of a system of morals, in opposition to a system then in vogue, which was founded on what was called the '<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>.' The ideas, however, there attached to it, are vague, and defective in practical application.\" (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> Review, No. xxi.) If these few sentences were scrutinized with the severity and minuteness of Bentham's Fragment on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>, they would be found to contain almost as many misremembrances as assertions. Utility is not \"mentioned,\" but fully discussed, in Mr Hume's Discourse. It is seldom spoken of by \"name.\" Instead of charging it with \"vagueness,\" it would be more just to admire the precision which it combines with beauty. Instead of being \"defective in practical application,\" perhaps the desire of rendering it popular has crowded it with examples and illustrations taken from life. To the assertion that \"it was opposed to the moral sense,\" no reply can be needful but the following words extracted from the Discourse itself: \"I am apt to suspect that reason and sentiment concur in almost all moral determinations and conclusions. The final sentence which pronounces characters and actions amiable or odious, probably depends on some internal sense or feeling, which nature has made universal in the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>.\" (An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, sect. i.) The phrase \"made universal,\" which is here used instead of the more obvious and common word \"implanted,\" shows the anxious and perfect precision of language, by which a philosopher avoids the needless decision of a controversy not at the moment before him.\n\nNote W, p. 380.\n\nA writer of consummate ability, who has failed in little but the respect due to the abilities and character of his opponents, has given too much countenance to the abuse and confusion of language exemplified in the well-known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> of Pope,\n\nModes of self-love the Passions we may call.\n\"We know,\" says he, \"no universal proposition respecting human nature which is true but one\u2014that men always act from self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>.\" (Edinburgh Review, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1829.) It is manifest from the sequel, that the writer is not the dupe of the confusion; but many of his readers may be so. If, indeed, the word self-interest could with propriety be used for the gratification of every prevalent desire, he has clearly shown that this change in the signification of terms would be of no advantage to the doctrine which he controverts. It would make as many sorts of self-interest as there are appetites, and it is irreconcilably at variance with the system of association embraced by Mr Mill. To the word self-love <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a> properly assigns two significations: 1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">Gross</a> self-love, which consists in the pursuit of the greatest pleasures, from all those desires which look to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> gratification; or, 2. refined self-love, which seeks the greatest pleasure which can arise from all the desires of human nature,\u2014the latter of which is an invaluable, though inferior principle. The admirable writer whose language has occasioned this illustration, who at an early age has mastered every species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, will doubtless hold fast to simplicity, which survives all the fashions of deviation from it, and which a man of a genius so fertile has few temptations to forsake.","sp":642,"ep":655},{"h":"RICHARD PRICE","t":"About the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TIME\">time</a> with the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of Smith, but with a popular reception very different, Dr Richard Price, an excellent and eminent non-conformist minister, published A Review of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> Questions in Morals;\u2014an attempt to revive the intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of\n\n---\n\n1 Born in 1723; died in 1791.\n2 The third edition was published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> in 1787.\nmoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a>, which seemed to have fallen under the attacks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>, Hutcheson, and Hume, even before Smith.

The most curious and difficult portion, however, of the Greek Geometry, has unfortunately been transmitted to us in a mutilated and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> state, which has often tortured the skill of commentators and mathematicians to restore it. Soon after the revival of letters, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> works of the Greek Geometers were translated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> by Commandine; but of Apollonius' Conics several books are wanting, and some parts of the Collections of Pappus exhibit only detached fragments. Near the close of the sixteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, and early in the seventeenth, Vieta, from a few scattered hints, restored the lost Tract on Tangencies, Fermat framed some beautiful separate demonstrations, and Snellius reproduced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLANE\">Plane</a> Loci, but in a tasteless shape. Soon afterwards Viviani, the surviving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Galileo, supplied the fifth book of Apollonius, and with such remarkable\nsuccess, that on comparing his production with an Arabic version <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> then discovered, he appeared to have surpassed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>. Huygens afterwards gave, in the purest taste, some specimens of the Ancient Geometry. A Collection of the Mathematical Treatises of the Greeks respecting the Art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAR\">War</a> was now published in a magnificent folio from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Press at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. But a more extensive undertaking was planned by our oriental traveller Bernard, to print at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of the Greek Geometers, filling up the blanks from the inspection of Arabic Manuscripts. In pursuance of this scheme, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Gregory edited Euclid, and Dr Halley Apollonius, while he restored likewise the Tracts on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECTION\">Section</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RATIO\">Ratio</a> and of Space. After an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of fourscore years, Torelli's elegant edition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, purchased in Italy, has issued from the same press. Every lover of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> would rejoice to see a portion of those ample funds that have been provided at Oxford for the encouragement of such expensive works, appropriated to the republication of Pappus' Mathematical Collections, of which several manuscripts exist far more complete than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> printed by Commandine.\n\nThe relish for the Ancient Geometry has been\n\n---\n\n1 Born at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAGUE\">Hague</a> in 1629, and son of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> of Zuyllichen, Secretary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>; completed his mathematical studies at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> under Schooten, and printed a beautiful tract on the Circle and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPERBOLA\">Hyperbola</a> in 1651. But after visiting different countries, he published in 1658 his original and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOROLOGIUM\">Horologium</a> Oscillatorium. Having successfully applied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> to regulate the motions of clocks and watches, he was anxious to accommodate these instruments to the finding of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. For that purpose he visited England, where he was treated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>; but returning in 1653 through France, he was induced by the Minister Colbert to accept of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> pension, and fix his abode at Paris. There he resided till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> became impaired, and in 1661 he retired to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> near his native country. The same pursuits, however, engaged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> at the Hague on the 8th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1695. He was one of the clearest writers and most elegant geometers of modern times, and his powers of invention have seldom been surpassed. The finished works of Huygens have been collected at two several times into three quarto volumes.\n\n2 Nephew to the famous James Gregory, born at Aberdeen in 1661, completed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, and was appointed Professor of Mathematics in that University in 1663, the office having been suffered to remain vacant for eight years after the death of his uncle. In 1691 he had sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> to obtain the Savilian professorship at Oxford, and had the honorary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> in Physick conferred on him by the University. He published his Elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a> in 1702, and in the following year brought out his Edition of Euclid. He had made some progress in preparing the Conics of Apollonius, but fell a sacrifice in 1719 to an attack of malignant small-pox, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAIDENHEAD\">Maidenhead</a>, where he chanced to stop at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INN\">Inn</a>, on his return from a visit to Bath. He possessed some learning, but his genius was of a very inferior order to that of his uncle.\n\n3 Edmund Halley, born in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 29, 1656, the son of a substantial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITIZEN\">citizen</a>\u2014educated at St Paul's school, and sent to Oxford in 1673\u2014sailed for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of St Helena in November 1676, and returned with his catalogue of fixed stars after an absence of exactly two years\u2014elected immediately fellow of the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, and deputed by that learned body in 1679 to visit Hevelius, at Dantzig, and examine his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a>\u2014spent the years 1680 and 1681 in France and Italy. In 1684, having turned his attention to Kepler's problem, he tried, as some other mathematicians about this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TIME\">time</a> had done, to derive it from a graduating central force, but was unable to find a geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>; and not obtaining any help as he expected in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> from Hooke or Wren, he had recourse to Newton, who astonished him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a> by the store of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> discoveries, condensed into eight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> propositions. He overcame the scruples of the modest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, and prevailed with him to arrange the materials of the Principia, of which he superintended the publication in 1687, having written the preface and some elegant recommendatory verses. Halley now gave a geometrical construction of the higher equations, computed the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, and revised tables of life <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANNUITIES\">annuities</a>. For the purpose of improving Nautical Science, he took the command of the Paramour Pink, with which he sailed from England on the 14th November 1688, traversed the Atlantic, and crossed the Equinoctial Line; but his crew growing sick and mutinous, he was obliged to return to England the following June. Invested with fuller powers, he set sail again in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>, and spent twelve months in exploring both hemispheres, and during the year after his return, he delineated and published his famous astronomical chart. He was next employed on a survey of the British Channel, and then sent by the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a> to assist her ally the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> of Germany in forming a harbour at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the Adriatic. On his return he was appointed, in November 1703, Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford, having been thwarted before in a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CANVASS\">canvass</a> by clerical influence. He now set about recovering the works of Apollonius; studied as much Arabic as enabled him to translate the tract on the Section of Ratio, and he restored the other tract on the Section of Space from the hints left by Pappus. These pieces, in a small octavo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, appeared in 1706; but four years afterwards came forth, in a splendid folio, his edition of the Conics, with the eighth book restored, and the additional treatise of Serenus. In 1719 Halley was appointed astronomer royal, and resided at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a> during the rest of his life, devoting his advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> to the careful and assiduous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of the Heavens. He completed even his projected task of embracing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of eighteen years. A paralytic disorder seized him in 1737, from which he partially recovered, but his strength declined insensibly, and he expired on the 14th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1742. Few philosophers have contributed more largely to the advancement of useful knowledge. Ingenuity, ardour, indefatigable perseverance, learning, and general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>, were possessed by Dr Halley in a most eminent degree; and having mingled in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> scenes of life, he had the rare advantage of combining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> with the habits of social intercourse.\n\n4 Born in 1721 at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VERONA\">Verona</a>, where he died in 1781. He studied at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a>, and became a great linguist, a good mathematician, and an excellent critical scholar. Being in easy circumstances, he devoted his whole time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> pursuits, and carried his admiration of the Ancient Geometry almost to a pitch of bigotry.\nlonger preserved in Italy and in England than over the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. But no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> ever cultivated that fine science with more assiduity, perseverance, and success, than our countryman Dr Robert Simson of Glasgow, the learned and critical editor of Euclid's Elements. In this department he concentrated his whole efforts, and appears, from his familiarity with the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of demonstration, to have inhaled the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of the Greeks. In 1749, he published his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESTORATION\">Restoration</a> of the books of Apollonius on Plane Loci, which by its fulness and peculiar elegance leaves scarcely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> of regret for the loss of the original. Simson pursued his researches in the Ancient Analysis through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> life, and not only restored various fragments, but threw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on some very difficult and abstruse questions connected with it. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a> volume, printed in 1776, at the expense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> Stanhope, besides many fine geometrical speculations, contains the first satisfactory exposition of Porisms, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> advanced by Pappus had been commonly regarded as an incomprehensible enigma. But from the unvarying tenor of his studies, the Scotch professor became a rigorist for the Ancient Analysis, and rejected with disdain the most obvious improvements in the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a>. It deserves remark, that mathematical demonstration, being addressed to the eye rather than to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, must attain its greatest perspicuity when the successive steps of reasoning are seized at a glance. This is effected by adopting the symbols of Algebraic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTATION\">Notation</a>, the most concise and perfect of all written characters; nor is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and logical accuracy of the procedure in any degree impaired by such a transparent covering.\n\nDr Matthew Stewart of Edinburgh, who had been the pupil of Dr Simson, and possessed a\n\n---\n\n4 Born at Kirtonhall in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AYRSHIRE\">Ayrshire</a> on 14th October 1687, studied at Glasgow, and made such progress in elementary geometry, that at the early age of 22 he had an offer of the professorship of mathematics, which was immediately accepted to become vacant in that University. Feeling his deficiency, however, he obtained leave of a year's absence, which he spent in London under the tutelage of Humphry Ditton, and was admitted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol5.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> on the 20th of November 1711. His time seems afterwards to have been mostly spent in discharging the duties of his office, the intervals being allotted to the solution of geometrical problems, the perusal of the older mathematicians, and to miscellaneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-READING\">reading</a>. He led the life of a recluse, and all his steps were formal and methodical; yet his disposition was amiable, and he indulged at stated times in easy conviviality. He sent two papers, geometrical and algebraical, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">Indeterminate</a> Problems, to the Royal Society in 1723 and 1753, gave his restoration of the Loci Plani in 1745, published his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONIC_SECTIONS\">Conic Sections</a> in 1735, produced the Latin edition of Euclid's Elements in a quarto volume in 1756, which he compressed in 1760 into an English octavo, to which he annexed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> in 1762. It contains only the first six books of the original, with the eleventh and twelfth, the rest of the books being omitted as of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> in the present state of science. Perhaps the selection should have been carried farther. This edition is correct and creditable to the compiler, and has obtained prodigious success. Nay, the very Scottians with which it abounds appear now to be adopted at Oxford and Cambridge as the appropriate dictum of the Ancient Geometry. Simson quite idolized his original. He had a fine taste for geometry, some talents of invention, and considerable attainments as a scholar, but without any great force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>. In his latter years, from excessive veneration of the Greek Geometry, he not only viewed the Cartesian method with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a>, but began to regard the Fluxionary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CALCULUS\">Calculus</a> with mistrust and suspicion. He became curricula professor in 1761, and died on the 1st of October 1766.\n\n5 Born in 1717 at Rothesay, in the Isle of Bute, of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> his father was minister; studied seven years at Glasgow, where he distinguished himself; to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> farther instruction, in 1741 he removed to Edinburgh, where he cultivated the society of the celebrated MacLaurin, while he corresponded with Simson, his old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>. He now prosecuted geometrical studies with ardour, and put forth his uncommon powers of invention; and after he became minister at Rosemount, he found leisure in that seclusion to continue his favourite pursuits. On the occasion of a vacancy of the mathematical chair at Edinburgh by the death of MacLaurin, he was induced to draw out the substance of his most profound geometrical investigations, which he printed under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of General Theorems, in a small volume, about the end of 1746. This publication secured his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>, and after some delay he was appointed professor in September 1747. He thus enjoyed a situation most congenial to his taste, and favourable to the exercise of his rare talents. Ambitious to apply his beloved geometry to unravel questions which were believed to demand all the resources of algebra, he discovered a solution of Kepler's problem at once simple and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a>, and greatly surpassing in beauty even more laboured efforts of calculation. This investigation was inserted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> volume of the Transactions of the Edinburgh Society, which appeared in 1756. Encouraged by this success, he five years afterwards produced his Physical and Mathematical Tracts; a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> and elegant work, which would have been clearer had the author only admitted an abbreviation by the simpler algebraic symbols. About this time the results of the observations of the Transit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a>, which had been expected to give the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of the Sun, were found to be unsatisfactory and discordant. Stewart therefore published in 1763, as a sequel to his Tracts, a theoretical solution of the problem; in which he was directed by Geometry to the exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the Lunar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APOGEE\">Apogee</a>, a question that, since the analysis of Newton, had perplexed the greatest mathematicians. But he was not equally felicitous in Determining the Solar Distance, which required the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INVERSION\">inversion</a> of the problem, and involved some deceitful and precarious compensations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. This pamphlet was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> production, having printed only a few months before an octavo volume under the title of Propositiones More Veteranum Demonstratae. These propositions, however, derive their value merely as exercises of the method of conducting geometrical analysis and synthesis. But his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a> of genius was already nearly extinguished. Dr Stewart fell into a state of bad health, and having devolved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of teaching on his son, then a youth of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, he retired in 1772 to a small paternal property in Ayrshire, where he chiefly spent the rest of his days, and died on the 23d of January 1785.\nmuch richer invention, was likewise an able and zealous promoter of the Greek Geometry, which he directed besides to the investigation of certain difficult parts of Physical Astronomy. But though managed with sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> he employed was hardly fitted for exploring the more abstruse and recondite problems, which often require all the concentrated powers of the Modern Analysis. The conclusions at which he arrived display much elegance, though merely approximative, and devoid of the precision that is indispensable in the present advanced state of Astronomical Science.\n\nI need not stop to notice the attempts of other English mathematicians, to restore some fragments of Apollonius. After the principal demonstration was obtained, there could be little difficulty in evolving its different phases, and modifying it to the several cases. Playfair's elucidation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of Porisms is entitled to higher distinction.\n\nIt has often been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of surprise, that the Greeks should have spent so much ingenuity, and set such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> value on the Geometrical Construction of Problems. But the application of Geometry served them in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the purpose of calculation, and became a sort of substitute for the tedious and laborious operations of their imperfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of Arithmetic. Accustomed, as we are, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> facility of computing by help of the Arabic ciphers, we can form no adequate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the toil of working with alphabetic numerals, though the Greeks had made some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> improvements in their system of notation. They could extract laboriously the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">Square</a> Root of a number, but never attained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">Cube</a> Root, which it appears was first discovered many centuries afterwards by the Arabians. Hence undoubtedly the solicitude of the Greeks to solve, by a Geometrical, or even a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">Mechanical</a> Construction, the famous Delian Problem, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUPLICATION\">Duplication</a> of the Cube.\n\nIt would seem that, in finding the square root, the Greek mathematicians must have employed certain methods of abbreviation which are not explained. Archimedes, in his famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUADRATURE\">Quadrature</a> of the Circle, to which he approximated by measuring the successive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> and circumscribing polygons, having occasion repeatedly to extract the square root, expressed the value by fractions, and yet with such felicity as always to adopt the lowest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEGRAL\">integral</a> numerator and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENOMINATOR\">denominator</a>. He thus discovered that the circumference of a circle is less than $3\\frac{1}{7}$ times and greater than $3\\frac{10}{71}$ times its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, or that their ratio lies between the ratios 7 to 22 and of 71 to 223. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> within the limits of the 2000th and 4000th parts, might be sufficient for ordinary practice. But Apollonius and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> afterwards approached a hundred times nearer. Yet no farther advances were made in solving that important problem, which required the most refined address, till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of near a thousand years, when the Arabians became possessed of the denary system of notation, and carried the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> for the circumference of a circle to ten decimal places. But this elaborate result was imperfectly known to the revivers of science in Europe; and Vieta, Adrianus Romanus, and others, exerted their ingenuity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> in extending the earlier solution. The simplest and most elegant is that of 113 to 355, an approximation differing scarcely by the ten millionth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, which was discovered about the year 1595 by the elder Adrian Metius, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> engineer in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>. His countrymen Van Keulen and Snellius, in the next century, pushed the expression for the circumference of the circle to 35 figures. But the progress of the higher analysis opened more easy and rapid modes of approximation. In the early part of the eighteenth century, Sharp and Ma-\n\nThis ratio, it may be observed, is easily derived from the limits assigned by Archimedes, for $71 + 7 \\times 6 = 113$, and $223 + 22 \\times 6 = 355$.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> Sharp, born at Little Horton, in the West Riding of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, in 1651, was apprenticed to a merchant at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>; but preferring the study of mathematics, he supported himself by teaching a school in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>. Here he engaged as amanuensis to Flamsteed, and became his assistant when the Royal Observatory was erected at Greenwich in 1676. His services were most eminent in every department. He constructed optical and astronomical instruments, observed stars, calculated tables, and delineated celestial charts. His peculiar neatness of execution is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in a small geometrical work which he published in 1717. About that time he seems to have retired to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a>, where he led the life of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HERMIT\">hermit</a>, but esteemed for his quiet and beneficent disposition. He died in 1742.\nchin computed in England the quadrature of the circle to 75 and 100 places of decimals, and Lagny in France advanced to 128 figures. But these labours were outdone by Vega, an officer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a> in the Austrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, who amused his leisure during a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a>, in employing one of Euler's formulae to derive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> from the tangents of fractional arcs, carried the expression to 140 decimal places. This was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> of calculation; and though no doubt superfluous, it might at least convince any judicious person of the impossibility of stating the ratio of the diameter to the circumference in finite terms. Yet the squaring of the circle is a problem which has at all times fascinated the attention and bewildered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> of many superficial or antiquated students in Geometry. The incom-\n\nmensurability of the circle, which James Gregory had attempted to prove in 1661, was finally demonstrated a century afterwards by Lambert, from an ingenious transformation of the known series for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUADRANTAL\">quadrantal</a> arc in terms of its tangent or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a>. The same ingenious mathematician likewise proposed several neat geometrical constructions, for approximating to the length of arcs of a circle still more nearly than the methods given by Fermat, Gregory, Huygens, and others.\n\nElementary Plane Geometry rests on the combined properties of the straight line and the circle. Many important additions have been made to the digest of Euclid; and several eminent mathematicians of the eighteenth century have corrected, simplified, and essentially improved the only valuable portion of the large work. Some\n\n---\n\n1 John Machin, elected professor of Astronomy in Gresham <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> in 1713, and became secretary of the Royal Society. He had the reputation of being an able mathematician, yet his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> on the Laws of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MOON\">Moon</a>'s Motion, in which he attempted to rectify the Principia, was but a superficial performance. He died in 1731.\n\n2 This excellent mathematician, who published in 1794 a complete collection of Logarithmic Tables and Analytical Formulae, was eight years afterwards robbed and barbarously murdered by a miller, in whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> he lodged, and his body thrown into the Danube.\n\n3 It may be sufficient perhaps to notice the Elements of Geometry by Thomas Simpson, and the similar treatises in the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> by Clairaut and Legendre. These productions all unite clearness with precision; and excluding whatever appears superfluous, they still comprise the whole series of connected propositions. Simpson's unpretending volume is neat and very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a>, yet sufficiently perspicuous. The Geometry of Clairaut is still shorter, but has an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of originality, being designed to show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a>, or to guide the learner through his efforts at the solution of geometric problems, to discover the great elementary truths. He followed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, and with more complete success, in his excellent Elements of Algebra. But the Geometry by Legendre claims much higher merit, and is perhaps the best on the whole that has yet appeared. It wants, however, of exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>; the steps of his demonstrations are sometimes incomplete, and the entire separation of the problems is at least a very questionable improvement. The notes he has added are valuable, but appear disproportioned to the text, and certainly too profound for beginners. This elegant geometer attempted to found the comparison of triangles on abstract considerations derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of functions. But such reasonings a priori are fallacious, involving unperceived some metaphysical assumptions.\n\nThe works now mentioned might suffice for the instruction of practical or professional men; but the pursuit of a liberal education aspires to greater attainments. The main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is to sharpen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of perception, and invigorate by due exercise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> of the intellectual powers. For contributing to that effect, the fulness and circumspection of the ancient mode of demonstration are admirably calculated. It seemed, therefore, an estimable task to select the scattered wrecks of the Greek Analysis, and dispose them into a form accessible to ordinary students. The beauty of the propositions concerning Locl was particularly striking.\n\nIt would be preposterous, however, to hold up the Elements of Euclid as a standard of instruction in Geometry for the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. They were composed before the invention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">Trigonometry</a>, and probably designed chiefly as an introduction to the Pythagorean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>. Hence the large portion of them devoted to the relations of numbers, and the properties of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> polygons and solids. By common consent, therefore, the greater part of the system is now laid aside, and the other books are commonly altered or curtailed in practice. Many trivial propositions occur in the third book; several of the fourth have little interest; and it may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABATE\">abate</a> that extravagant praise which several mathematicians have lavished on the Doctrine of Proportion contained in the fifth book, to know that it really cannot be taught. But the language employed in that celebrated compilation, for want of appropriate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> terms, is often vague and indistinct. The word <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, for instance, has no less than three different significations; and other examples of a like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> might be easily cited. In some cases, the demonstrations of Euclid are imperfect or inconclusive. Thus, the reasoning in the twenty-fourth proposition of the first book applies only to the particular position of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>; an objection first started by Thomas Simpson, to the great annoyance of his critical namesake. But similar oversight was made in the demonstration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> proposition of the same book, which fails if the figure be changed. Both these propositions are only of consequence as auxiliaries in the train of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>. But of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> property of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> lines, the demonstration rests on the mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> of an intricate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a>. In a few cases the reasoning is unnecessarily complicated, from the peculiar conceptions of the author. Thus, the noted fifth proposition of the first book is of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. Its demonstration implies the reversed application, at least mentally, of the isosceles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>; but Euclid evades or disguises the process, by producing the sides of the triangle, and forming two interwoven triangles, which are virtually adapted by inversion, and the annexed triangles being then taken away, the equality of the angles at the base hence follows. But the last is the only step wanted, and the other two were evidently superfluous. This stumbling proposition has been called the Ponca Athorium; and no wonder that the beginner should feel puzzled at seeing such a parade of argument end in so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> a result.\nremarkable propositions, derived from sources beyond the usual scope of Geometry, are yet assimilated with that science. Of such accessions, one of the most beautiful is the late curious and unexpected discovery of Gauss, that, besides the ordinary regular polygons, a numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a>, including the next polygon of seventeen sides, are capable of being inscribed within a circle, by a mere geometrical construction.\n\nIn solving the common problems, the straight line and the circle are generally combined, which requires the application of both the ruler and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPASSES\">compasses</a>. Schooten effected by the ruler alone several simple constructions, of use particularly in castrametation. But the late Mascheroni of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BERGAMO\">Bergamo</a>, in a small work which appeared in 1795, made a beautiful addition to Elementary Geometry, by the solution of a variety of problems, especially those concerning the inscription of the regular polygons, with the help exclusively of compasses. Such speculations, however, are in a great measure extraneous to the science.\n\nThe theory of Lines of the Second Order forms one of the finest speculations of the more advanced geometry. These curves were derived from the Section of the Cone; but the clearest and most philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of treating them is by considering their description on a plane. The distinguishing property of the foci was known to Apollonius, but the advantage of its application overlooked. The Parabola forms the intermediate transition of the Ellipse to the Hyperbola, the remote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> stretching farther out, till it vanishes into indefinite space, again to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-appear on the opposite side. The features of the Parabola are therefore not strictly included in the phases of the Ellipse and Hyperbola. The more comprehensive relation of the distances of any point in the curve from a focus and the directrix is mentioned by Pappus, but the beauty of that locus was not perceived till Boscovich, in 1752, deduced the properties of those lines from it in a string of corollaries, more ingenious than elegant. This essay was compressed and methodized by Thomas Newton in 1794; and in the same year Walker, a respectable mathematician, unaware of what had been already done, produced a work on a similar plan, of which the first part occupied a quarto volume, composed indeed after the manner of the ancients, but so exceedingly prolix in diction as to have very few readers.\n\nAn elegant mode of investigating curves of the second or higher orders, is to consider them as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONDITIONAL\">conditional</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a> of angles or lines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> about fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> or poles. The property had been stated generally in the Principia, but was expanded in 1720 by Maclaurin in his Geometria Organica. The intersections of Polar Radiants were discussed by Brackenridge in 1733. The subject has been again revived, and prosecuted with great ingenuity and research, by the celebrated Carnot, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of Transversals.\n\nNo part of Geometry has been more improved in the course of the last century than Trigonometry, which is not only simplified but much extended in its application. The theory of planes and solids has likewise been cultivated with eminent success. As the position of a point on a plane is assigned by referring it to two co-ordinate lines, so the place of a point in space may be determined by its distances from three planes which are mutually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a>. The properties of a line of single curvature may be derived from the equation of its co-ordinates; the properties of a curved surface can likewise be deduced from its triple shades, or the perpendicular projections on the three planes. Such is the process employed by Monge in his Descriptive\n\n---\n\n1 Gauss found that the expression for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MULTIPLE\">multiple</a> cosine is always decomposable into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BINOMIAL\">binomial</a> factors, and hence concluded that any regular polygon, the number of whose sides is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a>, and denoted by $2^n + 1$, may be inscribed in a circle by mere Elementary Geometry. These numbers form the series 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537, &c., of which the first two only were known before.\n\n2 Born in 1759; died at Paris, July 14, 1800. His tract on the Compasses happening to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of General Bonaparte during his first triumphant campaign in Italy, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was so struck with its ingenuity, that, on his return to Paris, he communicated, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>, some of the propositions to the members of the Institute. The book was immediately translated into French, and the author promoted to a place of trust and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a> in the Italian Republic.\n\n3 Gaspard Monge, born in 1746 at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BEAUNE\">Beaune</a>, and educated at the Jesuits' seminary at Lyons. His uncommon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> procured him admission into the Military School at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MEZIERES\">Mezieres</a>, where he soon became assistant teacher. Disgusted\nGeometry, which may be considered as the completion of the analytical method of Descartes. It furnishes direct and general solutions of several important problems, especially of those relating to the intersection of planes and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of solids. Descriptive Geometry comprehends also the theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">Perspective</a>, which was founded by Ubaldi, and long afterwards recast and simplified by Brook Taylor, and rendered still more practical by Lambert.\n\n2. ARITHMETIC.\n\nTo express large numbers by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> additions being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, it soon became necessary to arrange them on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> of ascending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROGRESSION\">progression</a>. The simplest mode was evidently to repeat the same root of the scale; and as men in the earlier periods of society used to reckon with the ten fingers of both hands, they were led by Nature herself to frame the Denary System of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUMERATION\">Numeration</a>. If they had likewise formed marks for a Digital Notation, they would have completed the bases of Arithmetic. But unfortunately the Alphabetic Characters had been introduced before distinct symbols were contrived to represent numbers. The letters designed merely for written language, came hence among all nations to be employed besides in numeral notation, though hardly manageable, and ill adapted to any regular system of arrangement. In the application of those characters the ancient Greeks showed great ingenuity, by distinguishing them into three classes, appropriated to the ascending progression of units, tens, and hundreds. In this way they reached the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of a thousand, and by employing as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AUXILIARY\">auxiliary</a> the capital M, they could indicate myriads or ten thousands. The triple series of thousands up to a million were more easily denoted, however, by placing a dash under the successive sections of letters. But Archimedes indicated a mode of obtaining almost unbounded extension of this system, by decomposing the elements of the notation into periods of ascending myriads. Apollonius simplified the plan, by adopting a thousand as the root of the progressive scale. Had he proceeded only a little farther, and rejected the letters, except the first class denoting digits, he would have rendered his notation perfect, and have achieved one of the most useful and prolific discoveries ever made. Ptolemy afterwards advanced much nearer to this ultimate object, by employing, in his Trigonometrical Tables, the descending Sexagesimal Scale, suggested by the subdivision of the circumference of a circle into degrees, of which sixty, or the root of this scale, correspond nearly to the length of the radius. It would seem, however, that, during the interval between Archimedes and Ptolemy, the Greek Arithmetic had received some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> improvements in practice; for the Sicilian geometer, by a very tedious and operose process, of which he gives merely the results, was content with stating the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of a circle as intermediate between that of 7 to 22 and of 71 to 223, differing therefore by a 1200th part from the truth; whereas the chords computed by the astronomer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> for every half degree of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a> are correct to the last place, and consequently never deviate by a 300,000th part of the whole.\n\nwith the tedious and operose methods of calculation then practised among engineers, he sought to shorten the road by recurring to general principles and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of Geometry. Thinking closely on that subject, he matured a regular system, which has changed the theory of planes and solids. The ardour of his pursuits was infused into his pupils, and the frequent communications he made to learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> rapidly extended his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>. In 1760 he was conjoined with Bossut as acting professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol10.html#article-HYDRODYNAMICS\">Hydrodynamics</a> at the Louvre, a place erected by the patriotic minister Turgot, which required him to reside at Paris only during half the year. But three years afterwards, on being appointed to succeed Bezout as Examiner of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARINE\">Marine</a>, he fixed his permanent abode in the capital, and engaged in the experiments and discussions of the philosophers. He became a warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARTISAN\">partisan</a> of the Revolution, and conducted its utmost efforts to promote the various plans adopted by its leaders. But he deserved praise for the great concern he took in founding the Polytechnic School, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> eventually productive of the very best effects. Having accompanied Bonaparte to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, he returned with the fruit of his observations to share in the fortunes of that wonderful man. He resumed with lustre the duties of professor, and continued to delight the numerous pupils by his kind attention and the clearness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-ORAL\">oral</a> discourses. But on the second return of the Bourbons in 1815, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of their vengeance. The Institute was remodelled, and the Polytechnic School suppressed. This sad reverse preyed on his spirits, and produced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALIENATION\">alienation</a> of mind; in which melancholy state he languished for some time, and expired on the 28th July 1818.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who cared only about objects of vulgar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a>, overlooked the refined mode of Greek Notation, and remained satisfied with their own very clumsy and involved system, which could with difficulty represent a large number, but was absolutely disqualified for serving in any way the purposes of calculation. They were obliged therefore to have recourse to counters, and by help of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABACUS\">Abacus</a>, or decimal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>, they performed the ordinary operations of summing accounts. This humble expedient was practised in Europe till the seventeenth century, and is still used by the traders throughout the Chinese Empire, its application being there facilitated by the prevalence of the decimal subdivision of weights, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, and coins.\n\nThe discovery of the Denary Notation, so beautiful and simple in its application, is commonly referred to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, though neither the place nor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of its origin has been ascertained. It was unknown to the Arabian astronomers till near the close of the eleventh century of our era, and even at this period its expressions appear sometimes intermingled with the alphabetic numerals. But the advantages of the system were soon perceived; and the Tables of Sines and Tangents calculated by those laborious mathematicians are now found, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the manuscripts belonging to the University of Leyden, to be correct to the tenth decimal figure. The Arabians transmitted the new system of notation to the flourishing colony of their countrymen in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, whence it was slowly communicated to the several Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">States</a> over Europe. This change was effected chiefly by the calendars or perpetual almanacs compiled in the Moorish seminaries, and eagerly purchased by the various monasteries and convents throughout Christendom. Yet the Arabic ciphers appear to have remained unknown in every part of Europe beyond Spain, before the middle of the fourteenth century; nor in mercantile transactions were they commonly adopted till near two centuries later. It is a singular circumstance that the advantages of employing the descending progression in the nicer calculations were not sooner perceived, especially after the use which Ptolemy had made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEXAGESIMALS\">sexagesimals</a>. Stevinus was the first who distinctly introduced the practice of decimal fractions in 1585, though Regiomontanus had made a great step towards that improvement, which Ramus even indirectly employed. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> downwards might seem as easy as to reckon upwards. But the mode of denoting the ranks of decimals was then most cumbrous, the successive numerals, like the indices in Algebra, being inclosed in small circles. Bayer in 1619 proposed to substitute for these complex marks an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCENT\">accent</a> repeated. It was our illustrious countryman Napier, however, that brought the notation of decimals to its ultimate simplicity, having proposed in his Rhindologia, printed ten years earlier, to reject entirely the marks placed over the fractions, and merely to set a point at the end of the units. But his sublime invention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">Logarithms</a> about this epoch eclipsed every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> improvement, and as far transcended the denary notation, as this had surpassed the numeral system of the Greeks.\n\nVarious speculations have been framed regarding the properties of the different arithmetical scales. Leibnitz fancied important advantages to accrue from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of the Binary Scale, which operates with extreme facility, and requires only a single character besides the zero. This progression mounts so slowly, however, that it cannot express a large number without employing a multitude of terms. But the Duodecimal Notation, which is partially admitted in the uncial subdivisions, would evidently answer the best for general practice. It proceeds faster than the Denary Scale, and is less subject to be affected by fractions, since its root has no fewer than four divisors, while ten admits only of two. Still these advantages would not compensate for its want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> with the train of ordinary language. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECIMAL_ARITHMETIC\">Decimal Arithmetic</a> would soon generally supersede the use of every other kind of fractions, if it were likewise in practice combined with an extensive decimal subdivision of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WEIGHTS_AND_MEASURES\">weights and measures</a>.\n\nThe curious or mystical properties of numbers have at all times fixed the attention of mankind. Square numbers, denoting the sides of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>-angled triangle, were sought for by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PYTHAGOREANS\">Pythagoreans</a>, who gave a very simple rule\nPerfect numbers, or such as may be composed by the addition of their aliquot parts, could not fail to excite admiration; and Euclid produced an elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a> for discovering them. It is remarkable that these numbers should appear frequent at first in the series, and afterwards occur only at wide intervals. Thus, below 10,000, there are four perfect numbers; but the last of the succeeding four includes no fewer than nineteen ciphers. The moderns have advanced farther, and imagined what are called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMICABLE\">Amicable</a> numbers, on all which subjects Euler has shown his ingenuity and unrivalled analytical skill.\n\nIt is less a matter of speculation, while it is of considerable consequence in the practice of calculation, to assign the Prime Numbers, or such as admit of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, and to resolve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COMPOSITE\">Composite</a> Numbers into their several factors. No general method has yet been devised for the investigation of Primes, though by the researches of Bachet and Fermat in the seventeenth century, and of Euler, Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss, in the eighteenth, they are now reduced to certain constant forms, which may facilitate their discovery. By an extension of the method called the Sieve of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ERATOSTHENES\">Eratosthenes</a>, a sort of mechanical process, the prime numbers are separated from the ordinary progression. In this way several authors have constructed tables of Primes, and of Composite Numbers, with their various factors or divisors. Lindenau proceeded to a hundred thousand, but Cherac has lately carried the enumeration as high as ten millions.\n\nThe formation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGIC\">Magic</a> Squares, by which the numbers in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> order are disposed in cells, so that each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> gives an equal sum, remounts to high antiquity. They have been regarded in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EAST\">east</a> as charms or talismans, of great potency in the tide of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> affairs. The digital squares from 3 to 9 were dedicated to the seven stars, including the sun and moon, which in the astrological visions were believed to rule the successive days of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. The people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SIAM\">Siam</a> had learned a very simple method of filling up those squares; but some European Mathematicians have since amused themselves with such arithmetical curiosities. Stifels, in his Arithmetica Integra, incidentally treated of Magic Squares, yet without naming them. He was immediately followed in a small arithmetical treatise by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Riese; but the French seem to have directed most attention to those scientific recreations. From the latter part of the 17th till beyond the middle of the 18th century, a succession of ingenious persons were at pains to improve and extend the construction. Frenicle, Poignard, Delahire, Ons-en-Bray, and Rallier des Ourmes, are entitled to particular notice.\n\nThe construction of Magic Squares belongs to the class of problems styled Indeterminate, which depend on variable combinations, and therefore admit of very numerous answers. Thus, Frenicle, who successfully studied this subject near the beginning of the last century, showed that the first sixteen of the natural numbers could be formed into a Magic Square in not fewer than 880 different ways. Analysts have since tried to narrow those chances, and augment the difficulty of the investigation, by annexing other conditions. Dr Franklin produced, by dint of perseverance, what he called a Magic Square of Squares, and a Magical Circle. De la Hire treated the formation of Magic Squares with such copious detail as to leave very little to be done by his successors. Yet several eminent mathematicians have occasionally reverted to this amusing subject. Even the great Euler has not disdained to direct his transcendent skill in algebraic analysis to the solution of\n\n---\n\n1 See notes to the Elements of Geometry. Euler has demonstrated that every number whatever consists of not more than four squares. An example may be given of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of numbers between 10 and 20: 10 = 9 + 1, 11 = 9 + 1 + 1, 12 = 9 + 1 + 1 + 1, 13 = 9 + 4, 14 = 9 + 4 + 1, 15 = 9 + 4 + 1 + 1, 16 = 16 + 1, 17 = 16 + 1 + 1, 18 = 16 + 1 + 1 + 1, 19 = 16 + 1 + 1 + 1, 20 = 16 + 4.\n\n2 It may gratify the curious to see the series 6, 23, 496, 8123, 33550336, 8589869056, 137436691323, and 29056439061369551236. These numbers are obtained by multiplying the 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 16, 18, and 30 powers of 2 by its 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, and 31 powers diminished by unit.\n\n3 The first in modern times who noticed Magic Squares was Agrrippa of Nettesheim, who gave in his book de Occulta Philosophia, printed in 1533, the Sigilla Jovis, Martis, Solis, Veneris, Mercurii, and Lunae.\n\n4 Born at Paris in 1640, and died in 1716, a man of some attainments, and great application\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WELL\">well</a> acquainted with the details of surveying, and of practical astronomy.\nproblems connected with the theory of Magic Squares.\n\nAnother portion of Arithmetic, not merely curious, but of material importance in the application of that science, has been much cultivated during the eighteenth century. If both the terms of a proper fraction be divided by the numerator, there <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> result an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> fraction, having unit for its numerator, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEGER\">integer</a>, conjoined with another fraction of smaller terms, for its denominator. But this new fraction may be again broken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in the same way, and the process of decomposition renewed successively, till a fraction with an integral denominator is at length obtained. This mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> is therefore the very same as what is employed in finding a common measure or divisor, only the several quotients are here preserved. When the original fraction is expressed by rational numbers, its decomposition must always terminate; but if the numerator and denominator be mutually incommensurable, the process of evolving their elements will never draw to a conclusion. The fractions which thence arise may simply repeat, or they may circulate at short intervals or periods, or they may succeed each other without any sort of order whatever. But it is evident that such progressive subdivision must approach constantly nearer to the true value, and that the resulting fractions, if successively recombined, will exhibit a series of approximations.\n\nThe fractions of this kind were first noticed by Lord Brounker, who proposed one of them to express the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of a circle, which Dr Wallis afterwards investigated. Huygens perceived the utility of employing such fractions to represent approximate ratios, and in this way he found convenient small numbers to represent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> and pinions of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PLANETARIUM\">Planetarium</a>. But the subject appears to have lain neglected till 1737, when Euler explored it with his usual depth and felicity, in a distinct memoir published in the Petersburg Transactions. He may consequently be regarded as the real founder of the Theory of Continued Fractions, to which indeed he gave the appellation they have since retained. It was a favourite speculation of that great analyst, who resumed the subject at different times, and widely extended its application. Euler showed how to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> any quadratic equation into a Continued Fraction, and demonstrated that the expression for an irrational square root consists of terms which either repeat or circulate in regular periods. A cube root may likewise be expressed by a Continued Fraction, but its terms can have no sort of order in their sequence. As these Fractions, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> to their ultimate value, oscillate continually between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> and defect, they are always capable of being changed into Converging Series, affected by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> signs of plus and minus, and the transformation may be reversed. By this method the very ingenious Lambert converted the series of Gregory and Leibnitz for the length of a quadrant into a Continued Fraction, whose terms have a regular and incessant circulation, and hence proved (what had only been presumed before) that the Circle is incommensurable. But he was enabled to proceed still farther, and to establish, that even the square of the number\n\n---\n\n1 Cornelius Capito printed, in 1767, at Gl\u00fcckstadt, a short treatise on Magic Squares, in which he proposed to vary their construction no fewer than a million times. But the latest and completest work on this curious subject was compiled by the late Professor Mollweide of Leipzig, the ingenious editor of Kl\u00fcgel's valuable Mathematisches W\u00f6rterbuch.\n\n2 Born in 1620, and died in 1684; an able mathematician, but an unprincipled courtier.\n\n3 This very remarkable man was born November 23, 1616, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASHFORD\">Ashford</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>\u2014educated at Cambridge\u2014became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHAPLAIN\">chaplain</a> to Lady Vere in 1643, and was then led to cultivate the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECIPHERING\">deciphering</a>, in which he acquired such skill, as to be afterwards frequently employed by the Long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> in examining intercepted dispatches. Through that interest he was appointed to a sequestrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> in London, and chosen in 1644 one of the scribes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">Assembly</a> of Divines. But his austere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> did not divert him from the nobler pursuits of philosophy and science; and being appointed by the Parliamentary commissioners in 1649, Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford, he continued regularly to discharge the duties of that office. He had afterwards some hot disputes with Hobbes, who, though a most ingenious metaphysician, unfortunately mistook his own blunders for discoveries in Mathematics. Wallis maintained a large correspondence with men of science, and assiduously contributed to the progress of philosophical discovery during that active period. The moderation of his character assured him the possession of the places he held at the Restoration; and though he found leisure to compose a very learned philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> of the English language, and sometimes indulged his early taste for controversial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, he devoted the greater part of a long life to the laborious cultivation and extension of the various departments of Mathematical Science. His works are voluminous, and display great erudition, talents for deep research, and originality of conception. He died on the 20th October 1703, and was succeeded in the chair by Dr Halley.\nexpressing the circumference is likewise irrational.\\(^1\\)\n\nLagrange has since recommended and explained the application of Continued Fractions to the solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NUMERICAL\">numerical</a> equations. These fractions may be readily changed into Recurring Series,\\(^2\\) which, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of small roots, are often beautifully simple and remarkably convergent. But sometimes they betray the opposite tendency to diverge; and the great object of Lagrange was to remove that defect. Euler, in several of his last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> and opuscules, directed them to indeterminate problems, to the finding of maxima and minima, and to the development and integration of certain analytical formulae. Nothing can exceed the beauty of some of these speculations.\n\nIt is a singular fact, that though Continued Fractions had their origin in this island, they were afterwards almost wholly overlooked by our mathematicians. Scarcely thirty years have passed away since the attention of the curious was again recalled to them. But an acquaintance with the transformation of those fractions would prove extremely useful to practical men, by furnishing a variety of short approximations, which are easily remembered and readily applied. Ordinary computations in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MENSURATION\">mensuration</a>, in the comparison of different weights and measures, and in several standard proportions, might thus be much abbreviated without any sensible inaccuracy. The method proposed by Lambert for decomposing fractions into progressions that have their denominators formed by successive multipliers, could be employed in a similar way; but its application is somewhat difficult and intricate.\\(^3\\)\n\nTo facilitate the operations of arithmetic, tables have been digested of the powers and products of numbers. The most astonishing work of that kind, including all the multipliers from one to one thousand, was produced by Hervart, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>, in 1610, only four years before the invention of Logarithms, the want of which it could in some faint degree have supplied. But tables of products in a less unwieldy shape are still occasionally used for abridging the labour of calculation. A notable improvement has been lately introduced by the substitution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">Quarter</a> Squares, grounded on the known property that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> of any two numbers is equal to the fourth part of the excess of the square of their sum above the square of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>. A single page might comprise as many of those numbers as, by simple addition and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUBTRACTION\">subtraction</a>, would exhibit an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of products equal to those contained in Hervart's enormous folio.\\(^4\\)\n\nIt would be a great improvement in elementary education to introduce into the schools a more extended multiplication <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, including at least all the products of the numbers from 1 to 25. A very useful practice has been adopted lately in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of Germany, to accustom learners to the readiness of mental calculation.\\(^5\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of a circle having unit for its diameter is expressed by the alternating series \\(1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4} + \\ldots\\), which was converted by Euler into the continued fraction\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{9}{2 + \\frac{25}{2 + \\frac{49}{2 + \\ldots}}}}}\n\\]\n\nof the odd numbers. This extension never stops, and consequently the fraction is not reducible to finite terms. The square of the expression runs into a similar infinitude.\n\n\\(^2\\) It deserves to be mentioned that Girard first gave the simple recurring series which expresses the parts of a line divided into extreme and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> ratio. It is formed by the continued addition of the two preceding terms. Thus 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, &c. The square of each number in this series differs from the product of the two numbers which inclose it, only by unit alternately in excess and defect: Thus \\(0^2 = 0\\), \\(1^2 = 1\\), \\(2^2 = 4\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), \\(5^2 = 25\\), \\(8^2 = 64\\), \\(13^2 = 169\\), \\(21^2 = 441\\), \\(34^2 = 1156\\), \\(55^2 = 3025\\), \\(89^2 = 7921\\), \\(144^2 = 20736\\).\n\n\\(^3\\) For an explication of Lambert's method of decomposing fractions, see Philosophy of Arithmetic.\n\n\\(^4\\) A large table of multiplication, from 1 to 10,000, and a specimen of quarter squares, extending to a million, may be seen in the treatise quoted above.\n\n\\(^5\\) It is called Kopfrechnung or calculating by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. Three works are current on this subject, those of Biermann, Heuss, and K\u00f6hler\u2014published between 1790 and 1816.\n3. ALGEBRA.\n\nAlgebra derives its immense superiority over the ancient analysis from the very complete system of notation which it has at length attained. Each step of an investigation being now registered in the clearest and most precise manner, the mind is relieved from the fatigue of carrying forward the whole of a continuous chain of reasoning. It can rest at any place, and again resume the process of deduction with the greatest facility. But this perfection of pictured language has been the result of a series of slow and successive improvements. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DIOPHANTUS\">Diophantus</a>, who, soon after the Christian era, composed a large treatise on the resolution of certain arithmetical problems, a portion of which work is preserved, made the first attempt towards an abbreviated form of analysis. The symbols he used were, however, exceedingly few, being the initials or terminations of the ordinary words, only somewhat modified. It deserves remark, that Diophantus viewing a number as composed from another by the addition or subtraction of a third, he termed this last one abundant or deficient, and gave a rule for the multiplication of those affected numbers, similar to what is now applied to the signs plus and minus. His treatise passed into the hands of the Arabians, who studied the numerical properties with much ardour, but made no advances in refining or simplifying the form of notation. From them again this higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of arithmetic was transplanted into Italy, probably during the fourteenth century, by Leonard, a merchant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a>, who had travelled long in the East. A series of works on Arithmetic and Geometry were published between the years 1470 and 1487 by Pacciolo, a Minorite Friar, who in 1494 brought out his Arte Maggiore, or what he says was vulgarly called the Regola de la Cosa, or Algebra and Almucabala; the first appellation derived from the Italian Cosa, denoting the Thing sought, and the other borrowed from the Arabic words expressing Resolution and Composition. After the appearance of this elementary digest, Algebra was cultivated in Italy, during the first half of the sixteenth century, with great industry and success. Ferreo, Tartalea, and especially Cardan, made rapid advances in the new science. This ingenious though very singular person not only gave the solution of Cubic Equations which bears his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, but discovered the leading properties of equations in general, distinguishing their roots into the true and the fictitious; and besides improved the notation by employing frequently the letters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>. The Italians, however, still used contracted words for symbols, and the initials p. and m. for the signs of plus and minus. In 1572, Bombelli of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, retaining this embarrassed mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, composed a regular summary of Algebra, which he enriched with Ferrari's rule for resolving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BIQUADRATIC\">biquadratic</a> equations. In the meanwhile the knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYTIC\">analytic</a> art had penetrated into Germany, where it received its capital improvement in notation from the systematic genius of that people. The change was chiefly effected by the industry of Stifels, a Protestant minister and zealous follower of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a>, who in 1544 published his Arithmetica Integra. In that remarkable work he first introduced the symbols + and \u2014 for plus and minus, and the character \u221a (or a contracted R) for Radix or root; and he represented unknown quantities by the capital letters A, B, C, &c. and intimated the successive powers and their reciprocals by an ascending and descending series of exponents. Nor was his merit confined to algebraic writing: the en-\n\n---\n\n1 Born at Ealingen, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, in 1529, and died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JENA\">Jena</a> in 1567. Though a profound and inventive mathematician, he seems to have inhibited all the wild enthusiasm of that convulsed period. Captivated perhaps by the wonderful properties of numbers, he fancied, as other ingenious persons have since done, that he could interpret the visions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-APOCALYPSE\">Apocalypse</a>, and foretell the end of the world. He was so imprudent as to place that awful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> very near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. Early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of the day predicted in the year 1553, he assembled his trembling flock in a wide open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, where he endeavoured to season their minds for the tremendous change by fervid prayers and pathetic exhortations. The sky was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a>, the darkness thickened, a portentous silence prevailed, and the preacher rolled his thunders with overpowering energy. But the clouds soon passed away, the sun shone forth in his wonted splendour, and all nature smiled. The populace recovered their agitated spirits; and now breathing rage and disdain, they chased the unlucky prophet home with volleys of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>.\nthusiasm of the age seems to have roused the spirit of invention in him; and Stifels anticipated some of the later discoveries, pointed out the nature of Logarithms, explained the properties of figurate numbers, and showed how the co-efficients of the powers of a binomial quantity may be derived from the columns of what has been since called the arithmetical triangle. Scheubel a few years afterwards pursued the same path, yet without adding any thing material to the science. In this state it made its way at last into England, where Recorde, an ingenious though unfortunate man, printed the Cossic Art at London in 1553. He was the first to propose the sign = for equality, but made no other advances; and during a period of most active enterprise, till the close of the century, Algebra was not cultivated at all in this country.\n\nIn the meanwhile France continued the pursuit of the mathematical sciences. Ramus had revived those abstract studies; but Vieta, who succeeded him, and flourished between the years 1570 and 1600, rose by his numerous discoveries to much higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>; a lawyer by profession, yet a man of great learning, and gifted with profound and original genius, conjoined with the most indefatigable application. Vieta introduced the literal or specious Algebra, and thus rendered its procedure quite general, by employing the Roman capitals always to denote numbers, the vowels being appropriated to unknown quantities. He likewise traced various distinctions, and framed several significant terms, which are still retained. But while he improved the analytical symbols, he greatly extended the theory of equations, and cultivated with success the prolific and important subject of angular sections.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a> at this period equally displayed the spirit of invention. Stevin of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRUGES\">Bruges</a>, born about the middle of the sixteenth century, was an engineer eminently skilled both in the theory and practice of his profession, possessing great original powers of mind. He reduced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATICS\">Statics</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">Hydrostatics</a> to their simplest principles; and in his Arithmetic or Algebra, printed in 1585, he extended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of calculation by several fine improvements and discoveries. Marking the unknown quantity with a small circle, he denoted its power by inserting the index; and was enabled, by prefixing a fraction, to represent also the roots. But, besides improving and simplifying the symbols, he enriched the analytic art by his inventions, and gave a general method for the resolution of numerical equations. The works of Stevin were, in 1625, collected and expanded by his countryman Girard, a man likewise of most original conception, who eagerly promoted the objects of science. Four years afterwards this editor produced a small tract exclusively his own, and full of new and ingenious deductions. He there gave a very complete theory of equations, distinguishing them into their several orders, and proving that they had always a corresponding number of roots; he showed how these roots are successively combined in forming the co-efficients of the several terms; and finally anticipated the remarkable rule discovered by Newton, to find the sums of their different powers. Girard was possessed of fancy as well as invention; and his fondness for philological speculation led him to frame new terms, and to adopt certain modes of expression which are not always strictly logical. Though he stated well the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> of the signs plus and minus, in reference to mere geometrical position, he first introduced the very inaccurate phrases of greater and less than nothing, and began the unfortunate appellation of impossible quantities.\n\nIt is indeed the reproach of modern analysis to be clothed in such loose and figurative language, which has created mysticism, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a>, and misconception. The Algebraist, confident in the accuracy of his results, whenever they-\n\n---\n\n1 Robert Recorde, born of a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, about the year 1506\u2014studied at Oxford, and elected a fellow there in 1531. He embraced the medical profession, but taught mathematics at both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>, and afterwards in London, where between the years 1551 and 1557 he published several elementary treatises on Geometry and Algebra, with quaint titles. But Recorde was unfortunate, and having been thrown into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-FLEET\">Fleet</a> for debt, he died a prisoner in 1558.\n\n2 Albert Girard published his edition of Stevin's Arithmetic in 1625, and his own discoveries in Algebra in a small quarto at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> in 1629. He died in 1633, and his widow the year after put forth his complete collection of Stevin's works.\nbecome significant, hastens through the successive steps to a conclusion, without stopping to mark the conditions and restrictions implicated in the problem. This rapidity of operation, though in many respects most advantageous, yet affords less mental exercise than the cautious and guarded procedure of the Greeks. It will not be deemed foreign to the scope of this discourse, to remark, that the signs plus and minus confer no distinctive character, but merely indicate that the number to which they are prefixed, is to be annexed to some other number, or disjoined from it. The terms additive and subtractive would express correctly their whole import. The rules for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INVOLUTION\">involution</a> of those signs are derived from the consideration of the properties of compounds, arising from the addition or multiplication, for instance, of the binomials $a + b$ and $c + d$. The operation proceeds by detail; but the real meaning of the notation may be suspended, and it becomes significant only after the several members have been recombined. A number, in strict language, is altogether devoid of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, and can be reckoned neither positive or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATIVE\">affirmative</a>, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>, which designations are accidents, and not attributes. In proposing these terms, Vieta did not, therefore, discriminate the precise nature of the symbols; and his powerful example has continued to infect the language and darken the conceptions of algebraists. A disposition has also prevailed in modern times, of hastening to general conclusions, although the data be limited or imperfect. Such careless deductions are but awkwardly amended, by the adoption of expedients more like the fictions of lawyers than the reasonings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> logicians. The introduction of equal and impossible roots of equations served only to restrict the ordinary rules, which had been made too general, representing the number of roots as always equal to the index of the highest power. The involution or repeated multiplication of binomials will produce the successive orders of expressions, which pass into equations on the supposition that any one of them vanishes or has its parts mutually balanced. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> of this proposition will not always hold true, That every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> expression is resolvable into as many binomial factors as the index of its highest power signifies. Several forms even of the quadratic or cubic expressions resist all binomial decomposition. But it is a property demonstrated, that every higher expression whatever may be resolved into binomial or trinomial factors, or into simple or quadratic elements. Impossible quantities are thus merely the symbolical exhibition of the binomial factors of a quadratic or trinomial expression which is irreducible; and\n\n---\n\n1 This distinction might perhaps have satisfied the scruples of the late venerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Maseres, who wrote an express treatise against the abuse of the Negative Sign, which he came to view with a sort of aversion as the main source of the incorrect language and vague conception so prevalent among algebraists. Though not quite entitled to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of a discoverer, that excellent person deserves a place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Mathematics, for his valuable contributions, and his zealous and unrestrained exertions to promote accurate science. He was an able geometer, a profound constitutional lawyer, a man of sound and most extensive learning, and of very general information. But he possessed the higher qualities of our nature, and combined liberality of sentiment and unbounded integrity with the feelings of a kind, generous, and social disposition. His Elements of Trigonometry was the completest treatise in English at the period of its appearance. He afterwards improved the solutions of cubic and biquadratic equations, and illustrated the methods of approximating to the resolution of equations in general. But the most important service he rendered to mathematical science consists in reprinting at great expense, and chiefly for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a>, the series of original authors in logarithms, with ample annotations, in six large quarto volumes. From his anxiety to be perspicuous, he was apt to fall into the opposite extreme of tiresome prolixity.\n\nThe grandfather of Maseres was an officer in the French guards, born in the district of Bearn, and a Hugonot, who, on the revocation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDICT\">Edict</a> of Nantes, retired to Holland, and transferring his services to the Prince of Orange, accompanied the Preserver of our liberties into England, and fought by his side in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>. The grandson having embraced the profession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, was soon after the peace of 1763, probably on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of his intimate acquaintance with French language and customs, appointed Attorney General of Quebec, where he resided till 1776. At leaving his charge, he visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BOSTON\">Boston</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NEW_YORK\">New <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, while that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> was fermenting which burst into open revolt. Soon after his return to England, he published in successive volumes his Canadian Freeholders, in which he refuted the despotic maxims of Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MANSFIELD\">Mansfield</a>, and earnestly recommended conciliatory measures with our American colonies. But it was a time of infatuation and disaster. Maseres by his firmness gave mortal offence to the courtiers, and never obtained any promotion, farther than the small sinecure office of Cursitor Baron of Exchequer. But fortune had abundantly provided for all his wants, and he enjoyed unbroken health, and the renovating pleasures of study and social intercourse. The Baron had composed a full and learned treatise on Life Annuities, and matured a plan for securing small pensions from Government to such of the poorer classes as should make certain contributions during the vigour of their days. This he embodied in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BILL\">Bill</a> which passed the Commons, but was lost in the House of Lords, through the influence of the Bishops, who seem to have considered pauperism as a right appendage to their splendid ecclesiastic establishment. He died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REIGATE\">Reigate</a> in May 1824, at the very advanced age of 93.\n\nDiss. IV.\nthe mark of impossibility is removed, either by a change of the signs, or by a recombination that restores those factors to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> binomial form. Such notation may indicate the limits of a problem, and seems to originate in neglecting the previous statement of the limitations. In reference to Geometry, the impossible expressions intimate the transition of the circle into the equilateral hyperbola, or of arcs into logarithms.\n\nThe publication of the Geometry of Descartes in 1637 is justly deemed an epoch in the history of analytical science. The capacious mind of the author seized on all the preceding discoveries, and moulded them with his original inventions into a regular and comprehensive system. He gave rapidity to the writing of Algebra by the introduction of small characters, and rendered the distinction more palpable between known and unknown quantities, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROPRIATION\">appropriation</a> of the initial and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> letters of the alphabet. He adopted the notation of the integral exponents or indices, as reduced to its simplest form by Herigon; and this apparently very slight improvement led, in the sequel, to the most important results. Though the index was at first merely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> for the repeating of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> in the involution of powers, yet it acquired a most extensive import when it came to be treated abstractly as a number. The prefixing of the subtractive sign changed the expression into its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a>, and the substituting of a fraction converted it into the symbol of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EVOLUTION\">evolution</a> or the extraction of roots. Nothing can better illustrate the efficiency of a systematic notation, as an instrument for enabling the intellect to pursue and generalize its deductions, than the successive modifications which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> suggested in the marking of exponents, during the short period from Descartes to Newton.\n\nBut the French philosopher effected a revolution in scientific procedure, by applying (what his countryman Vieta had only partially attempted before) the symbols and calculations of Algebra to the solution of geometrical problems. By referring curve lines to co-ordinates or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> perpendiculars, he expressed their relations by equations, of which he distinguished the rank and composition. He showed that a biquadratic equation is, by the help of indeterminate co-efficients, resolved into two quadratics, and may be constructed by combining a circle with a conic section. The construction of a cubic equation was somewhat simpler, though derived from the same principles. But Descartes proceeded still farther, and represented what are now called curves of double curvature, by reducing them, by a series of perpendiculars, to some plane of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a>. These were all important advances in mathematical speculation.\n\nAttempts have been made to apply the Cartesian method even to Elementary Geometry, which is in fact to convert a clear and simple train of reasoning into a sort of hard mechanical process of calculation. This change, were it attainable, would be the reverse of an improvement. It would extinguish that fine study which affords the best exercise and discipline of the intellectual powers. The wonderful dexterity and readiness which men of such teeming invention as the Bernoullis, Euler, and Lagrange generally displayed in managing algebraic analysis, appear to have seduced their admirers into an over-estimate of its real advantages. The constructions derived from algebra very seldom reach the purity and elegant simplicity of the geometrical methods. In those cases where Geometry\n\n---\n\n1 A very simple problem will illustrate this: Suppose it were required, from a given point, to draw a tangent to a given circle. The construction would be, to join the centre with the given point, and upon the connecting line describe a circle to cut the former in the points of contact. It is evident, that if the given point occupied the extremity of the diameter, there would be only one point of contact; and if it lay within the circle, there could be none. This construction hence intimates sufficiently the conditions of the problem; and yet it fails in the case where the circle described merges in the given point, and consequently ceases to determine the position of the tangent. The algebraical solution, if rightly interpreted, gives similar information. Let \\( r \\) denote the radius of the given circle, and \\( a \\) the distance from its centre to the given point; then \\( \\sqrt{a^2 - r^2} \\) will express the length of the tangent, which only requires to be inflected to the given circumference. But if the given point fall on that circumference, then \\( a = r \\) and the origin and termination of the tangent coincide, leaving its position undetermined. Again, if the given point <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> within the circle, \\( a \\) will be less than \\( r \\), and consequently the subtractive portion \\( -r^2 \\) will predominate over the other portion \\( a^2 \\), and the compound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RADICAL\">radical</a> \\( \\sqrt{a^2 - r^2} \\) become impossible. It serves to show, however, that by a change of condition the problem would be rendered soluble.\nis most felicitous, they betray the features of a clumsy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> combination. The application of Algebra should therefore be reserved for the most arduous and complicated problems in the Higher Geometry.\n\nIn the latter part of the seventeenth, and during the course of the eighteenth century, Algebra still continued to advance; and though it underwent no revolution, it acquired greater perfection in all its details. The construction of cubic and biquadratic equations, which Descartes had effected by combining a circle with a parabola, was afterwards improved; but Newton proposed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCHOID\">Conchoid</a> as the curve best adapted for the practical solution of such problems. Leibnitz succeeded in conquering the irreducible case of Cardan, by a bold application of the binomial theorem, having converted the cubic roots of the compound expressions into two series, with alternate imaginary terms, which are extinguished by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a>. In examining generally the nature of cubic equations, their solution came afterwards to be referred to the trisection of a Circular or Hyperbolic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECTOR\">Sector</a>, and was therefore accomplished by the application of a table either of Sines or of Logarithms. The theory of the Section of Angles and of Ratios, founded by the ingenuity of Cotes, furnished a clue to the resolution of certain forms of the Higher Equations. But though Euler solved biquadratics in a different way from that of Descartes, all attempts to find directly the roots of the fifth and the superior orders of equations had totally failed. It became necessary therefore to have recourse to the approximative methods of resolving equations. Successive improvements in the process of calculation were made by Raphson, Halley, Laguy, and Taylor; so that little seemed wanting for any practical end.\n\nDuring the last century likewise the method of series, so various and extensive in its application, was cultivated with the greatest success. About the years 1714 and 1718, Montmort and James Bernoulli employed it in the investigation of the Laws of Chance. But De Moivre, a French refugee, and a man of learning and profound science, carried these researches much farther, having devoted his time professionally to the calculation of probabilities, and of the values of life-annuities. In 1730, he published an original work, which, besides other useful inventions, explained the properties of a Recurring Series, that always repeats the same succession of co-efficients in distinct sequences. About the same time, Stirling brought out a complete treatise on Series, in which he advanced by a different road to consider their convergence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INTERPOLATION\">interpolation</a>, and summation. This ingenious\n\n---\n\nA man of some rank, and an able mathematician, born in 1673 at Paris, where he died in 1719.\n\nAbraham De Moivre, born in 1667 at Vitri in Champagne, being a Protestant, he was obliged at the age of eighteen to seek shelter in England after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Having shown an early taste for Mathematics, he continued to prosecute the study as a profession. He supported himself creditably by giving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> and reading public lectures. His analytical discoveries extended his fame, and his good conduct insured him respect. He embraced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NEWTONIAN_PHILOSOPHY\">Newtonian Philosophy</a>, and made some improvements on it. He generalized Cotes' famous theorem of the section of a circle, but turned his attention chiefly to the method of series, which he applied successfully to the doctrine of annuities and chances. After his reputation for such calculations had been established, it is said that he spent a great part of the day at Slaughter's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COFFEE\">Coffee</a>-House, in St Martin's Lane, where he was ready to answer any question of that nature propounded to him, for the fee of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GUINEA\">guinea</a>. His principal work on the Doctrine of Chances was published in 1738, but the enlarged and improved edition bears date 1756. De Moivre lived to a great age, but in his advanced years he was subject to obstinate fits of sleeping, and in that torpid state he remained for at least several weeks, till death closed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> in November 1754.\n\nJames Stirling, born about the year 1690 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-STIRLINGSHIRE\">Stirlingshire</a>, where his father owned a small property. He was educated at Glasgow, and sent by that University on Snell's Foundation to Balliol College in Oxford. During his retreat there he applied himself so diligently to the study of Mathematics, that he printed in 1717 a small tract on Lines of the Third Order, with new solutions of one or two difficult problems by the fluxionary calculus. He then repaired to London, and becoming acquainted with the Venetian Minister, he accepted an invitation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, where he resided several years, and taught Mathematics. The vicinity of Padua gave him an opportunity of acquiring the friendship of Nicholas Bernoulli, nephew of the two elder Bernoullis, who was Mathematical professor in that University. During his stay at Venice, Stirling contrived to gain access to the manufacture of glass plates, and escaping at some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> risk, he is said to have transferred the secret to England. He now conducted a mathematical or nautical school on Tower Hill, while he maintained a correspondence with the philosophers both abroad and at home. Here he published his great work on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENTIAL\">Differential</a> Method and Series in 1730. After toiling in his academy several years, he was induced to leave London, and undertake the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MINES\">Mines</a> at Leadhills in Scotland. In that elevated district near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SANQUHAR\">Sanquhar</a> he resided during the rest of his life, and by his skill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> he greatly improved the operations of extracting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> ore. He now held a profitable employment, but his high mathematical fame would have secured him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of succeeding Maclaurin in 1746, if he had not at that unhappy period been tainted with Jacobite principles. In his latter years he seems to have confined his attention to practical concerns, and died at Leadhills in 1772.\nmathematician followed no general procedure, but showed great felicity and address in transforming one series into another. The subject was at different times partially extended by Simpson, Maclaurin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANDEN\">Landen</a>, Lorgna, Hutton, Waring, Pfaff, and Kramp. Euler handled Series with his usual fulness, perspicuity, and penetration; and yet Lagrange and Laplace, in surveying that field, have gleaned fresh discoveries, which the latter of these illustrious men applied most happily to develope the Theory of Probabilities.\n\nThe composition of equations was at the same time investigated with more address and precision. The rule for distinguishing the positive and negative roots from the alternating signs, which Descartes had merely stated, now received a strict demonstration by Segner. The mode of finding the impossible roots, or rather the quadratic factors, of an equation, which Newton probably had inferred from mere induction, was traced by Maclaurin to its real source. D'Alembert proved that every irrational expression is reducible to the form $A^2 = \\sqrt{-B^2}$; or, in other words, that every compound expression of a higher order may be resolved either into simple or quadratic factors. This is the most important conclusion perhaps relating to the nature of equations. But the general theory was never so clearly and completely discussed as by Gauss, in a small work published by him in 1779. Various methods, and several of them elegant, have been proposed by Euler and others for simplifying and expediting the approximation to the roots of equations. When a question involved the powers and products of more than one unknown quantity, it exercised the skill of algebraists to separate them; but Bezout has brought the mode of this elimination into a regular system, which removes all the difficulties. Among the promoters of Algebraical Science may be ranked our countryman Dr Waring, a profound analyst, but unfortunately an obscure and confused writer. His Miscellanea Analytica and other detached pieces discover uncommon penetration and originality of conception, and though neglected at home, they have, notwithstanding their repulsive form, been duly appreciated by the great mathematicians on the Continent.\n\nThe latest improvement that Algebra has received consists in the Combinatorial Analysis, which may be viewed as an important extension of the principles of the binomial theorem. Vieta traced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of the doctrine, which was successively enlarged by Mersenne, Guldinus, Schooten, Pascal, Wallis, James Bernoulli, De Moivre, and Euler. But it has received its greatest expansion in Germany, and chiefly from the laborious and persevering researches of Hindenburg, who first published a tract on this subject in 1779, and resumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> in the years 1793, 1794, and 1795. He was followed in the same line of investigation by Bureckhardt, Rothe, De Prassi, and Pfaff; and this interesting branch of analysis now forms a part of the algebraical course pursued in the German States. It throws much light on the theory of equations, renders more general the method of series, and facilitates the calculation of chances.\n\nIn the application of Algebra to Geometry, Euler, pursuing the route marked out in 1727 by Frederick Mayer, has given such extension to the properties of Angular Sections, as to create almost a new science, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the appellation of the Arithmetic of Series. Vieta prepared the\n\n---\n\n1 Stephen Bezout, born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NEMOURS\">Nemours</a> on the 31st <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1730\u2014led accidentally to the study of Geometry, and fired by the perusal of the Eloges of Fontenelle. Having soon distinguished himself by proficiency in Mathematical Science, he was appointed Examiner to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NAVY\">Navy</a> in 1763, and Examiner of the Artillery Department 1768. In the discharge of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> in those offices, he gained the love and respect of the youth by his impartiality, kindness, and solicitude for their advancement. He published The General Theory of Equations in 1779, and gave further proofs of his original inventive powers in other occasional Memoirs. But he has owed his celebrity chiefly to the excellent Course of Mathematics compiled for professional education, which is highly esteemed and generally adopted on the Continent. The constitution of Bezout was prematurely exhausted, and he died of a malignant fever on the 27th of September 1793.\n\n2 Edward Waring, born near Shrewsbury in 1736. He studied at Cambridge, where he distinguished himself so much in abstract calculations, that he was elected, after a hard contest, Lucasian professor of Mathematics in January 1760. He led the life of a recluse student, and though a man of great worth, he was unfitted by his extreme diffidence for the general intercourse of society. His latter years appear to have been spent at his place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATIVITY\">nativity</a>, where he died on the 16th August 1798. Waring had not entirely confined his application to mathematical research; he printed a metaphysical tract of considerable merit, which was distributed among his friends; and it deserves mention, that he there distinctly brought forward the philosophical view of Causation which is now very generally embraced.\nway, and the Bernoullis had advanced far in the research, but it was reserved for their great disciple to expand and convert their conclusions into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> body of doctrine. This important branch of Analysis has continued to be much cultivated in Germany, under the more expressive name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GONIOMETRY\">Goniometry</a>, which was first applied by Lagny in the Parisian Transactions for 1724, to an ingenious method proposed by him for measuring angles. Pfaff has lately enlarged it with the properties of the multiple tangents, and his countryman Mollweide has likewise made some valuable additions. The store of formulae now collected is of the utmost utility in transforming and reducing into practical operation the different series adopted by Physical Astronomy.\n\nAlgebra has also been applied with advantage to Goniometry generally, as comprehending the solution of the cases both in Plane and Spherical Trigonometry. This was early attempted by Girard, but carried to its completion by Euler and Lagrange. Some concise and elegant formulae have been deduced, which facilitate and diversify the practice of computation. In short, if Algebra were purged of the vitiuous language and inaccurate conceptions that pervade it, and which were early introduced by the confidence of rapid and careless calculators, it might at last claim the character of a perfect science.\n\nThe number of elementary treatises of Algebra which have been produced in various languages during the currency of the eighteenth century, appears quite incredible. They are almost ephemeral, and assume every feature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a>, superficial or profound, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of a primer to the magnitude of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEXICON\">lexicon</a>. A very few of those works claim the highest praise, and may retain their hold of education. The Algebra of Euler is in various respects a most remarkable production. That illustrious analyst, when totally deprived of sight in his advanced age, dictated it in the German language to a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a>, whom he trained for an amanuensis. He was obliged therefore to be plain, distinct, and perspicuous; and these qualities he combined with richness of invention. The second volume had an air of originality, which made it peculiarly interesting. It treated of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-DIOPHANTINE_PROBLEMS\">Diophantine Problems</a>, and the resolution of Indeterminate Equations, and was afterwards expanded in the French version by the masterly annotations of Lagrange. In our own language, Maclaurin's Elements of Algebra, though a posthumous work, is perhaps the ablest on the whole, and the most complete. The bulky volumes of Dr Sanderson, which were likewise printed after the death of the author, are commendable chiefly as the production of an ingenious person, afflicted from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a> with the calamity of total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>; they have little claims to depth, originality, or logical precision, but possess the merit of being eminently clear, methodical, and copious even to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>. The Algebra of Thomas Simpson is a work of an opposite description\u2014brief, condensed, and marked with traits of invention. Passing over the numerous smaller treatises which have run through the schools, the compilation of Emerson deserves notice. It forms part of the Cyclomathesis, or\n\n---\n\n1 This consists in performing by the help of compasses a repeated decomposition, similar to what is effected in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of a common to a continued fraction. There being in practice generally a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> of errors, the numerical relation hence derived approximates to great precision. The method may be applied to the comparison either of arcs or of straight lines.\n\n2 The collection of formulae by Hirsch deserves particular commendation.\n\n3 Nicholas Sanderson, born at Thurleston in Yorkshire in 1689. When only twelve months old, he lost both eyeballs by small-pox; but showing early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, he was sent to the free-school at Penniston, where he made great proficiency in the knowledge of the classics, and soon understood the works of the ancient Geometers when read to him in the original Greek. He afterwards profited by the kind instructions of some mathematical friends, and found himself so far advanced in science, that at the age of 25 he repaired to Cambridge, and established his fame in that university by the warmth and splendour of his lectures on the New and Philosophy. He was encouraged by the gentleness of Whiston, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> no rival; and, on the election of that eminent enthusiast in 1711 as head of dogmatism, proceeded to the Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics, the duties of which he continued henceforth to perform with zeal and assiduity. The faculties of touch and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> he possessed in a wonderful degree; and he was a lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, breathing a free and open disposition. But sedentary habits impaired his vigorous constitution, and he died of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol12.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> in his limbs on the 19th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1739.\n\n4 William Emerson, born in June 1701 at Hurworth, a village near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DARLINGTON\">Darlington</a>\u2014the son of a schoolmaster, who taught him Mathematics, and left him a small property, which he occupied and cultivated. He was a person of strong intellect.\nseries of elementary works in all the departments of Mathematics and Mechanical Philosophy, executed with ability by that singular man; exhibiting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of valuable matter, clothed in a slovenly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, and digested without method, or any regard to taste or elegance. Nothing is more wanted for the purpose of education than a classical treatise on Algebra, which, avoiding all vague terms and hasty analogies, should unfold the principles with simplicity and rigid accuracy, and follow the train of induction with close and philosophical circumspection.\n\n4. THE HIGHER CALCULUS.\n\nLeibnitz, at his death, left the Calculus which he had framed in a most flourishing condition. The superiority of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALGORITHM\">algorithm</a>, joined to the ardour of his disciples and successors the Bernoullis, gave it the complete possession of the Continent. But in England, the Method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLUXIONS\">Fluxions</a>, now greatly in arrear, was cultivated only by a very few aspirants. Its inventor had vacillated about the notation he should adopt, and the unfortunate marking by points appeared the first time in one of the volumes of Dr Wallis' works, printed in 1699. Newton had published nothing separately on the subject, till the Tract on Fluxions, drawn from the recesses of his closet, made its appearance in 1704; which, though full of ingenuity, was then decidedly imperfect and insufficient. But Cotes* and Taylor\u2020 laboured successfully in extending the analytical discoveries of their great master. The former, one of the brightest mathematicians whom England has produced, died at an early age, after achieving, however, some fine analytical discoveries. Besides producing the beautiful geometrical theorem on which is founded the application of Binomial Factors, he constructed an ample Table of Fluents or Integrals, which were solved by the decomposition of fractions, by Logarithms or Circular Arcs. Other ingenious problems are introduced in his posthumous volume entitled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARMONIA\">Harmonia</a> Mensurarum, published in 1722 by his relative and successor Dr Smith; but for want of the author's revision, this profound tract is unluckily so concise and obscure as to need a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a>. Some of the propositions were neatly demonstrated by John Bernoulli; but De Moivre considerably extended the doctrine, which was afterwards reduced into a systematic form by Walmesley.\n\nDr Brook Taylor was a man of rich invention and elegant accomplishments, who supported with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> the reputation of English science. He was indeed our only mathematician that,\n\nand considerable talent of invention; but affected singularity, and indulged coarse boorish habits. Having a mechanical turn, he constructed his own instruments, and delineated all the figures he wanted. His best work, perhaps, was the treatise of Increments, but his System of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a> has had the greatest currency among all ranks of students. In the decline of life he suffered much from the cruel attacks of gravel, and died after a lingering illness on the 20th May 1732.\n\nThe earliest mode used by Newton for denoting a Fluxion seems to have been a zero prefixed to the variable quantity. Thus, the fluxion of $x^n$ was written $x^{n-1} \\cdot x$. It is evident therefore that the great inventor must have then had nearly the same conception of the origin of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDIVISIBLES\">Indivisibles</a> as his rival Leibnitz.\n\n* Roger Cotes, born July 10, 1682, at Burbach in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEICESTERSHIRE\">Leicestershire</a>, of which his father was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RECTOR\">rector</a>. Having shown an early and decided inclination to Mathematics, he was encouraged by his uncle, the Rev. John Smith, who carried the boy to his house in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LINCOLNSHIRE\">Lincolnshire</a>, and carefully instructed him in the principles of science. Hence he removed to St Paul's school, where he made great progress in classical attainments, but still found leisure to cultivate his favourite studies. Thus accomplished, he was sent to Trinity College at Cambridge, and advanced through all the gradations with unrivalled distinction. In January 1706, he was elected unanimously to the chair of Astronomy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Experimental Philosophy</a>, which had been just founded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARCHDEACON\">Archdeacon</a> Plume. He took orders in 1713, and at the desire of Dr Bentley superintended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> of the second edition of the Principia, to which he furnished a learned and ingenious preface. His genius and uncommon talents had raised the highest expectations, when a putrid fever snatched him away in the full tide of vigour, on the 5th of June 1716. Newton in his latter days used often to exclaim with a modest feeling of regret, \"If Cotes had lived, we should have known something.\" This very promising philosopher was perhaps rather ambitious; for, except a short but ingenious essay on Logarithms, he produced nothing of decided importance during his lifetime. The papers left by him in an imperfect and unfinished state were collected and published with some annotations by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a> and successor Dr Robert Smith.\n\n\u2020 Born in affluent circumstances at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDMONTON\">Edmonton</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a> in 1682; studied at Cambridge, where he distinguished himself, and passed through the successive gradations with the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a>. The mathematical and physical sciences were his favourite pursuits, but he embraced general learning and cultivated the fine arts, being especially fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> and music. Fortune enabled him to indulge his taste. He held the office of Secretary to the Royal Society for a few years, and afterwards visited the Continent. His mind was most acute and inventive; but, though methodical on the whole, he was at no pains to unfold his original conceptions. He died at an early age in 1731.\nafter the retreat of Newton, could safely enter the lists with the Bernoullis. His most original work, the *Methodus Incrementorum*, published in 1715, unfolded the elements of the increase and decrease of a variable quantity or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>. It was a fine extension of the Differential or Fluxionary Calculus, and constituted a new and important branch of the Higher Analysis, which has since received an appropriate algorithm, and acquired the appellation of *Finite Differences*. The *Method of Increments* was applied to the summation of series, and a variety of difficult problems, of which it afforded easy and rapid solutions. It furnished the first investigation of the motions of a vibrating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>, showing that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARMONIC\">harmonic</a> curve is a Trochoid or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROLATE\">Prolate</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYCLOID\">Cycloid</a>. Among other improvements, it contained the celebrated theorem for the expansion of a magnitude, arising from the combination of its successive orders of differentials, which has deservedly retained the name of its ingenious author. This elegant formula is of extensive use in almost every analytical inquiry, and even performs the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> process of Fluxions, by exhibiting in many cases at once the resulting fluent or integral. But the notation employed was imperfect, consisting merely of accents instead of points; and the Tract, like other works of Taylor, affected a degree of brevity which borders on obscurity. It was therefore elucidated by Nicole, an eminent French mathematician, in a series of able dissertations, between the years 1717 and 1727. The Taylorian Theorem itself has been successively modified, transformed, and extended by Maclaurin, Lagrange, and Laplace, whose names are attached to their several formul\u00e6.\n\nThe Italian mathematicians contributed materially to the progress of the Higher Calculus. The Integration of a class of Differential Equations was proposed by Count Riccati, and solved in different ways by himself and the sons and nephews of the first Bernoullis. Manfredi\\(^1\\) in 1707 gave a skilful solution of differential equations of the first degree; and in 1722, Vincent, the son of James Riccati, pursued likewise the same road. A curious kind of problems was started by Fagnano,\\(^2\\) another Italian Count, to determine those Elliptical or Hyperbolic Arcs, which have their difference expressed by an algebraical quantity. This led Euler, in 1756, to invent a very comprehensive method of determining particular integrals, that Lagrange improved in 1766 and 1769, and which he himself again simplified in 1778. Our ingenious countryman Landen has chanced to fall into a similar train, having in 1775 converted the formula for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RECTIFICATION\">rectification</a> of the Hyperbola into another which includes two arcs of an Ellipse, together with an algebraical quantity. The rectification of the Ellipse has been since improved by Legendre and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-IVORY\">Ivory</a>.\n\nTo obtain the differential of any integral expression, is always practicable; the great difficulty consists in reversing the problem, and finding the integral which corresponds to a given differential equation. Such equation must be rendered complete before the integration is effected. It was hence a question of much importance, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> unavailing efforts, by determining the conditions necessarily required for integration. Euler, as usual, was the first to discover the rule in 1736; but, only three years afterwards, it was without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> produced by Fontaine and Clairaut. At a later period, Euler extended the conditions of integrability to the higher orders of Differential Equations, which Condorcet demonstrated with equal simplicity and elegance.\n\nThe Modern Analysis thus constantly advancing, received a capital extension about the middle of the last century, by what is termed the *Calculus of Partial Differences*, which applies with singular felicity to the solution of the most arduous and recondite physical problems. It would be difficult to communicate any distinct conception of this subtle doctrine to the uninitiated, but the object proposed may be stated generally as, the method of finding the function of several\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Born at Bologna in 1674\u2014appointed professor of Mathematics there in 1698, and astronomer to the Institute of Bologna in 1711.

His mathematical researches were published in two volumes quarto, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PESARO\">Pesaro</a>, in 1750. He devoted much attention to the remarkable properties of the curves called Lemniscates.\nvariable quantities, from the relation merely of the Differential Co-efficients contained in their Complete Differential. The first specimen of this sort of Integration was given by Euler in 1734; but D'Alembert expanded the process in his Discourse on the General Cause of Winds, which appeared in 1749. It was likewise employed by both these illustrious mathematicians in the rigorous solution of the problem of the vibrating musical string, the position of any point in the harmonic curve depending evidently on the interval of time, as well as on the relation between the absciss and ordinate. But Euler left nothing unfinished. In 1762 he resumed the subject of Partial Differences, and gave a complete explication of its principles, embodying the mode of calculation by an appropriate Algorithm, in a memoir of the Petersburg Acts, entitled, Investigatio functionum ex data differentiacione conditione. But still further progress was made by him in the third volume of his immortal work on the Differential and Integral Calculus, which came out in 1770. Euler, having then advanced to differential equations of the second order, digested the whole doctrine of Partial Differences into a clear and systematic form. Yet several important additions and improvements have been since contributed to this intricate subject by Lagrange and Laplace, by Nieuport and Trembley.\n\nThe last great accession to the Higher Analysis, and somewhat resembling the method of Partial Differences, is the Calculus of Variations. Of this fine theory, the first trace was shown by the rapid genius of Leibnitz, in his mode of differentiating a curve whose equation itself is supposed to undergo the minutest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>. The controversies of the Bernoullis concerning Isoperimeters and Lines of the Swiftest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">Descent</a>, augmented greatly the various resources of that kind of Analysis. But Euler, combining their discoveries, produced a new and direct mode of finding such Maxima and Minima, and compressed the solutions into a systematic form, in a distinct treatise published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAUSANNE\">Lausanne</a> in 1744. This elaborate performance led the way for the simpler and most elegant and comprehensive doctrine created by the early genius of Lagrange, and invested by him with a commodious notation. Euler, who was far superior to any feeling of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a>, readily embraced this improvement, and bestowed on it the denomination of the Calculus of Variations, of which he explained the principles and application, after the most complete manner, in a tract appended to the third volume of his great work. The distinction between Differentials and Variations is rather subtle, yet may be easily conceived by considering the nature of the Parabola. When an ordinate shifts into a proximate position, both it and the corresponding absciss acquire Differentials; but if the Parameter suffer the minutest alteration, the whole trace of the curve will vary, and the infinitesimal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MUTATION\">mutation</a> which the ordinate thence undergoes is termed its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">Variation</a>. The algorithm adopted to denote Variations consists of the Greek letters instead of the Roman or Italic, which have been appropriated to the ordinary Differentials. The modes of Integration used in both forms are fortunately convertible.\n\nThe Integration of Differential Equations has at length, perhaps, nearly attained that degree of perfection of which it is susceptible. A multitude of expedients are devised for effecting the process in particular cases, but no general and direct method has been yet found. To integrate a differential equation of the first order composed of two variable quantities, is the problem originally known by the title of the Inverse Method of Tangents, and is commonly solved by the separation of the indeterminate members, which brings it to a question of Quadratures. Some equations consist of parts which, though not separately integrable, will yet admit of integration when combined. Others are integrated by the inverse method of factors; but the process by successive approximations may be regarded as in most cases the preferable mode. The skill of the analyst is chiefly displayed in the evolution of series the most converging.\n\nOf the Theory of the Infinitesimal Calculus, various modifications have been offered during the course of the eighteenth century, which help to elucidate the subject by their contrast, and may be regarded as fine speculations, though they should lead to no material improvements in the practice. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of flowing quantities,\nfirst proposed by Newton, and from which he framed the terms Fluxions and Fluents, appears, on the whole, very clear and satisfactory; nor should the metaphysical objection of introducing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of motion into Geometry have much weight. Maclaurin was induced, however, by such caviling, to devote half a volume to an able but superfluous discussion of this question. As a refinement on the ancient process of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXHAUSTIONS\">Exhaustions</a>, the noted method of Prime and Ultimate Ratios, or of the Relations of Vanishing or Evanescent Quantities, which Newton preferred in the Principia, deserves the highest praise for accuracy of conception. It has been justly commended by D'Alembert, who expounded it copiously, and adopted it as the basis of the Higher Calculus. The same doctrine was likewise elucidated by our acute countryman Robins, who did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCRUPLE\">scruple</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> the occasion of making a coarse attack on the great Euler. Landen, one of those men so frequent in England whose talents surmount their narrow education, produced, in 1758, a new form of the Fluxionary Calculus, under the title of Residual Analysis, which, though framed with little elegance, may be deemed, on the whole, an improvement on the method of ultimate ratios. To confer more consequence on his innovation, he contrived likewise a set of symbols, and applied his algorithm to the solution of different problems. But it never obtained any currency, and soon fell into oblivion.\n\nThe method of Analytical or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DERIVATIVE\">Derivative</a> Functions, which has since acquired such celebrity, was darkly anticipated by Dr Waring, one of the profoundest but most obscure of algebraical writers. This elegant theory was concisely sketched by Lagrange in 1772, and enlarged thirty years afterwards into a distinct work; the same subject having been treated very fully and somewhat differently by Arbogast in 1800. It is grounded chiefly on the inversion of Taylor's theorem, the co-efficients of the several terms of a Derived or Expanded Function involving the successive orders of its Differentials. But Lagrange deduces the formula from considerations purely analytical, and endeavours thence to erect a science on strict logical principles, entirely disengaged from ideas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFINITESIMALS\">Infinitesimals</a> or of Vanishing Ratios. It may however be doubted whether, with all his ingenuity, he has attained that object, or gained, indeed, any real advantage. A mathematician so deeply imbued as that sublime genius with the spirit of calculation, would almost spontaneously regard a process of analysis in the same light as a train of legitimate reasoning. However satisfactory may seem the origin of Derivative Functions, if we examine it closely, we shall probably find the demonstration to rest merely on the strength of analogy, which surely is not the most conclusive sort of argument. But though the method of Derivations should not possess that logical superiority over the Fluxionary or Differential Calculus.\n\n---\n\n4 Benjamin Robins, born of Quaker parents at Bath in 1707. He discovered early and powerful talents, which he improved with intense ardour, and soon emancipated himself from the trammels of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. Mathematics were his favourite study, but he enriched his mind by a course of extensive reading and the pursuit of general information. He became a successful teacher of those sciences in London, and turned his attention to their practical application. Having cultivated also the art of writing, he distinguished himself by several controversial pieces in science, and even assisted by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> the opposition to Walpole's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>. He was now so well known as a clever writer as to be employed in correcting Walter's account of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMOS\">Amos</a>'s Voyage round the World; but finding the performance very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, he re-composed the whole.

He sailed from England at Christmas 1749, and on his arrival in India began immediately the fortifications at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MADRAS\">Madras</a>; but he fell a sacrifice to that baneful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> on the 29th July 1751. His various mathematical works are stamped with originality of conception, and composed in a clear, neat, and forcible style.\n\n5 John Landen, born at Peakirk in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NORTHAMPTONSHIRE\">Northamptonshire</a> in January 1719. Bred up to business, he showed an early talent for Mathematics, which he strenuously cultivated at his leisure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>. In 1762 he was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> to Earl Fitzwilliam, an employment which he held till within two years of his death. Besides his separate publications, he communicated to the Royal Society, at different times, valuable papers on the most difficult parts of mathematical and physical science, all of them distinguished by depth, ingenuity, and powerful invention. It is only to be regretted that, perhaps for want of the collision of society, he indulged a dogmatic and pugnacious temper. He died near his native spot on the 15th of January 1790.\n\nAn example will show how Landen's operation might be simplified. Let it be required to find the ratio of the differential of $x$ to that of $x^n$. Assume $v$ a proximate value or state of the variable $x$; then by division $\\frac{x^n - v^n}{x - v} = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}v + \\ldots + xv^{n-1} + v^n$, the number of terms being $n$. But it is evident that the closer $x$ comes to $v$, the nearer will each of these terms approximate to $x^{n-1}$. Therefore, at the coincidence of $x$ with $v$, the differential of $x^n$ divided by the differential of $x$ is $x^{n-1}$, and consequently $dx^n = x^{n-1} dx$.\nlus which its author fondly supposed, yet is the invention entitled to the highest praise for its beautiful perspicuity and its ready and most extensive application. We have only to regret that it has required a new system of characters, when the ordinary notation has become so familiar, and attained so great perfection. Such mutations, like the diversity of languages, may be deemed a serious evil, since they divert the attention to the mere accessories of learning, and retard or obstruct the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of real knowledge.","sp":806,"ep":828},{"h":"THOMAS BROWN","t":"A writer, as he advances in life, ought to speak with diffidence of systems which he had only begun to consider with care after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> in which it becomes hard for his thoughts to flow into new channels.

His mind soared and roamed through every region of philosophy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>; but his untravelled heart clung to the hearth of his father, to the children who shared it with him, and after them, first to the other partners of his childish sports, and then almost solely to those companions of his youthful studies who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be the friends of his life. Speculation seemed to keep his kindness at home. It is observable, that though sparkling with fancy, he does not seem to have been deeply or durably touched by those affections which are lighted at its torch, or at least tinged with its colours. His heart sought little abroad, but contentedly dwelt in his family and in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>. He was one of those men of genius who repaid the tender care of a mother by rocking the cradle of her reposing age.

It may be diverted from simplicity by causes which do not reach so deep as the character; by bad models, or by a restless and wearisome anxiety to shine, arising from many circumstances, none of which are probably more common than the unseasonable exertions of a recluse student in society, and the\n\n---\n\n1 See Sir H.

The association with unlike or superior companions which least distorts manners, is that which takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> with those classes whose secure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> generally renders their own manners easy; with whom the art of pleasing or of not displeasing each other in society is a serious concern; who have leisure enough to discover the positive and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> parts of the smaller moralities; and who, being trained to a watchful eye on what is ludicrous, apply the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LASH\">lash</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> to affectation, the most ridiculous of faults. The busy in every department of life are too respectably occupied to form these manners or to bestow them. They are the frivolous work of polished idleness; and perhaps their most serious value consists in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAR\">war</a> which they wage against affectation; though even there they betray their nature in punishing it, not as a deviation from nature, but as a badge of vulgarity.\n\nThe prose of Dr Brown is brilliant to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a>. It must not be denied that its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> is sometimes womanly; that it too often melts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> precision into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>; that it buries the main idea under a load of illustration, of which every part is expanded and adorned with such a visible labour, as to withdraw the mind from attention to the thoughts which it professes to introduce more easily into the understanding. It is darkened by excessive brightness; it loses ease and liveliness by over-dress; and, in the midst of its luscious sweetness, we wish for the striking and homely illustrations of Tucker, and for the pithy and sinewy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of Paley, either of whom, by a single short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METAPHOR\">metaphor</a> from a familiar, perhaps a low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, could at one blow set the two worlds of reason and fancy in movement.\n\nIt would be unjust to censure severely the declamatory parts of his Lectures; they are excusable in the first warmth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>. They might even be justifiable allurements in attracting young hearers to abstruse speculations. Had he lived, he would probably have taken his thoughts out of the declamatory forms of spoken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, and given to them the appearance, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>, of deep and subtile discussion. The habits indeed of so successful a lecturer, and the natural luxuriancy of his mind, could not fail to have somewhat tinctured all his compositions; but though he might still have fallen short of simplicity, he certainly would have avoided much of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>, and even common-place, which hang heavily on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> and brilliant thoughts; for it must be owned, that though, as a thinker, he is unusually original, yet when he falls among the declaimers, he is infected by their common-places.\n\nIn like manner, he would assuredly have shortened or left out many of the poetical quotations which he loved to recite, and which hearers even beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> hear with delight. There are two very different sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of poetry to be found in works on philosophy, which are as far asunder from each other in value as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. A philosopher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> admit some of those wonderful lines or words which bring to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> varieties of character, the furious bursts or wily workings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, the winding approaches of temptation, the slippery path to depravity, the beauty of tenderness, the grandeur of what is awful and holy in man. In every such quotation, the moral philosopher, if he be successful, uses the best materials of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>; for what are they but the results of experiment and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> on the human heart, performed by artists of far other skill and power than his? They are facts which could have only been ascertained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, by Dante, by Shakspeare, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CERVANTES\">Cervantes</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>. Every year of admiration since the unknown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> when the Iliad first gave delight, has extorted new proofs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of human nature, from the responding hearts of the admirers. Every strong feeling which these masters have excited is a successful repetition of their original experiment, and a continually growing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of the greatness of their discoveries. Quotations of this nature may be the most satisfactory, as well as the most delightful, proofs of philosophical positions. Others of inferior merit are not to be interdicted\u2014a pointed maxim, especially when familiar, pleases, and is recollected. I cannot entirely conquer my passion for the Roman and Stoical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a> of some passages in Lucan and Akenside. But\nquotations from those who have written on philosophy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>; or, in other words, from those who generally are inferior philosophers, and voluntarily deliver their doctrines in the most disadvantageous form, seem to be unreasonable. It is agreeable, no doubt, to the philosopher, still more to the youthful student, to meet his abstruse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> clothed in the sonorous verse of Akenside. The surprise of the unexpected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of verse with science is a very lawful enjoyment. But such slight and momentary pleasures, though they may tempt the writer to display them, do not excuse a vain effort to obtrude them on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a> of the searcher after truth in after-times. It is peculiarly unlucky that Dr Brown should have sought supposed ornament from the moral common-places of Thomson, rather than from that illustration of philosophy which is really to be found in his picturesque strokes.\n\nMuch more need not be said of Dr Brown's own poetry, somewhat voluminous as it is, than that it indicates fancy and feeling, and rose at least to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of an elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a>. It may seem a paradox, but it appears to me that he is really most poetical in those poems and passages which have the most properly metaphysical character. For every various form of life and nature, when it is habitually contemplated, may inspire feeling; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> representation of these feelings may be poetical. Dr Brown observed man, and his wider world, with the eye of a metaphysician; and the dark results of such contemplations, when he reviewed them, often filled his soul with feelings which, being both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and melancholy, were truly poetical. Unfortunately, however, few readers can be touched with fellow-feeling. He sings to few, and must be content with sometimes moving a string in the soul of the lonely visionary, who, in the day-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> of youth, has felt as well as meditated on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol12.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of nature. His heart has produced charming passages in all his poems; but, generally speaking, they are only beautiful works of art and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>. The choice of Akenside as a favourite and a model may, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEROGATION\">derogation</a> from that writer, be considered as no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of a poetically formed mind. There is more poetry in many single lines of Cowper than in volumes of sonorous verses such as Akenside's. Philosophical poetry is very different from versified philosophy. The former is the highest exertion of genius, the latter cannot be ranked above the slighter amusements of ingenuity. Dr Brown's poetry was, it must be owned, composed either of imitations, which, with some exceptions, may be produced and read without feeling, or of effusions of such feelings only as meet a rare and faint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ECHO\">echo</a> in the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>.\n\nA few words only can here be bestowed on the intellectual part of his philosophy. It is an open revolt against the authority of Reid; and, by a curious concurrence, he began to lecture nearly at the moment when the doctrines of that philosopher came to be taught with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> in France. Mr Stewart had dissented from the language of Reid, and had widely departed from his opinions on several secondary theories. Dr Brown rejected them entirely. He very justly considered the claim of Reid to the merit of detecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> delusion which had betrayed philosophers into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that ideas which were the sole objects of knowledge had a separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>, as a proof of his having mistaken their illustrative language for a metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>; but he does not do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> which Reid really rendered to mental science, by keeping the attention of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> speculators in a state of more constant watchfulness against the transient influence of such an illusion. His choice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> feeling to denote the operations which we usually refer to the understanding, is evidently too wide a departure from its ordinary use, to have any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a>. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> can strip so familiar a word of the thoughts and emotions which have so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> accompanied it, so as to fit it for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> term of the highest\n\n---\n\n1 His accomplished friend Mr Erskine confesses that Brown's poems \"are not written in the language of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> emotion. The string touched is too delicate for general sympathy. They are in an unknown tongue, to one half\" (he might have said nineteen twentieths) \"of the reading part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>.\" (Welsch's Life of Brown, p. 431.)\n2 Brown's Lectures, vol. II. p. 1-49.\nabstraction. If we can be said to have a feeling \"of the equality of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of forty-five degrees to half the angle of ninety degrees,\"\u00b9 we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">Arithmetic</a> sciences of feeling. He has very forcibly stated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of assuming \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> universal intuitions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> belief,\" which, in their nature, are incapable of all proof. They seem to be accurately described as notions which cannot be conceived separately, but without which nothing can be conceived. They are not only necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> and to belief, but to thought itself. It is equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to prove or to disprove them. He has very justly blamed the school of Reid for \"an extravagant and ridiculous\" multiplication of those principles which he truly represents as inconsistent with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> philosophy. To philosophize is indeed nothing more than to simplify securely.\u00b2\n\nThe substitution of suggestion for the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a>, association of ideas, would hardly deserve notice in so cursory a view, if it had not led him to a serious misconception of the doctrines and deserts of other philosophers. The fault of the latter phrase is rather in the narrowness of the last, than in the inadequacy of the first word. Association presents the fact in the light of a relation between two mental acts. Suggestion denotes rather the power of the one to call up the other. But whether we say that the sight of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> suggests fire, or that the ideas of fire and ashes are associated, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to convey the same fact; and, in both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, an exact thinker means to accompany the fact with no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>. Dr Brown has supposed the word association as intended to affirm that there was some \"intermediate process\"\u00b3 between the original succession of the mental acts, and the power which they acquired therefrom of calling up each other. This is quite as much to raise up imaginary antagonists for the honour of conquering them, as he justly reprehends Dr Reid for doing in the treatment of preceding philosophers. He falls into another more important and unaccountable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, in representing his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Mr Hume's principles of association (resemblance, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">contrariety</a>, causation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTIGUITY\">contiguity</a> in time or place) to the one principle of contiguity, as a discovery of his own, by which his theory is distinguished from \"the universal opinion of philosophers.\"\u2074 Nothing but too exclusive a consideration of the doctrines of the Scottish school could have led him to speak thus of what was hinted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, distinctly laid down by Hobbes, and fully unfolded both by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a> and Condillac. He has, however, extremely enlarged the proof and the illustration of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of mind, by the exercise of \"a more subtile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>,\" and the disclosure of \"a finer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a>.\"\u2075 As he has thus aided and confirmed, though he did not discover the general law, so he has rendered a new and very important service to mental science, by what he properly calls \"secondary laws of suggestion\"\u2076 or association,\u2014circumstances which modify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the general law, and must be distinctly considered, in order to explain its connection with the phenomena. The enumeration and exposition are instructive, and the example is worthy of commendation. For it is in this lower region of science that most remains to be discovered; it is that which rests most on observation, and least tempts to controversy; it is by improvements in that part of knowledge that the foundations are secured, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> so repaired as to rest steadily on them. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of common language between the head and the heart, which, as we have seen, is so often overlooked or misapplied by metaphysicians, is, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of Brown, signified by the terms \"mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STATES\">states</a>\" and \"emotions.\" It is unlucky that no single word could be found for the former, and that the use of \"feeling,\" as the generic term, should disturb its easy\n\n\u00b9 Brown's Lectures, vol. I. p. 222.\n\u00b2 Dr Brown always expresses himself best where he is short and familiar. \"An hypothesis is nothing more than a reason for making one experiment or observation rather than another.\" (Lectures, vol. I. p. 170.) In 1812, as the present writer observed to him that Reid and Hume differed more in words than in opinion, he answered, \"Yes, Reid bawled out, we must believe an outward world; but added in a whisper, we can give no reason for our belief.\" Hume cries out, we can give no reason for such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a>; and whispers, I own we cannot get rid of it.\"\n\u00b3 Lectures, vol. II. p. 335-347.\n\u2074 Ibid. vol. II. p. 349.\n\u2075 Ibid. vol. II. p. 216, &c.\n\u2076 Ibid. vol. II. p. 270.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> when it is applied more naturally.\n\nIn our more proper province he has followed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>, who appears to have been chiefly known to him through Mr Stewart, in the theory of the social affections. Their disinterestedness is enforced by the arguments of both these philosophers, as well as of Hutcheson. It is observable, however, that he applies the principle of suggestion or association boldly to this part of human nature, and seems inclined to refer to it even sympathy itself. It is hard to understand how, with such a disposition on the subject of a principle so generally thought ultimate as Sympathy, he should, inconsistently with himself, follow Mr Stewart in representing the theory which derives the affections from association as \"a Modification of the Selfish System.\" He mistakes that theory by stating, that it derives the affections from our experience that our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> was connected with that of others; while in truth it considers our regard to our own interest as formed from the same original pleasures by association, which, by the like process, may and do directly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> affections towards others, without passing through the channel of regard to our general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. But, says he, this is only an hypothesis, since the formation of these affections is acknowledged to belong to a time of which there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a>;\u2014an objection fatal to every theory of any mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>,\u2014subversive, for example, of Berkeley's discovery of acquired visual perception, and most strangely inconsistent in the mouth of a philosopher whose numerous simplifications of mental theory are and must be founded on occurrences which precede experience. It is in all other cases, and it must be in this, sufficient that the principle of the theory is really existing, that it explains the appearances, that its supposed action resembles what we know to be its action in those similar cases of which we have direct experience. Lastly, he in express words admits that, according to the theory to which he objects, we have affections which are at present disinterested. Is it not a direct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> in terms to call such a theory \"a modification of the selfish system\"? His language in the sequel clearly indicates a distrust of his own statement, and a suspicion that he is not only inconsistent, but altogether mistaken.\n\nAs we enter more deeply into the territory of Ethics, we at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> discover in Brown a distinction, the neglect of which by preceding speculators we have more than once lamented as productive of obscurity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>:\u2014\"The moral affections,\" says he, \"which I consider at present, I consider rather physiologically\" (or, as he elsewhere better expresses it, \"psychologically\") \"than ethically, as parts of our mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, not as involving the fulfilment or violation of duties.\" He immediately, however, loses sight of this distinction, and reasons inconsistently with it, instead of following it to its proper consequences in his explanation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>. Perhaps, indeed, (for the words are capable of more than one sense,) he meant to distinguish the virtuous affections from those sentiments which have morality exclusively in view, rather than to distinguish the theory of moral sentiment from the attempt to ascertain the characteristic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> action. Friendship is conformable in its dictates to morality; but it may, and does exist, without any view to it. He who feels the affections, and performs the duties of friendship, is the object of that distinct emotion which is called moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a>.\n\nIt is on the subject of conscience that, in imitation of Mr Stewart, and with no other arguments than his, he makes his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> stand against the theory which considers the formation of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> itself as probably referable to the necessary and universal operation of those laws of human nature to which he himself ascribes almost every other state of mind. On both sides of this question the supremacy of conscience is alike held to be venerable and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a>.

III. p. 231.\nmore, be it remembered, that the question is purely philosophical, and is only whether, from the impossibility of explaining its formation by more general laws, we are reduced to the necessity of considering it as an original fact in human nature, of which no further account can be given. Let it, however, be also remembered, that we are not driven to this supposition by the mere circumstance, that no satisfactory explanation has yet appeared; for there are many analogies in an unexplained state of mind to states already explained, which may justify us in believing that the explanation requires only more accurate observation, and more patient meditation, to be brought to that completeness which it probably will attain.","sp":620,"ep":626},{"h":"WILLIAM PALEY","t":"This excellent writer, who, after Clarke and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>, ought to be ranked among the brightest ornaments of the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> in the eighteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, is, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, naturally placed after Tucker, to whom, with praiseworthy liberality, he owns his extensive obligations.

Grateful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> brings this assemblage of qualities with unfaded colours before the mind at the present moment, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of twenty-eight years. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for the common business and ordinary amusements of life fortunately gave a zest to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> which his neighbourhood chanced to yield, without rendering him insensible to the pleasures of intercourse with more enlightened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. The practical bent of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> is visible in the language of his writings, which, on practical matters, is as precise as the nature of the subject requires, but, in his rare and reluctant efforts to rise to first principles, becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> and unsatisfactory; though no man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> was more free from the impediments which hinder a writer's meaning from being quickly and clearly seen. He seldom distinguishes more exactly than is required for palpable and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> usefulness. He possessed that chastised acuteness of discrimination, exercised on the affairs of men, and habitually looking to a purpose beyond the mere increase of knowledge, which forms the character of a lawyer's understanding, and which is apt to render a mere lawyer too subtile for the management of affairs, and yet too gross for the pursuit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> is as near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> in its kind as any in our language. Perhaps no words were ever more expressive and illustrative than those in which he represents the art of life to be that of rightly \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> our habits.\"\n\nThe most original and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> of his writings is the Horae Paulinae. The Evidences of Christianity are formed out of an admirable translation of Butler's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">Analogy</a>, and a most skilful abridgement of Lardner's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREDIBILITY\">Credibility</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOSPEL\">Gospel</a> History. He may be said to have thus given value to two works, of which the first was scarcely intelligible to most of those who were most desirous of profiting by it; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> soon wearies out the greater part of readers, though the few who are more patient have always been gradually won over to feel pleasure in a display of knowledge, probity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>, and meekness, unmatched by an avowed advocate in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> deeply interesting his warmest feelings. His Natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-THEOLOGY\">Theology</a> is the wonderful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of a man who, after sixty, had studied anatomy in order to write it; and it could only have been surpassed by a man who, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> originality of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> and clearness of exposition, added the advantage of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of physiologists.\n\nIt would be unreasonable here to say much of a work which is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of so many as his Moral and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> Philosophy. A very few remarks on one or two parts of it may be sufficient to estimate his value as a moralist, and to show his defects as a metaphysician. His general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> may indeed be chosen for both purposes. The manner in which he deduces the necessary tendency of all virtuous actions to the general happiness, from the goodness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">Divine</a> Lawgiver, though the principle be not, as has already more than once appeared, peculiar to him, but rather common to most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> philosophers, is characterized by a clearness and vigour which have never been surpassed. It is indeed nearly, if not entirely, an identical proposition, that a Being of unmixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> prescribe those laws only to his creatures which contribute to their wellbeing. When we are convinced that a course of conduct is generally beneficial to all men, we cannot help considering it as acceptable to a benevolent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>. The usefulness of actions is the mark set on them by the Supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">Legislator</a>, by which reasonable beings discover it to be His will that such actions should be done. In this apparently unanswerable deduction it is partly admitted, and universally implied, that the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and wrong may be treated apart from the manifestation of them in the Scriptures. If it were otherwise, how could men of perfectly different religions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> with each other on moral subjects? How could they regard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> and duties as subsisting between them? To what common principles could they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a>\n\n---\n\n1 See Animal Mechanic, by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a>, published by the Society for Useful Knowledge.\nin their differences? Even the Polytheists themselves, those worshippers of\n\nGods partial, changeful, passionate, unjust,\nWhose attributes are rage, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>, or lust,\n\nby a happy inconsistency are compelled, however irregularly and imperfectly, to ascribe some general enforcement of the moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CODE\">code</a> to their divinities. If there were no foundation for morality <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANTECEDENT\">antecedent</a> to revealed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, we should want that important test of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a> to pure morality, by which its claim to a divine origin is to be tried. The internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of religion necessarily presupposes such a standard. The Christian contrasts the precepts of the Koran with the pure and benevolent morality of the Gospel. The Mahometan claims, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, a superiority over the Hindoo, inasmuch as the Mussulman religion inculcates the moral perfection of one Supreme Ruler of the world. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CEREMONIAL\">ceremonial</a> and exclusive character of Judaism has ever been regarded as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> that it was intended to pave the way for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> religion,\u2014a morality seated in the heart, and a worship of sublime simplicity. These discussions would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, unless morality were previously proved or granted to exist. Though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of Ethics is thus far independent, it by no means follows that there is any equality, or that there may not be the utmost inequality, in the moral tendency of religious systems. The most ample scope is still left for the zeal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of those who seek to spread important truth. But it is absolutely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to ethical science that it should contain principles, the authority of which must be recognised by men of every conceivable variety of religious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>.\n\nThe peculiarities of Paley's mind are discoverable in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>, or rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a>, between the practical chapter on Happiness, and the philosophical portion of the chapter on Virtue. \"Virtue is the doing good to mankind, in obedience to the will of God, and for the sake of everlasting happiness.\" It is not perhaps very important to observe, that these words, which he offers as \"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a>,\" ought in propriety to have been called a proposition; but it is much more necessary to say that they contain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> account of virtue. According to this doctrine, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> not done for the sake of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>'s happiness is vicious. Now, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> cannot be said to be done for the sake of any thing which is not present to the mind of the agent at the moment of action. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> in terms to affirm that a man acts for the sake of any object, of which, however it may be the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of his act, he is not at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TIME\">time</a> fully aware. The unfelt consequences of his act can no more influence his will than its unknown consequences. Nay, further, a man is only with any propriety said to act for the sake of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> object; nor can he with entire correctness be said to act for the sake of any thing but his sole object. So that it is a necessary consequence of Paley's proposition, that every act which flows from generosity or benevolence is a vice. So also of every act of obedience to the will of God, if it arises from any motive but a desire of the reward which he will bestow. Any act of obedience influenced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, and affection, and veneration towards supreme benevolence and perfection, is so far <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>; and if it arises solely from these motives it becomes a vice. It must be owned, that this excellent and most enlightened man has laid the foundations of religion and virtue in a more intense and exclusive selfishness than was avowed by the Catholic enemies of Fenelon, when they persecuted him for his doctrine of a pure and disinterested <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of God.\n\nIn another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, of a very subordinate kind, the disposition of Paley to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> his principles to his own time and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and to look at them merely as far as they are calculated to amend prevalent vices and errors, betrayed him into narrow and false views. His chapter on what he calls the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">Honour</a> is unjust, even in its own small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, because it supposes honour to allow what it does not forbid; though the truth be, that the vices enumerated by him are only not forbidden by honour, because they are\n\n---\n\n'Paley, book i. chap. vii.'\nnot within its jurisdiction. He considers it as \"a system of rules constructed by people of fashion;\"\u2014a confused and transient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of expression, which may be understood with difficulty by our posterity, and which cannot now be exactly rendered perhaps in any other language.\n\nThe subject, however, thus narrowed and lowered, is neither unimportant in practice, nor unworthy of the consideration of the moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>. Though all mankind honour virtue and despise vice, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of respect or contempt is often far from being proportioned to the place which virtues and vices occupy in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> system of Ethics. Wherever higher honour is bestowed on one moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> than on others of equal or greater moral value, what is called a point of honour may be said to exist. It is singular that so shrewd an observer as Paley should not have observed a law of honour far more permanent than that which attracted his notice, in the feelings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> respecting the conduct of men and women. Cowardice is not so immoral as cruelty, nor indeed so detestable, but it is more despicable and disgraceful. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> point of honour forbids indeed a great vice, but one not so great as many others by which it is not violated. It is easy enough to see, that where we are strongly prompted to a virtue by a natural impulse, we love the man who is constantly actuated by the amiable sentiment, but we do not consider that which is done without difficulty as requiring or deserving admiration and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>. The kind affections are their own rich reward, and they are the object of affection to others. To encourage kindness by praise would be to insult it, besides its effect in producing counterfeits. It is for the conquest of fear, it would be still more for the conquest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>, if that were not; wherever it is real, the cessation of a state of mental agony, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> of mankind is reserved. Observations of a similar nature will easily occur to every reader respecting the point of honour in the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>. The conquest of natural frailties, especially in a case of far more importance to mankind than is at first sight obvious, is well distinguished as an object of honour, and the contrary vice is punished by shame. Honour is not wasted on those who abstain from acts which are punished by the law. These acts may be avoided without a pure motive. Wherever a virtue is easily performed by good men\u2014wherever it is its nature to be attended by delight\u2014wherever its outward observance is so necessary to society as to be enforced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>\u2014it is not the proper object of honour. Honour and shame, therefore, may be reasonably dispensed, without being strictly proportioned to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> morality of actions, if the inequality of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> contributes to the general equipoise of the whole moral system.\n\nA wide disproportion, however, or indeed any disproportion not justifiable on moral grounds, would be a depravation of the moral principle. Duelling is among us a disputed case, though the improvement of manners has rendered it so much more infrequent, that it is likely in time to lose its support from opinion. Those who excuse individuals for yielding to a false point of honour, as in the suicides of the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, may consistently blame the faulty principle, and rejoice in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>. The shame fixed on a Hindoo widow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> who voluntarily survives her husband, is regarded by all other nations with horror.\n\nThere is room for great praise and some blame in other parts of Paley's works. His political opinions were those generally adopted by moderate whigs in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. His language on the Revolution of 1688 may be very advantageously compared, both in precision and in generous boldness, to that of Blackstone, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of classical and harmonious composition, but a feeble reasoner and a confused thinker, whose writings are not exempt from the taint of slavishness.\n\nIt cannot be denied that Paley was sometimes rather a lax moralist, especially on public duties.\n\n---\n\n1 \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a> may be too secure. The greatest tyrants have been those whose titles were the most unquestioned. Whenever, therefore, the opinion of right becomes too predominant and superstitious, it is aborted by breaking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>. Thus the Revolution broke the custom of succession, and thereby moderated, both in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> and in the people, those lofty notions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> right, which in the one were become a continual incentive to tyranny, and disposed the other to invite servitude, by undue compliances and dangerous concessions.\" (Paley, book vii. chap ii.)\nIt is a sin which easily besets men of strong good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, little enthusiasm, and much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. They are naturally led to lower their precepts to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of their expectations. They see that higher pretensions often produce less good, to say nothing of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOCRISY\">hypocrisy</a>, extravagance, and turbulence, to which they lend some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. As those who claim more from men often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> less, it is natural for more sober and milder casuists to present a more accessible virtue to their followers. It was thus that the Jesuits began, till, strongly tempted by their perilous station as the moral guides of the powerful, some of them by degrees fell into that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> licentiousness for which all, not without injustice, have been cruelly immortalized by Pascal. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol12.html#article-INDULGENCE\">Indulgence</a>, which is a great virtue in judgment concerning the actions of others, is too apt, when blended in the same system with the precepts of morality, to be received as a licence for our own offences. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">Accommodation</a>, without which society would be painful, and arduous affairs would become impracticable, is more safely imbibed from temper and experience, than taught in early and systematic instruction. The middle region between laxity and rigour is hard to be fixed, and it is still harder steadily to remain within its boundaries. Whatever may be thought of Paley's observations on political influence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> subscription, as temperaments and mitigations which may preserve us from harsh judgment, they are assuredly not well qualified to form a part of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> which ought to breathe into the opening souls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>, at the critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of the formation of character, those inestimable virtues of sincerity, of integrity, of independence, which will even guide them more safely through life than mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, while they provide an inward fountain of pure delight, immeasurably more abundant than all the outward sources of precarious and perishable pleasure.","sp":598,"ep":602}]
