[{"h":"ABEL","t":"who succeeded in generalizing Legendre's methods to a far greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, was a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>, born in 1802 (25th August), and died the same at the premature <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of twenty-six (1829, 26th April). His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> memoir was presented to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> Institute when he was only twenty-four years old; and, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Mr Leslie Ellis, \"when the resources of the integral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a> were apparently exhausted, Abel was enabled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> into new fields of research by bringing it into intimate connection with a new branch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, namely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a> of Equations. The manner in which this was done shows that he was not unworthy to follow in the path of Euler and of Lagrange.\" 2\n\nLegendre's eulogy of Abel was concise:\u2014\"Quelle t\u00eate celle du jeune Norvegien!\" It is less agreeable to add that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of Abel was perhaps shortened by poverty and care. Though ultimately befriended by Legendre, Poisson, and others, his first visit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> (in 1826) occasioned nothing but disappointment, and his great memoir (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> unusual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a>, for the same happened to Fresnel) lay hopelessly lost amidst the papers of the Institute for fifteen years. Much, however, to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, the geometers above mentioned at length addressed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-KING\">King</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> on behalf of the rare genius his dominions contained; but in vain. Abel died neglected, unable even to print his researches, which were tardily given to the world in a collected form, at the expense of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> which refused to support\n\n---\n\n1 There is some discrepancy, as to the year of his birth, but I believe this to be correct.\n2 Report on the recent progress of Analysis.

The French Academy, which had buried his memoir in their most inaccessible \"archives,\" decreed too late the unprecedented <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of a posthumous medal to his mother. Jacobi, the friendly rival of Abel in his discoveries, died recently, at a mature though not advanced age, at K\u00f6nigsberg, where he was professor.\n\nBut to return to the labours of Legendre. The theory of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> and of other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a> naturally divides itself into two parts\u2014(1.) the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of attraction of an ellipsoid on a material point without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> within it; (2.) the figure of equilibrium of a fluid subjected to no forces but the mutual attractions of its particles, and the centrifugal force due to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a>. The latter of these problems is still imperfectly solved, the former completely so, and that mainly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the labours of Legendre and Ivory.\n\nThough the services of Legendre are well known and admitted, the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> of Laplace in the applications of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> has occasioned his receiving the credit of what in some instances belonged to the former.\n\nMaclaurin, by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of synthetic skill not exceeded since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Newton, had demonstrated the attraction of an ellipsoid of revolution upon a material point anywhere within it or on its surface, as well as for an exterior point in the prolongation of its axis or in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> of its equator. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> was afterwards analytically solved by D'Alembert and Lagrange. In 1782, Legendre, by a profound and complicated analysis, obtained an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, for the attraction of an exterior particle generally, and he was the first to imagine and employ those artifices of calculation known usually by the name of \"Laplace's functions.\" Laplace made a step towards the simplification of the expression of exterior attractions, but the complete solution was reserved for Mr Ivory, as I shall mention below.\n\nThe other labours of Legendre need not be specified here. He co-operated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRIGONOMETRICAL_SURVEY\">trigonometrical survey</a> of France, and gave the formula, known by his name, for approximately reducing a spherical to a plane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>. He also wrote on the orbits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a>, and on the method of least squares.\n\nJames Ivory, the most considerable British mathematician of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, or that had appeared since Maclaurin, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUNDEE\">Dundee</a> in 1765, and studied at St Andrews along with Sir John Leslie. The most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of his life was passed as mathematical professor at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">Military</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> of Marlow (afterwards removed to Sandhurst). He was essentially a self-taught mathematician, and spent much of his time in retirement. He fathomed in private the profoundest writings of the most learned continental mathematicians, and, at a period when but few Englishmen were able to understand those difficult works, he showed his capacity of adding to their value by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> contributions, not unworthy of the first analysts. We pass over his earlier contributions connected with mathematics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, several of which are contained in the Transactions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, and proceed to his most celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1809, in which he completely and definitely resolves the problem of attractions for every class of ellipsoidal bodies. After what has been stated above as to the position of the problem as treated by Legendre, a few words <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> explain the precise import of Ivory's Theorem, one of the most celebrated mathematical results of that time.\n\nWe have seen that the attraction of an ellipsoid on a point within or at its surface had been assigned by Maclaurin. The theorem in question enables us at once to reduce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of an exterior attracted attraction point to that of a point on the surface of the ellipsoid, of Ellipsoids.\n\nSuppose an ellipsoid having the same eccentricity, and with the principal sections <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the first, but whose surface passes through the given exterior point. Let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> on the surface whose co-ordinates parallel to the three axes of the respective solids are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to those axes be called corresponding points; then the attraction parallel to each axis which one of these bodies exerts on a point situated on the surface of the other is to the attraction of the latter on the \"corresponding point\" of the surface of the former, as the product of the two other axes of the first ellipsoid is to the product of the two other axes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>. By this means the attraction on an exterior point is accurately expressed in terms of the attraction on an interior point, which is known. It is fair to add that both Legendre and Laplace had some glimpses of the principle, though they failed to apply it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> solution of the problem, and between the publication of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> and that of Mr Ivory there elapsed nearly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a century.\n\nBesides this paper, Ivory contributed many others on the subject of the attraction of spheroids and the theory of the figure of the earth, during a period of nearly thirty years; several of these were controversial, and did not add materially to the progress of the subject; others are considered as masterpieces of analytical skill. One of the last subjects which occupied his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> was the possible equilibrium of a spheroid with three unequal axes, which Jacobi had discovered.\n\nBetween the labours of Ivory and those of Legendre a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> subsists; for the doctrine of elliptic integrals also occupied the attention of the former.\n\nBut next to the theory of attractions, that of Atmospheric Refraction most seriously engaged Ivory's attention. Its great importance in astronomy, and\n\n---\n\n1 See the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> Attraction and Figure of the Earth (the former by Ivory) in this Encyclopaedia.\nthe curious mathematical difficulties which it presents, renders it very interesting to analysts. Laplace had applied to it his method of Generating Functions; Kramp had introduced into his (now scarce) treatise the almost new Calculus of Factorials; and others, like Bessel and Atkinson, had skilfully combined theory and observation for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of useful tables. One of the most curious results of recent enquiries into this subject is, that Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of refractions (Phil. Trans., 1721) must have been founded on a profound consideration of the problem, such as no one else thought of till a much later period, and is so numerically exact as to agree closely with the later tables, Kramp's for example.\n\nMr Ivory attained the age of seventy-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a>, dying on the 21st September 1842. Probably his unceasing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> to a confined and abstruse topic of enquiry, reacting on a sensitive frame, rendered him in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> irritable and unsocial. He was not altogether responsible for this; but students of science should recollect that diversity of occupations and interests is subservient not only to bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, but also to mental equanimity and vigour.\n\nThe historian of science dwells with a special <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> on the results of Ivory's labours, when we recall the singular destitution of higher mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> which had reigned in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> for so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> a period, and which left us not only no position in the great struggle going on abroad for the advancement of physical astronomy, but scarcely even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of intelligent spectators.\n\n\u00a7 4.

Notwithstanding, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> compression, I must devote one short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> to mentioning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> labours in connection with physical astronomy of four eminent men mentioned in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>, who may fitly be considered as the immediate successors of Laplace. Two of them will be again referred to in this discourse.\n\nSim\u00e9on Denis Poisson, born in 1781, may be said truly to have been brought up at the feet of Lagrange and Laplace. He was their pupil in the first and brightest years of the Polytechnic School, where he was especially noticed by the former. He had the distinguished privilege of being literally their fellow-worker, his early memoirs having reference to their labours, and stimulating the still vigorous mind of Lagrange to the production, in his latest years, of several memoirs, which have been considered worthy of his best days. I refer more particularly to Poisson's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the stability of the planetary system holds when perturbations of the second order are taken into account, as has been stated in the first section of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>, Art. (55.) This was in 1808. Soon after, following out another of Lagrange's admirable generalizations of his theory of Arbitrary Constants, he embraced in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> series of formul\u00e6 the result of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> laws which regulate the rotation of bodies, together with those concerned in their translation in space. This important subject (rotation) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> at intervals to engage the attention of Poisson, not only as regards the motions of the heavenly bodies on their axes, but also as a branch of common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>. The basis of this intricate doctrine was laid by Huygens; Euler, in a celebrated and original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, gave it a general and analytical form; D'Alembert solved it by the problems of precession and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUTATION\">nutation</a>; Laplace demonstrated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> of the time of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\">earth's</a> rotation round its axis. This last problem was more fully discussed by Poisson, who showed by theory that neither can the earth ever rotate round an axis different from its present one, nor can the time of its rotation vary in consequence of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> attractions to which it is subject. These two matters are of the utmost moment; the first prevents the latitude of places from varying, and also renders impossible the extensive flooding of dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> by the waters of the ocean, which would be the evident consequence of such a change; the second assures us that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> unit of reckoning in all ages, the basis of astronomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a> and of physical astronomy generally, the length of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> solar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, has not varied, and never will perceptibly vary under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of known forces. Laplace had long before proved, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> eclipses with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> observations, that, practically, the length of the day had not varied in 2000 years. It appears, indeed, that since the earliest recorded Chaldean\n\n---\n\n1 See Blot in Connaissance des Temps, 1839; and Bally's Life of Flamsteed.\neclipse (that of B.C. 720), the rotatory velocity has not altered by one ten-millionth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>.\n\nAn eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> and rival of Poisson, M. Poinsot, has added many elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> to the Theory of Rotation. M. Poinsot is also the author of the Theory of Statical Couples, which now forms part of all elementary treatises on mechanics.\n\nPoisson wrote many other papers on subjects of physical astronomy, such, for example, as the Lunar Theory, but they did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, on the whole, to striking conclusions. In fact, he allowed himself to be diverted from this his most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> calling, by the ambition of constructing a system of Physics mainly founded on the applications of analysis. Some bulky volumes of this series appeared, especially those on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAPILLARY\">Capillary</a> Attraction, and on the Theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEAT\">Heat</a>. The author here shows himself as a profound analyst, but adds little to our knowledge either of principles or of important results. A similar criticism may be applied to his theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELASTIC\">Elastic</a> Substances, and to his doctrine of Waves. His papers on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNETISM\">Magnetism</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">Electricity</a> will be mentioned elsewhere, but their character is somewhat similar. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a> he was attached to the Newtonian theory. In Mechanics not requiring assumptions as to the properties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, he was very successful. He was eminently a solver of hard problems; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the whole circumstances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of a projectile in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> deserves notice. Indeed every branch of mechanics received his attention, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of his printed papers is said to exceed three hundred. On the whole, he will, perhaps, be most generally and favourably known by the excellent Treatise on Mechanics which he wrote for the use of advanced students. He was an eminent and diligent Professor, and his whole life was one of almost unremitting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>. \"La vie c'est le travail!\" was his reply, when urged to consult his health by reposing from his labours; and he actually died in the discharge of his duty as examinator of the Polytechnic School. This occurred on the 25th April 1840, in the fifty-ninth year of his age.\n\nMr Airy on the perturbation of Venus by Earth's motion.\u2014We here detach from what we shall elsewhere have to record of the eminent services rendered to the cause of astronomy by the present Astronomer Royal of England, a notice of his chief discovery in physical astronomy, the more remarkable from being almost the only improvement in the theory of the planetary motions, as applicable to the tables, which had proceeded from an English mathematician for a very long period. Sir James South called attention, in 1826, to a small but well marked deviation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">Sun</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> from that given by Delambre's solar theory (the Sun's place or the Earth's are of course convertible terms). Mr Airy, then Lucasian professor at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, instituted, in 1827, a more extensive comparison with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a> Observa-\n\ntions, and attributed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> chiefly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> of erroneous masses for Venus and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a>. But prolonged study satisfied him that it arose from a \"long inequality,\" arising from the mutual action of the Earth and Venus, similar in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> to that mentioned in Art. (66), as detected by Laplace in the case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>. It arises from the circumstance that eight times the orbital period of the Earth is almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to thirteen times that of Venus. Terms of the series expressive of the mutual action of the planets, which are divided by thirteen times the mean motion of the former minus eight times the mean motion of the latter (which is a very small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>), may consequently become considerable; still more, those involving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of this quantity. Such terms belong to the fifth and higher orders of the eccentricity, and would consequently be very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> indeed, but for the casual magnitude of their coefficient. The labour of tracing out and calculating the effects of these important terms from the vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of algebraic developments is enormously great,\u2014much greater than in the corresponding case of Jupiter and Saturn. As the calculations are not very likely to be repeated, Mr Airy took extraordinary precautions in their verification. The period of the inequality depends, first, as has been explained in Art. (67), upon the period required to carry the point of conjunction of the two planets completely round the circumference. This period is no less than 270 years. The perturbation is of course mutual, and affects the place of Venus as well as of the Earth.\n\nMr Airy is also the author of investigations connected with the Figure of the Earth, and the Theory of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TIDES\">Tides</a> [see Art. (32)]; and he has published valuable Tracts on Physical Astronomy for the use of students.\n\nSir John Lubbock's name deserves mention here as having devoted his energies, about the same time Sir John Lubbock, with Mr Airy, to intricate and laborious researches connected with the least inviting parts of physical astronomy, and striven to redeem England from the reproach of indifference or incapacity in respect of such inquiries. The chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his numerous memoirs (in the Philosophical Transactions for 1830, and following years) is to express, in a more convenient and exact manner than had been in use, the complicated serieses indicative of the perturbations as well in the Lunar as in the Planetary Theory.\n\nThe Lunar Theory: MM. Plana and Hansen.\u2014MM. Plana M. Plana, an astronomer and analyst of the greatest merit, who fortunately still does honour to the native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Lagrange (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TURIN\">Turin</a>), though the author of a great Lunar number of Memoirs in the Transactions of the Turin Academy, on different points of Applied Mathematics, is, and will be, best known by his elaborate and learned treatise on the Theory of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">Moon</a>. This extends to three very bulky quarto volumes, which are, so to speak, one mass of symbols. Nothing can\ngive a more impressive idea of the condition at which Physical Astronomy has now arrived, than a glance at this mountain of intellectual labour,\u2014especially as to the intricacy, inexpressible by words, of the motions of our own satellite. Here we have a work, not much smaller in appearance than the whole M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste, devoted to this one object. It is not superfluous to add, that this is no chimerical undertaking\u2014no curious puzzle\u2014no learned trifling; the Lunar Theory is the grand basis of the Art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NAVIGATION\">Navigation</a>. The real and main use to mankind of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> planet is a discovery of these latter ages: her cheerful and beneficial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, which all appreciate, and all enjoy, may almost be termed a secondary boon.\n\nThe merit of M. Plana is not so much that of an original geometer, outstripping the theories of Laplace and Lagrange, as of a most intrepid and skilful calculator, who has contrived to place in complete order the whole mathematical and many of the arithmetical steps of the solution of one vast problem, extending to some 2000 quarto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>. The calculations he has made unaided! The details are arranged in so lucid a manner, as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COURT\">court</a> enquiry from those interested in verifying them; and though the readers of so abstruse and indeed repulsive a work must be few indeed, it has already proved of essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> in the way which was intended\u2014the improvement of the lunar tables. The approximations by series are in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> carried to the fifth powers of small quantities, and, in some instances, to the seventh powers. Sir John Herschel has expressed in forcible and picturesque language the nature of what is wanting to the completeness of Laplace's investigations and which M. Plana has supplied, as regards the theory of the moon's motions:\n\n\"In the M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste, we admire the elegance displayed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> interlinking and development of formulae, and exult in the power of the analytical methods used; but when we come to the statement of numerical results, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-QUAIL\">quail</a> before the vast task of filling in those distant steps; and while cloud rolls after cloud in majesty and darkness, we feel our dependence on the conclusions attained to partake of superstitious trust, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMICABLE\">amicable</a> confidence, rather than of clear and demonstrative conviction.\"\u00b9\n\nThe courage of M. Plana did not \"quail\" before the serried ranks of symbolic legions. He attacked them first, and finally became their commander. But more than this; on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> authority, \"his analysis is always graceful, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> well considered, and his conceptions of the ultimate results to be expected from them perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, and justified by the results when obtained.\"\n\nI may here mention that M. Plana, in conjunction with M. Carlini of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>, undertook the calculation of the moon's motions from theory alone (that is, Lunar with only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> constants required to be given by observation), in compliance with a programme issued by the French Academy of Sciences alone on the proposition of Laplace; and that a French geometer, M. Damoiseau, on the same occasion, produced an independent investigation with very elaborate and valuable tables founded thereon.\n\nM. Plana is the author of many other more circumscribed researches on important points in physical astronomy, in geodesy, and in mathematical physics.\n\nM. Hansen, a German astronomer and analyst of great merit, has made the most recent considerable improvement in the theory of the moon. We will first, however, allude to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> which is applicable to the whole theory of perturbation.\n\nWe have seen, in the first section of this chapter, that the effects of perturbation may be considered either as applicable directly to the three co-ordinates of the perturbed body, or to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the elements of the orbit considered as instantaneously varying; that the former method has the advantage of being in most cases, and especially in first approximations, most direct; the latter is most applicable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> inequalities, and has a great recommendation in the exact physical conceptions on which it is founded. M. Hansen has proposed a third method, a refinement, in fact, on that of Lagrange, in which, by an assumption purely mathematical and arbitrary, he throws the effect of perturbation entirely on the element of time, so that with the time so altered, and invariable elliptic elements, the conditions of perturbation may be satisfied, and the true place of the body may result from the calculation. Such is the general nature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, which, to be carried out, requires the introduction of subsidiary terms, which serve to correct the latitude and radius vector. The advantages which are understood to follow from this highly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of proceeding are stated to be (1.) that the series expressing the perturbation of the co-ordinates are more convergent than in the other methods, and likewise the coefficients of the terms to be retained are more easily calculated; (2.) M. Hansen considers that his method enables him to ascertain with certainty those terms which, when fully calculated, will affect the result in a sensible manner. The inventor has applied his methods both to the Lunar and to the Planetary theory.\n\nWe have said that physical astronomy is indebted to M. Hansen for a notable improvement in the theory of the Moon,\u2014the discovery, in fact, of two inequalities of long period, the existence of which had been more than suspected from observation, but which were\n\n\u00b9 Astronomical Society's Monthly Notices, vol. v., p. 37. The last expressions may astonish some persons, but experienced analytical calculators agree in the same view. Mr Airy (probably the most competent authority in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a> the same thing in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of his writings, to the effect that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> for conclusions so obtained is rather that of more than of mathematical certainty.\nnot accounted for. In the infancy of the lunar theory, Euler had predicted that it would always be impossible, on account of the perturbing forces of the planets, to predict the Moon's place within 30\u00b0; and it was a quantity of about this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> which remained outstanding after all the resources of analysis seemed exhausted. M. Poisson and Sir J. Lubbock showed that the anomaly could not be due to the solar action, nor yet to the irregularity of the Earth's figure. The planetary attractions, then, alone remained. M. Hansen discovered two independent inequalities due to the motion of Venus. One of these is an indirect (or, as it is sometimes called, reflected) effect depending on the change of form of the Earth's orbit by the attraction of Venus, which, of course, modifies slightly the solar perturbation of the Moon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>. It is, in fact, a secondary consequence of long inequality of Venus and the Earth investigated by Mr Airy [Art.(115)], and has the same period, namely, about 240 years. Its greatest amount is 23\u00b0.2. The other inequality discovered by Hansen is of a still more curious and complicated kind, which goes on increasing for 2000 lunations, when it attains a maximum value of 27\u00b0.4 in longitude (although the perturbation of the radius vector does not exceed 10 feet), after which it diminishes for an equal space of time.\n\nBy these discoveries, the movements of our refractory satellite may be considered to be, after an unprecedented amount of labour, accounted for by theory almost or quite within the limits of the present accuracy of observation. M. Hansen has recently been engaged in perfecting the practical details of the lunar theory, in accordance with the extensive reductions of the Greenwich observations which will be mentioned in the next chapter. He has also given the first complete theory of \"Foucault's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a>,\" also to be mentioned hereafter. Altogether, he stands amongst the most eminent analytical astronomers of the present day.\n\nWe have now to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHRONICLE\">chronicle</a> a discovery which, by general consent, stands first in the achievements of science, not only in the period now under review, but even in the long and eventful series of years which have elapsed since Newton established the doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> gravitation.\n\nThe discovery of which we speak was no less than the proof of the existence of a planet beyond the recognised boundary of our system, merely as an inference from the perturbed motion of the outmost planet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URANUS\">Uranus</a>; a proof, not general or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a>, but particular and specific: \"Look, on such a night, and in such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, and there you will see (by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>) a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STAR\">star</a>, small indeed, but with a distinguishable disk,\u2014that is the planet which has made Uranus move so unsteadily in its orbit;\"\u2014so spoke the mathematician; and the zealous astronomer, to whom the call was especially addressed, pointing his glass to the sky, discovered at once, that is, the same evening, a body answering almost precisely in position, as well as in brilliancy, to the oracular announcement.\n\n\u00a7 5.

Astronomy Poisson for France, Airy for England, Plana for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, Hansen for Germany. It would be easy, of course, to add the names of many others engaged in similar works, and scarcely less deserving of notice. Some of these will find a place in other chapters, and we have yet one section of this chapter to devote to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of a discovery of rare interest, in which France and England have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> share. We may in Europe, be allowed to mention the names of M. Damoiseau and M. Pontecoulant in France; the former known by his excellent lunar tables deduced from theory, the latter for his calculations of cometary perturbation, and his compendious treatise on physical astronomy, based on the M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste; in Italy, MM. Carlini and Santini. But in Germany these studies have been perhaps most systematically pursued. MM. Gauss and Eneke have only not been included in this section because we find it more suitable to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> to associate the name of the former with his theory of Terrestrial Magnetism, and the latter with the recent history of Comets. Bessel likewise was a physical as well as first-rate practical astronomer. I will here only add that these and in severe and arduous studies have at length been America, effectually cultivated beyond the limits of Europe.\n\nMr Bowditch (born 1773, died 1838), a private Bowditch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of the United States, undertook the gigantic labour of translating and illustrating, with a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> in which every difficulty is considered, and every step of analysis supplied, the M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste of Laplace. Since his death, a younger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of American mathematicians has taken up the great problems of physical astronomy, amongst whom may be mentioned Mr Walker and Mr Peirce. The latter gentleman has recently (1853) published lunar tables, embracing the latest researches of theory.\n\nM. Hansen has also discovered the course of a small inequality of the Moon's latitude, detected from observation by Mr Airy. His theory of the Moon's figure has been referred to in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> to Art.(57.)\nSince the publication of the *Principia*, or rather we should say since the great theory continued in that work had fully attracted the sympathies of thoughtful and able men, nearly the whole science of physical astronomy consisted in the solution of one vast and intricate problem, which has been called the \"Problem of the Three Bodies.\" To this were bent the powers of Clairaut, Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, Plana, Hansen, and so many more. \"Let three bodies be placed and move in a given manner in space and attract one another by the Newtonian law, to determine the motions as affected by their mutual influence.\" The problem solved independently by the two analysts whose names stand at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of this section is this, \"Given two bodies (the Sun and Uranus) and their relative motion, to find at any moment the position of a third body whose attraction shall be required to account for those motions.\" To have solved this new and far more difficult problem (under certain limitations) is a triumph altogether unlike in kind to any of the other brilliant successes of which we have had to speak in the preceding pages.\n\nThe great intricacy of the problem is not perhaps at the first moment fully <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>. The perturbation of the known planet (Uranus) is not the effect, either in direction or in amount, of the attraction of the body sought, either at the instant, or at any previous instant. It is an accumulated effect arising from the totality of the mutual influences of the two planets during a long space of time, and under a variety of circumstances, which circumstances it is the aim of the solution to discover. But, more than this, we do not even know the quantity or direction of the perturbative action at any moment for which the cause is sought, for we do not know the purely elliptic elements of Uranus. His motion has, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, been always troubled by this exterior planet, and Uranus has been so short a time known and observed (only accurately since 1781) that the motion has not yet been cleared of ordinary inequalities (due to the action of the unseen body), which, therefore, are inextricably mixed up with the elliptic elements. It is absolutely necessary, therefore, to suppose not only the elements of the new planet to be unknown, but also the elements of Uranus to be severally affected by unknown errors. This nearly doubles the unknown quantities to be found.\n\nWe shall now glance at the history of these unexplained perturbations, and at the rise and growth of the idea of their being explicable by the influence of an unseen body.\n\nAfter Sir William Herschel had discovered, in 1781, the planet which he called Georgium Sidus, Irregularis (afterwards named Herschel, and finally, by general consent, Uranus,) it was easy, by a few observations, to ascertain its approximate orbit and distance from the sun. But the extreme slowness of its motion (it will not have completed a single revolution before 1861) made it impossible to determine its elements with precision, until it had been discovered that the records of astronomy contained about twenty observations of this body before its planetary nature was discovered; being, in fact, registered places of fixed stars where no stars exist, concurring in brightness and position with the circumstances of Uranus at those remoter periods; the earliest of these observations was one of Flamsteed, in 1690. The first person who constructed tables of the planet was Delambre; but even at that early period, it was remarked, that the modern were not satisfactorily reconcilable with the ancient observations; and, finally, Delambre included of the latter only one, by Mayer, which he did, he tells us, \"out of pure respect,\" although it certainly rendered the tables less exact and less durable. The longer the planet was observed, and the greater the care that was expended in analysing and combining the observations, the more clearly it appeared that the tables had only an empirical character, satisfying observations for a few years before and after the time for which they had been constructed; and that, in particular, as the nineteenth century advanced, the deviations from elliptic regularity became more and more intolerable, till the \"ancient\" observations were at length totally given up. This was the state of matters in 1821, after M. Bouvard of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">Observatory</a> of Paris, a most able calculator, had exhausted every resource in improving the Tables of Uranus. A few years more gave that patient astronomer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> of seeing his tables as obsolete as those of his predecessors, and numerous surmises were circulated as to possible explanations of the anomaly: a failure in the law of gravity, cometary perturbation, a resisting medium, and finally, the presence of an unseen planet, were amongst these guesses. The last and most plausible of these hypotheses occurred to many; amongst others, to Mr Hussey in England, M. Bouvard in France, and later to M. Bessel in Germany. The first of these astronomers actually consulted Mr Airy, in 1834, on the possibility of predicting the place of the perturbing planet from theory, and then discovering it by observation. Mrs Somerville, in 1836, gave a precise expression to the same idea. From this time the subject could not be lost sight of. The errors of the tables which in 1821 were insensible, increased in 1830 to 15\u00b0 or 20\u00b0, and in 1845\n\n---\n\n1 Clairaut, nearly a century before, in calculating the return of Halley's comet, hinted at the possible perturbation due to a planet superior to Saturn.\n2 In her *Connection of the Physical Sciences*.\namounted to two minutes of longitude. M. Bouvard to his latest years, perhaps his latest hours, cherished the hope of extricating this theory from its difficulties. He also engaged his nephew M. Eug\u00e8ne Bouvard in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>, who appears to have followed it with much zeal and intelligence, and in 1845 constructed new tables of Uranus. But by this time two geometers had separately and independently undertaken the problem, with the determination of finding, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> possible, a physical solution of all this perplexity. The earliest in point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> was Mr Adams, a young graduate of Cambridge; the other was M. Leverrier of Paris, whose attention was directed to the subject by M. Arago. As the researches of M. Leverrier, though second in point of time, occasioned the actual recognition of the planet, and thus stamped the correctness of the solution with success, we shall consider them in the first instance.\n\nM. Leverrier is, we believe, a native of St Lo in Normandy, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> which has been singularly productive of eminent men (Laplace and Fresnel were of the number). With no advantages, but the reverse, he won a high position at entering the polytechnic school, which he constantly maintained. He at first, we believe, attached himself to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for physical astronomy was soon developed, and was advanced entirely by his private efforts. It is a peculiarity of the mode of cultivating the sciences in Paris, that such abstruse and difficult studies are not merely engaged in temporarily for purposes of academical distinction, but that they actually become a \"carri\u00e8re\" or calling, and are pursued in that methodical manner for which the French are distinguished. In 1845, when he commenced the careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the theory of Uranus, M. Leverrier was already favourably known by his researches on comets, and on the orbit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>, but especially by immense calculations, connected with the secular inequalities of the planets, by which his ability and hardihood in computation had been thoroughly exercised. He began his new enquiry with the method and intrepidity of calculation which distinguish him. He revised with the most minute care the observations of Uranus, and computed afresh every sensible perturbation which theory recognised as arising from known planets. This done, and having compared the most probable orbit with observations which he collected from authentic sources, and especially from the Greenwich observations which were communicated to him for this purpose, the result was, that even confining himself to observations since 1781, arranged in eleven convenient groups (each resulting from many observed places), and attributing to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> the largest error which could be in reason allowed, and even admitting that all these errors were in the direction most favourable to the assumption, it was still impossible to account for more than one-fourth part of the observed discordances.\n\nM. Leverrier then assumed that a perturbing planet existed beyond the orbit of Uranus, and at nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> its distance from the sun, in conformity with the empirical law, (usually attributed to Bode the German astronomer,) which expresses with general accuracy, thus far, the arrangement of the planetary system. The law is, that the distances of the planetary orbits from Mercury are successively doubled. This assumption\u2014it was absolutely necessary to assume some distance to begin with)\u2014was ingeniously confirmed by other considerations.\n\nLeaving the perturbations in latitude out of account, he now considered each error of Uranus in longitude as the expression of a perturbation due to the action of the unknown planet, and capable therefore of algebraic expression in terms of the elements of that planet, namely its eccentricity, longitude of perihelion, epoch in its orbit, and mass; but, as we have already remarked, the first three of these elements must be considered as incorrectly assumed for Uranus itself, as well as the mean distance of that planet, and, therefore, there are four unknown corrections for its elliptic elements, making in all eight quantities to be eliminated from the discordances of theory and observation. So complex an elimination cannot be directly effected; and even if it could, the result could not be depended on, as the possible error of each observation involves a fresh and important source of doubt in the conclusion. M. Leverrier proceeded, by a series of gradually restricted assumptions, to find within what limits the more important elements might be made to vary without producing effects <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with observation, and his attention was at first confined to the approximate mean longitude of the planet. He obtained a result after their a prodigious amount of tentative calculation. The result, eccentricity and position of the perihelion were then inferred. On the 1st <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1846 he announced to the Academy of Sciences that the true longitude of the expected planet for 1st <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1847 was 325\u00b0, with a probable error of 10\u00b0. This result was immediately published in the Comptes Rendus.\n\nBetween the 1st June and 31st August 1846, when his third memoir on the perturbations of M. Leverrier's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> announcement; Uranus appeared, M. Leverrier busied himself in obtaining a farther approximation to the elements and place of the suspected planet. He now assumed the correction of the mean distance amongst the other quantities to be sought. By a fresh calculation he\n\n---\n\n1 M. Bouvard was born in 1767. He performed almost all of the numerical calculations required by Laplace in his great work, and was associated with that eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> by the most friendly ties. He \"ceased to calculate and to live\" 7th June 1843.\ndeduced a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of elements as regards longitude; and diminished the mean distance considerably. The true longitude by this calculation differed only $1\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0 from his previous estimation. He finds for the mean distance from the Sun 36 times that of our Earth (that of Uranus being 19), the period 217 years, and the mass $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the Sun's. Assuming the density of the planet to be the same as that of Uranus, he conjectures that the apparent diameter will be $3\\frac{1}{3}$\u00b0; that it will therefore have a visible disk sufficient to distinguish it from a fixed star, and that its brilliancy should equal that of a star of the 8th or 9th magnitude. As the result of these suppositions, he found that the whole errors in the places of Uranus from 1781 to 1844 were reconciled within quantities amounting but in one instance to 5\u00b0; that the ancient observations of the 18th century were reconciled within 7\u00b0 or 8\u00b0; and the oldest observation of all, that of Flamsteed in 1690, had an outstanding error of 20\u00b0, a quantity very far from excessive, considering the state of astronomy at that period.\n\nNo one who read at the time the abstract of this remarkable paper in the Comptes Rendus failed to be struck with it, not only as regarded the weighty matter, thus publicly announced, but also on account of the calm and well-grounded conviction which the author manifested in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of his bold conclusions, and the definite manner in which he gives the challenge to practical astronomers to verify or disprove them. \"Since Copernicus declared\" (according to the prevalent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>) \"that when means should be discovered for improving the vision, it would be found that Venus had phases like the moon, nothing,\" writes Mr Airy, \"so bold, and so justifiably bold, has been uttered in astronomical prediction.\" M. Leverrier had hastened his calculations in anticipation of the approaching opposition of the new planet in the autumn of 1846, but it is very doubtful whether astronomers would have made the discovery at that time, but for his personal application to M. Galle, then assistant-astrophotographer at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>, where a powerful refractor suitable for the search existed. So ardent a conviction in a manner compelled the proof which the geometer claimed, and M. Galle, whose intelligence and zeal are well known, pointed his telescope to the sky the very evening that M. Leverrier's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> reached him. Fortunately provided with a newly published star map by Bremicker of that region of the heavens, which was not at that time diffused generally amongst European observatories, he detected that same night (the 23rd September 1846) a star-like body of the 8th magnitude, not noted in the star chart, therefore a wandering body, having a manifest disk from $2\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0 to $3\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0 in diameter, and distant only fifty-four minutes of a degree from the predicted place.\n\nIt will be remarked that the discovery in question was anticipated and completed in France and Germany alone; England had no direct participation. We must now, however, state briefly what occurred there of a similar character at the same time, and even earlier.\n\nMr John Couch Adams, when a student at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1841, formed the design of detecting the position of a perturbing planet which should account for the anomalous motions of Uranus. He made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> on the problem in 1843, assuming the distance of the suspected body from the Sun to be double that of Uranus. I learn from good authority that he obtained a place for the unseen planet not very different from that which he finally adopted. Early in 1844 he obtained from Greenwich the valuable series of places of Uranus which were afterwards in like manner applied for by M. Leverrier. In September 1845, he communicated to Professor Challis the elements of the new planet's orbit (neglecting the inclination) and an ephemeris of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GEOCENTRIC\">geocentric</a> place; and in October he transmitted the elements also to the Astronomer Royal. Mr Adams This, it will be observed, was soon after M. Leverrier's preceded attention was first directed to the subject, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> months previous to his announcement of the locality where the new body should be sought. Mr Adams afterwards repeated his calculation with a mean distance $\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0 less than before, and considered himself warranted, by the improvement thus produced on the residual errors, in inferring that a farther considerable diminution of the mean distance would satisfy the observations still better. This was communicated to Mr Airy on the 2d September 1846; subsequently therefore to the publication of M. Leverrier's Elements. Mr Adams, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> his results (at a later time) to the Astronomical Society, with characteristic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> says, \"I mention these dates merely to show that my results were arrived at independently, and previously to the publication of M. Leverrier, and not with the intention of interfering with his just claims to the honors of the discovery, for there is no doubt that his researches were first published to the world and led to the actual discovery of the planet by Dr Galle.\"\n\nAnd such is no doubt the fact. The priority of Mr Adams in the mathematical investigation is as certain as that the researches of M. Leverrier alone produced the discovery of Neptune. Even the search for the planet which took place in August and September 1846 at Cambridge by Professor Challis, was not occasioned by Mr Adams' researches only; it was the near coincidence of the longitude assigned by Mr Adams in the previous October with that published by M. Leverrier in June 1846 which induced Mr Airy to suggest this investigation of the heavens, and to offer (if need were) himself to bear the expense. Had the planet been discovered at Cambridge\n\n---\n\n1. The planet was indeed seen at Cambridge by Mr Challis, for it was recorded more than once amongst the numerous fixed stars whose places were taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in the progress of the search; but as the comparisons of the \"sweeps\" were not made at the time, the discovery was anticipated by M. Galle.\nbefore it was at Berlin, M. Leverrier must still have had a share in the credit of success.\n\nIt is perhaps to be regretted that Mr Adams had not given his whole investigation to the world, or at least published his results, so as to avouch the confidence which he felt in his own prediction, and to throw upon practical astronomers generally the responsibility of its verification. Had he done so in 1845, it is possible that the planet might have been discovered at the opposition of that year; but it is at least certain that M. Leverrier's claims to priority as regards the discovery of Neptune would have been effectually anticipated. But it is only just to our countryman to recollect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of his age and position. M. Leverrier was at the time about 35 years of age, and was a candidate for the substantial benefits as well as for the honour of a membership of the Academy of Sciences. Mr Adams must have been nine or ten years younger at the period of this discovery, a circumstance which enhances our admiration at the achievement, whilst it gives an additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> to the modest conduct of the author.\n\nI have endeavoured to state correctly (with due regard to the limits of this essay) the main facts of the most curious case of double discovery which, perhaps, the history of science presents; and happily as to the facts, down to the minutest detail, no discrepancy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> ever existed. Different minds will, with perfect truth, attach more or less distinction to the two illustrious rivals,\u2014neither of whom has for an instant lowered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of his position by one ungenerous expression,\u2014but that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> merit of both is of the very highest character is on all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> admitted. \"The names of M. Leverrier and Mr Adams,\" said Sir John Herschel, addressing the Astronomical Society, \"which Genius and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTINY\">Destiny</a> have joined, I shall by no means put asunder; nor will they ever be pronounced apart so long as language shall celebrate the triumphs of Science in her sublimest walks.\"\n\nBut before closing, I must briefly state how far the orbit of the planet Neptune, when discovered, realized the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> of theory. A fortunate circumstance rendered it easy to obtain at an early fixed star period a correct knowledge of the elements. It seems that the planet Neptune was observed by Lalande at Paris on the 6th and 10th May 1795, and entered as a fixed star, notwithstanding a distinct change of place between the observations, actually corresponding to what the planet should have had. But such an oversight had been made by Lemonnier in the case of Uranus. By means of this observation of fifty years back, the orbit was easily computed. It is a singular and startling fact, that, except as regards the longitude on the orbit, the other elements computed from observation were somewhat widely different from those assigned by M. Leverrier and Mr Adams. We shall present them in a tabular view. The value of the mass in the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> is calculated from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELONGATION\">elongation</a> and period of a satellite of Neptune discovered by Mr Lassell.\n\n| Epoch of Elements | Theory\u2014Leverrier | Observation\u2014Walker |\n|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Mean Longitude    | 318\u00b0 47'         | 328\u00b0 35'          |\n| Mean Distance     | 36-15            | 30-04             |\n| Period            | 217-4 years      | 164-6             |\n| Long.

The conjunction (when the mutual distance is least and the attraction strongest) took place in 1822. Now the places of Uranus from 1690 (the first observation) until 1800 can be sufficiently well represented by elliptic elements. The perturbation of Neptune became sensible therefore only twenty years before conjunction. In this time Neptune describes (really) only \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of a circumference, or 45\u00b0, and relatively to the motion of Uranus about the same. It is evident then that even a considerable error in the period of Neptune would scarcely sensibly affect the law of perturbation during twenty years, and that the approximate determination of the place of the perturbing planet about the time of conjunction will not be much affected by the error of that assumption. Again, as to the error of mean distance, we may observe, that since the mutual action of the planets is confined within such (comparatively) narrow limits of space and time, though we might anticipate a tolerable approximation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between the bodies\n\n---\n\n1 One of the observations was suppressed in the publication, and only discovered on searching Lalande's MS.\n2 This was the hypothesis upon which Mr Adams made his second or corrected calculation of elements. Nevertheless, he inferred from that calculation that the mean distance might with much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> be reduced to 33\u00b0 4'.\n3 Pierce. Struve's mass is \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\).\nat that time, it would be unreasonable to expect a correct determination of the form and ellipticity of the orbit of Neptune, such as might be looked for if the perturbations were sensible through the entire orbits; and in fact, by varying the position of the perihelion and the amount of eccentricity, we may, for an assumed mean distance, obtain any value whatever for the interval of the two planets at a particular time. We have seen the origin of the false assumption of mean distance on the part both of M. Leverrier and Mr Adams, and we find that the mathematical solution corrects to a great extent the error of that assumption by giving a correspondingly incorrect position of the perihelion, and also an exaggerated measure of the eccentricity, by which two circumstances the planets of both mathematicians would have had, near the time of conjunction, a distance from the sun of only 32 or 33 radii of the earth's orbit, the true distance being about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) part less. This still remaining error was palliated, and evidently might for a time have been completely masked, by assuming a mass of Neptune proportionally too great, as indeed the table we have given shows was the case.\n\nThat the discovery of Neptune took place at the time when it did was no accident. The conjunction of Uranus and Neptune, when alone the perturbation of the elliptic elements is perceptible, is a rare phenomenon, occurring but once in about 172 years. The last conjunction previous to 1822 was in 1649: we have seen that the attention of astronomers was importunately called to the subject by the irregularities in the motions of Uranus at the first conjunction succeeding its discovery.\n\nWe are indebted to Professor Peirce and Mr Walker of the United States for many useful investigations connected with the orbits of Uranus and Neptune; but it is to be wished that the theory were completely re-examined, and also the problem of the inverse method of perturbations which has now become a systematic portion of physical astronomy. The near commensurability of the two periods presents a peculiar case of perturbation similar to the long inequality of Jupiter and Saturn; but as its period is no less than 4047 years, although the coefficient of the inequality is considerable, it will not perceptibly alter the motions of either planet except in a long course of years.\n\nIt will not be supposed that either M. Leverrier or Mr Adams could, after such a memorable triumph, abandon the pursuits of physical astronomy. The first has continued his researches on the orbits of comets and on the perturbations of the solar system; and having been recently appointed to succeed M. Arago in the direction of the Paris Observatory, we cannot doubt that he will infuse new life into its management. Mr Adams has made the discovery of some important oversights in the details of the lunar theory. One of these, with reference to Laplace's Theory of the Secular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">Acceleration</a> of the Moon's mean Motion, has been referred to in a note to Art. (62). Though Mr Adams occupies no public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>, and though he has declined the honours of a title, his continued residence at Cambridge must influence very beneficially the studies of the place, where some of his many friends have founded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of his achievements a perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> for the advancement of physical astronomy, which is denominated the Adams Prize.","sp":832,"ep":842},{"h":"ADAM SMITH","t":"The great name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Smith rests upon the Enquiry into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> and Causes of the Wealth of Nations; perhaps the only book which produced an immediate, general, and irrevocable change in some of the most important parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a> of all civilized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a>. The works of Grotius, of Locke, and of Montesquieu, which bear a resemblance to it in character, and had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> inconsiderable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of their popular influence, were productive only of a general amendment, not so conspicuous in particular instances, as discoverable, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, in the improved condition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> affairs. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of Smith, as it touched those matters which may be numbered, and measured, and weighed, bore more visible and palpable fruit. In a few years it began to alter laws and treaties, and has made its way, throughout the convulsions of revolution and conquest, to a due ascendant over the minds of men, with far less than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> obstructions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> and clamour, which choked the channels through which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> flows into practice.

Perhaps there is no ethical work since Cicero's Offices, of which an abridgement enables the reader so inadequately to estimate the merit, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a> of Moral Sentiments. This is not chiefly owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of diction, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of Cicero; but to the variety of explanations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and manners which embellish the book often more than they illuminate the theory. Yet, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, it must be owned that, for purely philosophical purposes, few books more need abridgement: for the most careful reader frequently loses sight of principles buried under illustrations. The naturally copious and flowing style of the author is generally redundant, and the repetition of certain formularies of the system is, in the later editions, so frequent as to be wearisome, and sometimes ludicrous. Perhaps Smith and Hobbes may be considered as forming the two extremes of good style in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>; the first of graceful fulness falling into flaccidity; while the masterly concision of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> is oftener tainted by dictatorial dryness. Hume and Berkeley, though they are nearer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> of abundance, are probably the least distant from perfection.\n\nThat mankind are so constituted as to sympathize with each other's feelings, and to feel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in the accordance of these feelings, are the only facts required by Dr Smith, and they certainly must be granted to him. To adopt the feelings of another, is to approve them. When the sentiments of another are such as would be excited in us by the same objects, we approve them as morally proper. To obtain this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a>, it becomes necessary for him who enjoys <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> suffers, to lower his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of feeling to the point to which the by-stander can raise his fellow-feelings; on which are founded all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> virtues of self-denial and self-command; and it is equally necessary for the by-stander to raise his sympathy as near as he can to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> feeling. In all unsocial passions, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>, we have a divided sympathy between him who feels them and those who are the\n\n1 Born in 1723; died in 1790.\n2 Notes and Illustrations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> 8.\n3 This remark is chiefly applicable to Hume's Essays. His Treatise of Human Nature is more Hobbian in its general tenor, though it has Ciceronian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>.\nobjects of them. Hence the propriety of extremely moderating them. Pure malice is always to be concealed or disguised, because all sympathy is arrayed against it. In the private passions, where there is only a simple sympathy\u2014that with the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>\u2014the expression has more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. The benevolent affections, where there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> sympathy\u2014with those who feel them, and those who are their objects\u2014are the most agreeable, and may be indulged with the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of finding no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ECHO\">echo</a> in other breasts. Sympathy with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> of those who are benefited by good actions, prompts us to consider them as deserving of reward, and forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of merit; as fellow-feeling with the resentment of those who are injured by crimes leads us to look on them as worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, and constitutes the sense of demerit. These sentiments require not only beneficial actions, but benevolent motives for them; being compounded, in the case of merit, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> sympathy with the good disposition of the benefactor, and an indirect sympathy with the persons benefited; in the opposite case, with precisely opposite sympathies. He who does an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of wrong to another to gratify his own passions, must not expect that the spectators, who have none of his undue partiality to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, will enter into his feelings. In such a case, he knows that they will pity the person wronged, and be full of indignation against him. When he is cooled, he adopts the sentiments of others on his own crime, feels shame at the impropriety of his former passion, pity for those who have suffered by him, and a dread of punishment from general and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> resentment. Such are the constituent parts of remorse.\n\nOur moral sentiments respecting ourselves arise from those which others feel concerning us. We feel a self-approbation whenever we believe that the general feeling of mankind coincides with that state of mind in which we ourselves were at a given time. \"We suppose ourselves the spectators of our own behaviour, and endeavour to imagine what effect it would in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> produce in us.\" We must view our own conduct with the eyes of others before we can judge it. The sense of duty arises from putting ourselves in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of others, and adopting their sentiments respecting our own conduct. In utter solitude there could have been no self-approbation. The rules of morality are a summary of those sentiments; and often beneficially stand in their stead when the self-delusions of passion would otherwise hide from us the non-conformity of our state of mind with that which, in the circumstances, can be entered into and approved by impartial bystanders. It is hence that we learn to raise our mind above local or temporary clamour, and to fix our eyes on the surest indications of the general and lasting sentiments of human nature.\n\n\"When we approve of any character or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, our sentiments are derived from four sources: first, we sympathize with the motives of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>; secondly, we enter into the gratitude of those who have been benefited by his actions; thirdly, we observe that his conduct has been agreeable to the general rules by which those two sympathies generally act; and, last of all, when we consider such actions as forming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a system of behaviour which tends to promote the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> either of the individual or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, they appear to derive a beauty from this utility, not unlike that which we ascribe to any well-contrived machine.\"","sp":382,"ep":383},{"h":"ARCHBISHOP OF DUBLIN","t":"Dissertation Third.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nA sketch, like the present, of the rise, progress, and corruptions of Christianity, would be altogether defective without some notice of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> systems which it was designed to supplant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> to complete.\n\nNot only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> be thrown upon its genuine character and excellence by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> with their errors or deficiencies, but moreover, a knowledge of these will often disclose to us the sources of some of those corruptions which have disfigured the simplicity of the Gospel.\n\nThe earliest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of mankind, by far, that we possess, is that contained in the Book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENESIS\">Genesis</a>. It is extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> and scanty; especially the earliest portion of it. But it plainly represents the first of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, when in the Garden of Eden, as receiving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> communications from God. We have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> detailed account, however, of the instruction they received; and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of what the history does record is but obscurely intimated. For example, it is rather hinted than expressly stated, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> was imparted to them by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>. This, however, is generally understood to be the meaning of the passage (Gen. ii. 20), in which it is said that God brought unto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> the beasts and birds, to see what he would call them, and that Adam gave them names.\n\nBut our first parents, or their children, must have received direct from God a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of instruction of which no particulars are related. For besides being taught something of religious and moral duty (Gen. ii. 16; iv. 7), it is evident that they must have learned something of the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. The first generations of mankind were certainly not left at all in the condition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> savages, subsisting on such wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> and animals as they might chance to meet with. We read concerning the first two sons of Adam, that the one was occupied in tilling the ground, and the other in keeping cattle.\n\nAnd even independently of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a> history, we might draw the same conclusion from what is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of actual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, and as it were before our eyes at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. For it appears that mere savages, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> left to themselves without any instruction, never did, and never can, civilise themselves. And, consequently, the first of the human race that did acquire any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of civilisation, since\nthey could not have had instruction from other men, must have had a superhuman instructor. But for such an instructor, all mankind would have been savages at this day. The mere fact that civilised men do exist, is enough to prove, even to a person who had never heard of the Bible, that, at some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a> or other, men must have been taught something by a superior Being; in other words, that there must have been a revelation.\n\nIt has been indeed not unfrequently maintained that savages can, and sometimes do, invent for themselves, one by one, all the useful arts, and thus raise themselves to a civilised state, without any assistance from men already civilised. One may meet with fine descriptions\u2014though altogether fanciful\u2014of this supposed progress of men towards civilisation. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, it has been conceived, wishing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> himself the trouble of roaming through the woods in search of wild fruits and roots, would bethink himself of collecting the seeds of these, and cultivating them in a spot of ground cleared and broken up for the purpose. And finding that he could thus raise more than enough for himself, he might agree with some of his neighbours to let them have a part of the produce in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> for some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAME\">game</a> and fish they might have taken. Another again, it has been imagined, would endeavour to save himself the labour and uncertainty of hunting, by catching some kind of wild animals alive, and keeping them in an inclosure to breed, that he might have a supply always at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>.\n\nAnd again, another, it is supposed, might devote himself to the occupation of dressing skins for clothing, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> huts or canoes, or making various kinds of tools; and might subsist by exchanging these with his neighbours for food. And by thus devoting his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to some one kind of manufacture, he would acquire increased skill in that, and would strike out useful new inventions.\n\nThus these supposed savages having gradually come to be divided into husbandmen, shepherds, and artisans of various kinds, would begin to enjoy the various advantages of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of labour, and would advance, step by step, in all the arts of civilised life.\n\nNow, all this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> is likely to appear plausible, at the first glance, to those who do not inquire carefully, and reflect attentively. But, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, it will be found to be contradicted by all history, and to be quite inconsistent with the real character of such beings as savages actually are. In reality, such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of inventions and improvements as that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> described, is what never did, and never possibly can, take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> left wholly to themselves.\n\nAll the nations of which we know anything, that have risen from a savage to a civilised state, appear to have had the advantage of the instruction and example of civilised men living among them. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> that has ever had any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> of a time when their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> were savages, and of the first introduction of civilisation among them, always represent some foreigner or some Being from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> as having first taught them the arts of life.\n\nThus the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Greeks, we know, attributed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROMETHEUS\">Prometheus</a> the introduction of the use of fire. And <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> and other arts were popularly supposed to have been first introduced into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> by Triptolemus and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CADMUS\">Cadmus</a>, and others, strangers from a distant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.\n\nAnd the Peruvians have a like tradition concerning a person they call Manco Capac, whom they represent as the offspring of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, and as having taught useful arts to their ancestors.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of savage tribes, in various parts of the world, who have had no regular intercourse with civilised men, but who have been visited by several voyagers, at different times, and in some instances at very distant periods. And it appears from comparing together the accounts of those voyagers, that these tribes remain perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>; not making the smallest advance towards civilisation.\n\nFor example, the people of the vast continent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEW_HOLLAND\">New <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPUA\">Papua</a> (or New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>), who are among the rudest of savages, appear to remain (in those parts not settled by Europeans), in exactly the same brutish condition as when they were first discovered. They roam about the forests in search of wild animals, and of some few eatable roots, which they laboriously dig up with sharpened sticks. But though they are often half-starved, and though they have to expend as much toil for three or four\nscanty meals as would suffice for breaking up and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> a piece of ground that would supply them for a year, it has never occurred to them to attempt cultivating these roots.\n\nThe inhabitants, again, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of Andaman, in the eastern ocean, appear to be in a more degraded and wretched state than even the New Hollanders.\n\nAnd to add but one instance more, the New Zealanders, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of above one hundred and twenty-five years between the first discovery of their islands by Tasman, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> discovery by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cook, seem to have made no advances whatever, but to have remained just in the same condition. And yet they were in a far less savage state than that of the New Hollanders, being accustomed rudely to cultivate the ground, and raise crops of sweet potatoes.\n\nAnd such appears to be, from all accounts, the condition of all savage, or nearly savage, tribes. They seem never to invent anything, or to make any effort to improve; so that what few arts they do possess (and which, in general, are only such as to enable them just to support life), must be the remnant that they have retained from a more civilised state, from which their ancestors had degenerated.\n\nWhen, indeed, men have arrived at a certain stage in the advance towards civilisation (far short of what exists in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>), it is then possible for them, if nothing occurs to keep them back, to advance further and further towards a more civilised state.\n\nAnd this it is that misleads some persons in their notions respecting savages. For finding that there is no one art which might not have been invented by unassisted man, supposing him to have a certain degree of civilisation to start from, they hence conclude that unassisted man might have invented all the arts, supposing him left originally in a completely savage state. But this is contradicted by all experience; which shews that men, in the condition of the lowest savages, never have made the first step towards civilisation, without some assistance from without.\n\nHuman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> may be compared to some combustible substances which will not take fire spontaneously, but when once set on fire will burn with continually increasing force. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> of men requires, as it were, to be kindled, and requires no more.\n\nWhat, perhaps, contributes most to the erroneous views referred to above, is, that when one tries to fancy himself in the situation of a savage, it occurs to him that he would set his mind to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> to contrive means for bettering his condition, and that he might perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> upon such and such useful inventions; and hence he may be led to think it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> that savages should do so, and that some tribes of them may have advanced themselves, in the way above described, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> help. But nothing of the kind appears to have ever really occurred; and what leads some persons to fancy it, is, that they themselves are not savages, but have some degree of mental cultivation, and some of the habits of thought of civilised men; and, therefore, they form to themselves an incorrect notion of what a savage really is\u2014just as a person who possesses eyesight cannot understand correctly the condition of one born <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a>.\n\nBut those who have seen a good deal of real savages, have observed that they are not only feeble in mental powers, but also sluggish in the use of such powers as they have, except when urged by pressing want. When not thus urged, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> their time either in perfect inactivity, or else in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>, or decorating their bodies with paint, or with feathers and shells, or in various childish sports. They are not only brutishly stupid, but still more remarkable for childish thoughtlessness and improvidence. So that it never occurs to them to consider how they may put themselves in a better condition a year or two hence.\n\nNow, such must have been the condition of all mankind <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to this day, if they had all been, from the first, left without any instruction, and in what is called a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>\u2014that is, with the faculties man is born with, not at all unfolded or exercised by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>. For from such a state, unassisted Man cannot, as all experience shews, ever raise himself. And consequently, in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the whole world would have been peopled with mere savages in the very lowest state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a>. The very existence, therefore, at this day, of civilised men, proves that there must have been, at some time or other,\nsome instruction given to Man in the arts of life, by some Being superior to Man. For, since the first beginnings of civilisation could not have come from any human instructor, they must have come from one superhuman.\n\nIt has been shewn, then, that the whole world would now have been peopled with the very lowest savages, if men had never received any instruction, and yet had been able to subsist at all. But it is doubtful whether even this bare subsistence would have been possible. It is more likely that the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> would all have perished for want of those few arts which even savages possess, and which (as has been above remarked) were probably not invented by savages, but are remnants which they have retained from a more civilised state. The knowledge, for instance, of wholesome and of poisonous roots and fruits, the arts of making fish-hooks and nets, bows and arrows, or darts, and snares for wild animals, and of constructing rude huts and canoes, and some other such simple arts, are possessed, more or less, by all savages, and are necessary to enable them to support their lives. And it is doubtful whether men left completely in a state of nature\u2014that is wholly untaught\u2014would not all perish before they could invent them for themselves.\n\nFor we should remember that Man, when left in a state of nature, untaught, and with his rational powers not unfolded, is far less fitted for supporting and taking care of himself than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>. They are much better provided both with instincts, and with bodily organs for supplying their own wants. For example, those animals that have occasion to dig, either for food or to make burrows for shelter\u2014such as the swine, the hedgehog, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a>, and the rabbit, have both an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a>, and snouts or paws far better adapted for that purpose than man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. Yet man is enabled to turn up the ground much better than any brute; but then this is by means of tools which man can be taught to make and use, though brutes cannot. Again, birds and bees have an instinct for building such nests and habitations as answer their purpose as well as the most commodious beds and houses made by men; but Man has no instinct that teaches him how to construct these. Brutes, again, know by instinct their proper food, and avoid what is unwholesome; but man has no instinct for distinguishing the nightshade-berry (with which children have been so often poisoned), from wholesome fruits. And <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> swim by nature, because their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> is the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> by which they advance when on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>; but a man, falling into deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, is drowned, unless he has learnt to swim.\n\nIt appears, then, very doubtful whether men left wholly untaught, would be able to subsist at all, even in the state of the lowest savages. But, at any rate, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> they could never have risen above that state. And, consequently, the existence of civilisation at this day is a kind of monument attesting the fact that some instruction from above must, at some time or other, have been supplied to mankind. And the most probable conclusion is, that Man, when first created, or very shortly afterwards, was advanced by the Creator Himself, to a state above that of a mere savage.\n\nNow this is exactly what is related in Scripture. But it must be remembered that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> which has been just given of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> revelation to Man, is quite independent of the Bible history; and, therefore, tends to confirm that history. That Man could not have made himself, is appealed to, as a proof of a divine Creator. And that mankind could not, in the first instance, have civilised themselves, is a proof exactly of the same kind, and equally strong, of a superhuman Instructor.\n\nAnd here the inquiry may perhaps be raised, how it ever came about that various tribes of men, from time to time, degenerated into the savage state. We have no distinct records of the progress of this degeneracy; nor, from the nature of the case, is it possible that we should. But, no doubt, wars have always been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> cause of it. When men were continually harassed by a superior force of ferocious enemies, who hunted them down like wild beasts, and burnt their dwellings, and laid waste the country, they would be driven to shelter themselves in forests, and deserts, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>; and would have no opportunity of practising, or of teaching to their children, most of the arts they might be acquainted with. Agriculture, for instance, would neces-\nsarily be abandoned. And being entirely occupied in a struggle for bare subsistence, and in providing for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> against their enemies, or for escape, they would have neither leisure, nor means, nor inclination, for keeping up the various arts of civilised life. These, therefore, would, in two or three generations, be forgotten and irrecoverably lost among them; and the whole character of the people would have degenerated.\n\nWe have said, that from the very nature of the case, it is impossible we should have any distinct accounts of the progress of this degradation, since men so situated would not compose histories. But it is remarkable that in several savage tribes, there are some faint traditions of their ancestors having formerly come from some distant and better country; doubtless driven out by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAR\">war</a>.\n\nIt is likely that the instruction in the arts of life that was originally bestowed on the human race was merely sufficient to give them a beginning; to advance them just so far towards civilisation as to enable them, thenceforward, to advance themselves, and to invent, one by one, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of their own faculties, various arts, according to their wants and opportunities.\n\nThe Bible history informs us of hardly any particulars, either of what was originally taught to mankind, or of their own inventions. We have only a very brief and slight hint of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the art of working <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, and of musical instruments, and perhaps, also of tents. (Gen. iv. 20.) But, doubtless, many other arts were invented before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOD\">Flood</a>.\n\nSeveral of the most important arts, and of those most generally known throughout the world, must have been very ancient; and as their first introduction is not mentioned in the Bible, there is no record or tradition of it. And we are so familiar with these that we are apt to regard them as more simple and obvious than they are; though, on reflection, it will appear that some of them were most likely invented gradually, and by successive steps taken at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> intervals.\n\nAnd here it is worth observing how important an advantage, in reference to the invention of arts, would have been afforded to men in a very early and rude state of society, by their possessing (as Scripture informs us the earliest of them did) a very long continuance of life. In the present day, an ingenious and observant man writes down, and generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a> and publishes the experiments and observations he has made; and thus those who come after him are enabled to follow up his inquiries and attempts, so that each generation improves upon the last. But before the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, the chief part of each man's experience would be lost to those who came after him. In those early days, therefore, it was of vast importance, with a view to the invention of arts, that each man should be enabled, by great length of life, to apply his own experience, and to follow up himself the discoveries he might have made.\n\nWe have no direct information as to the immediate cause of the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONGEVITY\">longevity</a> of the earliest generations of men. But it seems likely that it may have been produced by the influence of \"the Tree of Life.\"1\n\nThat the produce of this tree (whether its fruits or its leaves) was endued by the Creator with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of warding off <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, we are plainly taught, both by its name and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of Adam from the Garden of Eden, \"lest he should eat of the tree of life, and live forever.\"\n\nIt is likely that it had the medicinal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, when applied from time to time, of preventing or curing the decays of old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; just as our ordinary food preserves men from dying of exhaustion by famine; and as several well-known medicines prevent or cure certain diseases. We know, indeed, that there does not exist now any medicine that has the virtue of keeping up or renewing youthful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> or vigour. But such a medicine would not be in itself at all more strange than many things which we are familiar with, but whose effects we cannot explain, and could never have conjectured.\n\nFor example, that opium and some other drugs\n\n---\n\n1 It appears to be a vestige of an early tradition respecting the use of the Tree of Life, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> represents his gods as supporting perpetual life and vigour by drinking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NECTAR\">nectar</a> and eating Ambrosia, i.e. (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a>.)\nshould produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, and strong liquors a kind of temporary madness, is what no one would ever have thought of, if he had never heard of it, nor seen the experiment tried, of swallowing those substances. Nor, even if he were a skilful chemist, would he be able, by analysing them, to conjecture what their effects would be. If, then, the Tree of Life were such a medicine as we have supposed, a person who always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> the use of it from time to time, would continue exempt from decay and death.\n\nBut supposing some persons who had been in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of using it (as our first parents doubtless had, since there was nothing to prevent them) should afterwards cease to use it, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> would probably have been so far fortified, that though they would at length die, yet they would live much longer than man's natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a>. And they would even be likely to transmit to their descendants such a constitution as would confer on those also a great degree of longevity, which would only wear out gradually in many successive generations.\n\nNow, it is remarkable that this exactly agrees with what we do find recorded. If we look into those parts of the Bible history which relate to this subject, we shall find Man's life in the earliest generations extending to eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> centuries, and upwards. And we shall find longevity gradually diminishing in each generation, down to the times of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a>, who lived rather less than two hundred years; and again down to the time of Moses, who began his mission, apparently in the full vigour of life, at fourscore, and lived to one hundred and twenty. Joshua, who succeeded him, lived one hundred and ten years. And from thenceforward human life appears to have been brought down to about its present limit.\n\nThe above seems to be the most clear, easy, and natural interpretation of those parts of Scripture we have been examining. There is not, however, any such distinct revelation on the subject as to authorise our pronouncing confidently that such must be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> interpretation, and making this an article of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>.\n\nWith respect to religious instruction, although, as has been said, the Maker and Governor of all things did certainly make Himself known to the earliest generations of mankind, and accepted worship from them; we are told very few particulars of the revelations that were made. We find, indeed, a prophecy made to Adam and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVE\">Eve</a>, just before their expulsion from Paradise: that the seed of the woman should bruise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. But whether any explanation was given them, of the reference this had to our Saviour's triumph over Satan and Death, we are not told. And it is even a matter of doubt among the learned, whether the sacrifices (Gen. iv. viii.), that were offered up in the earliest times, and afterwards by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a>, were of express divine appointment, or were merely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of worship which men devised of themselves, and which God thought fit to approve and accept. And there is nothing so distinctly said in Scripture on the subject, as to authorise any one to decide confidently, one way or the other. If it had been necessary that we should have any certainty as to this point, doubtless we should have had some plain declarations upon it.\n\nOf Enoch we find it recorded, that he \"walked with God,\" that is, led a life of eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a>, and was so far favoured, as to be withdrawn from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> without tasting of death. And he is referred to, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, as an example of faith, inasmuch as \"without faith it is impossible to please God.\" But as to the subjects of his faith, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APOSTLE\">Apostle</a> himself seems to have had no distinct and particular knowledge, except that he must have believed in the existence and in the goodness of God,\u2014\"For he that cometh to God must believe that He is; and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.\"\n\nOf course what is meant in this passage by the word \"God,\" is\u2014what we also understand by it\u2014the Creator of the world. We cannot doubt that He must have made Himself known to the earliest of mankind, as the Maker of themselves, and of all things around them. And the account given in Genesis, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, and of some other of the earliest events, is probably a tradition of this most ancient revelation, and was very likely committed to writing, long before the time of Moses.\n\nSome persons have imagined that we are bound\nto take our notions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>, and of all other Physical Sciences, from the Bible. And accordingly, when astronomers discovered and proved that the earth turns round on its axis, and that the sun does not move round the earth, some cried out against this as profane, because Scripture speaks of the sun's rising and setting. And this probably led some astronomers to reject the Bible, because they were taught that if they received that as a divine revelation, they must disbelieve truths which they had demonstrated.\n\nSo also, some have thought themselves bound to believe, if they receive Scripture at all, that the earth, and all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> and animals that ever existed on it, must have been created within six days, of exactly the same length as our present days. And this, even before the sun, by which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> our days, is recorded to have been created. Hence, the discoveries made by geologists, which seem to prove that the earth and various races of animals must have existed a very long time before Man existed, have been represented as completely inconsistent with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in Scripture.\n\nWe may not stop to discuss the various objections (some of them more or less plausible, and others very weak), that have been brought\u2014on grounds of science, or supposed science\u2014against the Mosaic accounts of the creation, of the state of the early world, and of the flood, and to bring forward the several answers that have been given to those objections. But it is important to lay down the PRINCIPLE on which either the Bible or any other writing or speech ought to be studied and understood, viz., with a reference to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> proposed by the writer or speaker.\n\nFor example, if we bid any one proceed in a straight line from one place to another, and to take care to arrive before the sun goes down, he will rightly and fully understand us, in reference to the practical object which alone we had in view. Now, we know that there cannot really be a straight line on the surface of the earth; and that the sun does not really go down, only our portion of the earth is turned away from it. But whether the other party knows all this or not, matters nothing to our present object; which was not to teach him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> or astronomy, but to make him conform to our directions, which are equally intelligible to the learned and the unlearned.\n\nNow, the object of the Scripture revelation is to teach men, not astronomy or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-GEOLOGY\">geology</a>, or any other physical science, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RELIGION\">Religion</a>. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> was to inform men, not in what manner the world was made, but who made it; and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> them to worship Him, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, instead of worshipping his creatures, the heavens and earth themselves, as gods; which is what the ancient heathen actually did.\n\nAlthough, therefore, Scripture gives very scanty and imperfect information respecting the earth and the heavenly bodies, and speaks of them in the language and according to the notions of the people of a rude age, still it fully effects the object for which it was given, when it teaches that the heavens and the earth are not gods to be worshipped, but that \"God created the heavens and the earth,\" and that it is He who made the various tribes of animals, and also Man.\n\nBut as for astronomy and geology and other sciences, men were left, when once sufficiently civilised to be capable of improving themselves, to make discoveries in them by the exercise of their own faculties.\n\nBut whatever may have been the religious instruction originally afforded to mankind, most of them appear not to have made the proper use of their advantages; but to have fallen, in very early times, into idolatry and superstitions of various kinds.\n\nWhether false religion was introduced before the flood, we are not expressly told; but there is every reason to think it must have been. For we read that mankind had become excessively wicked, and that this brought on them that terrible judgment. And all experience shows that great moral depravity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> religious corruption accompany each other. Moral corruption favours the introduction of corrupted and false religious notions; and a false religion, in turn, favours immorality.\n\nMoreover, there is a passage in Genesis (chap. iv. 26), which, though it be but an obscure hint, seems to relate to the first introduction of false gods, in the times of Enos, grandson of Adam, and\napparently about three or four centuries after the creation. The passage is translated in the text of our version, \"Then began men to call upon the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>: \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d9\u05b4\u05d3\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc \u05d5\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d3\u05b0\u05e2\u05b7\u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9 (Gen. iv. 26.) But the translation in the margin is \"Then began men to call themselves by the name of the Lord.\" And some learned men translate it, \"Then began men to call the Lord by name.\"\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the passage certainly cannot be that divine worship was then introduced for the first time; which, we know, from the preceding history (ch. iv. 3), was not the case. But it probably means that, then, those who worshipped the true God, began to apply to Him some distinct name or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADONAI\">Adonai</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JEHOVAH\">Jehovah</a>, to distinguish Him from the pretended gods worshipped by others, and that they called themselves \"by his name,\" that is, described themselves as his worshippers, to distinguish themselves from those who served other gods. As long as one God only was acknowledged in the world, there was no need to apply to Him any distinguishing title. But when the worship of other Beings was introduced, it would be necessary for the true worshippers to mark the distinction. It is probable, therefore, that this was the time when such false worship first became prevalent.\n\nIn later times, we know, false religions did prevail very extensively, as indeed they still do, among a large portion of mankind.\n\nWe shall next consider what was the real character of the Pagan religions, and in what way it is likely they were introduced.","sp":455,"ep":464},{"h":"CHURCH ALLEGIANCE AND SEPARATIONS","t":"It has been pointed out that the correction of abuses and corruptions in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RELIGION\">Religion</a> has been, in most instances, resisted and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> delayed; partly from an undue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> having been directed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> importance, which has drawn off men's thoughts from very serious errors; partly from mistaken notions respecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a>-unity; and partly from a mistaken dread of innovation, causing men to overlook what are in reality the greatest innovations.\n\nFrom these and other causes, various corruptions have often been allowed to go on unchecked by timely remedies, and to increase, till a thorough reformation was necessary; and indeed much longer. And the longer a reformation is deferred, the more difficult, and the more dangerous and violent, it is likely to be.\n\nIn particular, a reformation very long delayed is the more liable to those two classes of evils mentioned above: [I.] the danger of retaining some of the former wrong principles, so as to revive, under a new form, the faults which had been corrected; and [II.] the danger of reactions, leading men from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> into another.\n\n[I.] For, the longer any corruption has been allowed to prevail, the more it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> have wrought itself into men's character, so as to have affected their mind throughout, and become, as it were, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of themselves. And then, the same fault, substantially, will be the more likely to reappear in a different shape.\n\nThus, for instance, when the principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>, above adverted to, had been so very long acted on, that men all over the world had been familiarised to the putting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> of heresies by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> and fire, and the enforcement of the profession of the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAITH\">Faith</a> by the Civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">Magistrate</a>, as an indispensable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> duty, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, that reformers, even when exposed to persecution themselves, still clung to the faulty principle. They considered persecution, (as was before observed,) as consisting in punishing those who maintained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. And it was long before they came to perceive,\u2014what Scripture so very plainly points out,\u2014the inconsistency with Christ's Religion of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of coercion in his cause. And some remain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> to this, even down to the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nAnd, again, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the true character of Christianity, resulting from the non-translation of the Scriptures, had been very widely spread and long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, and then, persons who had very little mental cultivation, and who had been trained from childhood in most erroneous religious notions, suddenly came to the perusal of the Scriptures, (often without any assistance,) it naturally happened that many of them fell into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> mistakes as to the meaning of what they read. In particular, they often mixed up together confusedly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a> and the Gospel; and often read detached <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, taken at random, without any reference to times, places, persons, and occasions. And thus among many, ignorance of the true character of Christianity continued, in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, to prevail, though in a new shape.\n\nThis has been often brought forward by the opponents of the Reformation, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the danger of putting the Scriptures into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the People. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> Christian Ministers had all along done their duty in training the People to an intelligent and profitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of Scripture, this evil would have been, for the most part prevented. Instead of this, they had kept them ignorant and uneducated, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> after generation. And mankind had been so long blindfolded that they could not see clearly when the bandage was removed.\n\n[II.] And again, the longer and the more obstinately any needful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> has been resisted, the more fierce in general will be the spirit in which it is at length effected. Abuses which have been maintained long after they have been exposed and complained of, men are apt to correct with an angry and indiscriminate violence, which often leads them to rush into extremes, and to reject what is true and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, along with what is erroneous and faulty. Thus, one may sometimes see long-continued tyranny succeeded by\nrevolutionary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a>; and a long reign of ignorant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, even by avowed Atheism.\n\nMany, also, of the evils which are apt to accompany any great religious reformation, have been increased by the too great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of a single Church.\n\nThe Apostles appear to have founded a distinct Church in each considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>; as at Philippi, Thessalonica, and several other cities in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MACEDONIA\">Macedonia</a>, and elsewhere. Now, if some corruption had found its way into these Churches, and one of them\u2014suppose Philippi\u2014had reformed itself, although it is likely that some degree of jealousy and disapprobation would have at first arisen in the other Churches which were as yet unreformed, and though the Philippians might have been censured as having taken a rash step, at least they could not have been denounced as schismatical revolters. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> one could have complained that they had separated from a Church of which they were subjects. They could not have been viewed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of rebellious children, throwing off the yoke of an authority they had been subject to.\n\nBut when a multitude of Churches were united into one vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">Community</a>, comprehending many great Nations spread over extensive Regions, then any reformation not embracing the whole of this great Church, necessarily implied revolt and separation.\n\nAny branch of that Church which resolved to correct abuses that were obstinately retained by the supreme central Authority, was compelled to throw off submission to that Authority, and to assert its independence. And then, those who adhered to the Church which claimed to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> Church, naturally regarded the others as not only erroneous, but Heretics and Schismatics.\n\nAnd such they undoubtedly would have been had they separated on insufficient grounds. They had done that which would have been sinful, if it had not been justified by the corruptions in essential points of Faith and Worship, which the supreme central Authority had obstinately refused to correct. This refusal transferred the sin of causing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, from the revolters, to those who made the revolt necessary.\n\nBut of course a separation thus effected gave rise to much more hostile feelings on both sides than would have been likely to exist between Churches that had been originally distinct, and had always continued so; neither claiming any control over the other. Such Churches might, indeed, have been to a certain degree alienated from each other by differences in Doctrine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">Discipline</a>; but there would not have been the additional provocations of a revolt, and an unfriendly separation on the one side, and a claim of supremacy on the other.\n\nAnd, accordingly, it was on the very ground of the Reformed being Heretics and Schismatics that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> power was called in to reduce them by force to submission. Princes were not called on to wage <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAR\">war</a> against religious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, merely as such; but they were urged to reduce to obedience those who had revolted against the Church to which they were bound to be subject. And thus religious wars, and fierce persecutions, and mutual hatred were introduced, far beyond what would have been likely to arise if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> independence of numerous Churches had always continued.\n\nWhen several distinct Churches had been established in revolt\u2014the members of them having been compelled to secede from the Community they had belonged to, on account of a disagreement as to the fundamentals of Christianity\u2014the result was, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of distinctness, and of disagreement, often came to be, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, blended together in men's minds. There was a sort of presumption created, that any Churches independent of each other may be expected to be at variance. That mutual friendly feeling and free inter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> which prevailed in the earliest ages\u2014when an Ephesian Christian, for instance, going to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> at Corinth, or at any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where there was a christian Church, and bringing proper testimonials, was at once received as a member of that Church\u2014were much impaired, and sometimes forgotten.\n\nAnd, moreover, when men had become familiarly accustomed to separation, from having been forced into it, they were in danger of becoming careless about it, and disposed to think lightly of the sin of Schism.\n\nSomething similar takes place in many other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. For instance, those who have been placed\nin such circumstances as to make the shedding of blood an unavoidable evil, are in danger of gradually losing their original repugnance to it, and becoming so far hardened, as to think little of sacrificing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, even without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>.\n\nIt is the same in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> now before us. There is always a danger that necessary separations may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to others not necessary, and may have prepared men's minds to make every little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, even on points of no vital importance, a ground for setting up new sects. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of a Minister's vestment,\u2014the names of the months,\u2014and of the days of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>,\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of conducting Church music,\u2014the using or not using of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> in matrimony,\u2014on these and such like matters, differences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> have been made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> for separation.\n\nNow, it is much less likely that this would have occurred in Churches which had not broken off from any other, but had been all along distinct Communities. For though, in any such Church, differences of opinion on minor points might have arisen, it is likely that men would have agreed to some compromise, rather than occasion hostile divisions.\n\nIt is true, indeed, that in almost every question, however insignificant, there is a better and a worse decision; and the decision of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s own judgment will, of course, appear to himself to be the better. But in matters not essential, it is evidently a duty to yield, or to adopt a compromise, rather than endanger christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCORD\">concord</a>. For if each person were to draw up what might appear to himself the very best form of Church <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>, and the best possible mode of expressing each christian Doctrine, and the most perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RITUAL\">Ritual</a> for divine Worship, and should resolve not to belong to any Church that did not exactly adopt all these in every particular, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that there would be almost as many Sects as families, and that no christian community at all could subsist for a single year.\n\nBut, as has been above said, when unfriendly separations had been once begun, through a necessity caused by the obstinate retaining of abuses, ceaseless divisions often ensued from men's having become familiarised to divisions, and almost entirely regardless of Church-union.\n\nAnd again, abhorrence of such divisions has led some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> to adopt the system of making a State and a Church one Community, and assigning to the Civil Magistrate the entire control in spiritual matters, and the right of dictating to the consciences of all the citizens. And thus under the name of \"making the State religious\" and \"providing for the greatest good of its subjects,\" they make Christ's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of this world.\n\nWith this fault, and with the endless divisions which have contributed to cause it, Reformers are often exultingly reproached by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> of the system of having one great Church which is to comprehend all Christians, and to dictate to them their faith and practice. See, they say, what are the consequences of once allowing any separation from the Church on any grounds whatever! When you have once begun, you cannot tell where to stop.\n\nNow, in truth, that very Church from which the Reformers revolted, was (as has been above pointed out) the original cause of all these evils. In the first place, by obstinately adhering to an accumulated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of gross corruptions, it made a thorough reformation necessary. And secondly, by having absorbed into one Community a multitude of distinct Churches, it made separation a necessary part of reformation. And thus it not only retarded needful reformations, and made them more difficult, but also made them, when they did come, much more hurtful, and more exposed to the dangers which are attendant on any great reformation.\n\nAs for what are, and are not such essential points as to warrant separation, it would of course be unsuitable to our present purpose to enter on the discussion of such a subject. But everyone should be warned, that in each question of the kind that may arise, he is bound to inquire and examine seriously, carefully, and dispassionately; not as if it were merely a matter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, fancy, or convenience. We are responsible to God for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of our best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> in forming a decision. And we are bound in duty to Him, to take care neither to sacrifice the essentials of Christianity for the sake of peace, nor again, lightly and wantonly to cause divisions.\n\nAll separation, in short, and all resistance to Church-authority, must be either a duty or a sin. Which of the two it is, in each particular instance,\neach must decide according to the best of his judgment; which is, after all, fallible. And in no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> are we authorised to pronounce our neighbour guilty of an unpardonable sin. But though Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> requires us to make allowance for those who appear to us blameable, it is no part of charity to confound the distinctions of right and wrong; nor indeed would there be any room for the exercise of charity in judging of those whom we do not consider to be acting wrongly.\n\nOn these and several other important questions connected with religion, some persons are so distrustful of what they call \"private judgment,\"\u2014that is, the judgment of the generality of men, and of themselves,\u2014that they resolve to renounce altogether the exercise of private judgment on all religious questions, and to submit themselves in every thing to the judgment of their Church. They dwell much on the incompetency of most men to decide rightly on difficult points; and consider that there is a pious humility in determining not to exercise their own judgment at all.\n\nBut they quite forget that, in the course they adopt, they do decide on one most important and difficult point. A man who resolves to place himself under a certain guide to be implicitly followed, and decides that such and such a Church is the appointed infallible guide, does decide on his own private judgment, that one most important point, which includes in it all other decisions relative to Religion. And if, by his own shewing, he is unfit to judge at all, he can have no ground for confidence that he has decided it rightly. And if, accordingly, he will not trust himself to judge even on this point, but resolves to consult his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, or some other friends, and be led entirely by their judgment thereupon, still he does, in thus resolving, exercise his own judgment as to the counsellors he so relies on.\n\nThere is no need, therefore, to dispute about the right, or about the duty, of private judgment. For there is plainly an unavoidable necessity of private judgment, on any subject wherein we take any serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. The responsibility is one which, however unfit we may deem ourselves to bear it, we cannot possibly get rid of, in any matter about which we really feel an anxious care. It is in vain to discuss the questions whether we may, or whether we ought, to exercise private judgment, since we must do so, whether we will or no.\n\nThat which often misleads men in this matter, is that we can refrain from exercising private judgment on this or that particular point, by transferring our judgment to some other point. For example\u2014A sick man who is conscious of his own want of knowledge of medicine, may refrain from exercising any judgment as to the remedies he should use, and may put himself wholly in the hands of a physician; that is, he judges that a physician is needful, and that such and such a practitioner is worthy of confidence. Or, supposing he distrusts his own judgment on this point also, then he consults some friend whom he judges to be trustworthy, as to what physician he shall employ. In one way, or else in another, he cannot but exercise private judgment. So, also, if a man inherit a great fortune, and have a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the great responsibility attending it, and of his own unfitness to dispose of his wealth, he may resolve to make it all over to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TRUSTEES\">trustees</a>, to distribute in charity at their discretion. He may have judged rightly in so doing; but it is evident he does judge, and does exercise an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of ownership once for all, in thus divesting himself of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>. And if he deem himself incompetent even to the task of selecting trustees, and relies on the judgment of some friend as to what persons he shall appoint trustees, still he is exercising his judgment in the selection of that friend. The responsibility is one which he cannot shake off, do what he will.\n\nThe man who in the course of God's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a> comes into the possession of wealth, is by that providence, entrusted with the stewardship of that wealth, however ill-qualified he may seem, to us, or to himself, for such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>. And instead of murmuring or wondering at God's dispensations, or trying in vain to shake off the responsibility thus laid on him, he should set himself to do the best he can towards the fulfilment of the duty imposed on him.\n\nAnd it is the same in all cases. We do and must exercise our judgment, on one point or on another, in all matters except those in which we take no interest, and which do not occupy our thoughts. In most of the causes, for instance, which are tried in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, we do not\ntrouble ourselves to exercise any judgment, if we know or care nothing about either plaintiff or defendant, and feel no interest in the decision.\n\nAccordingly, if any one resolves that he will not exercise any judgment on religious matters, and really does consistently keep to that rule, not deceiving himself (as many do) in the way <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> above noticed, by judging on one point instead of another, he will find that there is only one possible way of complying with that rule\u2014namely, by withdrawing his attention as much as possible from the whole subject, except as far as regards outward forms and observances, and refraining altogether from considering the questions, what the christian Religion is, and whether there is any truth in it.\n\nAnd there are not a few who really do, in this way, abstain from exercising any judgment at all in religious matters, and are content to do and say just what they have been accustomed to, without any serious reflection on the subject. But even so, they do not escape responsibility. For we are responsible, not only for doing, but also for leaving undone; else, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> who hid his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> would have escaped <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a>.\n\nOf course it is not meant that on any important point a man ought to make up his mind, unassisted, and without consulting those whom he may consider to be intelligent, and well-informed, and upright advisers. Only, let him not deceive himself by imagining that he can forego all exercise of his own judgment in any matter about which he has a real and anxious care.\n\nAnd on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, we should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against the opposite mistake of supposing that whatever is left to our own discretion is, therefore, left to our caprice, and may be decided on at random. We may have a right to do many things which we should not be right in doing. For instance, when any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> is brought into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, each member has an undoubted right to vote for it or against it; but it would be absurd to say that he would be equally right in doing either. It is in such cases, and in such alone, that there is room for the exercise of any such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> as good sense, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, discretion, &c. For, in matters quite indifferent, there is clearly no exercise of judgment in deciding. Nor, again, is there any room for it in matters that are already decided for us, and in which we have no choice: as, for instance, when a Judge has to declare what the law actually is on such and such a point. But when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">Legislator</a> is called on to decide what the law ought to be, and, in short, in every case where we have to decide, and where there may be a better or a worse decision, it is then, and then only, that there is room for the exercise of good sense.\n\nWe should keep in mind, then, that as the exercise of our own judgment (in matters in which we feel a deep interest) is, on the one hand, unavoidable, so it is, on the other hand, responsible. We are bound to use, to the best of our power, such faculties and opportunities as God's providence may have bestowed on us, in judging of any question pertaining to Religion; and among others, in any question as to separation.\n\nBut though, as we have already said, much blame attaches to those who hastily, and on slight grounds, separate from their Church; a Church, on the other hand, is not exempted from a share of blame, which narrows too much its terms of communion. Some terms, of course, are indispensable; since persons differing as to the fundamentals of christian Doctrine and Worship cannot possibly be members of the same christian Community. But care should be taken not to go beyond what is necessary. If possible, none should be excluded of those who can join in christian Worship together, and receive instruction together in the essential truths of the Gospel. To multiply <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">Articles</a> of Faith and Ordinances, unnecessarily, manifestly tends to create divisions.\n\nAnd it is not enough to say that these Articles are, all, such as we are convinced are scriptural, and that none of our Ordinances are contrary to Scripture, and that the scruples of those who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to them are unfounded and frivolous. All this may be true; and it may be true that those are to blame who on such grounds separate from the Church; yet this does not clear from blame those who put a stumblingblock in the way of weak brethren by insisting on points that are not essential, and on which persons may differ who are yet capable of worshipping together as Members of the same christian Church. \"Him that\nis weak in the Faith, receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.\" (Rom. xiv. 1.)\n\nIt is to be observed, however, that when we speak of points that are and that are not \"essential,\" we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>, in this place, essential as terms of communion; not, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a>. For there are some points of disagreement which would completely prevent men from being Members of the same Church, though hardly any, of either party, would regard the other as under a fatal error.\n\nFor example, there are persons irreconcilably opposed on the subject of Church-endowments. Some of the advocates of what is called \"the voluntary system\" consider it as not only objectionable, but utterly unlawful, to attend what they call a hired Ministry\u2014that is, one maintained by endowments. And the other party, though not holding it absolutely unlawful for a Minister to be dependent on the voluntary contributions of his People (since \"the labourer is worthy of his hire,\") yet consider this so very undesirable, that they would feel bound to support and promote the system of endowments. Now these two parties could hardly continue Members of the same Church: And yet neither need regard the other as having abandoned the fundamentals of Christianity.\n\nThe same may be said of an irreconcilable disagreement as to the use of extemporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>, and of stated forms, in Public Worship. Some consider the use of any form, even the Lord's Prayer, as not allowable. Others, again, believe that a special <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> is made to the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>\" prayers of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONGREGATION\">Congregation</a> who \"agree together touching something they shall ask in Christ's name;\" and that, accordingly, they are bound to pray together, (either audibly or mentally,) and not merely to listen to the prayers offered up by another. And they hold it to be impossible, in most cases, that a Congregation (at least, the whole of it) can so constantly go along with all that is said by an extemporary speaker, as to accompany\u2014properly speaking\u2014his prayers; that is, so as not only to understand and approve what he says, but to make his prayers their own prayers also at the moment. These prayers, accordingly, will generally be, they conceive, rather of the character of exhortations addressed to the People by the Minister, than of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>-prayers addressed by the People to God.\n\nNow persons strongly impressed with these opposite notions could not be united in one Church, though they may not regard each other as fatally in error.\n\nIt has been above said, that a man is deeply responsible for the sin of Schism, if he should, without evident and strong necessity, separate from his Church. But some have doubted what Church it is that has this general claim to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a>; whether that which is established by law; or that which his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> formerly belonged to; or that in which he himself has been brought up.\n\nAs for the first of these, the Religion established by law, has not, on that ground, any claim on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>. A member, for example, of the Church of England becomes a dissenter if he settle in some part of the Empire where some other form of religion is established. But if he is conscientiously a member of his own original Church, and sees no reason to consider it unscriptural, he has no right to forsake it on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> grounds.\n\nAs for the Church to which one's ancestors may have belonged, no one should think himself bound to investigate obscure and difficult questions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, and to judge of all the acts of those who founded or reformed his Church, perhaps several centuries ago, in order to decide whether he is permitted, or whether he is bound, to continue in the Church in which he was brought up. If those founders separated unreasonably, they indeed were chargeable with the sin of Schism. But it would be to create a fresh Schism, if he were to forsake the Church he was brought up in, not from feeling any objection to its Doctrines or Worship, but merely on the ground that its original formation was not justifiable.\n\nAnd a like principle is universally recognised in all civil affairs. Else, indeed, the whole World would be filled with perpetual rebellions and\n\n---\n\n1 More properly called unhired; being supported, not like a labourer by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> of his employer, but by endowments similar to those of many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">Hospitals</a>, Colleges, &c.\ncivil wars. For example, every one knows that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a> was formerly united, not to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, but to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>\u2014that, in like manner, Normandy, and other provinces of France, and also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">States</a>, formerly belonged to England; and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a> consisted of several independent Kingdoms. But if a Norman were to hold that he owed no allegiance to the French Government, or an American to that of the United States, and so on, unless every such separation and annexation could be proved originally justifiable, and if every man were to think himself authorised on such grounds to raise revolt, there would be hardly such a thing as a peaceable Government on Earth.\n\nEach man, therefore, owes allegiance, generally, to the Church in which he has been brought up, unless he find this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with his reverence for God's Word, and his obedience to the divine Will.\n\nIndependently, however, of any disagreement, a separation may take place with the consent of all parties, of one Branch of a Church from the rest, merely from reasons of convenience, and without any interruption of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> and inter-communion, any more than among the several distinct Churches originally founded by the Apostles. For example, this took place with the American Episcopalian Church, which formerly was a portion of the Church of England. When the American States became politically independent, the inconvenience of having one Church whose members were citizens of different political Communities, was so plain to all parties, that a friendly separation was agreed on. And if this had been done long before, by mutual consent, merely on the ground of the inconvenient distance between the two Countries, no one could have had any right to find fault with the measure. For, any union or separation that is made by mutual consent, is evidently a matter which the parties concerned have a full right to determine for themselves.\n\nBut difficult questions may arise when both parties do not thus agree; those who desire to form themselves into a distinct Church being opposed by the rest. Suppose, for instance, that on the occasion just alluded to, the English Church had refused to consent to the independence of the American, and had insisted on retaining control over them. In any such case, those desiring to secede should, in the first place, satisfy themselves, on careful consideration, that the evils they seek to remedy are not only real, but great, and likely to interfere with the objects for which Churches exist. Next, they should respectfully, and in a spirit of kindness, set forth their reasons, and listen candidly to what may be urged on the opposite side. And if they see no reason to alter their opinion, they should still remonstrate earnestly and perseveringly, before they take the extreme step of seceding without the consent of their brethren.\n\nIn these, however, and in all similar matters, it is impossible to lay down rules such as will at once apply to every case that may arise. There must always be room for the exercise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> judgment and candour, in deciding on each particular question.\n\nThere is one principle, however, which should always be kept in mind, and which, obvious as it is, men often lose sight of in practice; namely, that a necessity imposed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> circumstances, and for which we are not responsible, will justify, and call for, such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> as would be sinful if there were no such necessity. We should be careful, therefore, not to commit either the error of censuring men for doing what would, in ordinary circumstances, be wrong; or the error of supposing ourselves at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to do, at any time and under any circumstances, whatever has, in some particular case, been justifiably and rightly done.\n\nIn the ordinary affairs of life, this principle is, in general, well understood and acted on. For example, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of men, citizens of any State, to assemble, and by their own authority, declare themselves a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SENATE\">Senate</a>, and proceed to elect Magistrates, and enact Laws, and establish a Government, would justly be regarded as a most heinous act of rebellion; and all their laws, (however good in themselves,) would be evidently null and void. But if a number of persons were to find themselves wrecked on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, or the sole survivors of a pestilence, or in some other way left to themselves, no one would contend that they were bound thenceforward to live in a\nstate of anarchy, because they had no legitimate Rulers or Laws. They would be authorized, and bound, to agree as well as they could, in establishing some sort of Government. And the Laws and Magistrates thus appointed would have as good a claim to obedience as those of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">Country</a> in the World; because it is plainly necessary to human welfare, and agreeable to the divine Will, that men should live under a regular Government. Yet this case would afford no precedent for any persons who should take upon them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> up an existing Community, and to revolt against \"the Powers that be.\"\n\nSo also, if the persons thus situated were to find themselves without regularly ordained Clergy, or without any except such as they were fully convinced had abandoned the genuine Doctrines of the Gospel, it would be absurd to suppose it could be the Will of their Heavenly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a>, that they should remain for ever destitute of a christian Ministry and Church-ordinances. They would clearly be conforming to the spirit of his injunctions, in forming themselves into a Church, and appointing various Orders of Ministers, selecting the best qualified persons they could find, for each office, and establishing Church-regulations according to the best of their judgment. And the necessity under which they were placed, would justify, and render valid, all their acts and appointments; supposing them always not to be in themselves superstitious or unscriptural. But such a case would afford no fair precedent for persons differently circumstanced, who should take upon themselves, wantonly and without necessity, to ordain Ministers, and set up themselves as a new Church.\n\nSo, also, there may be extreme cases of such cruel and intolerable oppression as to justify subjects in revolting against an established Government. But extreme cases do not destroy the authority of a general rule, though they may authorize an exceptional departure from it. And it is undoubtedly true, as a general rule, that we are in duty bound to submit to existing Governments.\n\nAgain, if the loyal portion of a garrison were to revolt from a general, who had turned traitor, and was betraying the city into an enemy's hands, so far from being treasonable in thus revolting, they would have been abettors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a> if they had not. And yet the general rule is, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> are bound to obey their commander.\n\nIn like manner, submission to Church-authority, and the preservation of Church-union, are the rule; and resistance, or separation, the exception. The burden of proof lies with those who undertake to justify a departure from a rule. And if they do thus justify themselves, their case affords no fair precedent for those who would introduce general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCORD\">discord</a> and confusion.\n\nIt is to be observed, however, that when we speak of the general claim to obedience, which the Laws of any Community\u2014civil or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a>\u2014have on its Members, this does not imply such a blind veneration as should withhold us from seeking any needful amendment. Any one who scorns the absurdity of attributing infallibility to human Beings, would be himself guilty of a still greater absurdity, if, while considering all men as fallible, he should yet act as if they were in-fallible, by insisting that all their institutions and regulations should be like the Laws of the Medes and Persians, which could never be changed; and that no one should even inquire whether amendment in any point be possible, and needful. All wanton and hasty changes, indeed, should, in all subjects, be avoided; the presumption being, as has been above said, against every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>. And a man's veneration for any existing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">Constitution</a>\u2014whether in Church or in State\u2014may reasonably lead him to deprecate any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> change. But the best security against this,\u2014in short, against revolution,\u2014is, the constant correction of abuses, and the introduction of improvements as they are needed. It is the neglect of timely repairs (as was remarked above) that makes rebuilding necessary.\n\nAnd, moreover, the amendment of any Law that is faulty, tends (beside the immediate benefit) to increase men's confidence in those that are left unchanged; and in this way contributes to the stability of the whole system. For it creates a presumption that what is left unchanged, is so left for some good and sufficient reasons, and not from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> blind determination against any change, whether for the worse or for the better.\n\nSome persons, however, there are, who are far from thinking all existing laws (civil or eccle-\nsistical) faultless; and who, on that ground, hold themselves at liberty to disobey or evade any that they think objectionable. But if these very persons are called on to exert themselves to procure, in a regular way, a remedy for the evil, they will shrink from the trouble, or expense, or odium, they might thus incur for the public good. There are many, for example, who from their disapprobation of the existing revenue laws, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAME\">game</a> laws, &c., will violate these without scruple, when they can do so with impunity. But when urged to exert themselves in perseveringly calling the attention of the Legislature to these laws, they will plead that it is no concern of theirs, but only of their Rulers.\n\nAnd they act in the same way with respect to Church-regulations; disregarding without scruple any that they disapprove; but refusing to take any pains for the regular correction of anything they complain of.\n\nBut a truly conscientious and right-minded man will pursue exactly the opposite course. As long as a law exists, he will feel bound to obey it, as far as he can with a safe conscience. But if he consider it an unwise law, he will exert himself to have it amended by competent authority; or, if necessary, to have some competent authority appointed for the purpose of rectifying whatever may be amiss. These exertions may, perhaps, cost him much more trouble and discomfort than he, individually, suffers from the existing state of things. But he will not hesitate to sacrifice his own immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> comfort and ease, for the lasting benefit of his Countrymen and fellow-Christians. For a true Christian is most emphatically and pre-eminently public-spirited. \"NONE OF US,\" says the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APOSTLE\">Apostle</a> Paul, \"LIVETH UNTO HIMSELF.\" (Rom. xiv. 7.) And he who is the most sedulously occupied in working out, on Gospel principles, his own salvation, will always be found the most devotedly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> in promoting the welfare of his brethren.","sp":544,"ep":553},{"h":"CONTENTS OF THE SIXTH DISSERTATION","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">CHAPTER</a> I.\u2014INTRODUCTORY.\n\n\u00a7 1.

There would have been a perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a> lodged in some person <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> persons, indued with such manifest miraculous powers as could leave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt as to their inspiration. And these infallible interpreters would have been universally and readily accessible.\n\nBut it is notorious, that such was not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of Providence; and that no such guide does exist. Of all the persons who have claimed infallibility, there is none who has displayed (as Paul did) \"the signs of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a>,\" that is, such palpable and undeniable miraculous powers, as to leave no doubt in any candid mind, of his being really inspired. And since the very purpose for which an infallible guide is supposed to be needed, is, the removal of all reasonable doubts, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that if God had thought fit to provide us with such a guide, He would not have left it at all doubtful where we were to look for that guide.\n\nIt seems to have been his design that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">Man</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> on Earth should consist in his being required to \"prove (\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9), [that is, try and examine] all things, and hold fast that which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>.\" We are called on to inquire carefully, and humbly, and piously, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>; and to embrace whatever appears, to the best of our judgment, to be the truth.\n\nTo complain of this,\u2014to reject or undervalue the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a> God has bestowed, urging that it is no revelation to us, or an insufficient one, because unerring certainty is not bestowed also,\u2014because we are required to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> patient diligence and watchfulness, and candour, and humble self-distrust,\u2014this would be as unreasonable as to disparage and neglect the bountiful gift of eyesight, because men's eyes have sometimes deceived them; because men have mistaken a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> imitated, or a mirage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> for a lake; and have fancied they had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of sight for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; and to infer from all this that we ought to blindfold ourselves, and be led henceforth by some guide who pretends to be himself not liable to such deceptions.\n\nThe two great volumes,\u2014that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a>, and that of Revelation, which God has opened before us for our benefit, are in this respect analogous. Both are in themselves exempt from error; but they do not confer complete exemption from all possibility of error on the student of them. As the laws of nature are in themselves invariable, but yet are sometimes imperfectly known, and sometimes mistaken, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> philosophers, so the Scriptures are intrinsically infallible, but do not impart infallibility to the student of them. Even by the most learned, they are in many parts imperfectly understood; by the \"unlearned and unstable\" they are liable to be \"wrested to their own destruction.\"\n\nBut still, if no errors or dissensions had arisen in the Church during the days of the Apostles, and then, when these inspired teachers were removed, heresies and schisms (\u03c3\u03c7\u03af\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, divisions) had arisen for the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, we might have felt as if God had forsaken us, and as if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> were exposed to such trials as had not been originally designed. Or we might have imagined (as indeed some persons have imagined) that God would still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> us inspiration, attested by miraculous signs, if we were not wanting in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> supplication for such gifts.\n\nAnd accordingly, in almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">Age</a> of Christianity, there have been persons who have persuaded themselves that miraculous powers and inspiration actually are bestowed on themselves or on their Church; and these pretensions are believed by such as decide according to their own wishes and conjectures, without any rational proofs.\n\nBut when we come to examine Scripture His-\ntory, we find that, even in the times of the Apostles, false teachers did \"arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them,\" and that Christians were thus divided into rival sects. And this, the Apostles teach us, is a part of the appointed trial to which we are to be subjected here on earth. \"There must needs be heresies, that they which are approved may be made manifest\" (1 Cor. xi. 19), that is, that men may have to exercise their care and candour in chusing between truth and error.\n\nAnd since God did think fit that Christians should have to encounter such trials, He mercifully provided that they should be forewarned \"to take heed to themselves.\" The errors and corruptions introduced, even in the days of the Apostles, are recorded in our Sacred Books, on purpose, no doubt, to put us on our guard; to prepare us to be watchful against corruptions of Christianity in all other Ages of the Church; and also to prevent our being disheartened at finding ourselves exposed to such a trial.\n\nIt is not the design of this Dissertation, nor indeed would its limits permit, to give an historical account of each of the various corruptions of Christianity which have taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in different Ages and Countries. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be sufficient to give a sketch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> sources from which they arose, and of the means by which, in many instances, they were encouraged and kept up.\n\nThese two general rules, then, are to be kept in mind:\n\n1st. That whatever opposed Christianity at the outset, afterwards tended to mix itself up with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RELIGION\">Religion</a>, and corrupt it.\n\n2dly. That as far as any corruptions depended on local and temporary circumstances, so far, they would be likely soon to die away, without spreading widely; but so far as they were connected with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> Nature, we may expect to find them appearing again and again, in various Countries.\n\nI. First, then, we have said that the causes which, at the beginning, led to open hostility against the Gospel, afterwards operated to corrupt it. All those human faults and follies\u2014all those prejudices, and infirmities, and vices\u2014which originally disposed men to reject the Christian religion, found their way into it, in proportion as it prevailed.\n\nAt first, almost all those whose notions and whose dispositions were wholly adverse to Christianity, rejected it altogether, and endeavoured to put it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>: though even from the very first there were exceptions to this rule; as we see in the instances of Iscariot, and of Simon the Sorcerer. But as the Religion spread, and became less and less unpopular, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of disciples multiplied more and more, there was a continually increasing number of persons who, though members of Christian churches, had not fully understood the character of the Gospel, nor imbibed the spirit of it. And these introduced into the Religion the same kind of errors and wrong principles as had originally been openly arrayed against it.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> opposition to the Gospel arose from (1.) Judaism; (2.) Pagan Superstitions; (3.) Heathen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>; (4.) Immorality of Character; and, (5.) Worldly Policy.\n\nAnd the spirit of Judaism, of Paganism, &c., afterwards found their way into Christianity, and tended to corrupt it.\n\n(1.) It has been pointed out in an earlier part of this Dissertation, how much opposed the prevailing Jewish notions and prejudices were to the religion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ.\n\nAnd accordingly, one of the very earliest attempts to corrupt Christianity was made by the Judaizing teachers, who were continually endeavouring to bring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENTILE\">Gentile</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEVERS\">believers</a> under the yoke of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOSAIC_LAW\">Mosaic <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>. (Acts xv., Gal. ii., Phil. iii.)\n\n(2.) Then, again, of the opposition of the Pagan worshippers to the Gospel, we find many instances mentioned in the Book of the Acts of the Apostles; especially in chap. xvi. 20, 21; and xix. 27.\n\nAnd we find, from time to time, attempts made to incorporate into Christianity superstitions borrowed from Paganism, or of a similar nature.\n\nActs xx. 28, perverted doctrines, harpaginis.\nThe earliest, perhaps, of these corruptions of Christianity, was that introduced by those very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> heretics the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GNOSTICS\">Gnostics</a>, whom the Apostle John was particularly occupied in opposing, both in his Epistles and in the opening of his Gospel.\n\nThese men, it is well known, blended with christian doctrines many of the notions of the Pagans, of the Persian, and some other Eastern Nations. The religious system of these nations consisted in acknowledging and reverencing two Beings of equal power,\u2014a good and an evil god,\u2014whom they called Ormuzd and Ahriman. And some of their descendants, in the same regions, at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, are said to retain this faith, and to be worshippers principally of the evil god.\n\nThe Gnostics accordingly taught, among other things, that the world was not created by the Supreme God, but by an Evil Being, or by a certain inferior god.\\(^1\\)\n\nBut, as has been above said, various other Pagan errors, or errors resembling those of Paganism, have from time to time, crept into the christian Church.\n\n(3.) The ancient heathen philosophers again, who believed little or nothing of the popular superstitions, were no less opposed to the Gospel, which they derided as \"foolishness.\" And many of them, when they afterwards embraced Christianity, endeavoured to reconcile it with their philosophical speculations, and thus to be wise above that which is written.\n\nIt is evidently to this danger that Paul is alluding, in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>; especially when he warns the Colossians, \"Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of the world, and not after Christ.\" (Col. ii. 8. See also 1 Cor. i. 20\u201328.)\n\nIt appears, therefore, that even in the Apostolic Age, men had begun to introduce into Christianity presumptuous speculations on matters not revealed in Scripture, and to make the Gospel a field for the exercise of their philosophical ingenuity. But in later ages this evil prevailed to a far greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>.\n\n(4.) As for moral depravity, no one can doubt how much this must have led many persons to shut their ears against the evidences for a religion which required them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> their lives.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> given of Felix, the Governor, would no doubt have suited a great number of others: \"When Paul reasoned of righteousness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a>, and the judgment to come, Felix trembled, and said, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season I will call for thee.\"\n\nBut when persons of this character did become members of the Church, as it appears many did, even in the time of the Apostles, they naturally sought to accommodate the religion to their own corrupt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>. This seems to have been more particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with those Gnostics above mentioned. For they taught that men are to be saved by what they called \"knowledge\" of the Gospel,\" while living the most immoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and yet having no sin (that is nothing imputed to them as sin) but being accounted righteous without \"doing righteousness.\" (1 John iii.) And this it was that made the Apostle John so vehement in his censure of them.\n\nBut there are many allusions in the Apostolic Epistles, to others besides these Gnostics, who sought to \"hold the truth in unrighteousness.\" (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> i. 18.)\n\n(5.) Lastly, worldly policy was evidently one of the chief causes which in the outset, acted as a hindrance to the reception of Christianity. It is plain, from the very nature of the case, that all views of worldly ambition,\u2014all desire of worldly profit or advantage of any kind,\u2014all considerations of supposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> expediency,\u2014must have been, at first, arrayed in opposition to the Gospel. And every part of the sacred narrative confirms this. We find the Jewish rulers influenced by the fear that \"the Romans would come and take away their place and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>.\" (John x. 48.) We find them urging before Pilate, that \"whosoever maketh himself a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-KING\">king</a>, speaketh against Caesar.\" And we find the same sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> repeatedly used to the Roman governors, and often with effect. (See Acts xvii. 7, and xix. 23.)\n\nAnd again, the poverty, hardships, and perse-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Thence denominated by them \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9.\n\n\\(^2\\) Hence their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of \"Gnostics;\" that is, persons knowing the Gospel.\ncutions, which the early Christians had been so earnestly forewarned of by our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> (John xvi. 1, 2), and to which they were actually exposed, must have operated very strongly in prejudicing all men of a worldly character against the religion.\n\nOf course, in proportion as Christianity became less unpopular, and more generally received, this cause would less and less operate in making men reject the religion, and would be more and more likely to corrupt it. In proportion as worldly-minded men became members of the Church, they would naturally endeavour to wrest the Religion to their own views of ambition or of profit.\n\nThis could not be expected to take place to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> in the earliest Ages as afterwards. Yet we find that even in the days of the Apostles, men had crept into the church who were tainted with avarice or worldly ambition, and who corrupted the christian doctrines so as to favour their own views. For we find Paul cautioning Timothy against \"perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who regard religion as a source of profit.\"\u00b9\n\nAll the principal causes, then, which occasioned opposition to Christianity, at the outset, led afterwards to the corruption of the Religion; and accordingly, some of the principal corruptions which have, at various times, been introduced, will be noticed under the same five heads under which we have, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> above, treated of the sources of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> opposition to the Gospel. Those causes, which had begun to operate even in the days of the Apostles, had, of course, more of this corrupting influence in later times. In proportion as the dangers to the Church from without were diminished, by the increasing prevalence of the Religion, the dangers from within naturally increased. For, the number must of course have become greater, of members of the Church who were such merely because they had been brought up as children of Christian parents, or because Christianity was the prevailing religion; and who would have rejected it when first preached, from their having an unconverted heart, and being strangers to the true spirit of the Gospel. And such persons will always be likely to aim at bringing their religion into a conformity with their own characters, instead of conforming their own characters to the Religion.\n\nII. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> general rule we laid down was, that so far as any human fault or folly was peculiar to some particular time or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">Country</a>, its effects may be expected soon to have passed away without spreading very far; but so far as it belonged to human nature in general, we must expect to find the evil effects of its reappearing again and again, in various forms, in all Ages, and in various regions.\n\nAnd for the most part it will be found that the prejudices and evil dispositions of men which have introduced religious error, and accordingly the religious errors themselves thence arising, are different in their outward form according to the peculiar circumstances of each time and place; but that in substance and at bottom, they are nearly alike, always and everywhere.\n\nFor example, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of the Jews in favour of their own nation and institutions, gave rise to that very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> above noticed (see Acts xv., and Gal. ii.), of those who taught that all Christians were bound to keep the Mosaic Law; or at least, that such as did so had attained a superior degree of sanctity. The violation of the UNITY [ONENESS] of Christ's religion, by thus dividing Christians into two classes, admitted to different degrees of religious privilege, has been already noticed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> of Judaizing Christians, however, thus founded, seems not to have lasted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a>. The destruction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a> and its Temple appears to have soon put an end to it. But the general tendency towards this violation of Christian Unity, being not peculiar to the Jews, but a part of human nature, has shewn itself again and again, under various forms, in various portions of the Church.\n\nWhat are called the \"Monastic Orders,\" which have long existed in many Churches, are a striking instance of this. Though the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of Christians have been solemnly dedicated to Christ at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a>, wherein they engage to be his \"faithful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> and servants;\" yet many have thought fit to take on themselves a new and\n\n\u00b9 1 Tim. vi. 5.\ndistinct engagement, not binding on Christians generally, but only on such as have professed this new and superior kind of Christianity. The members of such Orders are often called the \"religious;\" and there is one well-known order called the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of Jesus;\" as if the Church itself were not the Society of Jesus, and all its members bound to be religious. And the members of these Orders are supposed to possess a certain extraordinary kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a>, from their imposing on themselves certain restrictions, and privations, and other sufferings, according to rules laid down, not by Scripture for all men, but by particular founders for their own Order. Now this is clearly in violation of the Oneness of Christ's religion.\n\nAgain, one may find persons dividing Christians into \"Elect,\" and not Elect\u2014those who are, and those who are not \"God's people:\" accounting some Christians \"Saints,\" and others not; some \"Evangelical\" and others not. Though \"Saints\" was the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> used by the apostles to denote what we call \"Christians;\" and though it is plain that since Christianity is the religion of the Gospel [Evangelium], all doctrines and all persons must be Evangelical or not, exactly in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, and in the same degree, that they are, or are not Christian.\n\nThose, also, who regard christian Ministers as sacerdotal Priests, acting as a kind of mediators between God and the People, are evidently going very far towards such a distinction between Clergy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAITY\">Laity</a> as is at variance with the Apostolical view of Christian-Unity.\n\nAnd, it may be added, that there is a considerable number of persons who make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of christians into the two classes, of Communicants and non-Communicants. For there are very many of these latter, who, though far from disregarding christian duty altogether, or absenting themselves from public worship, yet consider that, so far from being a duty, it would be a wrong thing for them to attend the Lord's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">Table</a>, unless they were determined to become Saints in some peculiar manner, different from what is expected of christians generally. And this they think it would be presumptuous for them to pretend to. They regard themselves, in short, as an inferior class of christians.\n\nAnd, it is to be observed, that the division of worshippers into different classes in respect of religious privileges, belonged, even much more, to the Pagan religions, than to the Jewish. For among the Pagans, certain persons were \"initiated\" into such \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MYSTERIES\">Mysteries</a>\" of their religion as were carefully kept secret from the vulgar. And this was not the case with the Mosaic religion. The division, therefore, of Christians into such classes, is what the heathen converts, no less than the Jewish, would be inclined to. And it is, moreover, something so natural to man, that, in one shape or another, it has appeared in almost all parts and Ages of the Church.\n\nAnd so it is with most of the other corruptions of Christianity. The particular form in which each has appeared, will have generally been determined by local and temporary circumstances; and, when these circumstances are changed, that particular corruption will die away, to reappear (so far as it pertains to the character of the \"natural man,\") under some new shapes, in various Countries.\n\nIt is to be observed, however, that those corruptions of Christianity which arise from the mixing up of Judaism with it, are, for one reason, likely to be more lasting than most others, and to be oftener revived. Christians acknowledge that the Mosaic Dispensation came from God. And that, and also the Christian Dispensation, are contained in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> which we call the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a>. Now, any one who regards the Bible (which many Christians do) as one book, containing divine instructions, without having formed any clear notions of what does and does not belong to each Dispensation, will, of course, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into\n\n---\n\n1 There are, indeed, some persons who confine both the terms \"Christian\" and \"Evangelical\" to those who exactly agree with them in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, and belong to their Party; regarding all others as excluded from the Gospel covenant. But there are, again, some who make the distinction above alluded to.\n\n2 Josephus remarks, as a distinction between the Pagan and the Jewish religions, that this latter made known to all the People the mysteries of their religion, while the Pagans concealed from all but those specially \"initiated\" the mysteries of theirs.\nthe greatest confusion of thought. He will be like a man who should have received from his father, at various times, a great number of letters containing directions as to his conduct, from the time when he was a little child just able to read, till he was a grown man; and who should lay by these letters with care and reverence, but in a confused heap, and should take up any one of them at random, and read it without any reference to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, whenever he needed his father's instructions how to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a>.\n\nAccordingly, many erroneous notions, wholly or partly drawn from Judaism, have again and again found their way into the christian Church.\n\nFor example, there have been in almost all Ages of the Church, persons who have taught that Jesus Christ is to come upon earth and reign in great worldly splendour at Jerusalem for a thousand years; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> is thence called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILLENNIUM\">Millennium</a>. And superior privileges, as God's peculiar People, are then to be restored (according to this doctrine) to the Jews; that is, to such Jews as shall have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> unbelievers; not, to the descendants of those great multitudes of them who embraced Christianity in the days of the Apostles, and since, and who thereupon soon became blended with the Gentile Christians. But the remnant of the Jews who shall have obstinately rejected the Gospel up to that time, are then to be restored to their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, and to have a superiority in God's sight over men of Gentile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RACE\">race</a>. And the Temple at Jerusalem is to be restored, and to be again the place of peculiar holiness, whither all men are to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to worship.\n\nNow these expectations of a Christ, who is to be a great and victorious temporal king, and of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of earthly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, and of the restoration of the Temple, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXALTATION\">exaltation</a> of the Jews above all other people, are precisely those which the Jewish nation were so wedded to when our Lord came, and which led most of them to reject Him.\n\nThere are several other religious errors which have arisen from the same cause,\u2014the practice of confusedly blending together the Law and the Gospel. Thus, some persons, as we had before occasion to remark, represent temporal rewards and punishments as a part of the sanction of the Christian Dispensation; and again, future rewards and punishments as a part of the sanction of the Mosaic. And this, as we have already said, destroys all clear notions of either system, and leads to great and dangerous practical errors, besides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> our Scriptures to unanswerable objections from infidels.\n\nAnd again, the introduction into Christianity of sacerdotal Priests, Altars, Sacrifices, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">Temples</a>, which is so utterly repugnant to the whole character of the Gospel, may be traced both to Judaism and to Paganism. For all these things were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to them both; though the Jewish Priests offered sacrifices to the true God, and the Pagan Priests to idols.\n\nThe Priests of the Israelites were appointed by the Almighty Himself, for the express purpose of offering sacrifices, in the name and on the behalf of the people; they alone were allowed to make oblations and burn incense before the Lord; it was through them that the People were to approach Him, that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> might be acceptable. A very great portion of the Jewish religion consisted in the performance of certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CEREMONIAL\">ceremonial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a>, most of which could only be duly performed by the Priests, or through their mediation and assistance; they were to make intercession and atonement for offenders; they, in short, were the mediators between God and Man.\n\nAnd among the Pagans, whose institutions appear to have been, in great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, corrupt imitations of those of the Patriarchal religion, we find,\n\n---\n\n1 Our word \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIEST\">Priest</a>\" is formed from \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2; which is, translated, an \"Elder,\" in our version of the Bible. But the word which our translators have rendered \"Priest\" is, in the original Greek, \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2, in Latin, SACERDOTUS, and is always applied to a sacrificing minister. And the word is never applied to any one under the Christian dispensation, except Jesus Christ alone, our great and only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">High</a> Priest, who offered up Himself a sacrifice for man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a>.\n\nNow we may be sure that, if the Apostles had ordained any one to the office of a sacerdotal priest, or had designed that there should be such in the christian Church, there would have been mention made of it in the Book of Acts, and in the Apostolic Epistles.\n\nWhenever the title of priest [\u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2] is applied to any Christians, it is applied to all Christians (Rev. v. 10, and 1 Pet. ii. 9) as offering up themselves to God.\nin like manner, Priests, who were principally, if not exclusively, the offerers of sacrifices, in behalf of the State and of individuals,\u2014intercessors, supplicating and making atonement for others,\u2014mediators, as before, between Man and the object of his worship.\n\nThe office of priest, then, in that sense of the word which we are now considering, viz., as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2, being such as has been described, it follows that in our religion, the only Priest, in that sense, is Jesus Christ Himself; to whom consequently, and to whom alone, under the Gospel, the title is applied by the inspired Writers. He alone has offered up an atoning sacrifice for us, even the sacrifice of his own blood; He \"ever liveth to make intercession for us;\" He is the \"one Mediator between God and man;\" \"through Him we have access to the Father; and no man cometh unto the Father, but by Him.\"\n\nAs for the Ministers whom He, and his Apostles, and their successors, appointed, they are completely distinct from Priests in the former sense, in office, as well as in name. Of this office one principal part is, that it belongs to them (not exclusively indeed, but principally and especially) to preach the Gospel,\u2014to instruct, exhort, admonish, and spiritually govern, Christ's flock. His command was to \"go and teach all nations;\"\u2014to \"preach the Gospel to every creature;\" and these Christian Ministers are called in the Epistle to the Hebrews, \"those that bear rule over them, and watch for their souls, as they that must give an account.\" Now it is worthy of remark, that the office we are at present speaking of made no part of the especial duties of a Priest, in the other sense, such as those of the Jews, and of the Pagans. Among the former, it was not so much the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AARON\">Aaron</a>, as the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of Levi, that seem to have been set aside for the purpose of teaching the Law; and even to these it was so far from being in any degree confined, that persons of any tribe might teach publicly in the synagogues on the Sabbath-day; as was done by our Lord Himself, who was of the tribe of Judah, and Paul, of the tribe of Benjamin, without any objection being raised; whereas an intrusion into the Priest's office would have been vehemently resented.\n\nAnd as for the Pagan Priests, their business was rather to conceal, than to explain, the mysteries of their religion;\u2014to keep the people in darkness, than to enlighten them. Accordingly the moral improvement of the people, among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> seems to have been considered as the proper care of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a>; whose laws and system of public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> generally had this object in view. To these and to the public disputations of philosophers, but not at all to the Priests of their religion, they appear to have looked for instruction in their duty.\n\nThat the Christian Ministry, on the contrary, was appointed in great measure, if not principally, for the purpose of giving religious instruction and admonition, is clearly proved both by the practice of the Apostles themselves, and by Paul's directions to Timothy and to Titus.\n\nAnother, and that a peculiar and exclusive office of the Christian Ministers, is, the administration of the Sacraments of Baptism and of the Lord's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">Supper</a>. But this administration does not at all assimilate the Christian Priesthood to the Pagan, or the Jewish. The former of these rites is, in the first place, an admission into the visible Church; and therefore very suitably received at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of those whose especial business is to instruct and examine those who are candidates for baptism, as adults, or who have been baptised in their infancy; and in the second place, it is an admission to a participation in the gifts of the Spirit, which constitute the Church \"the temple of the Holy Ghost.\" The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>, as it were, of divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> is then thrown open, to which we may resort when a sufficient maturity of years enables us to understand our wants, and we are inclined to apply for their relief. It is not, let it be observed, through the mediation of an earthly Priest that we are admitted to offer our supplications before God's mercy-seat; we are authorised, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of this sacred rite, to appear as it were in his presence ourselves; needing no intercessor with the Father, but his Son Jesus Christ, both God and man. \"Having therefore,\" says Paul, \"boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, and having an High Priest over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of God, let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts\nsprinkled from an evil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>, and our bodies washed with pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WATER\">water</a>.\"\n\nThe Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, again, is not, as the Romanists unwarrantably pretend, a fresh sacrifice, but manifestly a celebration of the one already made. And the rite seems plainly to have been ordained for the express purpose (among others) of fixing our minds on the great and single oblation of Himself, made by the only High Priest \"once for all;\" that great High Priest who has no earthly successor. And all the communicants are alike partakers, spiritually, of the Body and Blood of Christ (i.e. of His Spirit), of which these are the emblems), provided they themselves are in a sanctified and right frame of mind. It is on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> holiness of the Communicant, not of the Minister, that the efficacy of the sacrament depends; he, so far from offering any sacrifice himself, refers them to the sacrifice already made by another.\n\nSuch being, then, the respective offices of these two Orders of men (both now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called in English, \"Priests,\" but originally distinguished by the names of Hiericus and Presbyteros), we may assert that the word in question is ambiguous; denoting, when thus applied to both, two things essentially distinct. It is not merely a comprehensive term, embracing two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> under one class, but rather an equivocal term, applied, in different senses, to two things of different classes. At least, it must be admitted, that what is most essential to each respectively, is wanting in the other. The essential characteristic of the Jewish Priests, was (not their being ministers of religion; for that, in a certain sense, all the Levites were, but) their offering sacrifices, and making atonement and intercession for the people; whereas, of the Christian Minister, the especial office is religious instruction, and the administration of rites altogether different in their nature from the offering of sacrifices; totally precluding the idea of his being himself the mediator between God and Man.\n\nAnd the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> in this point, between the christian religion on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and all that exist, or ever existed, besides it (including the Jewish), on the other, will afford, if we rightly consider when, and by whom, our faith was introduced, one of the most powerful evidences of its truth.\n\nThe Apostles, though attentive to the regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the churches they founded, ordaining, for various services, Elders, and other Ministers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>, (the latter being known by the title of \"Widows,\") yet appointed no order of Priests in the sense of Hiericus (familiar as they must have been with the name), answering to the sacrificing Priests of the Jewish and of the Pagan religions. The same observation will apply to the Temple. The term was familiar to the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> writers; but it is never once applied by them to a christian place of worship; always to the worshippers themselves collectively;\u2014to the christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a>; as e.g. \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of the Holy Ghost, which dwelleth in you?\" \"Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost.\" \"Ye, as lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, are builded together into an holy temple,\" &c.\n\nAll this is indeed perfectly intelligible to anyone who understands the character of our religion. It is perfectly consistent with the Gospel scheme; but it is utterly at variance with the notions which would naturally have occurred to the unassisted mind of Man.\n\nA further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this, if further could be needed, is furnished by the changes which were introduced in after ages. The very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> which Christianity in its pure state had abrogated, was grafted into it, as it became corrupted with human devices. An order of Priests in the ancient sense, offering pretended sacrifices, on a pretended altar, in behalf of the People, was introduced into the christian scheme, in such utter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> both to the spirit, and the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> of it, that they were driven to declare the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and wine of the Eucharist miraculously changed into literal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> and blood offered up day by day repeatedly: although the founders of our religion had not only proclaimed the perfection of the one oblation of our Lord by Himself, but had even proved the imperfection of the Levitical sacrifices, from the very circumstance of their being repeated \"year by year continually;\" inasmuch as they would have ceased\" (says the Apostle) \"to be offered,\" if, like the sacrifice of Christ, \"once for all,\" they could \"have made\nthe comers thereunto perfect.\" Now, if when the religion had actually been established without Altar, without Sacrifice, without Priest on earth, all these were introduced into it, in opposition to its manifest character, through the strong craving (if we may so speak) of \"the natural man\" after them; how much more might we expect\u2014with what complete certainty\u2014that men brought up Jews, and having never seen or heard of any religion, true or false, without Priests, would have instituted, had they been left to themselves, an order of sacrificing Priests in their new religion? And how certain, that, since they carefully abstained from this and provided against it in the terms they employed;\u2014how certain\u2014that they were not left to themselves, but proceeded under the guidance of a divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a>!\n\nThe corruptions then subsequently introduced into Christian churches, in respect of the Priesthood, do in reality, by shewing what the tendency of human nature is, go to prove the superhuman origin of the original institution. These have, however, afforded ground for cavil against Christianity itself, to those who, ignorantly or designedly, confound the religion itself with this perversion of it.\n\nThe Greek and Romish, and some other Churches have, in fact, in some great degree, transformed the Presbyteros, the Priest of the Gospel Dispensation, into the Hiericus, or Levitical Priest: thus derogating from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the ONE great High Priest, and altering some of the most characteristic features of his religion, into something more like Judaism or Paganism than Christianity.\n\nTo enter into the detail of this perversion, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to a discussion not only too long for our present purpose, but which in fact must have been forestalled by any one who is at all acquainted with the abuses formerly prevailing among us.\n\nBefore the Reformation of our Church, the Priest professed, like the Jewish, to offer sacrifice (the sacrifice of the Mass) to propitiate God towards himself and his congregation: the efficacy of that sacrifice was made to depend on sincerity and rectitude of intention, not in the Communicants themselves, but in the Priest; he assuming the character of a mediator and intercessor, prayed not with but for the people, in a tongue unknown to them, and in an inaudible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>; the whole style and character of the Service being evidently far different from what the Apostle must have intended, in commanding us to \"pray for one another.\" The Priest undertook to reconcile transgressors with the Almighty, by prescribing penances, to be performed by them, in order to obtain his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTION\">absolution</a>; and, profanely copying our only High Priest, pretended to transfer to them his own merits, or those of the Saints. He, like a Pagan, rather than a Jewish, Priest, kept hidden from the people the volume of their faith, that they might, with ignorant reverence, submit to the dominion of error, instead of being \"made free by the truth,\" which he was expressly commissioned to make known; thus hiding the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> under a bushel,\" which was designed to \"be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> to lighten the nations.\"\n\nIn short, whoever will minutely examine, with this view, the errors of our unreformed Church, will find that a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and important portion of them may be comprehended under this one general censure, that they destroyed the true character of the Christian Priesthood, substituting for it, in great measure, what cannot be called a Priesthood, except in a different sense of the word. These errors, in short, go far towards changing the office of Presbyteros into that of Hiericus.\n\nThere is another point in which superstitions, very much like those of the Pagans, have corrupted the worship of many Christians. We had occasion to remark, in an earlier part of this Dissertation, that many of the Pagan gods were deceased Men, whom they had deified on account of some supposed extraordinary excellence of character, and eminent services to mankind, or to their countrymen.\n\nSome of these they worshipped as gods; others under the title of demi-gods, or heroes. Any man whom his countrymen had been accustomed to venerate very highly in his lifetime, they naturally first wished, and then hoped, and lastly believed, might be elevated after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> to such an exalted state as to enable him to hear them, and to do them services, either by himself, or by making applications on their behalf to some superior god. And just as persons in humble life generally\napply to a king or other great man, not directly, but through his ministers and other attendants, so, a large portion of the Pagan worship was addressed to some whom they accounted inferior gods.\n\nBut, moreover, they supposed each of these inferior deities to have a special regard for his own country. Thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROMULUS\">Romulus</a> (Quirinus) was the tutelar god of Rome, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THESEUS\">Theseus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, &c. And even private families had gods of their own, who among the Romans were called \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LARES\">Lares</a>,\" and \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PENATES\">Penates</a>.\" And the superior gods also were supposed to have partialities for particular regions or races. Thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a> [Pallas] was tutelar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a> of Athens; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIANA\">Diana</a> [Artemis] of Ephesus; and Juno, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARGOS\">Argos</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAMOS\">Samos</a>, &c. The power also of many of their gods was supposed to be limited to particular places, or to particular offices. Thus, we find the Syrians fancying that the God of Israel was the God of the hills (1 Kings xx. 23), and would not be able to succour his People on the plains. And <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASTOR\">Castor</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLLUX\">Pollux</a> were supposed to protect sailors, &c.\n\nAnd moreover, there were certain images and temples, which were supposed to have a superior sanctity above other images and temples of the same god. And again, some particular temples were resorted to by those who had need of some particular kind of service. Thus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">oracles</a> were supposed to be given by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>, not in every one of his temples, but only in those at Delos, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELPHI\">Delphi</a>, and some others. And it was the like with respect to various other benefits sought for from several of the gods.\n\nSuch, then, being the natural tendency of mankind, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was that many Christians, though they did not introduce into the christian Religion the worship of the very same gods which were worshipped by their pagan forefathers, yet fell into the same kind of superstitions.\n\nTheir deep reverence for the Blessed Virgin, and for the Apostles and other eminent Christians, led them to hope, and then to believe, that these persons were able after their departure from Earth, to hear any one who called on them, and to make prayers of intercession for them. And the evil of this practice of invoking departed Saints, was,\u2014and still is, to many Christians\u2014disguised by their overlooking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between asking the prayers of the living and of the departed. No doubt many persons entreated (as Simon the Sorcerer did, Acts viii.) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> or other Apostles to pray for them. And James expressly exhorts Christians to pray for one another (Jas. i. 16). No Christian need scruple to ask any one whom he considers to be a pious and worthy man to pray for him. But when it came to be believed that a holy person, when removed from the Earth, can hear the addresses of thousands and millions of his votaries calling on him in all parts of the world, and know the secret dispositions of mind in each several person that invokes him, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> did in fact deify him.\n\nWhatever subtle explanations may be attempted of the way in which glorified \"saints\" are able to hear, from various regions, and to repeat, more prayers in the day than there are minutes in the twenty-four hours, it is plain that at least the great mass of their worshippers must regard them no less as gods than the ancient pagans did the Beings they worshipped.\n\nThe consequence was, that the chief part of the worship which is due to the \"Jealous God\" came to be paid to the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, and those other \"Saints\" (amounting to several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>), who were, from time to time, enrolled on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a>.\n\nAnd thus did Christians introduce into their Religion, under new names, almost every one of the ancient pagan superstitions just above noticed. They knelt before images and pictures of the saint they invoked. They attributed peculiar holiness to some particular image, or chapel, above others dedicated to the same saint. They had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> saints (answering to the tutelar gods of the Pagans) presiding over particular nations, or classes, or persons. One saint, again, was supposed to be peculiarly powerful in procuring some particular kind of relief or benefit; and another, in another kind. In short, we have only to look back to what has been just said of the Pagan worship, and we shall see how closely it corresponds in every point (besides many more which might have been added) with the worship which has been, in some Churches, introduced into Christianity.\n\nAnd, on the other hand, if we look to the Scriptures, we shall plainly see that it is not thence that the invocation of Saints could have been de-\nrived. They not only contain nothing to warrant it, but they seem framed purposely to guard all who are sincerely desirous of following Scripture, against this very corruption. Though we find in the Book of Acts narratives of the death (Acts vii., xii.) of the two martyrs, Stephen, and James the Apostle, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of John, there is no mention of their being invoked after death. And when God <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> fit to convey his commands to Cornelius, and again to Paul (Acts x., xxvii.) by a created Being, it is not either of these blessed martyrs, but an Angel, that is sent.\n\nThe Virgin Mary, again, is hardly so much as named throughout the Acts\u00b9 and Apostolic Epistles. Now this silence respecting her is utterly inconceivable, supposing it had been the practice of the early Christians to pray to her. In the Gospels, again, she is but rarely mentioned.\n\nEven John, her adopted son, though in all likelihood he must have long outlived her, does not record her death, nor give any particulars of her life; and yet he wrote, as is universally believed, purposely to supply the omissions of the other Evangelists. And it is remarkable that we gather from him incidentally, and only incidentally, that Mary had usually resided with Jesus, who, at his death, committed her to the care of the beloved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">Disciple</a>; and \"from that time he took her to his home.\" Why this sparing and unfrequent mention of her whom \"all generations should call blessed,\" and who must have been personally so well known to many of the most eminent disciples?\n\nHumanly speaking, this seems to us impossible. We are left,\u2014we are driven, to suppose that the divine Spirit which guided the sacred Writers, led them, whether consciously or unconsciously, to suppress what they would naturally have recorded, in order to guard against that superstitious veneration for the Virgin Mary, to which, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> shews, there is naturally so strong a tendency in the minds of Christians. And the few passages which do allude to her, furnish a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of the soundness of this conclusion. They are chiefly such as are calculated, and apparently designed, to repress superstitious veneration. One of them records that, when the mother and other kindred of our Lord were announced as desiring to speak with Him, He took occasion to point out that these had no claim, on that ground, to especial reverence; He turned to his disciples, and said, \"Behold my mother and my brethren!\" Upon another occasion, when a woman exclaimed\u2014\"Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps that Thou has sucked!\"\u2014He replied, \"Yea, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it.\" One of those who did so, was, we may be sure, his mother herself; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> circumstance of her being his mother, did not, as He declares, imply a blessedness equal to that of the humblest of his faithful hearers. Does not the record of these allusions to one of whom so little is recorded, seem expressly designed to guard against that superstitious error to which the tendency is so natural, and, as experience has shewn, so strong?\n\nOnce more, it is mentioned in the narrative contained in the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of St John's Gospel, that the mother of Jesus was invited, as well as himself, and his disciples, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>-feast at Cana. She seems to have been apprised of his design to perform the miracle; for she applied to him when the wine was deficient. His answer has not that roughness, indeed, which our English translation gives it, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the term \"woman.\" The word in the original is one which denotes no disrespect; being found in the classical Greek writers applied even to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>. But He plainly forbids her interference, telling her that the time is not yet come for the display of his miraculous power. Now, why is her application to him, and his reply,\u2014why is even her presence on this occasion at all,\u2014mentioned in this place? Evidently, for the purpose of shewing that he would do no miracle at her bidding; that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> reverence did not extend to his admitting her interference in anything connected with his ministry. It is a warning to all who will be warned by Scripture, that they must not be led by their veneration for the mother of Jesus, to look for her intercession for them with her Son. \"There is one mediator\n\n\u00b9 Once very slightly, in Acts i.\nbetween God and Man,\" Jesus Christ\u2014between Him and Man\u2014none. He is himself ever at hand; and if any man will seek to do his will, \"He will come unto him, and make his abode in him by his Spirit.\"\n\nAny one, therefore, who carefully follows the teaching of the Evangelists and Apostles, will be preserved from such errors as we have been speaking of. But it was the disposition of \"the Natural Man\" that originally led the Pagans to corrupt the Religion revealed to the earliest generations, and to \"worship the creature more than the Creator.\" And that very same disposition has led many of those Christians who neglect the guidance of Scripture, to introduce like corruptions into Christianity.\n\nIII. In addition to these sources of corruption, the tendency already mentioned to introduce philosophical speculations into Christianity has shewn itself again and again under various forms, in all ages of the Church, and has given rise to a multitude of heresies.\n\nPhilosophy is not at all opposed to true Religion, as long as men confine their speculations to matters which properly come within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Reason.\u00b9\n\nBut in what relates to Divine Revelations, Reason should be confined to these two points:\u2014\n\n1st, To judge of the grounds on which any professed revelation should be received or rejected, as being \"from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">Heaven</a>, or of men;\" and, 2dly, To determine what it is that we are enabled and required to learn from the Revelation which God has actually given.\n\nThe restless spirit of philosophising, however, was not easy to be subdued, or to be confined within these limits. Even during the times of the Apostles, and still more, after their departure, many philosophers, on embracing Christianity, transgressed their proper limits, and sought to exercise their ingenuity on that subject\u2014one of so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> and importance\u2014in order to maintain their superiority over the vulgar, even in the knowledge of divine mysteries. They acknowledged, for the most part, that the christian revelation had made known things pertaining to God, which could not otherwise have been known: but these things they seem to have regarded as fresh materials for human reason to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> upon; and when the illumination from heaven\u2014the rays of revelation\u2014failed to shed full light on the Gospel dispensation, they brought to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a>-plate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a> of human philosophy.\u00b2\n\nAccordingly, we find in very early times, curious questions raised concerning the incarnation, and the nature and person of the Lord Jesus. One system so ancient as to be alluded to by John in his Epistle, represented Jesus Christ as not really \"come in the flesh,\" but as a man in appearance only. Other systems made Jesus to have been born a mere human being, on whom, at his baptism, a certain emanation (which they called Christ) from the divine fulness, descended and dwelt in Him. And endless were the questions raised, and the different hypotheses set up, as to the manner in which the divine nature was united with the human in Jesus Christ; whether He was properly to be called one person, or two; whether the Virgin Mary were properly to be styled the Mother of God; whether Christ should be regarded as of one substance, or of like substance with the Father; whether the Deity suffered at the crucifixion; in what way the sacrifice of Christ was accepted as a satisfaction for sin; why this sacrifice was necessary; besides (in later times) an infinite number of equally subtle speculations as to the nature of the Trinity,\u2014the divine decrees,\u2014and, in short, everything pertaining to the intrinsic nature of the Supreme Being, and the explanation of all his designs and proceedings. And yet the motions of the earth, and the circulation of the blood, were not discovered till many ages after. The cause of the vital warmth in animals, philosophers are not\n\n\u00b9 It is remarked by Locke, that those who are for laying aside the use of Reason in matters pertaining to Revelation, resemble one who should put out his eyes in order to make use of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>.\n\n\u00b2 Some persons have been so much struck with the resemblance between some of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>'s speculations, and those of certain ancient Theologians, respecting the Trinity, as even to imagine that he must have received some revelation from Heaven! But instead of concluding that Plato had imparted to him by inspiration knowledge beyond what was communicated to the Apostles\u2014or at least beyond what they were commissioned to teach\u2014we ought rather to infer that those Theologians had corrupted the simplicity of the Gospel by mixing up with it Plato's philosophy.\neven yet agreed on; nor is it decided whether light, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>, are substances, or qualities of bodies. But as to the substance of the Supreme Being, and of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, many men were (and are still) confident in their opinions, and dogmatical in maintaining them; the more, inasmuch as in these subjects they could not be refuted by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to experiment.\n\nAll these various systems of philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a> were discussed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> containing technical terms more numerous than those of almost any science; some of them taken from the sacred Writers (we may say, in every sense of the phrase, \"taken from them,\" since hardly any theologian confined himself to their use of the terms), and others not found in Scripture, but framed for each occasion. These were introduced professedly for the purpose of putting down heresies as they arose. That they did not effect this object, we know by experience; which, indeed, would lead us to conclude, that heresies were by this means rather multiplied. We are inclined to think, that if all Christians had always studied the Scriptures carefully and honestly, and relied on these more than on their own philosophical systems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, the Incarnation, for instance, and the Trinity, would never have been doubted, nor ever named. And this at least is certain, that as scientific theories and technical phraseology gained ground, party animosity raged the more violently. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> of the several systems did not, like the ancient heathen philosophers, carry on a calm and friendly dispute, but (to the disgrace of the Christian name) reviled, and (when opportunity offered) persecuted each other, with the utmost bitterness. For each of them having not only placed the essence of Christianity in faith, but the essence of faith in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, and strict adherence to his own use of the technical terms of his theology, was led hence to condemn all departures from his system, as involving both blasphemy against God, and danger to the souls of men. And they employed, accordingly, that violence in the cause of what they believed to be divine truth, which Jesus Himself and his Apostles expressly forbade in the cause of what they knew to be divine truth. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> of the Lord,\" says Paul, \"must not strive, but be gentle unto all men, in meekness instructing them that oppose themselves, if God, peradventure, will give them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REPENTANCE\">repentance</a>, to the acknowledging of the truth.\" (2 Tim. ii. 24, 25.) But those who lose sight of the real character and design of the Christian revelation, generally lose also the mild, patient, and forbearing spirit of the Gospel.\n\nThere is no one of the numberless systems we have alluded to that has not been opposed, and strongly condemned, by the advocates of some different one; but they have not usually been condemned on what appears to us to be the right ground.\n\nThe proper objection to the various philosophical systems of religion,\u2014the different hypotheses or theories that have been introduced to explain the Christian Dispensation,\u2014is, not the difficulties that have been urged (often with good reason) against each separately; but the fault that belongs to all of them equally. It is not that the Arian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the incarnation, for instance, is wrong for this reason, and the Nestorian for that, and the Eutychian for another, and so on; but they are all wrong alike, because they are theories, relative to matters on which it is vain, and absurd, and irreverent, to attempt forming any philosophical theories whatever.\n\nAnd the same, we think, may be said of the various schemes (devised either by those Divines called the Schoolmen, or by others) on which it has been attempted, from time to time, to explain other religious mysteries also in the divine nature and dispensations. We would object, for instance, to the Pelagian theory, and to the Calvinistic theory, and the Arminian theory, and others, not for reasons peculiar to each one, but for such as apply in common to all.\n\nPhilosophical divines are continually prone to forget that the subjects on which they speculate, are, confessedly, and by their own account, beyond the reach of the human faculties. This is no reason, indeed, against our believing anything clearly revealed in Scripture; but it is a reason against going beyond Scripture with metaphysical speculations of our own. One out of the many evils resulting from this, is, that they thus lay open Christianity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a> objections, such as it would otherwise have been safe from. It is too late, when objections are alleged from the diffi-\nculties involved in some theory, to reply, that the whole subject is mysterious and above reason, and cannot be satisfactorily explained to our imperfect faculties. The objector may answer, \"Then you should have left it in the original mysterious indistinctness of the Scriptures. Your own explanations of the doctrines of your Scriptures you must not be suffered to make use of as far as they are admitted, and then, when they are opposed, to shelter them from attack, as sacred mysteries. If we enter on the field of philosophical argument, we cannot be allowed afterwards to shrink back from fair discussion on philosophical principles.\"\n\nIt is wiser and safer, as well as more pious and humble, and more agreeable to Christian truth, to confess, that, of the mysteries which have been so boldly discussed by many who acknowledge them to be unfathomable, we know nothing beyond the faint and indistinct revelations of Scripture; and that if it had been possible, and proper, and designed, that we should know more of such matters, more would have been there revealed.\n\nAnd we should rather point out to objectors that what is revealed, is practical, and not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a>\u2014that what the Scriptures are concerned with is, not the philosophy of the Human Mind in itself, nor yet the philosophy of the Divine Nature in itself, but (that which is properly Religion) the relation and connection of the two Beings;\u2014what God is to us,\u2014what He has done and will do for us,\u2014and what we are to be and to do, in regard to Him.\n\nHow great must be the errors arising from men's overlooking, or not carefully attending to, this circumstance, it is hardly necessary to point out. The rustic, who persists in maintaining that the sun itself actually moves, because he sees it rise and set, i.e. sees that it is in different positions relatively to himself; and the child, who, while he is sailing in a ship, fancies that the land flies from him, or advances towards him; are not more completely mistaken in their notions, than those theologians who reason upon the accounts which the Scriptures give us of the Deity, as if these were intended to explain to us what He is, absolutely, in Himself, and not merely what He is in relation to ourselves.\n\nAnd the liability to error is greatly increased by this circumstance; that even the relations in which God stands to his creatures are so imperfectly comprehensible by our understandings, that it is necessary to explain them by analogical language, and by the use of such types and comparisons, as may furnish to our minds a kind of picture or image of heavenly things, whose correspondence with the original cannot of course be in all points complete; any more than a picture can, in all respects, resemble the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> body which it is designed to imitate. If, therefore, we extend the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> further than was intended, and conclude, that the things which are represented as corresponding in some points, must needs correspond throughout,\u2014or if, again, we conclude, that the things must be alike, because they are analogous, and bear similar relations to something else,\u2014we shall fall into the grossest absurdities; such as we often see in children, when they interpret literally the analogical explanations which are given them.\n\nIf any one will be at the pains to collect instances for himself, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> of his own infancy, and from what he has observed in other children, of the mistakes which are in this way continually committed by every child, and will carefully reflect on these, not as a mere source of amusement, but with a view to his own instruction, they will serve as a mirror to shew what sort of mistakes he himself also has to guard against, in the notions he forms respecting the Almighty.\n\nTo take one out of innumerable instances; how many there are who speak and reason concerning the glory of God (that being a phrase which occurs in Scripture), as if they supposed, that the desire of glory did literally influence the divine Mind, and as if God could really covet the admiration of his creatures: not considering that the only intention of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> is to signify merely, that God's works are contrived in the same admirable manner, as if He had had this object in view: and that we are bound to pay Him the same reverent homage, and zealous obedience, as if He were really and literally capable of being glorified by us. And yet it is chiefly from a literal interpretation of this phrase of \"the glory of God\" that some Divines have undertaken to explain the whole system of divine\nProvidence, and to establish some very revolting and somewhat dangerous conclusions.\n\nThe difference between Religious knowledge properly so called, and what may be more properly styled theological Philosophy, may be thus illustrated. Different theories, we know, have prevailed at different times, to account for the motions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, and other heavenly bodies,\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>, and various other subjects pertaining to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural philosophy</a>. Several of these theories, which supplanted one another, have now become obsolete; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> discoveries have established, on good grounds, explanations of most of these points. But the great mass of mankind cannot be expected to understand these explanations. There are, however, many points of daily practical use, which they can understand, and which it is needful for them to be informed upon. Accordingly, there are printed Tables, showing the times of the sun's rising and setting at each period of the year,\u2014the appearances of the moon,\u2014the times of eclipses,\u2014the variations of the tides, in different places, and the like. And all these are sufficiently intelligible, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, even to plain unlearned men. The practical knowledge thus conveyed involves no astronomical theory, but may be equally reconciled with the Ptolemaic or the Copernican systems of the universe. It is not the less possible, nor the less useful, for any one to know the times when the sun gives light to this earth, even though he should not know whether it is the sun that moves, or the earth.\n\nNow it is just such practical knowledge as this that the Scriptures give us of the christian Dispensation. They afford practical directions, but no theory. But there is this important difference between the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. The human faculties could, and at length did, (though it is beyond the great mass of mankind,) discover the true theory of the appearances and motions of the heavenly bodies. In matters pertaining to divine Revelation, on the contrary, though there must actually be a true theory, (since there must be reasons, and those known to God Himself, even if hidden from every creature, why He proceeded in this way rather than in that,) this theory never can be known to us; because the whole subject is so far above the human powers, that we must have remained, but for Revelation, in the darkest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> concerning it. Many curious and valuable truths has the world discovered by philosophy, (or as our translators express it \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>;\" but \"the world\" (says Paul) \"by wisdom knew not God:\" of which assertion the writings of the ancient heathen philosophers, now extant, afford sufficient proofs.\n\nAnd, we would further remark, that if it had been possible and allowable for us to follow up by metaphysical researches, the view opened to us by Revelation, and thus to enlarge our knowledge of God's dealings with Man, Paul (as well as the other Apostles) would not have censured, but favoured, such researches, and would have set us the example of so speculating. And if he had done this, even in those discourses of his which are not recorded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, we may be sure that his Gospel would not have been considered as \"foolishness\" by the Greeks, even those of them who did not fully agree with him. This, therefore, supplies a useful practical rule in judging of anything we may read or hear: whenever we meet with such a representation of Christianity as would not have been a stumbling-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> to the Jews, or such as would not have been foolishness to the Greeks, we may at once conclude that this cannot be the Gospel which Paul preached. For he would not have been opposed as he was, had his doctrine favoured either men's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and worldly ambition, or their spirit of presumptuous speculation.\n\nIt may be remarked, as another reason for condemning such presumptuous explanations, and metaphysical theories of Christianity, as we have alluded to,\u2014all of them equally,\u2014that if such speculations be allowed, it is evident Christianity must be, not one, but two religions;\u2014that for the few profound theologians, and that for ordinary men; such as the humble shepherds to whom the holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">Angels</a> announced the birth of Jesus,\u2014the fishermen and publicans who associated with Him,\u2014and \"the common people\" who (we read) \"heard Him gladly.\" Now there is nothing more characteristic of the Gospel Dispensation than its oneness;\u2014one Lord,\u2014one faith,\u2014one hope,\u2014in short, one and the same religion proposed to all who will heartily receive it.\nAll such speculations, then, we should reject, if we would (in the words of the Apostle Peter) \"desire, as new born babes, the sincere (\u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u1f72\u03c2, un-adulterated) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> of the Word, that we may grow thereby.\" If we would learn the very gospel which the Apostles taught, just as it was received by their hearers, we must in heart and spirit accompany the simple shepherds in their visit \"to Bethlehem, to see\" (not what human philosophy has devised, but) \"what the LORD hath made known to us.\"\n\nIV. Many corruptions, again, of Christianity have been either introduced, or favoured and kept up, by moral corruption in the members of christian Churches. For it belongs to the true Gospel to purify and also to elevate the moral character. Hence, there is a complete and constant opposition between genuine Christianity and all the evil and base propensities of man's nature. This is what Paul means when he says, \"Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh; for the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would:\" that is, he who has within him two contrary tendencies, cannot at the same time yield to both.\n\nEvery kind of depravity or moral defect, therefore, predisposes men either to reject Christianity altogether, or else to introduce, or to accept, some erroneous views of it. And there is no kind of religious corruption against which men are usually less on their guard. They are well aware, indeed, that there is a danger of men's falling into sin in violation of the precepts of religion. And they are not ignorant that a religion which is altogether false may have a bad moral effect on the worshippers. But they consider that a man who has embraced a true Faith, and who is of a religious disposition, will necessarily be made, by his religion, a good moral man; or at least such a man as will be accepted as righteous by the God he worships.\n\nNow, this is true, only if we suppose him to observe diligently the caution of Paul, \"that they who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works.\" (Tit. ii. 14, and iii. 8;) \"giving all diligence,\" (2 Pet. i. 5) (as Peter exhorts us), to add to his faith, virtue, &c. But if he takes no vigilant pains in the improvement of his moral character, the result will be, that, instead of his religion improving his character, his moral deficiencies, on the contrary, will tend to corrupt his religion. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> itself, which falls pure from the heavens, will not continue pure if it be received in an unclean vessel.\n\nAnd this kind of corruption took place\u2014as has been above said\u2014even in the days of Paul; who speaks of some, \"who having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> away a good conscience, concerning [the] Faith, have made shipwreck.\" (1 Tim. i. 19.)\n\nIt will be sufficient to mention some of the principal errors of this class, that have crept into the Church, without entering into a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of any of them.\n\n1st, The notion that a Priest has power to forgive sins as against God is evidently a doctrine very acceptable to such persons as have a sense of religion, combined with a great dislike to the practice of christian virtue; and who, accordingly, are glad of any contrivance for being religious without virtue.\n\n2dly, The same may be said of the doctrine, that fasting and other penances,\u2014or pilgrimages to certain holy places,\u2014or prayers and sacrifices offered up in behalf of the deceased,\u2014or rich gifts bestowed on the Church, can atone for sin, and help to obtain for a man <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a>.\n\n3dly, Of a like nature is the doctrine, that if a man who has led a thoroughly unchristian life shall on his deathbed receive the Lord's Supper, or the rite of \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTREME\">Extreme</a> Unction,\" professing sorrow for his sins, and faith in Christ, we are au-\n\n---\n\n1 \u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u1fb3 \u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c8\u03b5\u03bd, \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bc\u1f74 \u1f02\u03bd \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u1ff6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f22 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u1ff6\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd. Gal. v. 17. More exactly translated\u2014\"these are so opposed to each other as to be an obstacle to your doing what ye desire to do.\"\n\nBy the expressions which are rendered \"flesh,\" and \"fleshly lusts,\" and \"a carnal mind, which is enmity against God,\" Paul does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> merely sensual excess, but all evil dispositions of the natural man. For he expressly charges the Corinthians with being \"carnal\" on account of their \"strifes and divisions.\"\n\n2 It is very remarkable that in all religions either devised by men, or corrupted by human inventions, there is a tendency to set aside certain particular reasons, or particular persons, for what is called \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a>,\"\u2014that is, self-torture, as a kind of set-off against the toleration of general licentiousness at other times, or in other persons.\nthorised to pronounce, that (supposing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a> to be, at the moment, sincere) his salvation is certain.\n\nNow, the utmost that Scripture can warrant, in such a case is, that we are not forbidden to hope. But the Scripture-promises are all made to those who \"bring forth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> meet for repentance.\" And any one who presumes to hold out confident promises where Scripture does not, is evidently guilty of preaching, not the true Gospel, but one of man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>.\n\n4thly, The heresy of the ancient Gnostic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANTINOMIANS\">Antinomians</a> has been already alluded to, as being held in such detestation by the Apostles. And some Antinomian doctrines much like theirs have been found in every Age of the Church.\n\nFor example, That because \"by grace we are saved through faith, and that not of ourselves, but by the gift of God,\" (Eph. ii. 8,) and \"without the works of the Law,\" therefore, we may safely \"continue in sin that grace may abound,\" (Rom. vi. 7;) that certain persons may know and feel themselves set apart as \"God's People,\" and that these are certain of salvation, though continuing in the practice of known sins, because God will not impute sin to them, do what they will; and that they ought not to be at all uneasy at any sins they may commit, because He purposely suffers \"his own people to fall into very grievous sins, in order to show them their own weakness, and to humble them!\" though in reality such a doctrine is calculated to puff up a man with spiritual pride, in addition to all his other vices; since nothing is more flattering to a proud heart than the notion of being privileged to do without censure, or without danger, what others would be condemned for.\n\nAll these shocking absurdities, so utterly at variance with Scripture, have found their way into Christianity through the depravity of Man. And when we consider, that besides the mischief done by such teachers to their own followers, they bring a scandal on Christianity itself, we cannot wonder at the abhorrence shown by the Apostles, of the Antinomians of their own day. They raised a prejudice against the Religion, as being far worse than no religion at all; because the doctrine they taught tends to silence the suggestions and the reproaches of natural science, and represents God as the encourager of vice.\n\n5thly, Besides these avowed Antinomian doctrines, there are others which are liable to be so understood as to lead practically to the same consequences; though these consequences are not designed or foreseen by those who incautiously teach such doctrines. For example, there are some good, well-meaning men who represent Paul as describing, in his Epistle to the Romans, (chap. vii. 9-25,) his own actual condition. If they would read the whole chapter through, (especially <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> 9,) and then go on to the eighth chapter, they would see that this is impossible; and that the Apostle is evidently describing the condition of a man under the Law, and not under the Gospel \u2014 sensible of the requirements of God's Law, but not under the influence of the Grace of the Gospel.\n\nNow, any man who is living a life of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> vice, while he approves and admires virtue, will not be likely to be at all alarmed, or to consider moral reformation as needful, or indeed as possible, if he believes himself to be just in the same condition with the Apostle Paul, and all the other most eminent Christians that ever existed. And he will be likely to regard all that is said in Scripture about holiness of life, as a kind of theory which no one is expected to bring into practice.\n\nAgain, the doctrine that \"nothing a man can do can forward his own salvation,\" is indeed true, in the sense that no good works of ours can establish a claim of merit in God's sight; and also in this sense, that we cannot lead a life of true christian virtue, of ourselves, and without the aid of the Holy Spirit, which \"helpeth our infirmities.\" But if the doctrine is earnestly and continually taught without these explanations, the greater part of the hearers will understand it in a sense exactly opposed to Paul's exhortation, to \"work out our own salvation with fear and trembling;\" and they will also conclude, that if to keep God's commandments cannot further a man's salvation, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> them cannot hinder his salvation. At least, the Christian is not incited to endeavour to \"grow in grace,\" and to \"go on unto perfection.\" And thus the doctrine becomes, in its consequences, completely Antinomian.\nready to consent to anything for the sake of peace and unity.\n\n(2.) And thus they are led to commit the second of those mistakes above adverted to, and to resist all correction of abuses, for fear of unsettling men's minds, disturbing the peace of the Church, and violating its Unity.\n\nAnd this is especially the case when men have adopted that view of Christian Unity which represents it as consisting in having one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> on earth, to which all Christians belong, or ought to belong, and to whose government all are bound to submit.\n\nIt is true, the same kind of feeling may influence the members of any Church, even one which does not claim to be \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> church.\" For men are undoubtedly bound to be very careful not to \"cause divisions\" hastily, or on slight grounds. Whatever christian Church they find themselves belonging to, they are bound to give no occasion of any schism\u2014any unfriendly separation from it, unless they are fully convinced on deliberate reflection that its doctrines or practices are at variance, in essential points, with Scripture, and that there is no reasonable hope of reform. But, on the other hand, if the rulers of any Church, force a part of its members to separate from it, by maintaining what is really thus unscriptural, (and of this the All-Wise God alone can be the infallible judge,) the guilt of the schism lies with those rulers.\n\nThe questions, however, what is or is not Scriptural? and what points are essential? are to be very carefully and candidly considered, under a sense of awful responsibility to God; and are questions on which different men often come to different conclusions.\n\nAnd hence, while some are guilty of hastily causing divisions on wrong grounds, or on insufficient grounds, (as if each man were free to consult his own fancy or convenience in such matters,) others sometimes fall into the opposite extreme. For there are persons who will bring themselves to acquiesce in something which they perceive to be fundamentally wrong, for fear of being guilty of causing a schism.\n\nNow this latter fault, men are much more liable to, who consider \"the true Church\" to be, necessarily, one community under a single government on earth. For all Christ's promises being made to his Church, they feel that a separation from that community which they regard as the Catholic Church, would be to renounce the Gospel Covenant. And thence they are led to infer, either that Christ allows this Church to depart in important points from the written Word, or else that what plainly appear to be departures from it, are somehow reconcilable with it. They would, perhaps, be glad if the governors of their Church could be prevailed on to remedy such and such an abuse. But if these resolve, in compliance with the wish of the majority, to retain it, such persons consider that they have only to submit, rather than forfeit (as they imagine) all their Christian hopes at once. To oppose or question the decisions of the Church which they regard as the divinely-appointed Authority and Guide for all Christians in whatever pertains to religion, they consider as a rebellion against Christ. And thus they in time force themselves to believe their Church infallible\u2014to assent to and uphold the grossest corruptions\u2014and to resist all attempts at correction.\n\nThis mistake as to the nature of christian unity is one which could hardly arise in the days of the Apostles. For they manifestly founded many distinct Churches, agreeing indeed in Faith, but quite independent of each other, and having no common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HEAD\">Head</a> on Earth. And the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">Bishops</a> which they appointed for the government of most (if not all) of these Churches, differed as much from the Bishops of later times, as a Sovereign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> does from a colonial governor. Each was the Head <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESBYTER\">Presbyter</a>, to whom was intrusted the chief power in an entire Church.\n\nIt was indeed allowable and desirable that delegates from these several Churches should assemble, from time to time, to hold a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a>, (or, as it is called in political affairs, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONGRESS\">Congress</a>,) for the purpose of conferring together on religious questions, and concerting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> for putting down false doctrines and abuses. This did not necessarily destroy the independence of the Churches; any more than Sovereign-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">States</a> surrender their independence when they send ambassadors to a Congress to deliberate concerning a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a>. But ambitious men, when they obtained a majority in any of these Councils, naturally encouraged the\nnotion that the minority were bound to submit to their decisions, whether they would or no. This, so far, tended to combine all these Churches into one. And when the chief part of the Roman Empire became Christian, the Emperors always sought to favour this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>, in order that they might the more easily and the more completely control it.\n\nAnd that this worldly policy of theirs had a principal share in the uniting of the several distinct christian communities into one, is plain from the circumstance that it was not Jerusalem\u2014the earliest christian Church, and from which all others were off-sets\u2014but Rome, the political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">Capital</a> of the Empire, that came to be regarded as the seat of government, and centre of the Universal Church.\n\nThere is not, indeed, any rule laid down by divine authority, as to what is to be the greatest extent of a single Church. It cannot, therefore, be said that there is in Scripture any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> prohibition of Christians all over the world uniting themselves into one single community. But the example left us by the Apostles, in founding many distinct Churches, independent of that of Jerusalem, and of each other, shews that they did not consider a very extensive Church, as either a necessary or a desirable thing. And the inconvenience is so manifest and so great, of placing under one Church-government men of different nations, far distant from each other, and differing in language and in customs, that we may be sure no such thing would ever have been thought of, except either for reasons of worldly policy, or else from a misconception of the character of Christ's kingdom. The ruler of a great empire, containing many provinces, may naturally wish that all his subjects should be members of the same Church; and the supreme rulers of any Church are likely to be tempted by ambition to extend that Church as widely as possible. Those, again, who make the mistake above alluded to, respecting the true meaning of christian-unity, will readily enter into these views. And some will be likely to fancy that the governors of a single Church comprehending all Christians, will be likely to prevent such errors as might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> up in some out of a multitude of independent Churches, and thus preserve the purity of Gospel truth. But this is to suppose that the governors of the universal Church are to be infallible. Else, it is plain that they may fall into error as easily as the governors of a smaller Church, and may employ their extensive power in maintaining and spreading such error. And, accordingly, all who contend for a Universal Church, in the sense of a single community under one government on earth, always lay claim,\u2014more or less distinctly,\u2014to infallibility as belonging to that Church.\n\nBut as no such infallibility can be proved, or does exist, the result has been that all attempts to give universal dominion to a single Church have increased the difficulty of checking and of correcting corruptions.\n\nFor example\u2014one great abuse, and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> of many others, the keeping of the Scriptures and of the public Service in a dead language, was doubtless much favoured by the great extent of a single Church. The abuse was not one that originated in very early times. For it was not caused by men's having from the first a superstitious dread of any attempt to translate the Scriptures at all, and consequently leaving them in the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> and Greek. On the contrary, they were translated into Latin, when that was the prevailing language, on purpose that they might be accessible to the people. And afterwards, when Latin gradually ceased to be spoken in the Provinces, and at length, in Rome itself, the Latin Bible and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRAYER\">Prayer</a>-Books continued in use after they had ceased to be understood by the mass of the people. No one could point out the precise time when a new translation first became necessary; because the change of Latin into Italian, Spanish, &c., was gradual. And men had a sort of superstitious veneration for the language which they and their fathers had been accustomed to hear employed in divine Service.\n\nAnd this is evidently an error which it served the purpose of an ambitious Church to keep up. All over the world, as far as the dominion of that\n\n---\n\n1 Not only were there several distinct Churches in the one province of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MACEDONIA\">Macedonia</a>, and in that of Achala, but the one Epistle to the Galatians is addressed to \"the Churches\" of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GALATIA\">Galatia</a>.\n\n2 The enforcement of celibacy on the clergy, (for which there is no warrant in Scripture,) was also manifestly favourable to the ambitions views of a supreme central government, as it tended to keep the clergy unconnected with the people.\nto dictate to the understanding, and to domineer over the conscience, of all the rest. For, whatever strong reasons a man may see for condemning any corruptions which that Church may have sanctioned, he will labour to stifle his convictions, and to believe any absurdity, or approve of any abuse, rather than exclude himself, as he supposes, from the true Church. So also, a mistake as to the true limits of Church-authority is one which tends to foster other mistakes. If a Church assumes the right of setting aside the precepts of Scripture, or of giving any interpretations whatever of them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> its own views, or of \"making the Word of God of none effect through their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>,\" a man will be led to submit to all this against his better judgment, if he is persuaded that he is only submitting to the authority which Christ has appointed for his guidance in all that pertains to religion.\n\nAnd lastly, the prevalence of this error leads to the neglect of the study of the Scriptures, and even to their being left untranslated, and inaccessible to the People. For as no one need study medical books, himself, if he is placed under the care of a skilful physician, so there seems no need for any one to study Scripture, if he has others to do it for him, whose interpretations, after all, he is bound to receive, and who are ready to tell him what he is to believe and do.\n\nAnd thus general ignorance will soon prevail; which is the greatest encourager and supporter of every kind of error and abuse. For when the light of the Gospel which was given for the illumination of the World, is thus \"put under a bushel,\" men are thenceforward left to grope in darkness, without any means of distinguishing truth from falsehood, or genuine Religion from the grossest superstitions.\n\n---\n\n**REFORMATIONS IN RELIGION.**\n\nWe have seen that corruptions of Christianity have existed, from the days of the Apostles, downwards; and that these inspired teachers warned men to be on their guard against this danger. They exhort us to \"take heed to ourselves,\" on account of \"deceitful teachers,\" and to \"prove all things, and hold fast that which is right.\" Christians, then, are evidently bound to be carefully watchful against any corruption of the \"simplicity of the Gospel.\" And whenever they shall find that any unscriptural doctrines or practices have crept in, it is their duty to exert themselves for the correction of the evil. And, accordingly, it appears that almost every one of the corruptions which have prevailed in christian Churches, was opposed, more or less, at its first introduction. Yet, on the whole, this opposition was, for many centuries, so far ineffectual, that the religion of the greater part of the christian world degenerated more and more from its original purity.\n\nIt is not our design to give an account of the various attempts made (with or without success) to resist the introduction of corruptions, or to drive them out. It will be sufficient to point out:\n\nI. What are the principal hindrances that have stood in the way of a successful opposition to errors and abuses, and of needful reformations.\u00b9\n\nII. What are the faults that reformers are chiefly liable to, and against which, consequently, men ought to be especially on their guard.\n\n[I.] There are three mistakes frequently committed by Christians, each of which has contributed to prevent successful opposition to corruption, and correction of them.\n\n\u00b9 In modern language one sometimes hears of \"reforming abuses.\" But this is an impropriety. It is an institution that is reformed: abuses are to be remedied.\n(1.) Some have attached too much importance to matters not essential, and have contended too earnestly about them.\n\n(2.) Others\u2014and sometimes, indeed, even the very same persons\u2014have acquiesced in very serious corruptions, through a mistaken anxiety for what they consider Christian Unity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCORD\">concord</a>.\n\n(3.) A third cause, tending to the same effects, is a mistaken dread o innovations. Those who are on their guard only against sudden corruptions, and overlook such as creep in silently and gradually, will be disposed to resist as innovations what are, in truth, restorations; and to maintain what are, in reality, very great and mischievous innovations.\n\n(1.) When men are once engaged in a contest on any question, their eagerness is apt to increase as the debate goes on; and they often come to regard some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> that is really of very small consequence, as if it were of the greatest. Thus, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is often drawn off from things far more important. For example, there have been fierce controversies among Christians about the proper time for celebrating the festival of Easter. And this is one of the many cases in which the attempt to unite all Christians under the government of one single community on earth, has led to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCORD\">discord</a> instead of concord. For, it is necessary that in any one Church, the times for celebrating religious festivals, should be fixed by authority; however unimportant it may be what shall be the time fixed. But two or more independent Churches may differ in this, and in several other non-essential points, without hostility and strife. Such questions, however, immediately become a source of strife, as soon as it is thought necessary to unite these Churches into one. And the same may be said of that most bitter dissension which arose between the Eastern and Western Churches as to the use of leavened or unleavened bread at the Lord's Supper. And at the very time when these controversies about such comparatively insignificant points were raging with the utmost fury, the unscriptural practice of applying to the Virgin and other saints as mediators, (besides many other superstitions,) was spreading widely among Christians.\n\nSo also, in later times, and even in our own day, there have been vehement debates on the question, whether a clergyman should preach in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> dress or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> one. And the attention of many persons has thus been called off from the far more important question as to the soundness of the doctrine preached. While occupied about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of a vestment, they have overlooked the serious corruptions of the faith introduced by such as were \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\"\n\nAnd, again, the schism of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DONATISTS\">Donatists</a>, which gave rise to one of the most furious contentions that ever existed among Christians, originated merely in a question as to the regularity of the appointment of a certain bishop. These persons having taken up that notion respecting \"apostolic succession\" which has been noticed in a former part of this Dissertation, they would not allow that the ministers ordained by the bishop whose succession they disputed, were ordained at all; or that any whom these baptized were really Christians, &c. And while this fierce contest lasted, which was nearly two centuries, (from the fourth to the sixth,) men's attention was drawn off by it from essential points; and various corruptions were allowed to spread, unchecked and unnoticed. Moreover, one effect of such contests is, that many men are apt to become, at length, so weary of strife, as to be ready to purchase peace at any price, and to acquiesce in various abuses and errors in important points, rather than run the risk of exciting any controversy.\n\nNow we ought certainly to prefer peace and christian concord to everything except the essentials of Gospel-truth and pure worship. But these must not be given up even for the sake of peace.\n\nFor, religious agreement is not that christian concord which it is so important to aim at, unless it be agreement in the genuine Religion of the Gospel. There may be an agreement in error as well as in truth.\n\nBut, vehement and long-continued disputes about matters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> importance which are not worth so much contention, will often drive men into the opposite extreme, and make them\n\n---\n\n1 C\u00e6cilian, elected Bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>, 311.\nAgain, some teach that Christ's obedience to the divine law is imputed to believers in Him; so that the good works He performed are reckoned in God's sight as performed by them. This doctrine, though not warranted by Scripture, is taught by some who are themselves striving to lead a virtuous life. But their hearers will be likely to conclude, \"if Christ's suffering for us and in our stead, is to exempt us from suffering in our own persons, then, by parity of reasoning, his performing in our stead good works which are imputed to us, as if we had performed them, must exempt us from all need of keeping God's commandments ourselves.\" And though this may not be an inevitable conclusion, and explanations may be given which will avoid it, still, we may be sure that there will be a danger of men's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> such an inference. And for this danger those teachers will be responsible who set forth a doctrine not clearly taught in Scripture.\n\nAnd some there are who dwell exclusively on the efficacy of faith; teaching (which is quite true) that genuine christian faith will not fail to bring forth the fruit of a christian life. But if they do not at the same time teach, as our Lord and his Apostles do, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of \"running,\"\u2014\"striving,\"\u2014\"watching,\"\u2014being \"careful,\" (1 Cor. ix. 24; Luke xiii. 24; Mark xiii. 33\u201337,) in their christian course, their hearers will conclude that they have only to take care of their faith, and leave christian virtue to follow of itself. And being once convinced that they have embraced the true faith, they will feel themselves in the condition of a man who has embarked on board a safe ship, bound to the right port, who has nothing to do but sit still, and let himself be carried thither. And the consequence of their thus taking no pains or care in the moral cultivation of their mind, will be, (as has been observed above,) that their religion, instead of improving their moral character, will be itself corrupted by it; and having \"cast away a good conscience, they will make shipwreck of the faith.\" (1 Tim. i. 19.)\n\nThe above are a part, and only a part, of the religious corruptions which have been introduced or fostered by moral corruption.\n\nV. Lastly, worldly policy has greatly helped to promote some of the worst religious errors. The same kind of men who would, most of them, have opposed Christianity, from covetous or ambitious views, when it was first preached, were disposed, afterwards, to distort the religion so as to suit those views.\n\nThus, any worldly men who found their way into the Ministry, were tempted to favour any kind of superstitious error that tended to bring them profit and power. The People were often disposed to fancy that the Priests could serve God in their stead, and that there were mysteries in Religion which the Priests understood, but which the Laity need not know anything of, and ought not to inquire into. And hence they were ready to follow blindly the guidance of the Priests in religious matters; just as a man trusts, in legal concerns, to his Lawyer, and in medical concerns, to his Physician; doing what they direct, and not considering it necessary himself to study Law or Medicine.\n\nAll these, and many other such erroneous notions, have been encouraged by worldly-minded Priests for the increase of their own power and wealth.\n\nAgain, ambitious and worldly-minded Rulers are generally glad to make use of Religion as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> for securing the submission of the People to tyrannical oppression, and for aiding their ambitious views when they seek to subdue their neighbours, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> of propagating the true Faith. Such men are disposed, like the Jews of old, to \"take Jesus by force to make Him a King;\" that is to make his a \"kingdom of this world.\"\n\nSuch men perceive a political advantage in having the same religion professed by all their subjects; and they endeavour to secure this object by force. They make laws for the punish-\n\n---\n\n1 Our Lord seems to be expressly guarding against this notion in the parable of the Marriage-feast. The Wedding garment (which represents the \"righteousness of Christ,\"\u2014that is the moral character which his Spirit enables us to attain to) was provided\u2014according to the Oriental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>\u2014by the king. But the guest who had refused to put it on was cast out without being allowed to plead\u2014\"You are clad in the wedding garment; your wearing it may be imputed to me, and may serve instead of my putting it on.\"\nment of heretics: or to exclude from civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> every one who is not a member of their Church; or they seek to compel every one to have his children taught their Faith.\n\nAll these are so many different forms in which the spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSECUTION\">Persecution</a> shows itself, in varying degrees of violence.\n\nNow, it is of course most desirable that all men should agree in true christian faith and practice. But then, this profession of the Religion should be sincere and voluntary. It is utterly contrary to the spirit of Christ's religion to attempt to maintain or to propagate it by force. But it belongs to the \"natural man\" to feel jealousy and dislike of those who differ from us in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> on important points; and, when we fail to convince them, to wish to force them to submission; or at least to keep for ourselves what is called a \"political ascendancy\" over them. And those who have a zeal for what they consider true religion, but who are strangers to the genuine spirit of the Gospel, persuade themselves that they are seeking God's glory and the good of mankind, in carrying out their own intolerant principles. Since Governments, they say, ought to seek the good,\u2014universally,\u2014of the subjects, and true religion is the greatest good, it must be the duty of the Civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">Magistrate</a> to insist on his subjects adhering to a true religion.\n\nBut they overlook two circumstances: 1st, that since the Magistrate must, by this rule, be himself the judge what religion is true, it would follow that the Jewish Rulers had a right to forbid the Apostles to preach the Gospel; and that the Apostles were bound to obey; and, 2dly, that though the sincere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCEPTANCE\">acceptance</a> of true religion be the greatest good, an outward profession, in obedience to the laws, of what a man does not really believe, is no good at all, but a great evil.\n\nYet all this is overlooked by those who \"have a zeal towards God, but not according to knowledge\" of the true Gospel.\n\nIn addition, however, to mistaken religious zeal, there can be no doubt that men's minds are often biased towards this particular corruption of Christianity, by worldly policy. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of power and worldly pre-eminence helps to give their turn to their religious zeal. And thus they so far mistake the real character of Christianity, as to imagine it allowable, and even a sacred duty, to put down religious errors by force, or to secure a monopoly of civil rights in behalf of the members of their own Church.\n\nThe above, then, are the chief sources from which corruptions of Christianity have sprung. And they correspond to those from which, as we have seen, originated the chief part of the early opposition to the religion, viz.: mistaken adherence to the Mosaic Law; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>; misapplied philosophy; moral depravity; and worldly policy.\n\nAs for the means by which various religious errors have been kept up and spread, one of the principal is that employment of coercion which has been just noticed. As a general rule, a resort to restrictions, and to force of every kind, must be, on the whole, more favourable to error than to truth, in all subjects: because it tends to take away the great advantage which truth has over error. Truth being in itself stronger than falsehood, may be expected to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> a superiority when there is free discussion. But Laws and Penalties may be on the wrong side as well as on the right. Those, therefore, who resort to these, may, not unfairly, be presumed to have themselves, some distrust of the goodness of their cause, since they remove the trial from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COURT\">Court</a> (that of Reason) in which truth has an advantage over falsehood, and appeal to brute-force, in which truth has no such advantage. A fair and free trial is what, generally speaking, the intelligent advocates of truth, in all subjects, will be likely to call for, and the advocates of error, to deprecate. Moreover, in regard to religious questions, the resort to coercion proves a person to have totally mistaken the character of Christianity as to one most important point; so that there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> that he will have mistaken other points also.\n\nThat erroneous view, again, of christian Unity, which has been already noticed, has tended very much to keep up and to extend other errors. For if a man is once convinced that all Christians are bound to belong to some one Community on earth, he will dread nothing so much as separation from that Church, whatever it may be, which he considers as having the best claim to be that one community.\n\nAnd thus, a majority will be enabled completely\nChurch extended, the Priests had a language of their own, not understood by the common people, and in which alone the Sacred Books could be studied. And thus the People could know little or nothing of their Religion, except just what these Priests chose to tell them.\n\nNow it is true, indeed, that the same error might find its way into each of several independent Churches, however small. It is conceivable, for example, that independent Churches in various parts of the world might have retained, some, an ancient Gothic translation of the Bible, some, an Anglo-Saxon, &c., long after those languages had ceased to be spoken. But then it is far less likely that every one of forty or fifty independent Churches should persist in this error, than that one should do so. And if some of those Churches, or even any one of them, had made new translations of the Bible to meet the wants of the People, the others would have been shamed into following their example in a thing so evidently reasonable.\n\nAnd this is proved by what has actually taken place. It is well known that at the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a>'s Reformation, and long before, the translating of the Scriptures into modern languages was most earnestly opposed by those who adhered to the Church of Rome. The Scriptures, which were originally addressed to Christians of all classes, including slaves, were represented as unfit for the perusal of the common people. But since then, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMAN_CATHOLICS\">Roman Catholics</a> have in some measure followed the example of those Churches which they denounce as heretical. They have among them now, (though not in perfectly free circulation,) translations of Scripture into English, French, Italian, and other languages. And some of them have also Prayer-books, with the Latin and their own language printed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> columns, so as to enable them to understand the Service that is going on. There can be little doubt, therefore, that this would have been done long before, if there had been all along numerous independent Churches, such as the Apostles established.\n\nIt is true, indeed, that before the time of that Reformation, and indeed, in a less degree, for a good while after it, the prevailing ignorance was such, that few besides the Clergy could read at all. But then it should be remembered, first, that to have the Church-Service\u2014including the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of the Scriptures\u2014in a language understood by the People, is a most important benefit even to those who cannot themselves read; and, secondly, that this gross ignorance would not have existed if the Clergy had all along done their duty in presenting to the People the Scriptures in their own language, and encouraging them to learn to read, for the very purpose of studying those Scriptures as they ought.\n\nIt is plain, therefore, that the abuse we have been speaking of was left much the longer unremedied in consequence of the dominion of one Church of vast extent.\n\nAnd the same may be said of many other abuses. A reform that is evidently needed, is more likely to be resisted by one community, than by every one of many independent communities. Any one out of several distinct Churches, when it corrects something that is manifestly wrong, sets an example which others are not unlikely to follow. And this advantage is wanting, when all or nearly all Christians are put under one single government.\n\nThe causes above mentioned have proved, in very many instances, great hindrances to needful reforms. Nevertheless, many attempts were made, in the earlier Ages of the Church, to introduce errors and abuses, which were vigorously and often successfully resisted. We have on record many varieties of false doctrine and corrupt worship, (most of them now nearly forgotten.)\n\n---\n\n1 This great and important change completely disproves what is maintained by the advocates, and by the bitterest enemies, of the Church of Rome\u2014the unchangeable character of that Church. But there is nothing so grossly and notoriously false as not to gain credence, if maintained by both of two opposite parties.\n\n2 As for the celebration of Divine Service in Latin, it has ever been made a matter of boast by the Roman Catholics, that in a foreign Country, a priest going thither ignorant of its language, can at once perform Service, as at home; and that a traveller equally ignorant of the country, can attend the Service of his Church, which is the same everywhere; while a member of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> would be at a loss. This is as if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> man should make it a matter of boast that he is not incumbered by the short days of winter, and has no occasion for candles. That day and night are alike to him, would indeed be an advantage, if he could see in both; but not, when the case is that he can see in neither.\nwhich were generally condemned and expelled as heretical.\n\nUnfortunately, indeed, it often happened that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which many of the ancient heresies were opposed, was such as to have the effect of giving rise to fresh heresies. But it was with good reason that the majority of the early Christians\u2014and, indeed, of Christians in all ages\u2014always opposed (though not always wise in their mode of proceeding) every innovation in doctrine. They justly considered, that anything new (in essential points) introduced into Christianity must be wrong.\n\nBut then, they often committed the fault of being on their guard only against sudden corruptions;\u2014against any innovation brought in openly and all at once. They overlooked (as men are apt to do in all subjects) the principle so well laid down by Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, that \"Time is the greatest innovator;\" that it \"introduces changes so silently and gently as to escape notice;\" and that \"since things alter for the worse spontaneously, hence, if they be not altered for the better designedly, there will be no end of the evil.\" To resolve that no changes shall take place, is to talk idly. One might as well forbid the winds to vary, or the tides to flow. But to resolve that no changes shall take place except such as are undesigned and accidental, is to determine that though a clock may gain or lose indefinitely, we will take care that it shall never be regulated.\n\nWhat is called \"the change of the style,\" is a striking instance of a seeming innovation, which was really a restoration, being a return to the right course, by the sudden correction of a great error that had resulted from the accumulation of imperceptibly small ones.\n\nIn religious matters, a remarkable instance of a gradual corruption, and a sudden reform, is the point already noticed,\u2014the keeping of the Scriptures in a language unknown to the People.\n\nThis was a most enormous innovation; since the Sacred Writers manifestly addressed themselves to Christians of all ranks. But it was overlooked, because it was no sudden innovation. The Latin language went out of use gradually. No one can fix the precise day or year on which a fresh translation was first needed. But when men did perceive the need, and translated the Bible into modern languages, this was a great and palpable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>. And, as such, it was vehemently opposed; though, in reality, it was, in spirit, a restoration of the original state of things; the placing of the Scriptures before the People in a language which they understood.\n\nSo, also, there can be no doubt, that the change of christian Ministers into Sacerdotal Priests, making offerings on an altar, and also the custom of invoking saints, and most of the other corruptions already noticed, crept in gradually and insensibly.\n\nThe fond veneration for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of any holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARTYR\">martyr</a> led men to visit his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a>, and to preserve carefully his garments, or other relics, and also images or pictures of him. They naturally prayed to God, with these images before them, for grace to follow the good example of such a holy man. And thence they were gradually led to beg for his intercession, and, in fact, to worship him.\n\nThen, when this had become a long-established corruption, and when men were called on at once to renounce it, and to pray to none but the all-present God, many were startled at the innovation, and resolved to keep to \"the old religion,\" and to worship as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> had done for centuries, rejecting as heretical all new doctrines. For, to them, the observance of the first and second commandments was a novelty; though, in reality, it was only a return to the primitive worship.\n\nAnd so it was, no doubt, with the greater part of the corruptions that crept into Christianity.\n\n---\n\n1 It should be observed that a \"Heretic\" properly signifies a person who maintains some false doctrine condemned by the Church of which he is a member. No Church, therefore, can be, in strictness of speech, heretical, though it may be erroneous. Accordingly, the Church of England, for example, pronounces the Church of Rome to have \"erred;\" but does not apply the term \"heresy\" to its errors, because it acknowledges the Church of Rome to be a distinct, independent Church. The Romanists, on the other hand, pronounce the Church of England \"heretical,\" because they reckon all Christians as members\u2014even though disobedient and rebellious members\u2014of their own Church. Those of them at least who do not, (for there is a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of uncertainty on this point,) cannot maintain that their own Church is Universal [Catholic] in the ordinary sense of the word, namely, as actually comprehending all Christians. They should rather call it \"the Church which seeks to be Universal.\"\n\nDISS. III.\nMen were not sufficiently on their guard against them, because they came in by little and little. And then, when correction was attempted, many resisted it, and would not allow that these were corruptions, because no one could point out the precise time when they arose.\n\nBut if we look to Scripture, and compare with this the doctrine and practices of some christian Churches, it will be plainly seen that their religion has been corrupted; though we may not be able to say exactly when, or by what means.\n\nAnd this is the only safe course of proceeding. For when a book, for instance, is often reprinted, the only way to insure accuracy is to collate carefully each edition with the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>. Sometimes this is neglected, and the second edition is printed from the first, and the third from the second; and so on, down to perhaps twenty or thirty editions. And the result has generally been, that though each edition has but a very few fresh misprints, and differs but very little from the preceding, yet the twentieth or thirtieth edition will be found, when compared with the original, to be excessively incorrect, through the accumulation of a multitude of small errors.\n\nIn like manner, if we would keep our Religion pure, both from new and from old corruptions, we must go straight to the very fountain-head itself, and observe what is or is not agreeable to the inspired Word.\n\n[II.] From the causes, then, which we have been speaking of, the correction of various abuses was so much impeded and so long delayed, that thorough Reformation (or as it might have been more wisely called\u2014a Restoration) became necessary.\n\nBy the \"reformation\" of a Church is generally understood a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> change in doctrine and worship, as distinguished from slight alterations. And we use the word reformation in a corresponding sense, in reference to any other Institution also. It is like the pulling down and rebuilding of a great part of a house, as distinguished from the many small repairs which are made every year by a prudent man, and the occasional small improvements he may see need for. Those repairs and improvements he makes on purpose that he may be saved from the far greater cost and inconvenience of rebuilding, which is an evil in itself, though a necessary evil when timely repairs have been neglected.\n\nSo also, every reformation is an evil, on account of the general disturbance and agitating alarm it tends to produce. But this is a less evil than the utter corruption of Christianity. And there is no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> when errors and abuses have been long suffered to accumulate, and all timely remedies have been obstinately rejected.\n\nBut many persons are led by their dread of the evils and dangers of a reformation, to oppose it as long as possible, and to endeavour to delay it; not considering that the longer it is deferred, the more violent and dangerous it is likely to be.\n\nThe principal dangers to which reformers are liable, may be classed under these two heads\u2014\n\n(1.) They are apt to feel too secure against falling into the faults of the system they are reforming. They often retain several of their former wrong notions; and accordingly commit some of the same errors, in substance, though in some new shape\u2014as those they undertook to remedy.\n\n(2.) And, secondly, they are apt not to be sufficiently on their guard against reactions. In their abhorrence of what is wrong, they have often rejected what is right along with it, and have often rushed from one extreme to the other; not considering that there may be two errors quite opposite to each other, and that men in their eagerness to avoid one fault, will often be blinded to the danger of committing a contrary fault, that is, perhaps, even worse than the first.\n\n(3.) When men feel a very strong abhorrence of any fault in the particular form in which they have been used to see it, they are apt to feel too much self-confidence in reference to that fault; and not to be on their guard against falling into (substantially) the same fault in some other shape.\n\nFor example\u2014the detestation felt by the early Christians for the pagan worship of the images of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> and Juno, and other gods and goddesses, made them feel secure against any danger of idolatry, in a christian Church. And this absence of self-distrust contributed to their falling into similar superstitions under different names, by paying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> to images of Beings whom\nthey do not call gods and goddesses, but male and female Saints.\n\nSo also, in the present case, reformers often retained some of the erroneous principles which had led to the abuses they were correcting; and thus they frequently themselves committed like errors, though in a different shape.\n\nFor example, they were fully convinced that the claims of the Church of Rome to infallibility are unfounded. But many still clung to the notion that infallibility must be lodged somewhere on Earth. They still thought a divine Revelation necessarily implied an unerring guide for the right interpretation of that Revelation.\n\nSome of them, accordingly, fancied that there must be somewhere, though not at Rome, an infallible Universal Church; though they sought in vain to find any person or Body of men having acknowledged power of any kind, over all Christians, and entitled to represent and to dictate to the whole christian World.\n\nAnd there are, even now, not a few persons, members of reformed Churches, who suffer themselves to be mystified by the vague and obscure language of artful leaders, and to be deluded into a belief in the infallibility of a certain Universal Church, consisting of all the \"orthodox,\" that is, all those who agree in opinion with those leaders. And thus they fancy themselves bound to receive as gospel truth whatever they are told by these leaders, whom they regard as most profound theologians. For as muddy water is often supposed to be deep, from one's not being able to see to the bottom of it, while that which is exceedingly clear is thought shallower than it is, so weak men are apt to admire as very profound, in Theology or in Philosophy, what they cannot clearly understand, and to despise as shallow, whatever is made very plainly intelligible.\n\nOthers, again, of those who cling to the notion of an infallible interpreter of Scripture, have concluded that every sincere Christian, or that they themselves, or that certain persons whom they look up to as pre-eminently holy, do possess this unerring guide, in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Whatever is really dictated by that Spirit, they justly concluded must be infallibly right. And they found in Scripture promises of the aid of that Spirit. They inferred, therefore, that whatever occurred to their minds, after having prayed for this spiritual aid, must be the true interpretation of Scripture; which, consequently, all men are bound to acknowledge and submit to.\n\nIt is remarkable that most of the persons who put forth such claims, do not pretend to exemption from Sin, though they hold themselves to be exempt from the possibility of doctrinal error. To suggest a doubt as to the truth of any doctrine they maintain, they regard as questioning the truth of God Himself. But for any man to account himself impeccable, they consider as an impious presumption. And yet the office of the Holy Spirit is to lead us, not only \"into all truth,\" but also into \"all righteousness;\" for \"the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth.\" And though both are highly important, most persons would allow that this latter is the more so. If a man were offered the choice,\u2014supposing he could not have both,\u2014of being completely secured, either from all mistakes in doctrinal points, or from all sin, he would hardly hesitate to acknowledge that the latter would be the more valuable gift. Yet the very same persons who make no claim to unerring rectitude of conduct, and exemption from sin, will hold themselves to have attained unerring rectitude of judgment, and exemption from error; and will regard any doubt on that point as a distrust of God's promises. And yet they are no more promised infallibility than impeccability.\n\nSome, however, there are who seem to think that both in doctrinal questions and in moral questions also, their judgment is infallibly right; and that though, in practice, they are liable to go wrong, this can only be when they offend against the dictates of their own conscience. This is to claim a great superiority over the Apostle Paul, and to reverse his procedure. For he says \"I judge not mine own self; for I know nothing against myself;\" (that is, I am not conscious of any wrong;) \"yet am I not hereby justified: but He that judgeth me is the Lord.\" He therefore did not set up his own conscience as an infallible standard of right and wrong.\n\n1 Cor. iv. 4.\nA circumstance, however, which is still more remarkable, is this; that many of those who thus in reality lay claim to \"inspiration\" and \"infallibility,\" yet carefully keep clear of those words. They do not call themselves inspired or infallible. And yet it is plain that a man who feels quite certain that his interpretations of Scripture are suggested by the very Spirit which dictated that Scripture, is, so far, claiming just as real an inspiration as the Sacred Writers themselves possessed. If he feels quite certain that he is unerringly following an infallible guide, he must in reality regard himself as infallible.\n\nIn this, as in many other cases, men are misled by names. They mistake for two different doctrines what are in reality only two different expressions of the very same.\n\nWhen, however, a large portion of the Christian World which had been under the dominion of a single Church, had thrown off that yoke, the danger of falling into the mistake of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> for an infallible guide on earth was much diminished. For those inclined to such a notion would naturally, as long as they were under one Church, look to that Church as the seat of the infallibility. But when they were separated into several distinct communities, the error tended\u2014if one may so speak\u2014to cure itself.\n\nFor then, several conflicting claims to infallibility were of course put forth, by persons teaching different doctrines, yet who each professed (and doubtless often with truth) to have earnestly prayed for inspiration; and as it was plain that all these claims could not be well-founded, this naturally put men on inquiring whether any of them were so. And then, all sober-minded men perceived that the only proof of inspiration, and that which must necessarily accompany it\u2014the display of miraculous signs\u2014was wanting in all the claimants; and consequently, that no infallible guide on Earth has been provided.\n\nBut the error, though greatly checked, is still to be found among weak-minded enthusiasts, who cannot, or will not think accurately.\n\nIt is kept up in them in great measure, by their confounding together the infallibility of the guide in itself, and our infallibility in following that guide. For instance, if, on the one hand, the mariner steers by a chart, then, even though he conform to it quite exactly, yet if this chart itself be at all incorrect, he may be misled by it. If, on the other hand, he steers by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STAR\">star</a>, he is sure that his guide cannot be wrong; but yet he may be misled if he mistakes one star for another. If, however, he is convinced that this is totally impossible, and that he is infallibly following an infallible guide, it is plain he reckons himself infallible.\n\nAnd even so, though the Scriptures and the Spirit of God cannot themselves err, no one has a right to pronounce confidently that he is exactly conforming to them, unless he is favoured with some sensible miraculous signs from Heaven to assure him of this. Without such a sign, \"if we say that we have no sin\"\u2014or that we have no error\u2014\"we deceive ourselves.\" For even if, in some point, our judgment or our conduct be in point of fact perfectly right, still, as we cannot with perfect certainty know this, during our state of trial on Earth, we have no right confidently to claim it.\n\nAnother wrong principle which has been retained by many reformers, is that of persecution. By the principle of persecution, we mean the notion that it is allowable and right to use <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> coercion in religious matters, or to maintain what is called the political \"ascendancy\" of those who profess the true Faith; so that they should monopolize civil rights and privileges.\n\nThe reason why we speak not of persecution itself, but of the persecuting principle, is, that where this principle is the most thoroughly carried out, there will be no actual persecution. In any country where all who dissented from the Established Faith have been either killed, or banished, or compelled to conform, there is no longer any one to be persecuted. No tree is destroyed by the scorching drought of the African Deserts, or by the intense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> of the Polar regions, because no tree can grow there. And in the most intolerant Countries on the Continent, no heretics are burnt, because there persecution has finished its work.\n\nAnd accordingly all persons agree in professing (and generally, no doubt, with sincerity) to be averse to persecution. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NEBUCHADNEZZAR\">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, who\ncondemned Shadrach, Meshech, and Abednego to the flames, and those Roman Emperors under whom so many Christian Martyrs suffered, wished them rather to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> their lives by worshipping the heathen gods. And it is the same with all, down to this day, who hold the persecuting principle.\n\nNow, that principle was not renounced by most of the earliest Reformers. They complained, indeed, of the persecutions they themselves were exposed to. But this was not from any doubt that heretics ought to be punished, but because they denied that they were heretics. Persecution they considered as consisting in penalties inflicted on those who profess the true Faith, which, of course, they held theirs to be. To put to death such as are really heretics, was, in their view, no persecution.\n\nBy degrees it came to be perceived, that this principle leads to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAR\">war</a> of extermination among all persons of different persuasions. And men began to adopt notions more humane, but not at all consistent either with the Gospel, or in themselves. They considered it as too severe to burn heretics, or even to put them to a less cruel death. But they thought it right to punish them by fine and imprisonment, either for refusing to profess what they did not believe, or for persisting in teaching doctrines which they felt themselves bound to propagate. (See Acts v. 28.)\n\nAnd others, again, went further, and were for inflicting no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> on those who do not hold the true Faith, but only excluding them from the rights of citizens; so as to secure to the \"true believers\" a monopoly of civil power.\n\nBut all these different classes of persons agreed in the erroneous principle which goes to make Christ's, a \"kingdom of this world.\"\n\nMany persons imagine that there is a necessary connection between these views and a belief in the infallibility of a certain Church, and of the impossibility of salvation out of it; as if no one could think it right to persecute for religious error unless he thought himself exempt from all possibility of error; and again, as if every one who does think this, must be a persecutor.\n\nBut this is quite a mistake. For, on the one hand, a man may be confident that his is the only saving Faith, and that his Church is infallible\u2014which was actually the case with the Churches under the immediate care of the inspired Apostles\u2014and yet may be convinced, like those very Apostles, that coercion in religious matters is utterly unchristian.\n\nAnd, on the other hand, a civil Ruler may so far misconceive the true character of the Gospel as to think it right to compel all his subjects to profess what appears to him to be the best religion; yet without thinking his Church or himself infallible in religious matters, any more than he is infallible in secular matters. Now in secular matters no Kings or Senates pretend to infallibility. They make such laws as they deem most expedient, and alter them from time to time as they see cause. But as long as those laws are unrepealed, they consider themselves (and very rightly) authorised to enforce them by penalties. If, then, they regard Religion as coming under the province of the civil Magistrate, they will of course apply the same rule to that also. They will feel themselves bound to take care, not only of the persons and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, but also of the souls of their subjects. They will prescribe what, in their judgment, shall appear to be the best regulations for traffic, and for keeping the peace, &c., and also the best for Religion.\n\nAnd perceiving the convenience of a uniformity of Worship for all their subjects, they will be likely to regard all who do not conform to that which they have established, as enemies of the State; and thence to expel or to degrade them as politically dangerous. And thus, without making any claim to religious infallibility, any more than to general legislative infallibility, they will change Christ's kingdom of Heaven into an earthly kingdom.\n\nIt is, indeed, true that any persons whose notions in morals or in politics are such as to make it impossible that they can be peaceable and loyal citizens, may allowably be excluded, not only from civil rights, but from the right of residing at all in the Country. And if there be absolutely no other way of fixing on such persons, but by their professed religion, it is necessary (as long as such continues to be the case) to submit to the\nvery great evil of making their religion a test to exclude them.\\footnote{See Paley's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Moral Philosophy</a>.}\n\nIf, for example, any one is fully convinced\u2014in opposition to all reason and to all experience\u2014that no Jews can possibly be good subjects, he ought to urge (not that the most unprincipled of them should be bribed by the hope of civil privileges to profess Christianity, but) that none of the Jewish Race should be allowed to reside in the Country.\n\nBut to make the profession of a certain Faith a necessary qualification for civil privileges, on the ground that it is the true Faith, and that the Magistrate is bound to uphold the true Faith, and to make the Church and the State one community, &c.; all this is evidently making Christ's a Kingdom of this World.\n\nGradually, juster views of the true character of that Kingdom prevailed more and more both among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> and Roman Catholics. But even now, these views are far from being universally acknowledged.\n\nTo the instances that have been noticed, others might have been added, of the same class; that is, instances of reformers retaining or reviving some of their former wrong notions, or practices, in some different shape. But what has been now said is sufficient to shew how careful men ought to be not to flatter themselves that when once they have reformed a corrupt system, or renounced a corrupt Church, they are thenceforward safe from like corruptions. If the corruptions are such as have their origin in the nature of Man, and (as is generally the case) are rather the cause of the faulty system, than the effect of it, it is against the infirmities of human nature that we should the most watchfully guard.\n\n(II.) The other class of errors formerly mentioned as likely to be committed by reformers, are those which arise from what we called the tendency to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a>; to \"mistake reverse of wrong for right,\" and thus to rush from one fault into another fault of the contrary extreme.\n\nFor example, many christian doctrines having been corrupted by \"philosophy and vain deceit,\" and mixed up with presumptuous and absurd speculations, the result has been, that some have been led to reject the doctrines themselves as taught in Scripture.\n\nThus, the doctrines of our Lord's divine Nature, and of his Atonement, have been by some reckoned among the early corruptions of Christianity. This was doubtless caused, in a great measure, by men's being disgusted with the rash metaphysical explanations of those doctrines which have been given by some who were accounted profound theologians; and which others, equally rash, have confounded with the doctrines themselves. And some have even gone so far as to represent the Apostles as having mistaken their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a>'s meaning as to these points, or mixed up their own fancies with his revelations; so as to have preached a different Gospel from what He designed, and to have led their followers into idolatry. For, the arrogant pretensions to a perpetual inspiration in the Church, and its consequent infallibility, having been found utterly groundless, a reaction ensued, which led some to deny the inspiration of Paul himself, which he established by the miraculous \"signs of an Apostle.\"\\footnote{The Religion of Mahomet may be reckoned as one of the corruptions of Christianity, and as owing, in some degree, its origin, or at least some part of its wide <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>, to a reaction against opposite corruptions. For the Mahometans, though they account Mahomet a greater prophet than Jesus Christ, yet confess Jesus to be the Christ,\u2014to have been really sent from God,\u2014to have been superior to all who came before Him,\u2014and to have established his claim by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>. And the chief part of the fables which they have mixed up with the Gospel-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, they borrowed from some of the earliest heretics. This religion, in short, is evidently a corrupted offshoot of Christianity. At the time when Mahomet arose, a great part of the Christian world had fallen into saint-worship, and the adoration of pictures in images, and had also corrupted the doctrine of the Trinity into something very nearly approaching to Tri-theism. Against these abuses vehemently protested, dwelling strongly on the Divine Unity, and on the duty of renouncing every kind of idolatry. But the principle of persecution\u2014already admitted by most Christians,\u2014he retained and vigorously carried out. And along with the errors he rejected, he discarded also great part of the fundamentals of Christianity, besides introducing much false doctrine of his own.}\nin the sense in which it was understood for many centuries, and in which the Writers knew it was understood. To call this a Revelation is a manifest contradiction. But what such persons really mean, or really believe, no one can decide. For, by their own shewing, they have so low a moral principle as to think it allowable for a man to teach what he is conscious is false in the sense in which he knows it will be understood; this being the conduct they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> to Writers whom they regard as God's messengers commissioned to instruct mankind.\n\nOthers, again, justly considering Holy Scripture as the only sure foundation of christian doctrine, and perceiving that to set up the authority of Church-tradition as an infallible interpreter of Scripture, might make Scripture say anything whatever, so as to render \"the Word of God of none effect,\"\u2014and perceiving also that to shut out the People from the reading of Scripture is a monstrous abuse,\u2014were led into an opposite extreme. They were for discarding all catechisms, and other human statements of christian doctrine, and depriving every Church of the office of teaching. They were for simply putting the Bible into each person's hands, and leaving him to make out, by his own unassisted study of it, whatever religion he could for himself. They forgot that, of all the books of the New Testament, there is not one that was written for the purpose of making known the christian Religion to those who were quite strangers to it. On the contrary, all those books were evidently written for the use of such as were already Christians, who had been carefully instructed [catechised] (See Luke i. 4.), and examined in the christian Faith.\n\nIt is the office of a Church to teach, and of Scripture to prove. We should study the Sacred Books carefully, as alone possessing divine authority in matters of faith. But we should study them with the best helps we can obtain; and with care not to mistake the character of them, and the purposes for which they were written. In short, we should imitate the Bereans of old, who did not refuse to hear the teachers that came among them, but \"searched the Scriptures daily, to see whether those things were so\" which were taught them, (Acts xvii. 11.)\n\nHuman teaching bears the same relation to Scripture, that what is called \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> currency\" does to the precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BANK\">Bank</a>-notes and Bills of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCHANGE\">Exchange</a>, though of no intrinsic value, are a very convenient circulating medium so long as they really represent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> or silver, and are payable in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a> on the demand of the holder. But if these notes are made a legal tender, and are required to be received in payment, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> of the very government which issues them, and on its bare word, without being convertible into gold and silver, the result is, that those metals soon disappear, and men are cheated of their goods in exchange for worthless bits of paper.\n\nEven so, as long as human teaching is really a representative of Scripture, and Scripture proof is always ready to be given, of whatever is taught, then, and then only, we are secured against the danger of having God's Word superseded by \"doctrines which are commandments of men.\"\n\nThen, again, some men's horror of the doctrine, that good works can claim merit in God's sight, and that pilgrimages to certain supposed holy spots, and various kinds of self-torture, can atone for sins, led them into the Antinomian error of the ancient Gnostics. They taught the doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a> by faith, in such a sense as to contradict the Apostle James, (ii. 17\u201326,) or at least to leave their hearers utterly careless about christian holiness of life.\n\nOther instances might be given of corruptions of christian doctrine, arising in great measure out of a reaction against opposite corruptions.\n\nWith respect to religious ordinances again, the burdensome and often superstitious rites with which christian worship has been in some Churches overlaid, have created such a reaction, that some have even gone so far as to reject the Sacraments distinctly appointed by Christ Himself, and administered according to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> by his Apostles, (1 Cor. xi. 23\u201326.) And the per-\n\n---\n\n1 See Dr West's \"Discourse on Reserve,\" and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> i. on the \"Kingdom of Christ.\"\nversion of the office of christian Ministers by those who have made them Sacerdotal Priests, has driven some into a rejection of a regular christian Ministry altogether.\n\nOthers, again, not going quite so far, have yet thought themselves bound to reject all institutions and ordinances that are not expressly enjoined in Scripture. There had been a manifest abuse of Church-authority in introducing ordinances and customs that are contrary to Scripture; and again, in teaching doctrines that are not contained in Scripture. And this produced a reaction, which led men to confound these two things together, and to deny the power which manifestly belongs to a Church, of making bye-laws respecting matters intrinsically indifferent, and in which Scripture gives no commands.\n\nAnd some reformers seem to have been led by their deep detestation of the corruptions they have protested against, to endeavour to be as unlike as possible to the Church from which they have revolted, even in matters indifferent: altering for the sake of change. They ought to have considered that the presumption is always against a change; that is, since change is not a good in itself, none should be introduced unless it can be shown to be needful, and to be a change for the better.\\(^1\\)\n\nIt is true, we may very rightly alter or reject things, good or harmless in themselves, when they are found to be very liable to abuse, or when they cause unnecessary offence. Thus \"Hezekiah brake in pieces the brazen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a> which Moses had made,\" when he found that the Israelites burned incense before it. And the Apostle Paul, though he decides that there was no harm in eating meats offered to idols, yet forbids the Corinthians to do so, when their eating it would be misapprehended and cause offence. So, also, a statue or picture of Christ, or of any eminent Christian, is not an evil in itself. But when it is found that the vulgar pay adoration to images or pictures, or that others apprehend them to be doing so, then such images should be removed from places of worship, as being a snare to weak brethren.\n\nThis, however, is no exception to the above rule, but an application of it. For in such a case, there is a good reason for the change.\n\nLastly, the usurpation and extravagant claims of a Church have driven some persons to set at nought Church-government altogether, and to overlook entirely the sanction which our Lord Himself gave to christian communities, and the powers which He conferred on them. The erroneous and over-strained notions of Church-unity which have been above noticed as having contributed to maintain corruptions and to hinder reforms, afterwards led to such a violent reaction, that many thought nothing of the guilt of Schism, and seemed even to forget that there was such a thing. And this, in turn, has sometimes produced a contrary reaction. The disgust and alarm caused by those who revolt against all rules, and discard the very notion of a christian community, have driven others to submit to the grossest abuses of Church-authority, for the sake of good order and peace. It is just so, that, in political affairs, also, there is a constant reaction between tyranny and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a>; each in turn tending to produce the other.\n\nMany more instances might be adduced; but what have been noticed are sufficient as specimens, to shew how watchful reformers ought to be against the tendency to reaction\u2014against suffering incautious zeal to hurry them from one extreme into another.\n\nWe shall now proceed to treat somewhat more fully of the questions relating to Church-unity.\n\n\\(^1\\) See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">Preface</a> to the Book of Common Prayer.","sp":512,"ep":544},{"h":"CUDWORTH","t":"Cudworth, one of the eminent men educated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> promoted in the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">Universities</a> during the Puritan rule, was one of the most distinguished of the Latitudinarian or Arminian party who came forth at the Restoration, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> imbibed from their Calvinistic masters, as well as from the writings of antiquity, yet tempered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of their own agitated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; and with a spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> toleration more impartial and mature, though less systematic and professedly comprehensive, than that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDEPENDENTS\">Independents</a>, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> who preached that doctrine.

But there is the more reason to regret (as far as relates to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>) that the larger treatises are still unpublished, because the above volume is not so much an ethical treatise as an introduction to one. Protagoras of old, and Hobbes then alive, having concluded that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and wrong were unreal, because they were not perceived by the senses, and because all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> knowledge consists only in such perception, Cudworth endeavours to refute them, by disproving that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of their premises which forms the last-stated proposition. The mind has many conceptions (\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9) which are not cognizable by the senses; and though they are occasioned by sensible objects, yet could not be formed but by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> superior to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>. The conceptions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and duty he places among them. The distinction of right from wrong is discerned by reason; and as soon as these words are defined, it becomes evident that it would be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> in terms to affirm that any power, human or divine, could change their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; or, in other words, make the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and unjust at the same time. They had existed eternally, in the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which truths can be said to be eternal, in the Eternal Mind; and they were indestructible and unchangeable like that Supreme Intelligence.\n\nWhatever judgment may be formed of this reasoning, it is manifest that it relates merely to the philosophy of the understanding, and does not attempt any explanation of what constitutes the very essence of morality; its relation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a>. That we perceive a distinction between right and wrong as much as between a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, is indeed true; and may possibly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to an explanation of the reason why men should adhere to the one and avoid the other. But it is not that reason. A command or a precept is not a proposition. It cannot be said that either is true or false. Cudworth, as well as many who succeeded him, confounded the mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> by the understanding that right is different from wrong, with the practical authority of these important conceptions, exercised over voluntary actions, in a totally distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>.\n\nThough his life was devoted to the assertion of divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>, and though his philosophy was imbued with the religious spirit of Platonism, yet he had placed Christianity too purely in the love of God and man to be considered as having much regard for those controversies about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> and opinions with which zealots disturb the world. They represented him as having fallen into the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> with Milton and with Clarke; and some of them even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> him with atheism, for no other reason than that he was not afraid to state the atheistic difficulties in their fullest force. As <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> heaps inconsistent accusations on each other, they called him at least \"an Arian, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOCINIAN\">Socinian</a>, or a Deist.\" The courtiers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II., who were delighted with every part of Hobbes but his in-\n\n---\n\n1 A curious account of the history of these MSS. by Dr Kippis, is to be found in the Biographia Britannica, IV. 549.\n2 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, 1731, 8vo.\n3 \"There are many objects of our mind which we can neither see, hear, feel, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and which did never enter into it by any sense; and therefore we can have no sensible pictures or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of them, drawn by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> of that inward limner or painter which borrows all his colours from sense, which we call Fancy: and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we reflect on our own cogitations of these things, we shall sensibly perceive that they are not phantastical, but acromatical: as, for example, justice, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a>, duty and obligation, cognition, opinion, intellect, volition, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, verity, falsity, cause, effect, genus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, nullity, contingency, possibility, impossibility, and innumerable others.\" (Eternal and Immutable Morality, p. 140.)

Hence the poet spoke of \"the philosophic sire and son.\" He was educated at Edinburgh, and he heard the lectures of Reid at Glasgow.

He was appointed to the Professorship on the resignation of Ferguson, not the least distinguished among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> moralists inclined to the Stoical school.\n\nThis office, filled in immediate succession by Ferguson, Stewart, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>, received a lustre from their names, which it owed in no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> to its modest exterior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> its limited advantages; and was rendered by them the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, in the humble, but not obscure, establishments of Scottish literature. The lectures of Mr Stewart, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a century, rendered it famous through every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of reason was allowed to penetrate. Perhaps few men ever lived, who poured into the breasts of youth a more fervid and yet reasonable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>.

He lived to see his disciples\n\n1 Born in 1763; died in 1828.\n2 Burns.\ndistinguished among the lights and ornaments of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>. He had the consolation to be sure that no words of his promoted the growth of an impure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, of an exclusive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, of a malevolent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>. Without derogation from his writings, it may be said that his disciples were among his best works. He, indeed, who may justly be said to have cultivated an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of mind which would otherwise have lain barren, and to have contributed to raise virtuous dispositions where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> growth might have been useless or noxious, is not less a benefactor of mankind, and may indirectly be a larger contributor to knowledge, than the author of great works, or even the discoverer of important truths. The system of conveying scientific instruction to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> audience by lectures, from which the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> have in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> departed, renders his qualities as a lecturer a most important part of his merit in a Scottish university which still adheres to the general method of European education. Probably no modern ever exceeded him in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of eloquence which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> to literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and moral excellence; which neither obscures science by prodigal ornament, nor disturbs the serenity of patient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>; but though it rather calms and soothes the feelings, yet exalts the genius, and insensibly inspires a reasonable enthusiasm for whatever is good and fair.\n\nHe embraced the philosophy of Dr Reid, a patient, modest, and deep thinker, who, in his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> (Enquiry into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> Mind), deserves a commendation more descriptive of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> than that bestowed by Professor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">Cousin</a>\u2014of having made \"a vigorous protest against scepticism on behalf of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>.\" His observations on suggestion, on natural signs, on the connection between what he calls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> and perception, though perhaps occasioned by Berkeley, whose idealism Reid had once adopted, are marked by the genuine spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> observation. As there are too many who seem more wise than they are, so it was the more uncommon fault of Reid to appear less a philosopher than he really was. Indeed his temporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of Berkeleianism is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of an unprejudiced and acute mind. Perhaps no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> ever rose finally above the seductions of that simple and ingenious system, who had not sometimes tried their full effect by surrendering his whole mind to them.\n\nBut it is never with entire impanity that philosophers borrow vague and inappropriate terms from vulgar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. Never did man afford a stronger instance of the danger than Reid, in his two most unfortunate terms, Common Sense and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSTINCT\">Instinct</a>. Common Sense is that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> portion of understanding, possessed by most men, which, as it is nearly always applied to conduct, has acquired an almost exclusively practical\n\n---\n\n1 As an example of Mr Stewart's school may be mentioned Francis Horner, a favourite pupil, and, till his last moment, an affectionate friend. The short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of this excellent person is worthy of serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>, by those more especially, who, in circumstances like his, enter on the slippery path of public affairs. Without the aids of birth or fortune, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> where aristocratical propensities prevail,\u2014by his understanding, industry, pure taste, and useful information,\u2014still more by modest independence, by steadiness and sincerity, joined to moderation,\u2014by the stamp of unbending integrity, and by the conscientious considerateness which breathed through his well-chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>,\u2014he raised himself, at the early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of thirty-six, to a moral authority which, without these qualities, no brilliancy of talents or power of reasoning could have acquired. No eminent speaker in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> owed so much of his success to his moral character. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> was therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> to his audience and to his country. Regret for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> was expressed with touching unanimity from every part of a divided assembly, unused to manifestations of sensibility, abhorrent from theatrical display, and whose tribute on such an occasion derived its peculiar value from their general coldness and sluggishness. The tears of those to whom he was unknown were shed over him; and at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of those by whom he was praised, wept, and honoured, was one, whose commendation would have been more enhanced in the eye of Mr Horner, by his discernment and veracity, than by the signal proof of the concurrence of all orders, as well as parties, which was afforded by the name of Howard.\n\n2 Those who may doubt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> do well to weigh the words of the most competent of judges, who, though candid and even indulgent, was not prodigal of praise. \"It is certainly very rare that a piece so deeply philosophical is wrote with so much spirit, and affords so much entertainment to the reader.

No man, if he had been in search of improper words, could have discovered any more unfit than these two, for denoting that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, or state, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of mind, which compels us to acknowledge certain simple and very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> truths, not being identical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> at the foundation of all reasoning, and to be the necessary ground of all belief.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">Long</a> after the death of Dr Reid, his philosophy was taught at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> by M. Royer Collard, who, on the restoration of free debate, became the most philosophical orator of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, and now fills, with impartiality and dignity, the chair of the Chamber of Deputies. His ingenious and eloquent scholar, Professor Cousin, dissatisfied with what he calls \"the sage and timid\" doctrines of Edinburgh, which he considered as only a vigorous protest, on behalf of common sense, against the scepticism of Hume, sought in Germany for a philosophy of \"such a masculine and brilliant character as might command the attention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and be able to struggle with success on a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, against the genius of the adverse school.\" It may be questioned whether he found in Kant more than the same vigorous protest, under a more systematic form, with an immense nomenclature, and constituting a philosophical edifice of equal symmetry and vastness. The preference of the more boastful system, over a philosophy thus chiefly blamed for its modest pretensions, does not seem to be entirely justified by its permanent authority in the country which gave it birth; where, however powerful its influence still continues to be, its doctrines do not appear to have now many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a>: and, indeed, the accomplished Professor himself rapidly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> through Kantianism, and now appears to rest or to stop at the doctrines of Schelling and Hegel, at a point so high, that it is hard to descry from it any distinction between objects, \u2014even that indispensable distinction between Reality and Illusion. As the works of Reid, and those of Kant, otherwise so different, appear to be simultaneous efforts of the conservative power of philosophy to expel the mortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> of scepticism, so the exertions of M. Royer Collard and M. Cousin, however at variance in metaphysical principles, seem to have been chiefly roused by the desire of delivering Ethics from that fatal taint of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a>, and, indeed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, which that science had received in France from the followers of Condillac, especially Helvetius, St Lambert, and Cabanis. The success of these attempts to render <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">Speculative</a> Philosophy once more popular in the country of Descartes, has already been considerable. The French youth, whose desire of knowledge and love of liberty afford an auspicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> of the succeeding age, have eagerly received doctrines, of which the moral part is so much more agreeable to their liberal spirit, than the selfish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in the stagnation of a corrupt, cruel, and dissolute tyranny.\n\nThese agreeable prospects bring us easily back to our subject; for though the restoration of Speculative Philosophy in the country of Descartes is due to the precise statement and vigorous logic of M. Royer Collard, the modifications introduced by him into the doctrine of Reid coincide with those of Mr Stewart, and would have appeared to agree more exactly, if the forms of the French philosopher had not been more dialectical, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of Mr Stewart had retained less of that oratorical character, which belonged to a justly celebrated speaker. Amidst excellencies of the highest order, his writings, it must be confessed, leave some room for criticism. He took precautions against offence to the feelings of his contemporaries, more anxious and frequent than the impatient searcher for truth may deem necessary.

Paris, 1823.\nception of philosophy itself; he studies perhaps too visibly to avoid whatever might raise up prejudices against it. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> and native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> dictated a superabundant care in softening and excusing his dissent from those who had been his own instructors, or who were the objects of general reverence. Exposed by his station, both to the assaults of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> prejudice, and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> animosities of a country where a few sceptics attacked the slumbering zeal of a Calvinistic people, it would have been wonderful if he had not betrayed more wariness than would have been necessary or becoming in a very different position. The fulness of his literature seduced him too much into multiplied illustrations. Too many of the expedients happily used to allure the young may unnecessarily swell his volumes. Perhaps a successive publication in separate parts made him more voluminous than he would have been if the whole had been at once before his eyes.\n\nA peculiar susceptibility and delicacy of taste produced forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, in themselves extremely beautiful, but of which the habitual use is not easily reconcilable with the condensation desirable in works necessarily so extensive. If, however, it must be owned that the caution incident to his temper, his feelings, his philosophy, and his station, has somewhat lengthened his composition, it is not less true, that some of the same circumstances have contributed towards those peculiar beauties which place him at the head of the most adorned writers on philosophy in our language.\n\nFew writers rise with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> groundwork, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> which require greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a> or embellishment. He gives to narrative, according to the precept of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, by a selection of happy expressions from original writers. Among the secret arts by which he diffuses elegance over his diction, may be remarked the skill which, by deepening or brightening a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> in a secondary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, by opening partial or preparatory glimpses of a thought to be afterwards unfolded, unobservedly heightens the import of a word, and gives it a new meaning, without any offence against old use. It is in this manner that philosophical originality may be reconciled to purity and stability of speech,\u2014that we may avoid new terms, which are the easy resource of the unskilful or the indolent, and often a characteristic mark of writers who love their language too little to feel its peculiar excellencies, or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the art of calling forth its powers.\n\nHe reminds us not unfrequently of the character given by Cicero to one of his contemporaries, \"who expressed refined and abstruse thought in soft and transparent diction.\" His writings are a proof that the mild sentiments have their eloquence as well as the vehement passions. It would be difficult to name works in which so much refined philosophy is joined with so fine a fancy,\u2014so much elegant literature, with such a delicate perception of the distinguishing excellencies of great writers, and with an estimate in general so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> of the services rendered to knowledge by a succession of philosophers. They are pervaded by a philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, which keeps up the ardour of his genius, without disturbing the serenity of his mind,\u2014which is felt in his reverence for knowledge, in the generosity of his praise, and in the tenderness of his censure. It is still more sensible in the general tone with which he relates the successful progress of the human understanding, among many formidable enemies. Those readers are not to be envied who limit their admiration to particular parts, or to excellencies merely literary, without being warmed by the glow of that honest triumph in the advancement of knowledge, and of that assured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> prevalence of truth and justice, which breathe through every page of them, and give the unity and dignity of a moral purpose to the whole of these classical works.\n\nHe has often quoted poetical passages, of which some throw much light on our mental operations. If he sometimes prized the moral common-places of Thomson and the speculative fancy of Akenside more highly than the higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> of their betters, it was not to be wondered at that the metaphysician and the moralist should sometimes prevail over the lover of poetry. His natural sensibility was perhaps occasionally cramped by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> criticism of an unpoetical age; and some of his remarks may be thought to indicate a more constant and exclusive regard\nto diction than is agreeable to the men of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> who have been trained by tremendous events to a passion for daring inventions, and to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> enthusiasm, impatient of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> elegancies and refinement. Many of those beauties which his generous criticism delighted to magnify in the works of his contemporaries, have already faded under the scorching rays of a fiercer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>.\n\nMr Stewart employed more skill in contriving, and more care in concealing, his very important reforms of Reid's doctrines, than others exert to maintain their claims to originality. Had his well-chosen language of \"laws of human thought or belief\" been at first adopted in that school, instead of \"instinct\" and \"common sense,\" it would have escaped much of the reproach (which Dr Reid himself did not merit) of shallowness and popularity. Expressions so exact, employed in the opening, could not have failed to influence the whole system, and to have given it, not only in the general estimation, but in the minds of its framers, a more scientific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>. In those parts of Mr Stewart's speculations in which he most departed from his general principles, he seems sometimes, as it were, to be suddenly driven back by what he unconsciously shrinks from as ungrateful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APOSTASY\">apostasy</a>; and to be desirous of making amends to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, by more harshness, than is otherwise natural to him, towards the writers whom he has insensibly approached. Hence perhaps the unwonted severity of his language towards Tucker and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a>. It is thus at the very time when he largely adopts the Principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">Association</a> in his excellent Essay on the Beautiful,\u00b9 that he treats most rigidly the latter of these writers, to whom, though neither the discoverer nor the sole advocate of that principle, it surely owes the greatest illustration and support.\n\nIn matters of far other importance, causes perhaps somewhat similar may have led to the like mistake. When he absolutely contradicts Dr Reid, by truly stating that \"it is more philosophical to resolve the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> into the association of ideas, than to resolve the association of ideas into habit,\"\u00b2 he, in the sequel of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>,\u00b3 refuses to go farther than to own, that \"the theory of Hartley concerning the origin of our affections, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>, is a most ingenious refinement on the selfish system, and that by means of it the force of many of the common reasonings against that system is eluded;\" though he somewhat inconsistently allows, that \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> principles which, arising from circumstances in which all the situations of mankind must agree, are therefore common to the whole species, at whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of life they may appear, are to be regarded as a part of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, no less than the instinct of suction; in the same manner as the acquired perception of distance, by the eye, is to be ranked among the perceptive powers of man, no less than the original perceptions of the other senses.\"\u2074 In another place also he makes a remark on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> beauty, which might have led him to a more just conclusion respecting the theory of the origin of the affections and the moral sense: \"It is scarcely necessary for me to observe, that, in those instances where association operates in heightening (or he might have said creates) the pleasures we receive from sight, the pleasing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a> continues still to appear, to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a>, simple and uncompounded.\"\u2075 To this remark he might have added, that until all the separate pleasures be melted into one,\u2014as long as any of them are discerned and felt as distinct from each other,\u2014the associations are incomplete, and the qualities which gratify are not called by the name of beauty. In like manner, as has been repeatedly observed, it is only when all the separate feelings, pleasurable and painful, excited by the contemplation of voluntary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, are lost in the general sentiments of ap-\n\n\u00b9 Stewart's Philosophical Essays, part ii. essay i. especially chap. vi.

The theory which thus ascribes the uniform formation of the moral faculty to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> and paramount laws, is not a refinement of the selfish system, nor is it any modification of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>. The partisans of selfishness maintain, that in acts of will the agent must have a view to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> or happiness which he hopes to reap from it. The philosophers who regard the social affections and the moral sentiments as formed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of association, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, contend that these affections and sentiments must work themselves clear from every particle of self-regard, before they deserve the names of benevolence and of conscience. In the actual state of human motives, the two systems are not to be likened, but to be contrasted to each other. It is remarkable that Mr Stewart, who admits the \"question respecting the origin of the affections to be rather curious than important,\" should have held a directly contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> respecting the moral sense; to which these words, in his sense of them, seem to be equally applicable. His meaning in the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> is, that if the affections be acquired, yet they are justly called natural; and if their origin be personal, yet their nature may and does become disinterested. What circumstance distinguishes the former from the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>? With respect to the origin of the affections, it must not be overlooked that his language is somewhat contradictory. For if the theory on that subject from which he dissents were merely \"a refinement on the selfish system,\" its truth or falsehood could not be represented as subordinate, since the controversy would continue to relate to the existence of disinterested motives of human conduct. It may also be observed, that he uniformly represents his opponents as deriving the affections from self-love, which, in its proper sense, is not the source to which they refer even avarice; and which is itself derived from other antecedent principles, some of which are inherent, and some acquired. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of this theory of the rise of the most important feelings of human nature were, as our philosopher supposes, \"to elude objections against the selfish system,\" it would be at best worthless. Its positive merits are several. It affirms the actual disinterestedness of human motives, as strongly as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a> himself. The explanation of the mental law, of which benevolence and conscience are formed habitually, when it is contemplated deeply, impresses on the mind the truth that they not only are but must be disinterested. It confirms, as it were, the testimony of consciousness, by exhibiting to the understanding the means employed to insure the production of disinterestedness. It affords the only effectual answer to the prejudice against the disinterested theory, from the multiplication of ultimate facts and implanted principles, which, under all its other forms, it seems to require. No room is left for this prejudice by a representation of disinterestedness, which ultimately traces its formation to principles almost as simple as those of Hobbes himself. Lastly, every step in just generalization is an advance in philosophy. No one has yet shown, either that man is not actually disinterested, or that he may not have been destined to become so by such a process as has been described:\u2014the cause to which the effects are ascribed is a real agent, which seems adequate to the appearance; and if future observation should be found to require that the theory shall be confined within narrower limits, such a limitation will not destroy its value.\n\nThe acquiescence of Mr Stewart in Dr Reid's general representation of our mental constitu-\n\n---\n\n1 Outlines of Moral Philosophy, p. 93.\n2 Outlines, p. 117. \"This is the most important question that can be stated with respect to the Theory of Morals.\"\n3 In the Philosophy of the Active and Moral Powers of Man (vol. I, p. 164) Mr Stewart has done more manifest injustice to the Hartleian theory, by calling it \"a doctrine fundamentally the same\" with the selfish system, and especially by representing Hartley, who ought to be rather classed with Butler and Hume, as agreeing with Gay, Tucker, and Paley.\ntion, led him to indulge more freely the natural bent of his understanding, by applying it to theories of character and manners, of life and literature, of taste and the arts, more than to the consideration of those more simple principles which rule over human nature under every form. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> work, as he frankly owns, is indeed rather a collection of such theories, pointing toward the common end of throwing light on the structure and functions of the mind, than a systematic treatise, such as might be expected from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of \"Elements.\" It is in essays of this kind that he has most surpassed other cultivators of mental philosophy. His remarks on the effects of casual associations may be quoted as a specimen of the most original and just thoughts, conveyed in the best manner. In this beautiful passage, he proceeds from their power of confusing speculation, to that of disturbing experience and of misleading practice; and ends with their extraordinary effect in bestowing on trivial, and even ludicrous circumstances, some portion of the dignity and sanctity of those sublime principles with which they are associated. The style, at first only clear, afterwards admitting the ornaments of a calm and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> elegance, at last rising to as high a strain as philosophy will endure, and of which all the parts (various as their nature is) are held together by an invisible thread of gentle transition, affords a specimen of adaptation of manner to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which it will be hard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> in any philosophical writer.\n\nAnother very fine remark, which seems to be as original as it is just, may be quoted as a sample of those beauties with which his writings abound. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> coldness and selfishness of mankind may be traced, in a great measure, to a want of attention and a want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>. In the case of those misfortunes which happen to ourselves or our near connections, neither of these powers is necessary to make us acquainted with our situation. But without an uncommon degree of both, it is impossible for any man to comprehend completely the situation of his neighbour, or to have an idea of the greater part of the distress which exists in the world. If we feel more for ourselves than for others, in the former case the facts are more fully before us than they can be in the latter.\"\n\nYet several parts of his writings afford the most satisfactory proof, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> from what is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called metaphysical speculation, arose from no inability to pursue it with signal success. As examples, his observations on General Terms, and on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAUSATION\">Causation</a>, may be appealed to with perfect confidence. In the first two Dissertations of the volume <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the title of Philosophical Essays, he with equal boldness and acuteness grapples with the most extensive and abstruse questions of mental philosophy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out both the sources and the uttermost boundaries of human knowledge with a Verulamean hand. In another part of his writings, he calls what are denominated first principles of experience, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> laws of human belief, or primary elements of human reason,\" which last form of expression has so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> a resemblance to the language of Kant, that it should have protected the latter from the imputation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> jargon.\n\nMr Stewart's excellent volume entitled Outlines of Moral Philosophy, though composed only as a text-book for the use of his hearers, is one of the most decisive proofs that he was perfectly qualified to unite precision with ease, to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> with the utmost clearness, and to write with becoming elegance in a style where the meaning is not overladen by ornaments. This volume contains his properly Ethical Theory, which is much expanded, but not substantially altered, in his Philosophy of the Active and Moral Powers\u2014a work almost posthumous, and composed under circumstances which give it a deeper interest than can be inspired by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> in science. Though, with his usual modesty, he manifests an anxiety to fasten his ethical theory to the kindred speculations of other philosophers of the Intellectual School, especially to those of Cudworth, recently clothed in more modern phraseology by Price, yet he still shows that independence and origin-\n\n---\n\n1 Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, vol.

Edinburgh, 1828.\nalily which all his aversion from parade could not entirely conceal. *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">Right</a>, duty, virtue, moral obligation,* and the like or the opposite forms of expression, represent, according to him, certain thoughts, which arise necessarily and instantaneously in the mind (or in the reason, if we take that word in the large sense in which it denotes all that is not emotive) at the contemplation of actions, and which are utterly incapable of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, consequently of all explanation, and which can be known only by being experienced. These thoughts or ideas, or by whatever other name they may be called, are followed as inexplicably, but as inevitably, by pleasurable and painful emotions, which suggest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of moral beauty; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of human actions distinct from their adherence to or deviation from rectitude, though generally coinciding with it. The question which a reflecting reader will here put is, whether any purpose is served by the introduction of the intermediate mental process between the particular thoughts and the moral emotions. How would the view be darkened or confused, or indeed in any degree changed, by withdrawing that process, or erasing the words which attempt to express it? No advocate of the intellectual origin of the moral faculty has yet stated a case in which a mere operation of reason or judgment, unattended by emotion, could, consistently with the universal opinion of mankind, as it is exhibited by the structure of language, be said to have the nature or to produce the effects of Conscience. Such an example would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to an experimentum crucis on the side of that celebrated theory. The failure to produce it, after long challenge, is at least a presumption against it, nearly approaching to that sort of decisively discriminative experiment. It would be vain to restate what has already been too often repeated, that all the objections to the selfish philosophy turn upon the actual nature, not upon the original source of our principles of action; and that it is by a confusion of these very distinct questions alone that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a> of Hobbes can be made apparently to involve Hartley. Mr Stewart appears, like most other metaphysicians, to have blended the inquiry into the nature of our moral sentiments with that other which only seeks a criterion to distinguish moral from immoral habits of feeling and action; for he considers the appearance of moral sentiment at an early age, before the general tendency of actions could be ascertained, as a decisive objection to the origin of these sentiments in association,\u2014an objection which assumes that, if utility be the criterion of morality, associations with utility must be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> by which the moral sentiments are formed, which no skilful advocate of the theory of association will ever allow. That the main, if not sole object of conscience is to govern our voluntary exertions, is manifest. But how could it perform this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> if it did not impel the will? and how could it have the latter effect as a mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of reason, or indeed in any respect otherwise than as it is made up of emotions, by which alone its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> aim could in any degree be attained? Judgment and reason are therefore preparatory to conscience, not properly a part of it. That the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of reason reduces virtue to be a relative quality, is another instance of the confusion of the two questions in moral theory; for though a fitness to excite approbation may be only a relation of objects to our susceptibility, yet the proposition that all virtuous actions are beneficial, is a proposition as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> as any other within the range of our understanding.\n\nA delicate state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, and an ardent desire to devote himself exclusively to study and composition, induced Mr Stewart, while in the full blaze of his reputation as a lecturer, to retire, in 1810, from the labour of public instruction. This retirement, as he himself describes it, was that of a quiet but active life. Three quarto and two octavo volumes, besides the magnificent Dissertations prefixed to this Encyclopedia, were among its happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>. These Dissertations are, perhaps, the most profusely ornamented of any of his compositions; a peculiarity which must in part have arisen from a principle of taste, which regarded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECORATION\">decoration</a> as more suitable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of philosophy than to philosophy itself. But the memorable instances of Cicero, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>, and still more those of Dryden and Burke, seem to show that there is some natural tendency in the fire of genius to burn more brightly or to blaze more fiercely in\nthe evening than in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of human life. Probably the materials which long experience supplies to the imagination, the boldness with which a more established reputation arms the mind, and the silence of the low but formidable rivals of the higher principles, may concur in producing this unexpected and little observed effect.\n\nIt was in the last years of his life, when suffering under the effects of a severe attack of palsy, with which he had been afflicted in 1822, that Mr Stewart most plentifully reaped the fruits of long virtue and a well-ordered mind. Happily for him, his own cultivation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of every kindly affection had laid up for him a store of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> consolation which none who deserve it ever want, and for the loss of which, nothing beyond the threshold can make amends. The same philosophy which he had cultivated from his youth upward employed his dying hand. Aspirations after higher and brighter scenes of excellence, always blended with his elevated morality, became more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> and deeper as worldly passions died away, and earthly objects vanished from his sight.","sp":410,"ep":418},{"h":"ESTABLISHMENT OF CHRIST'S KINGDOM","t":"When the bodily presence of our Divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a> was withdrawn from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, his Apostles proceeded, according to his directions, to establish \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>,\" over which He had placed them, saying, \"I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me.\"\n\nFor, that Gospel which had been proclaimed by Himself and his disciples, during his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> ministry, was, that \"the kingdom of heaven was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>.\" That kingdom was then only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>. It was not completely begun, till the Apostles, after the outpouring on them of the Holy Spirit, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENTECOST\">Pentecost</a>, founded at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a> the first christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, and baptized into the Name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> about three thousand persons, who were thus enrolled as subjects of that kingdom.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of these in Jerusalem increased rapidly. Other churches were established in Judea, in Galilee, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SAMARIA\">Samaria</a>, and elsewhere. And a few years after, the apostles having learnt by an express <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>\u2014quite contrary to their own expectations\u2014that Gentiles were to be admitted, on equal terms, as subjects of Christ's kingdom, great numbers of churches, consisting chiefly of these, arose in various parts of the world.\n\nAlthough, however, mention is made in Scripture of several of these churches, we have only incidental, slight, and scanty accounts of the way in which the Apostles proceeded in founding them. Very few particulars are given of the regulations established,\u2014of the appointment of the several Orders of Ministers,\u2014of the Divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">Service</a> celebrated,\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a>, in short, of any of the details of matters pertaining to a christian church.\n\nOne reason for this, probably, was, that a Jewish Synagogue, or a collection of Synagogues in the same neighbourhood, became at once a christian Church, as soon as the worshippers, or a considerable portion of them, had embraced the Gospel, and had separated themselves from unbelievers. They had only to make such additions to their public Service, and such alterations, as were required by their reception of the Gospel; leaving everything else as it was. For, the Apostles, we know, acted on the rule of \"becoming all things to all men;\" that is, of complying with men's habits, and avoiding all shock to their feelings, as far as this could be done without any sacrifice of principle, or detriment to the great objects proposed. It is incredible, therefore, especially considering that for several years the only converts were persons frequenting the synagogues,\u2014Jews or devout Gentiles,\u2014that they should have utterly disregarded all the existing and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a>-reverenced Institutions and Offices, which could so easily be accommodated to the New Dispensation.

They did not indeed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt, think themselves bound or authorised, to adhere blindly to existing institutions in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> in which these were at variance with the spirit of the Gospel, or were capable of being changed for the better; and doubtless they introduced from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to time, (and designed that their successors should do the same,) such alterations in the functions of the several officers, and in all regulations respecting other non-essential points, as circumstances of time and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> might require. But we cannot suppose that they aimed at originality for its own sake, or altered for the sake of altering. And the correspondence, accordingly, which has been traced by learned men between the Synagogue and the Church, is no more than what we might antecedently have expected.\n\nThe attempt to effect this conversion of a Jewish synagogue into a christian church, seems always to have been made, in the first instance, in every place where there was an opening for it. Even after the call of the idolatrous Gentiles, it appears plainly to have been the practice of the Apostles Paul and Barnabas, when they came to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> in which there was a synagogue, to go thither first and deliver their sacred message to the Jews, and \"devout (or proselyte) Gentiles;\"\u2014according to their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> (Acts xiii. 16); to the \"men of Israel;\" and those \"that feared God;\"\u2014adding, that \"it was necessary that the word of God should first be preached to them.\"\n\nAnd when they founded a church in any of those cities in which (and such were probably a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> majority) there was no Jewish Synagogue that received the Gospel, it is likely they would still conform in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a>.\n\nNow, Jewish synagogues, and all things pertaining to them, were so familiarly known in the days of our sacred writers, that there was no need to enter into any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> particulars respecting the officers, regulations, and practices of a synagogue.\n\nNevertheless, it seems probable that we should have found in Scripture something more than we do find, of incidental notices of some of these particulars, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> there had not been some especial reason for omitting them.\n\nThe same may be said with respect to the Creeds, Catechisms, and Forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRAYER\">Prayer</a>, and of administering the Sacraments, which were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in the days of the Apostles. We have no record in Scripture of any of these. And yet the more we reflect on the subject, viewing not merely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> probabilities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, but also what has actually occurred in respect of other religions, the more strongly we shall feel that the first founders of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> might naturally have been expected to have transmitted to posterity some, more or less systematic, compositions, such as we have been speaking of.\n\nFor if we look, for instance, to the Koran, we find Mahomet, in the midst of much extraneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, fitted only to gratify the appetite for the marvellous, inserting, however, also, not only a precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the Mahometan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAITH\">Faith</a>, but likewise minute directions concerning Fasts, Prayers, Ablutions,\u2014the amount of Alms,\u2014and all other points of the Mussulman's service of God. The same is represented to be the character of the Hindoo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHASTER\">Shaster</a>, and other Pagan books professing to contain a divine revelation of any system of religion.\n\nAnd that there is nothing in the christian religion, considered in itself, that stands in the way of such a procedure, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> from the number of works of this description which have appeared from the earliest times, (after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>,) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the present;\u2014from the writings entitled the \"Apostles' Creed,\" and the \"Apos-\n\n---\n\n1 A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, it should be observed, is thus afforded, that the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> Books are no forgery of the early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, since these would have been sure to insert what we do find in their own acknowledged writings, and which is altogether wanting in the Sacred Books.\n\nThe same inference may be drawn from a fact which we have already spoken of, the entire absence in the New Testament of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Christians, as applied by themselves to each other. It seems to have been adopted by Christians very early; probably soon after the destruction of Jerusalem; and if the Books of the New Testament had been forged or interpolated by them, at that, or at any subsequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, there can be no doubt we should have found it frequently so employed therein.\ntolical Constitutions,\" &c. (compositions of uncertain authors, and amidst the variety of opinions respecting them, never regarded as Scripture), down to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> Formularies and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONFESSIONS_OF_FAITH\">Confessions of Faith</a>.\n\nNor, again, can it be said that there was anything in the founders of the religion, any more than in the religion itself, which, humanly speaking, should seem likely to preclude them from transmitting to us such compositions. On the contrary, the Apostles were brought up Jews; accustomed, in their earliest notions of religion, to refer to the Books of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>, as containing precise statements of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, and most minute directions as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> worship and ceremonies. So that, to give complete and regular instructions as to the character and the requisitions of the new religion, as it would have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> for any one, was more especially to be expected of these men.\n\nAnd even supposing that the other avocations of the Apostles would not allow any of them leisure for such compositions,\u2014though we know that some of them did find time for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, two of them not a little,\u2014even this supposition does not at all explain the difficulty; for the Acts and two of the Gospels were written by men who were only attendants on the Apostles. Nor would such writings as we are speaking of have required an inspired penman; only one who had access to persons thus gifted. We know with what care the Apostolic Epistles were preserved, first by the churches to which they were respectively sent, and afterwards, by the others also, as soon as they received copies. How comes it, then, that no one of the Elders (Presbyters) of any of these Churches should have written down, and afterwards submitted to the revision of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APOSTLE\">Apostle</a>, that outline of catechetical instruction\u2014that elementary introduction to the christian faith\u2014which they must have received at first from that Apostle's lips, and have afterwards employed in the instruction of their own converts? Why did none of them record any of the prayers, of which they must have heard so many, from an Apostle's mouth, both in the ordinary devotional assemblies, in the administration of the Sacraments, and in the \"laying on of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>,\" by which they themselves had been ordained.\n\nPaul, after having given the most general exhortations to the Corinthians for the preservation of decent regularity in their religious meetings, adds, \"the rest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> I set in order when I come.\" And so, doubtless, he did; and so he must have done, by verbal directions, in all the other churches also: is it not strange then, that these verbal directions should nowhere have been committed to writing?\n\nThis would have seemed a most obvious and effectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of precluding all future disorders and disputes; as also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> up of a compendious statement of christian doctrines, would have seemed a safeguard against the still more important evil of heretical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. Yet if any such statements and formularies had been drawn up, with the sanction, and under the revision of an Apostle, we may be sure they would have been preserved and transmitted to posterity, with the most scrupulous and reverential care. The conclusion therefore seems inevitable, that either no one of the numerous Elders and Catechists ever thought of doing this, or else that they were forbidden by the Apostles to execute any such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>: and each of these alternatives seems alike inexplicable by natural causes.\n\nFor it should be remembered that, when other points are equal, it is much more difficult to explain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> than a positive circumstance in our Scriptures. There is something, suppose, in the New Testament, which the first promulgators of Christianity\u2014considered as mere unsolicited men\u2014were not likely to write; and there is something else which they were, we will suppose, equally unlikely to omit writing; now, these two difficulties are far from equal. For with respect to the former, if we can make out that any one of these men might have been, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> or by circumstances, qualified and induced to undertake the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, the phenomenon is solved. To point out even a single individual able and likely to write it, would account for its being written. But it is not so with respect to the other case, that of omission. Here we have to prove a negative;\u2014to show, not merely that this or that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was likely not to write what we find omitted, but that no one was likely to write it. Suppose we could make out the possibility or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of Paul's having left no Creed, Catechism, or\nCanons, why have we none from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> of Luke, or of Mark? Suppose this also explained, why did not John or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> supply the deficiency? And why, again, did none of the numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">Bishops</a> and Presbyters whom they ordained, undertake the work, under their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>? The difficulty, therefore, in this case exceeds the other, *ceteris paribus*, more than a hundredfold.\n\nSince, then, no one of the first promulgators of Christianity did that which they must\u2014some of them at least\u2014have been *naturally* led to do, it follows that they must have been *supernaturally* withheld from it; how little soever we may be able even to conjecture the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of the prohibition. For in respect of this, and several other (humanly speaking, unaccountable) circumstances in our religion, it is important to observe, that the argument thence derivable in favour of the divine origin of Christianity, does not turn on the supposed *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>* of this or that appointment, which we conceive to be worthy of the Deity, and thence infer that the religion must have proceeded from Him; but on the utter improbability of its having proceeded from Man; which leaves its divine origin the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a>. The christian Scriptures considered in this point of view, present to us a standing Miracle; at least, a Monument of a Miracle; since they are in several points such as we may be sure, according to all natural causes, they would *not* have been. Even though the character which these writings do in fact exhibit, be such as we cannot clearly account for on any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, still, if they are such as we can clearly perceive no false pretenders would have composed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> is complete, though the difficulty may remain unexplained.\n\nAlthough, however, we cannot pretend, in every case, to perceive the reasons for what God has appointed, it is not in the present case difficult to discern the superhuman wisdom of the course adopted. If the Hymns\u00b9 and forms of Prayer,\u2014the Catechisms,\u2014the Confessions of faith,\u2014and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">Ecclesiastical</a> regulations, which the Apostles employed, had been recorded, these would have all been regarded as parts of Scripture: and even had they been accompanied by the most express declarations of the lawfulness of altering or laying aside any of them, we cannot doubt that they would have been in practice most scrupulously retained, even when changes of manners, tastes, and local and temporary circumstances of every kind, rendered them no longer the most suitable. The Jewish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RITUAL\">ritual</a>, designed for one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATION\">Nation</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">Country</a>, and intended to be of temporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, was fixed and accurately prescribed. The same Divine Wisdom from which both dispensations proceeded, having designed Christianity for all Nations and Ages, left Christians at large in respect of those points in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> might be desirable. But we think no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> wisdom would have foreseen and provided for this. That a number of Jews, accustomed from their infancy to so strict a ritual, should, in introducing Christianity as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the same Dispensation, have abstained not only from accurately prescribing for the use of all Christian Churches for ever, the mode of divine worship, but even from recording what was actually in use under their own directions, does seem utterly incredible, unless we suppose them to have been restrained from doing this by a special admonition of the Divine Spirit.\n\nAnd we may be sure, as we have said, that if they *had* recorded the particulars of their own worship, the very words they wrote would have been invested in our minds with so much sanctity, that it would have been thought presumptuous to vary or to omit them, however inappropriate they might have become. The Lord's Prayer, the only one of general application that is recorded in the Scriptures, though so framed as to be suitable in all Ages and Countries, has yet been subjected to much superstitious abuse. A superstitious Christian mutters his \"paternosters,\" as a kind of sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a>, on all occasions, however inappropriate.\n\nIn like manner, the Apostles' Creed, from its acknowledged antiquity, together with the title it bears, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> (probably, in part,\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Pliny's account of the early Christians, derived in part from those who had belonged to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, mentions that they recited \"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYMN\">hymn</a> to Christ, as to a God.\" This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> hymn has not been transmitted to us, so as to be recognised. It is not unlikely, however, that it, or some part of it, formed the basis of that which we call the Te Deum.\ntrue) of its being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of the Apostles, is held by many Christians in a kind of veneration which may justly be characterised as superstitious. There are persons of the lower orders, and some above the very lowest, who are accustomed to recite it in their private devotions as a prayer.\n\nNo doubt there must ever be danger of all prayer degenerating into a superstitious formalism; but this danger must evidently be increased in proportion as the words uttered are the less appropriate to the occasion, and to the circumstances of the petitioner; and this must inevitably have been more likely to take place with a Liturgy transmitted to us from the times of the Apostles, as a part of Scripture.\n\nWith respect to Catechisms again,\u2014elementary introductions to the christian faith,\u2014nearly the same reasons will hold good. For though the christian religion is fundamentally \"the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever,\" it is impossible that any one mode of introducing its truths to the mind of the catechumen, can be the best adapted for children and adults,\u2014the civilized and the barbarian,\u2014and for all the other varieties of station, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, country, intellectual culture, and natural capacity.\n\nEach church, therefore, was left, through the wise foresight of Him who alone \"knew what is in Man,\" to provide for its own wants as they should arise;\u2014to steer its own course by the Chart and Compass which his holy Word supplies, regulating for itself the Sails and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RUDDER\">Rudder</a>, according to the winds and currents it may meet with.2 \"The Apostles had begun and established precedents, which, of course, would be naturally adopted by their uninspired successors. But still, as these were only the formal means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, and not the blessing itself, it was equally to be expected that the church should assume a discretionary power, whenever the means established became impracticable or clearly unsuitable, and either substitute others, or even altogether abolish such as existed . . . . It might seem at first that the apostolical precedents were literally binding on all Ages; but this cannot have been intended; and for this reason, that the greater portion of the apostolical practices have been transmitted to us, not on apostolical authority, but on the authority of the uninspired church; which has handed them down with an uncertain mixture of its own appointments. How are we to know the enactments of the inspired rulers from those of the uninspired? and if there be no certain clue, we must either bring down the authority of apostolical usage to that of the uninspired church, or raise that of the uninspired church to that of the apostolical. Now, the former is, doubtless, what was, to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, intended by the Apostles themselves; as will appear from a line of distinction by which they have carefully partitioned off such of their appointments as are designed to be perpetual, from such as are left to share the possibility of change, with the institutions of uninspired wisdom.\n\nIf, then, we look to the account of the christian usages contained in Scripture, nothing can be more unquestionable than that, while some are specified, others are passed over in silence. It is not even left so as to make us imagine that those mentioned may be all: but, while some are noted specifically, the establishment of others is implied, without the particular mode of observance being given. Thus, we are all equally sure from Scripture, that christian ministers were ordained by a certain form, and that Christians assembled in prayer; but while the precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of laying on of hands is mentioned in the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, no account is given of the precise method of Church-Service, or even of any regular forms of prayer, beyond the Lord's Prayer. Even the record of the Ordination Service itself admits of the same distinction. It is quite as certain, that, in it, some prayer was used, as that some outward form accompanied the prayer; but the form is specified, the prayer left unrecorded.\n\nWhat, now, is the obvious interpretation of the holy Dispenser's meaning in this mode of record? Clearly, it is, that the Apostles regulated, under his guidance, the forms and practices of the\n\n---\n\n1 If, as there seems good reason for thinking, part of this creed was actually in use with the Apostles, this circumstance renders it the more remarkable that it should not have been recorded by them in their writings.\u2014See Kino's (afterwards Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-KING\">King</a>) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of the Apostles' Creed.\n\n2 Bishop Hind's History of the Rise and Progress of Christianity.\nChurch, so as was best calculated to convey grace to the Church at that time. Nevertheless, part of its institutions were of a nature, which, although formal, would never require a change; and these, therefore, were left recorded in the Scriptures, to mark this distinction of character. The others were not, indeed, to be capriciously abandoned, nor except when there should be manifest cause for so doing; but as such a case was supposable, these were left to mingle with the uninspired precedents, the claims of which as precedents would be increased by this uncertain admixture, and the authority of the whole rendered so far binding, and so far subject to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> of the church. They might not be altered, unless sufficient grounds should appear; but the settling of this point, was left to the discretion of the church.\"\n\nThe Apostles themselves, however, and their numerous fellow-labourers, would not, probably, have been, if left to themselves, so far-sighted as to perceive (all, and each of them, without a single exception) the expediency of this procedure. Most likely, many of them,\u2014but according to all human probability, some of them,\u2014would have left us, as parts of Scripture, compositions such as we have been speaking of; and these, there can be no doubt, would have been scrupulously retained for ever. They would have left us Catechisms, which would have been like precise directions for the cultivation of some plant, admirably adapted to a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, but inapplicable to those of a contrary description. Their Symbols would have stood like ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-walls, built to repel the encroachments of the waves, and still scrupulously kept in repair, when perhaps the sea had retired from them many miles, and was encroaching on some different part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>.\n\nThere are multitudes, even as it is, who do not, even now, perceive the expediency of the omission; there are not a few who even complain of it as a defect, or even make it a ground of objection. That, in that day, the reasons for the procedure actually adopted, should have occurred, and occurred to all the first Christians, supposing them mere unassisted men, and men, too, brought up in Judaism, is utterly incredible.\n\nBut besides the reason we have now been speaking of, there is another, perhaps not less important, against the providing in Scripture of a regular systematic statement of christian doctrines. Supposing such a summary of Gospel truths had been drawn up, and could have been contrived with such exquisite skill as to be sufficient and well adapted for all, of every Age and Country, what would have been the probable result? It would have commanded the unhesitating assent of all Christians; who would, with deep veneration, have stored up the very words of it in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, without any need of laboriously searching the rest of the Scriptures, to ascertain its agreement with them; which is what we do (at least are evidently called on to do) with a human exposition of the faith: and the absence of this labour, together with the tranquil security as to the correctness of their belief which would have been thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a>, would have ended in a careless and contented apathy. There would have been no room for doubt,\u2014no call for vigilant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>,\u2014none of that effort of mind which is now requisite, in comparing one passage with another, and collecting instruction from the scattered, oblique, and incidental references to various doctrines in the existing Scriptures; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> none of that excitement of the best feelings, and that improvement of the heart, which are the natural, and doubtless the designed result of an humble, diligent, and sincere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the christian Scriptures.\n\nIn fact, all study, properly so called, of the rest of Scripture,\u2014all lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> in its perusal,\u2014would have been nearly superseded by such an inspired compendium of doctrine; to which alone, as far the most convenient for that purpose, habitual reference would have been made in any questions that might arise. Both would have been regarded, indeed, as of divine authority; but the Compendium, as the fused and purified metal; the other, as the mine containing the crude ore. And the Compendium itself, being not like the existing Scriptures, that from which the faith is to be learned, but the very thing to be learned,\n\n---\n\n1 Bishop Hind's History of the Rise and Progress of Christianity, vol. ii., p. 113-115.\nwould have come to be regarded by most with an indolent, unthinking veneration, which would have exercised little or no influence on the character.\n\nTheir orthodoxy would have been, as it were, petrified, like the bodies of those animals we read of incrusted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> of the polar regions; firm-fixed, indeed, and preserved unchangeable, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, motionless, lifeless.\n\nIt is only when our energies are roused, and our faculties exercised, and our attention kept awake, by an ardent pursuit of truth, and anxious watchfulness against error,\u2014when, in short, we feel ourselves to be doing something towards acquiring, or retaining, or improving our knowledge,\u2014it is then only, that that knowledge makes the requisite practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the heart and on the conduct.\n\nTo the Church, then, has her all-wise Founder left the office of teaching, to the Scriptures, that of proving, the christian doctrines: to the Scriptures He has left the delineation of christian principles; to each Church, the application of those principles, in their Symbols, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">Articles</a> of Religion,\u2014in their Forms of Worship,\u2014and in their Ecclesiastical regulations.\n\nAnd there can be no doubt that every Christian is bound, in duty to his divine Master, to pay obedience to the enactments and ordinances\u2014not adverse to Scripture\u2014of the Church he belongs to, though consisting of uninspired men. For such a measure of obedience is indispensably necessary for the existence of any Society. And it is certain that it is the will of the Lord Jesus that his People should be members of those Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETIES\">Societies</a> called Churches.\n\nThe religion He introduced was manifestly designed by Him\u2014and so understood by His immediate followers\u2014to be a social religion. It was not merely a revelation of certain truths to be received, and of practical rules to be observed,\u2014it was not a mere system of doctrines and precepts to be embraced by each individual, independently of others; and in which his agreement or co-operation with any others would be accidental; as when several men have come to the same conclusion in some science, or have adopted the same system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> or of medicine; but it was to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of men who should be \"members of the body of Christ,\"\u2014\"living <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>\" of one spiritual temple; \"edifying\" (i.e. building up) \"one another in their faith,\"\u2014and \"brethren\" of one holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>.\n\nOf this design to establish what should be emphatically a social religion,\u2014a \"fellowship\" or \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> (i.e. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>) of saints,\" there can be, we should think, no doubt in the mind of any reflecting reader of our Sacred Books. Besides our Lord's general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> of \"coming unto and dwelling in any man who should love Him, and keep his saying,\" there is a distinct promise also of an especial presence in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>\u2014even \"of two or three\u2014gathered together in his name.\" Besides the general promises made to prayer,\u2014to the prayer of an individual \"in the closet,\"\u2014there is a distinct promise also to those who shall \"agree together, touching something they shall ask.\" And it is in conformity with his own institutions that Christians have, ever since, celebrated what they designate as, emphatically, the Communion, by meeting together, \"to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>,\" in commemoration of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a> of his people.\n\nHis design, in short, manifestly was to adapt his religion to the social principles of man's nature; to bind his disciples, throughout all ages, to each other, by those ties of mutual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>, sympathy, and co-operation, which in every human community and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>, of whatever kind, are found so powerful.\n\nAnd it is evident that whoever directs or sanctions the establishment of a Community, must be understood as thereby sanctioning those institutions which belong to the essence of a Community.\n\nNow there are three things which necessarily pertain to every Community or Society, and are implied by its existence; 1st, Officers; 2dly, Rules; and, 3dly, the power of admitting or excluding Members.\n\nI. Whatever may be the character and objects of any Society\u2014whether it be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> Society [or State,]\u2014or a scientific,\u2014or a mercantile,\u2014or a religious society, such as we call a Church,\u2014in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, it must have some kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>, and consequently, certain Officers to administer that Government; to manage the affairs of the Body, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> some control over the individual members of it.\nII. There must also be, in every society, some kind of Rules; whether called Laws, or Statutes, or Canons, or by whatever other name: and these rules must be enforced by some kind of Penalties against violations of them.\n\nIII. And there must also exist, somewhere, a power of determining who shall be members of the Society;\u2014what persons shall be admitted or refused admittance into it, or expelled, or restored.\n\nThese three things are, as we have said, essential to every kind of Society.\n\nAs for a Civil Community [or State,] that is not a voluntary society; but must have, from the very nature of the case, a coercive power: it is necessary that all persons residing in each Country, should be compelled to submit to the government of that country. And there is no limit, except in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and wisdom of the rulers, to the punishments denounced against those who disobey the laws.\n\nBut in a voluntary Society, (such as Christ designed a Church to be,) the ultimate penalty must be expulsion, all others short of this being submitted to as the alternative. \"If he refuse,\" says our Lord, \"to hear the Church; let him be unto thee as a heathen man,\"\u2014that is, no longer a member of that church.\u00b9\n\nAnd even as a \"heathen man,\"\u2014one who never belonged to our Society,\u2014has no claim to any of its privileges, nor is subject to its government, or liable to its penalties; so, if one who has been a member of it, has renounced its authority, or has been formally expelled from it, he is placed on the same footing. It would be unfair, on the one hand, for him to claim any of its advantages, or, on the other hand, for us to attempt to subject him to its laws and its penalties. He, and that particular Society, have thenceforth nothing to do with each other.\u00b2\n\nAnd here it should be observed that it is necessary not only that every Community should have laws, enforced by certain penalties, but also that it should have power to make laws, from time to time, not in opposition to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> principles of the society, but for the carrying out of those principles.\n\nFor it would be impossible to lay down rules, once for all, so minute and precise as to meet every possible case, and never to need any addition. Even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOSAIC_LAW\">Mosaic law</a>, which was extremely particular in its directions, was not sufficient without some enactments, made by competent authority, to decide, for instance, what was or was not to be accounted work, and consequently prohibited on the Sabbath-day; and many other such points of detail.\n\nOur Lord does indeed censure the Jewish rulers for having, in some points, made absurd and frivolous regulations: and in some, having \"made the word of God of none effect, through their tradition.\" In the one case, they had made an ill use of the power intrusted to them; in the other they had altogether exceeded their power. But nevertheless, He acknowledges that the power did exist in the rulers of the Jewish Church, and that obedience was due to it when their enactments were not at variance with God's laws. \"The scribes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHARISEES\">Pharisees</a>\" said He, \"sit in Moses' seat;\" that is, they are his successors in the office of making and enforcing regulations for the Jewish church; \"whatsoever they bid you observe and do, so do ye; but do ye not after their works; for they say, and do not.\"\n\nNow the rules laid down in Scripture for a Christian Church, are (as was remarked above) far less numerous and less precise than those of the Law. So that it was even much more necessary that a christian Church should have that\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 That is, of that particular church whose authority he has renounced. It does not follow that he may not be a member of some other church.\n\nIndeed, it has often happened, amidst the many unhappy dissensions among Christians, that all the members of a church that is completely opposed to another, are shut out from christian inter-communion with the other church.\n\nBut though we may be justified in saying, such and such a person is not, and cannot be, considered a member of this particular church, we have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to pronounce him thereupon excluded from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> Church of Christ.\n\n\u00b2 Sometimes it has happened that some church, though claiming no power over a \"heathen man,\" has yet called in what is termed the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> arm,\" to punish as heretics, persons who have renounced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to that church, or whom it has excommunicated. But this is in manifest opposition to what our Lord says in the passage above referred to, as well as to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> that his \"kingdom is not of this world.\"\n\nWhether those persons were justly or unjustly excommunicated,\u2014or whether they were right or wrong in seceding,\u2014the church which has renounced them, or which they have renounced, has clearly no more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> over them, according to our Lord's express declaration, than it has over a \"heathen man.\"\npower which our Lord himself acknowledged to have been possessed by the Scribes and Pharisees.\n\nAnd since it was undoubtedly his design that there should always be christian churches \"even to the end of the world,\" there can be no doubt that He intended these churches to possess all those three requisites above mentioned, without which no community of any kind can subsist. And hence, we may feel assured that the officers of christian churches, and the rules established in them, (when not adverse to Gospel principles), and the penalties which form the sanction of those rules, and the power which every church exercises of admitting or excluding persons as members,\u2014all these, must, we are sure, have the sanction of our divine Master Himself.\n\nAll this we might infer, as has been said, from the mere fact of his having sanctioned the formation of christian communities. But, besides this, He expressly conferred on his Apostles\u2014the first founders and first rulers of christian churches\u2014those very powers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned.\n\nThe power of \"binding and loosing\"1\u2014that is, of making and annulling decisions and regulations\u2014He distinctly conferred on the Apostles; declaring that their decisions should be bound \"in heaven,\" that is sanctioned by Himself. (Matt. xvi. 19.)\n\nThis declaration He made first to Peter, as being the person chosen to take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> in laying the first foundation of a christian church; both among the Jews on the day of Pentecost, and afterwards among the Gentiles. (Acts ii., x.) But subsequently, a little before his departure, He appoints a kingdom to the Apostles generally. (Luke xxii. 29.) In addressing Peter, He mentions the \"keys of the kingdom of heaven,\" that is the power of admitting members into the christian church, and of excluding them. But this is in fact included in the appointment to the kingdom; since the rulers of a church must be intrusted with this power.\n\nAnd He also expressly conferred on the Apostles the power of inflicting and remitting church penalties (John xx. 23), for offences against the society,\u2014what we call Ecclesiastical offences.\n\nAnd it is likely, that, besides this, his words had reference also to their office of preaching \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a> of sins,\" and of administering or refusing baptism, according as each person might appear in their judgment fit or unfit: that is, the qualifications for being admitted into Christ's kingdom, and for being allowed to continue a subject of it, having been laid down by Himself as the Supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HEAD\">Head</a>, his ministers were left to decide in each case, who was, or was not, thus qualified.\n\nThis, doubtless, was our Lord's meaning when He spoke of the \"keys of the kingdom of heaven.\" And it is probably one part of what He meant to include in the power of remitting and retaining sins.\n\nBut this, at least, is quite certain, that no mere man can have power to forgive sins as against God; or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> or refuse admission into the realms of heavenly bliss; which is the office of the Lord Jesus Himself at the Day of Judgment. By Him his disciples were merely authorised to admit men into his kingdom on earth,\u2014that is, his Church: and to pronounce not what particular individuals, but what kind of persons should have remission of sins against God, and should attain eternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>,\u2014namely, those whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PENITENCE\">penitence</a> and faith are seen by Him to be sincere.\n\nHe might, had He seen fit, have gifted his apostles and other ministers with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-READING\">reading</a> any man's heart, and foreseeing the future course of his life; and He might thus have enabled them to pronounce positively of an individual, that his sins were pardoned by the Most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">High</a>, and that he would inherit eternal life. But this gift our Lord did not think fit to bestow on his Apostles, or on any man. They were left, to judge, as they could, of the sincerity of each man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>, and of the steadfastness both of his faith, and of his whole christian character. And in this they were liable to be deceived; as is evident from the case (among others) of Simon the sorcerer (Acts viii.); for he would not have been admitted to baptism, if it had been perceived at the time that he was \"in the bond of iniquity.\"\n\n---\n\n1 This is the phrase which was and still continues in use among the Jews in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>.\nBut offences against a society, that society has a right to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a>; just as an individual may forgive sins against himself. Indeed, our Lord, we know, commanded us thus to forgive. But of course He did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> that we have power to pardon sins as against God. For that belongs to Him alone. If any one does some wrong to us, or to a Society, he also, by doing this wrong, sins against God. It rests with us, or with the society he has wronged, to pardon the wrong as against his fellow-men. But God alone can pardon the sin against God.\n\nAll those three requisites, then, which we have been speaking of as essential to every Society, our Lord expressly established. He appointed officers, and He conferred the power of enacting rules, and of admitting and excluding members.\n\nAnd it is plain that what He said to those particular disciples He was addressing, could not be meant as limited to them alone, but as having reference to His Church \"even unto the end of the world;\" since it is certain He designed his Church not to cease with the lives of its first founders, but to continue permanently.\n\nWe may, perhaps, think that, if matters had been left to our judgment and disposal, we should have asked for a continuance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> for the conversion of unbelievers, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> inspiration in the church, in order to be sure of an infallible interpretation of Scripture. But as there is no promise of anything of this kind, we have no right either to conclude from our own wishes, that it must exist; or again, to reject Christianity for not completely answering our wishes. It is quite otherwise, however, with those things we have been speaking of as essential requisites for a Society. We infer that a christian church must have them, not because this is advantageous and desirable, but because it is indispensable to every kind of Society. Without Officers and Rules of some kind or other, and power of enrolling and excluding Members, no society could subsist at all. And since our Great Master did sanction the existence of christian societies, we fairly conclude, that by so doing, He sanctioned whatever is essential to the existence of a society, and implied thereby.\n\nSuch was manifestly the will of the divine Founder of our religion. And it was also his will that christian communities, the several portions of his kingdom, should continue to subsist under the government of uninspired fallible men, having no miraculous powers, nor any infallible guide on earth to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to, in case of any doubt as to the right interpretation of Scripture, or the right application of scripture principles.\n\nThis may seem to some persons very strange. Not but that we can perceive plainly that there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between our case and that of those who lived when the Gospel was first proclaimed. For in order to introduce a revelation from Heaven, it was indispensably necessary that certain persons should receive from Heaven a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of what that revelation was. And no one could have been expected to listen to them, if they had not proved, by the display of miraculous powers, that they really had received such a communication. In after times, on the contrary, the writings of those persons may be referred to for a knowledge of what the religion is. And the miracles by which they established it, and without which it never could have been established, may be appealed to in proof of its divine origin.\n\nBut still, if it were left to each Christian's judgment and choice, whether he would or would not have inspiration and other miraculous gifts bestowed on the Church, for the conversion of unbelievers, and for the satisfaction of the doubting, and for the correction of such errors as arise from time to time,\u2014if each man were left to decide on this according to his own judgment and wishes\u2014it is probable that very many would ask for a restoration of those gifts. We should not at least find all Christians agreeing to decline them as no longer needed.\n\nMany there are who would fain have\u2014somewhere at least on earth\u2014an infallible guide, accessible to all men, to decide, by evident divine authority, on any questions that may arise. And some there are who are even so bent on this, that they resolve to find it, because they deem it needful, with, or without good reasons for believing it to exist; and who will accept the Gospel on no other condition.\n\nThe truth is, that there is in the human mind a craving for infallibility, which predisposes men towards the pretensions, either of a supposed un-\nerring church, or of those who claim or who promise immediate inspiration. And accordingly, we find persons sometimes waver for a time between these two classes of pretensions, and ultimately give in to the one, or to the other, and sometimes thus changing more than once, yet still always clinging to the confident <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of finding that infallibility we have been speaking of. They are inquiring only after a way of exempting themselves from all further inquiry. Their care is only to relieve themselves ultimately from all further need of vigilant care. They are navigating in search of a perfectly safe haven, in which the helm may be abandoned, and the vessel left to ride securely, without any need of watching the winds and currents, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> out for rocks and shoals. They hope to obtain, in all ages of the church, that exemption from all need of vigilant circumspection, which was not granted even in the age of the Apostles; since we find that, even when there were these infallible guides on earth, Christians are perpetually warned of the danger of mistaking \"false apostles\" for genuine.\n\nAnd it may be added, that any one who is thus induced to give himself up implicitly to the guidance of such a supposed infallible authority, without presuming thenceforth to exercise his own judgment on any point relative to religion, or to think for himself at all on such matters,\u2014such a one will be likely to regard this procedure as the very perfection of pious humility,\u2014as a most reverent observance of the rule of \"lean not to thine own understanding;\" though, in reality, it is the very error of leaning improperly to our own understanding. For to resolve to believe that God must have dealt with mankind just in the way that we could wish as the most desirable, and in the way that to us seems the most probable; this is in fact to set up ourselves as his judges. It is to dictate to Him in the spirit of Naaman, who thought that the prophet would recover him by a touch, and who chose to be healed by the waters of Abana and Pharpar, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> of Damascus, which he deemed better than all the waters of Israel.\n\nBut anything that falls in at once with men's wishes, and with their conjectures, and which also presents itself to them in the guise of a virtuous humility; this, they are often found readily and firmly to believe, not only without evidence, but against all evidence. And thus it is in the present case. The principle of which we have been speaking,\u2014that every revelation from heaven necessarily requires, as an indispensable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPANIMENT\">accompaniment</a>, an infallible interpreter always at hand,\u2014this principle clings so strongly to the minds of many men, that they are even found still to maintain it, after they have ceased to believe in any revelation at all, or even in the existence of a God.\n\nThere can be, we conceive, no doubt of the fact, that very great numbers of men are to be found,\u2014they are much more numerous in some parts of the Continent than among us;\u2014men not deficient in intelligence, nor altogether strangers to reflection, who, while they for the most part conform externally to the prevailing religion, are inwardly utter unbelievers in Christianity; yet still hold to the principle,\u2014which, in fact, has had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> share in making them unbelievers,\u2014that the idea of a Divine Revelation implies that of a universally-accessible Infallible Interpreter; and that the one, without the other, is an absurdity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>.\n\nWe have said that it is this principle that has mainly contributed to make these men unbelievers. For when a tolerably intelligent and reflective man has fully satisfied himself, that, in point of fact, no such provision has been made,\u2014that no infallible and universally-accessible interpreter does exist on earth\u2014yet still adheres to the principle of its supposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, the consequence is inevitable, that he will at once reject all belief of Christianity. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of a Revelation, and of an unerring Interpreter, being in his mind inseparably conjoined, the overthrow of the one belief cannot but carry the other along with it. Such a person, therefore, will be apt to think it not worth while to examine the reasons in favour of any other system of Christianity not pretending to furnish an infallible interpreter. This\u2014which, he is fully convinced, is essential to a revelation from Heaven\u2014is by some churches claimed, but not established, while the rest do not even claim it. The pretensions of the one he has listened to and deliberately rejected; those of the other he regards as not even worth listening to.\nThe system, then, of reasoning from our own conjectures as to the necessity of the Most High doing so and so, tends to lead a man to proceed from the rejection of his own form of Christianity, to a rejection of revelation altogether. But does it stop here? Does not the same system lead naturally to Atheism also? <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">Experience</a> shows that that consequence, which reason might have anticipated, does often actually take place. He who gives the reins to his own conjectures as to what is necessary, and thence draws his conclusions, will be likely to find a necessity for such divine interference in the affairs of the world as does not in fact take place. He will deem it no less than necessary, that an omnipotent, and all-wise, and beneficent Being should interfere to rescue the oppressed from the oppressor,\u2014the corrupted from the corrupter,\u2014to deliver men from such temptations to evil as it is morally impossible they should withstand;\u2014and, in short, to banish evil from the universe. And, since this is not done, he draws the inference that there cannot possibly be a God, and that to believe otherwise is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> absurdity. Such a belief he may, indeed, consider as useful for keeping up a wholesome awe in the minds of the vulgar; and for their sakes he may outwardly profess Christianity also; even as the heathen philosophers of old endeavoured to keep up the popular superstitions: but a real belief he will regard as something impossible to an intelligent and reflective mind.\n\nWe are very far from saying that all, or the greater part, of those who maintain the principle we are speaking of, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ATHEISTS\">Atheists</a>. We all know how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> it is for men to fail of carrying out some principle (whether good or bad) which they have adopted;\u2014how common, to maintain the premises, and not perceive the conclusion to which they lead. But the tendency of the principle itself is what we are speaking of: and the danger is anything but imaginary of its leading, in fact as it does naturally and consistently, to Atheism as its ultimate result.\n\nBut whatever our wishes or conjectures might have been, no such choice,\u2014no such offer of infallible guidance\u2014has been set before us. What is required of us is, thankfully to endeavour to make the best use of the advantages we have, instead of conjecturing or wondering why it is that we have not more. We are not called on to explain to the satisfaction of all men, or of ourselves, the reasons, in each instance, for God's having dealt with us as He has. What we are to say, in reference to any such inquiries, is, \"Even so, Father! for so it seemed good in Thy sight.\"\n\nTo Him, then, it seemed good, that after the departure of the Apostles, no successors to them in the Apostolic office should arise. As members indeed, and as ministers and rulers of christian churches, they were succeeded by others, down to this day. But as Apostles of Jesus Christ, they have no successors. As personal attendants on Him, and eye-witnesses of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a>\u2014as both possessors and dispensers of miraculous gifts (Acts viii. 14), and as inspired <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">oracles</a> to make known the divine will,\u2014in all these points, which were what constituted the apostolic office, they left none to succeed them. In all that relates to christian churches, and also in that for the sake of which churches were instituted, the conduct of individual Christians in all the concerns of life,\u2014men are now, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>, left to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> (according to their own best discretion) in conformity with Gospel principles, as recorded in Scripture.\n\nThe Holy Spirit, indeed, \"who helpeth our infirmities,\" is promised to those who earnestly seek it, and who strive to profit by it. This aid is needed by us, and is promised to us, both for the establishment of our faith, and also for the guidance of our judgment, and of our conduct, whether in matters connected with the Church, or in anything else. But how far any one is really \"led by the Spirit\" in each instance, there is no authority on earth to decide. It is the office of that Spirit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> us both from error and from sin. But we must not pretend to be either free from sin, or exempt from error; since of that we cannot be infallible judges. If it be right to say, \"Who can tell how oft he offendeth?\" we ought to add also, \"Who can tell how oft he mistaketh?\"\n\nA christian church, then, being a Society, instituted under Christ's sanction, for the purpose of keeping up and extending the knowledge and practice of his religion, and of thus making men faithful and obedient subjects of his kingdom, the rulers of such a Society are bound to act, according to the best of their power, with a view\nto this object. They are to keep in mind, that is, that it is Christ's kingdom and not their own, in which they hold office. \"We preach not ourselves,\" says the Apostle, \"but Christ Jesus our Lord; and us, your servants for Christ's sake.\"\n\nThe powers, therefore, which He has entrusted to a Church are to be exercised in strict conformity with the principles laid down by Him and his inspired servants.\n\nNo Church has power to alter, or to add to, the terms of gospel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> as laid down in Scripture; or to keep back from its members anything revealed in Scripture; or to encourage, or willingly leave them, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of it. For its very office is, in the words of Christ Himself, to \"teach them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded.\"\n\nIt is, indeed, allowable, and proper, that a Church should employ, for the instruction of its people, convenient Summaries and Expositions of Scripture doctrine, such, for instance, as Catechisms. For this is to supply an omission, which (as above observed) was purposely left in Scripture. But then these Catechisms, &c., must contain the very doctrines of Scripture, and none other. And being the compositions of uninspired men, no authority must be claimed for them, except from their agreement with Scripture. And the same rule applies to Forms of prayer and to Creeds.\n\nCreeds, which have been sometimes called \"Symbols,\" sometimes \"Confessions of Faith,\" or \"Articles of Religion,\" are statements of such doctrines as must be acknowledged by any one who would become, or remain, a member of the Church which adopts that Creed. In different Churches, in the earliest times, different Creeds were in use; and alterations were made in them from time to time. Not that any Church had a right to alter the christian Faith; but that it was necessary to meet, and guard against the particular religious errors which arose in various Ages and Countries. But as none of these creeds is to be found in Scripture, so, there is none that can claim any authority, except from its conformity to Scripture.\n\nThe doctrines, then, which a christian Church teaches, and is bound to teach, are to be those of the christian Scriptures; neither more nor less.\n\nBut on the other hand, Church ordinances and regulations are only required to be not at variance with Scripture. For it is indispensably necessary for a Church to make enactments on many points respecting which nothing is precisely laid down in Scripture; but only the general principle, \"let all things be done to edifying.\"\n\nFor instance, assembling for public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> Worship is enjoined in Scripture; but the times, places and mode of conducting the worship are not specified. The Sacraments, again, as instituted by Christ, are to be celebrated; but the mode of celebration is not prescribed. It is not even ordered that the Elders [Clergy] are to administer the Sacraments; though this, (very naturally and properly,) has been the rule of every Church.\n\nIn these, and in several other points, a Church is not only authorized, but compelled, to make regulations; because we are enjoined to do things which must be done in some regular specified mode, and the mode is not laid down in Scripture.\n\nFor instance, since Christians are commanded (as has just been observed) to assemble (Heb. x. 25) for divine worship, it is necessary that the times for doing so should be fixed by authority. And, accordingly, certain days have been in all ages of Christianity, set apart by every Church, for this purpose. Thus every one knows what is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTMAS_DAY\">Christmas-day</a> has been set apart to commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ; the day called Good Friday, for his crucifixion; and Easter-day in each year, and also the first day in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> (thence called \"the Lord's Day\"), to celebrate his resurrection.1\n\n---\n\n1 Hence, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a>, being (like the Jewish Sabbath) one day in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a>, is sometimes called the Christian Sabbath; though kept on a different day of the week from the Jewish Sabbath, and in a different manner, and to commemorate a different event.\n\nNeither the fourth Commandment, nor any other law enjoining the observance of the seventh day of the week in memory of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, is regarded by christians as binding on them. For if it were, they would be bound strictly to obey it, as it was given. For the Apostles, who, themselves, as Jews, kept the Sabbath-day, and also, as christians, assembled for worship on the Lord's Day,\u2014never made a change of the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first. And no Church, consisting of uninspired men, has any right to change any divine ordinance designed for them. But the Mosaic Law having come to an end, and, moreover, having never been binding on Gentiles, a christian church is left to determine what days shall be set apart, as above mentioned.\nAnd in the observance of \"the Lord's Day,\" after the example of the Apostles, (though no express command of theirs to that effect is recorded), all Churches, from the earliest times, have, very properly, agreed.\n\nA Church that should act otherwise, would be making an ill use of the powers bestowed on it; but it would be presumptuously exceeding its powers, if it should dare to enact anything at variance with Scripture. For instance, either, on the one hand, to abolish the Sacraments ordained by Christ, or, on the other hand, to depart from that celebration of the Lord's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">Supper</a> which He Himself appointed, and to administer the bread without the cup, which He directed all the Disciples to drink of, is what no Church can have any right to do.\n\nAnd it would be equally against Scripture, and that in a most important point, to attempt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> christian Ministers into sacrificing Priests: because Scripture plainly teaches that, under the Gospel, this office belongs to Christ alone.\n\nBut christian Ministers for the performance of such duties as are described in Paul's Epistles to Timothy and to Titus, and elsewhere, every church clearly has a right to appoint, for the reasons already given. And there is no reason to doubt that the Elders ordained in each Church by Paul, or any other Apostle, did themselves, in turn, ordain others to assist or to succeed them; and these again, others; and so on in perpetuity, down to the present day.\n\nBut then, it is from the Church that Ministers (as well as Church ordinances) derive all their authority. Whether in sending fresh labourers into the Lord's vineyard, or in any of their other functions, they must act as authorised by the Society, and as representing it; not as possessing independent powers, as individuals. For it is to a Church as to a Society that those rights we have been speaking of belong; and whatever is done by the regular Officers of a Society, conformably to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, is to be considered as done by the society.\n\nWhen, therefore, Bishops, or any others, are spoken of as ordaining persons to the Ministry, it must be understood that, being empowered by their Church so to do, according to the rules of that Church, they are its representatives, and their acts are its acts.\n\nAnd if any Minister were regularly deprived of his office, he would no longer have any power either to ordain, or in any way to officiate; unless he were admitted into some other Church, and taken into its service as one of its Ministers.\n\nThe rights, then, conferred on christian Communities by our divine Master Himself, being such as we have described, no one need be distressed by doubts and fears respecting some possible irregularity in the ordination of some minister, which may possibly have occurred at some time or other, in the course of eighteen centuries.\n\nAmidst the wars and tumults and general confusion which took place at various times during that space, and especially during what are called \"the dark ages,\" when ignorance and barbarism, as well as lawless violence, were so prevalent, it may have happened, more than once, that some person who had never been regularly ordained, or, perhaps, even baptized, may have contrived to intrude himself into the ministerial office; and to have even attained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of a bishop; and may thus have been the ordainer of others, the successors of whom may possibly be among ourselves at this day.\n\nThere is no christian Minister now existing that can trace up, with complete certainty, his own ordination, through perfectly regular steps, to the times of the Apostles. And, accordingly, if the reality of the ministerial Office were made to depend, not on a man's being an acknowledged Minister of a christian Church, but on a certain mysterious sacramental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, transmitted from hand to hand, in unbroken succession from the Apostles, there would be a most distressing and incurable uncertainty in each Christian's mind, whether he were really baptized, really ordained, or really partaker of any christian privileges.\n\nBut as it is, there is no ground for any such perplexing doubts. A christian Community, formed on Gospel principles, confers on its recognised Officers the rights of christian Ministers; who are to be regarded as having Christ's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, and as successors of the Apostles in the ministerial office. We are bound, indeed, to do our very best to prevent irregularities of any kind, in ordinations, and in everything else con-\nnected with our religion. But we need not fear that any accidental or unavoidable irregularity that may ever have occurred, can have the effect of shutting out whole Bodies of sincere disciples from the Gospel covenant and christian ordinances, or from any privilege granted by Christ Himself to those who should be \"gathered together in his name.\"\n\nIt is to be observed, however, that although no one individual christian Minister can, with complete certainty, trace his own succession in an unbroken chain from the Apostles, and prove that there was no flaw in any link, the case is different when we look to the Clergy generally. For there can be no reasonable doubt that such an Order of men did always exist, from the times of the Apostles, continuously, to this day. We may be as sure of this as we are that great numbers of the English nation are descendants of the Saxons, who settled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> in the fifth and sixth centuries, though there is probably no one man who could trace his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> from any of them. For, christian Ministers held office in the churches as immediate successors of others who held the same office, and who in like manner professed to be the immediate successors of others, &c., whose predecessors had been appointed by the Apostles themselves.\n\nNow if, a century ago, or ten centuries ago, or at any other time, a number of men had arisen, claiming to be the immediate successors (as above described) of persons holding this office, when, in fact, no such Order of men had ever been heard of, such an absurd pretension would have been immediately exposed and derided.\n\nThere must always, therefore, have existed such an Order of men, from the time of those Apostles who professed to be eye-witnesses of the Resurrection, and to work sensible public miracles in proof of their divine commission. And, consequently, the christian Ministry is a standing monument to attest the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> of those miraculous events at the very time when they are said to have occurred.\n\nNow, at that time there must have been great numbers of persons able and willing to expose the imposture, had there been any.\n\nAnd this argument for the truth of the Sacred History is quite independent of any particular mode of appointing christian Ministers. If, for instance, these had always been elected by the People, and had at once entered on their office without any ordination by other Ministers, still, if they were but appointed (in whatever mode) as immediate successors of persons holding the same office, the argument would be the same.\n\nThat mode, indeed, of admitting men into the Ministry which was practised by the Apostles (1 Tim. iv. 14, and v. 22) has, in fact, been retained in all ages of Christianity. But the argument we have now been considering is quite independent of this. It turns entirely on the mere fact of the constant existence of a certain Order of men.\n\nAnd it is worth observing, that the Lord's Day is a monument of the same kind. It is kept all over the world, by different and even hostile Bodies of Christians, in memory of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. And not only so,\u2014for this alone would not be a decisive proof,\u2014but it is observed by them as a day which has been always thus kept, from the very day when the Lord Jesus is recorded to have risen, and to have appeared to his Disciples. Now, if it had not been thus constantly kept, from the first, but the observance of it introduced in some later age, those among whom it was thus introduced would have been able to testify that they had never heard of such a festival before.","sp":498,"ep":512},{"h":"HOBBS","t":"Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury may be numbered among those eminent persons born in the latter half of the sixteenth century, who gave a new character to European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> in the succeeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.

The controversies excited by Grotius have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> ceased, but the powerful influence of his works will be doubted by those only who are unacquainted with the disputes of the seventeenth century.\nnearly thirty that he supplied the defects of his early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, by classical studies so successfully prosecuted, that he wrote well in the Latin then used by his scientific contemporaries; and made such proficiency in Greek as, in his earliest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, the Translation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THUCYDIDES\">Thucydides</a>, published when he was forty, to afford a specimen of a version still valued for its remarkable fidelity; though written with a stiffness and constraint very opposite to the masterly facility of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> compositions.\n\nIt was after forty that he learned the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> (so miserably defective was his education); but yielding to the paradoxical disposition apt to infect those who begin to learn after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> age of commencement, he exposed himself, by absurd controversies with the masters of a science which looks <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with scorn on the Sophist. A considerable portion of his mature age was passed on the Continent, where he travelled as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> to two successive Earls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a>; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> with whom he seems to have passed near half a century of his long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. In France his reputation, founded at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a> solely on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> intercourse, became so great, that his observations on the Meditations of Descartes were published in the works of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, together with those of Gassendi and Arnauld. It was about his sixtieth year that he began to publish those philosophical writings which contain his peculiar opinions\u2014which set the understanding of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> into general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, and stirred up controversies among metaphysicians and moralists, not even yet determined. At the age of eighty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> he had the boldness to publish metrical versions of the Iliad and Odyssey, which the greatness of his name, and the singularity of the undertaking, still render objects of curiosity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not of criticism. He owed his influence to various causes; at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of which may be placed that genius for system, which, though it cramps the growth of knowledge, perhaps finally atones for that mischief, by the zeal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> which it rouses among followers and opponents, who discover <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> by accident, when in pursuit of weapons for their warfare. A system which attempts a task so hard as that of subjecting vast provinces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> knowledge to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> two principles, if it presents some striking instances of conformity to superficial appearances, is sure to delight the framer; and, for a time, to subdue and captivate the student too entirely for sober reflection and rigorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>. The evil does not indeed very frequently recur. Perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, Hobbes, and Kant, are the only persons who united in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> the great faculties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> and discrimination which compose the Genius of System. Of the three, Aristotle alone could throw it off where it was glaringly unsuitable; and it is deserving of observation, that the reign of system seems, from these examples, progressively to shorten in proportion as reason is cultivated and knowledge advances. But, in the first instance, consistency passes for truth. When principles in some instances have proved sufficient to give an unexpected explanation of facts, the delighted reader is content to accept as true all other deductions from the principles. Specious premises being assumed to be true, nothing more can be required than logical inference. Mathematical forms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> current as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> of mathematical certainty. The unwary admirer is satisfied with the completeness and symmetry of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>\u2014unmindful of the need of examining the firmness of the foundation and the soundness of the materials. The system-maker, like the conqueror, long dazzles and overawes the world; but when their sway is past, the vulgar herd, unable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> their astonishing faculties, take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> by trampling on fallen greatness.\n\nThe dogmatism of Hobbes was, however unjustly, one of the sources of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>. The founders of systems deliver their novelties with the undoubting spirit of discoverers; and their\n\n---\n\n1 The prevalence of freethinking under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIII., to a far greater degree than it was avowed, appears not only from the complaints of Mersenne and of Grotius, but from the disclosures of Guy Patin; who, in his Letters, describes his own conversations with Gassendi and Naud\u00e9, so as to leave no doubt of their opinions.\n\n2 \"Another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>,\" says the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">Wisdom</a>, \"is the over-early and peremptory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of knowledge into arts and methods, from which time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> receives small augmentation.\" (Bacon's Advancement of Learning, book i.)\n\n\"Method,\" says he, \"carrying a show of total and perfect knowledge, has a tendency to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> acquiescence.\" What pregnant words!\nfollowers are apt to be dogmatical, because they can see nothing beyond their own ground. It might seem incredible, if it were not established by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of all ages, that those who differ most from the opinions of their fellow-men are most confident of the truth of their own. But it commonly requires an overweening conceit of the superiority of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s own judgment, to make him espouse very singular notions; and when he has once embraced them, they are endeared to him by the hostility of those whom he contemns as the prejudiced vulgar. The temper of Hobbes must have been originally haughty. The advanced age at which he published his obnoxious opinions, rendered him more impatient of the acrimonious opposition which they necessarily provoked; until at length a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the injustice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> impending over his head, for the publication of what he believed to be truth, cooperated with the peevishness and timidity of his years, to render him the most imperious and morose of dogmatists. His dogmatism has indeed one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> more offensive than that of most others. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">Propositions</a> the most adverse to the opinions of mankind, and the most abhorrent from their feelings, are introduced into the course of his argument with mathematical coldness. He presents them as demonstrated conclusions, without deigning to explain to his fellow-creatures how they all happened to believe the opposite absurdities; without even the compliment of once observing how widely his discoveries were at variance with the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> judgments of the human understanding. The same quality in Spinoza indicates a recluse's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the world. In Hobbes it is the arrogance of a man who knows mankind and despises them.\n\nA permanent foundation of his fame consists in his admirable style, which seems to be the very perfection of didactic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. Short, clear, precise, pithy, his language never has more than one meaning, which never requires a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> thought to find. By the help of his exact method, it takes so firm a hold on the mind, that it will not allow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLACKEN\">slacken</a>. His little tract on Human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> has scarcely an ambiguous or a needless word. He has so great a power of always choosing the most significant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, that he never is reduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> expedient of using many in its stead. He had so thoroughly studied the genius of the language, and knew so well to steer between pedantry and vulgarity, that two centuries have not superannuated probably more than a dozen of his words. His expressions are so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a>, that he is clear without the help of illustration. Perhaps no writer of any age or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, on subjects so abstruse, has manifested an equal power of engraving his thoughts on the mind of his readers. He seems never to have taken a word for ornament or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; and he deals with eloquence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> as the natural philosopher who explains the mechanism of children's toys, or deigns to contrive them. Yet his style so stimulates attention, that it never tires; and, to those who are acquainted with the subject, appears to have as much spirit as can be safely blended with reason. He compresses his thoughts so unaffectedly, and yet so tersely, as to produce occasionally maxims which excite the same agreeable surprise with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, and have become a sort of philosophical proverbs; the success of which he partly owed to the suitableness of such forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> to his dictatorial nature. His words have such an appearance of springing from his thoughts, as to impress on the reader a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of his originality, and indeed to prove that he was not conscious of borrowing; though conversation with Gassendi must have influenced his mind; and it is hard to believe that his coincidence with Ockham should have been purely accidental, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> so important as the denial of general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, the reference of moral distinctions to superior power, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> thraldom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> under the civil power, which he seems to have thought necessary, to maintain that independence of the state on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> with which Ockham had been contented.\n\nHis philosophical writings might be read without reminding any one that the author was more than an intellectual machine. They never betray a feeling except that insupportable arrogance which looks down on men as a lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of beings; whose almost unanimous hostility is so far from shaking the firmness of his\nconviction, or even ruffling the calmness of his contempt, that it appears too petty a circumstance to require explanation, or even to merit notice. Let it not be forgotten, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his renown depends on the application of his admirable powers to expound truth when he meets it. This great merit is conspicuous in that part of his treatise of Human Nature which relates to the percipient and reasoning faculties. It is also very remarkable in many of his secondary principles on the subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, which, while the first principles are false and dangerous, are as admirable for truth as for his accustomed and unrivalled propriety of expression. In many of these observations he even shows a disposition to soften his paradoxes, and to conform to the common sense of mankind.\n\nIt was with perfect truth observed by my excellent friend Mr Stewart, that \"the ethical principles of Hobbes are completely interwoven with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> system.\" He might have said, that the whole of Hobbes's system, moral, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>, and in part philosophical, depended on his political scheme; not indeed logically, as conclusions depend on premises, but (if the word may be excused) psychologically, as the formation of one opinion may be influenced by a disposition to adapt it to previously cherished opinions. The Translation of Thucydides, as he himself boasts, was published to show the evils of popular government. Men he represented as being originally equal, and having an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to all things, but as being taught by reason to sacrifice this right for the advantages of peace, and to submit to a common authority, which can preserve quiet, only by being the sole depository of force, and must therefore be absolute and unlimited. The supreme authority cannot be sufficient for its purpose, unless it be wielded by a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>; nor even then, unless his absolute power extends over religion, which may prompt men to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCORD\">discord</a> by the fear of an evil greater than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. The perfect state of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, according to him, is where law prescribes the religion and morality of the people, and where the will of an absolute sovereign is the sole fountain of law. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOOKER\">Hooker</a> had inculcated the simple truth, that \"to live by one man's will is the cause of many men's misery.\" Hobbes embraced the daring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a>, that to live by one man's will is the only means of all men's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. Having thus rendered religion the slave of every human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>, it was an unavoidable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, that he should be disposed to lower her character, and lessen her power over men; that he should regard atheism as the most effectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of preventing rebellion; at least that species of rebellion which prevailed in his time, and had excited his alarms. The formidable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> of religion with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> haunted his mind, and urged him to the bold attempt of rooting out both these mighty principles; which, when combined with interests and passions, when debased by impure support, and provoked by unjust resistance, have indeed the power of fearfully agitating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>; but which are, nevertheless, in their own nature, and as far as they are unmixed and undisturbed, the fountains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, of order, of peace, as well as of those moral hopes, and of those glorious aspirations after higher excellence, which encourage and exalt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> in its passage through misery and depravity. A Hobbist is the only consistent persecutor; for he alone considers himself as bound, by whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> he has remaining, to conform to the religion of the sovereign.\n\n---\n\n1 See De Corpore Politico, Part i. chap. ii. iii. iv. and Leviathan, Part i. chap. xiv. xv. for remarks of this sort, full of sagacity.\n\n2 \"The laws of nature are immutable and eternal; for injustice, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a>, arrogance, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>, iniquity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ACCEPTION\">acception</a> of persons, and the rest, can never be made lawful.

And this, it is well known, is what the unconverted Jews of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> expect.\n\nYet some of the prophecies relating to the Christ's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, do contain allusions to the introduction of a new religion, distinct from that taught by Moses. The most decisive of these prophecies, in relation to this point, is that of Jeremiah,\u2014\u201cBehold the days come [are coming] saith the Lord, that I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> make a NEW COVENANT with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Israel \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers,\u201d &c.\n\nNow the system of divine Laws under which the Israelites lived, is, in the Books of Moses, always called (in our version) the \u201cCovenant\u201d which the Lord made with them. And in the Gospels and the Apostolic Epistles, the same word (in the Greek) is always applied to the christian system.\n\nThis, however, is likely to escape the notice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> English reader; because, in our version, the very same word Diatheke which, in reference to the Mosaic Law, is generally rendered COVENANT, is translated\u2014when it has reference to the Gospel\u2014by the word <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">TESTAMENT</a>. And even in the very passage of Exodus (xxiv. 8) which is cited in the ninth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of the Epistle to the Hebrews, the very word which our translators had before rendered \u201cCovenant,\u201d they have changed into \u201cTestament.\u201d (Heb. ix. 20.) And yet the word is so far from having different meanings in reference to the Law and to the Gospel, that, on the contrary, both the Lord Jesus Himself and his Apostles most plainly draw a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> between the two, and point out the circumstances of the former Covenants as types and shadows of the Gospel Dispensation.\n\nIn particular, as it was anciently the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> practice to ratify and sanction every kind of Covenant by the sacrifice of a victim, the shedding of whose blood was a necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>, so this took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>.\n\nMoses, on the occasion of the establishment of the LAW, offered a sacrifice, and sprinkled the blood of the victim on the people; saying, \u201cThi\n\n---\n\n1 These words signify in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> and the Greek \u201cThe Anointed,\u201d from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> practice of anointing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-KING\">king</a>, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, or a prophet, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the ceremony of appointing him to his office.\n\n2 Yet in Gal. iii. 15-19, it is translated Covenant, and what is more remarkable, the very same words in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> are translated, Heb. viii. 6, \u201cMediator of a Covenant,\u201d and in Heb. ix. 15, \u201cMediator of a Testament.\u201d\n\nIt would be unsuitable in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of this kind, to enter on the discussion of the interpretation of a disputed text, but it may be remarked:\n\nI. That the passage in Exod. xxiv., which is cited in Heb. ix., ought to have been translated in both by the same English words.\n\nII. That though we are accustomed to connect the idea of a covenant [<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>] with sealing and sealing, and not with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of a sacrificed victim; and again, are familiar with the idea of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>\u2019s bequeathing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> by a will, which is to take effect after his death,\u2014with the Jews it was the reverse. They (as well as many other ancient nations as may be seen in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>) were accustomed to see every covenant ratified by the blood of a victim. And, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, Wills they had none; since the Mosaic Law disposed of a man\u2019s property at his death. Accordingly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> one, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> to Hebrews (even though speaking of the Gospel alone), would have been likely to introduce a reference to Wills. But\u2014\n\nIII. The writer is evidently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> a parallel between the Mosaic Law and the Gospel. Now the Law was not at all of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of a Will [Testament], not being bequeathed by Moses at his death, but fully established forty years before. And accordingly,\n\nIV. We may observe, that, in the passage before us, the parallel drawn is not between Christ and Moses, but between Christ and the victims slain by Moses as the raiser of the Covenant.\n\nTo speak of the death of a \u201cTestator,\u201d therefore, totally destroys the parallel which plainly was in the writer\u2019s mind, and makes the whole passage meaningless. But when the death spoken of is understood of the death of the sacrificed victim\u2014even Jesus Christ, who offered Himself to die in our stead, and for our deliverance, the parallel which the writer is dwelling on becomes intelligible and striking.\nis the blood of the Covenant (Exod. xxiv. 8) [Testament] (Heb. ix. 20) which the Lord hath made with you.\" And the Lord Jesus, at the Last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">Supper</a>, when about to offer up Himself as a sacrifice, says, on giving to the disciples the wine which represented his blood, that is, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, \"This cup is the new Testament [Covenant] in my blood, which is shed for you.\"\n\nThe word Testament, therefore, whenever it occurs in Scripture, is always to be understood in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of \"Covenant\" [or \"Dispensation\"].\n\nThe Christian religion, then, though springing out of the Mosaic, of which it was the fulfilment and completion, yet was in itself a new Religion. It was the fruit, of which the Mosaic Dispensation was the blossom. And it was as distinct from it, and in many respects unlike it, as a fruit compared with the blossom which precedes it and produces it.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> which distinguish the Christian Dispensation from the Mosaic, are these three: 1. Spirituality; 2. Universality; and, 3. Unity. The new kingdom of God was to be \"not of this world,\" but spiritual; it was to be open to all mankind as its subjects; and it was to admit all of them to equal privileges.\n\nThe former kingdom of God was a kingdom of this world. The Lord was, as has already been pointed out, not only the God, but the temporal Ruler of the Israelites; prescribing to them not only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> with which He was to be worshipped, but also the civil regulations under which they were to live, and enforcing obedience by temporal rewards and penalties.\n\nJesus Christ, on the contrary, refused an earthly kingdom, when attempts were made to force it on Him, and declared that \"his kingdom was not of this world.\" He disclaimed all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to interfere in temporal concerns; saying to one who wished Him to decide between him and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, \"Who made me a judge or a divider over you?\" He bid his hearers submit to the civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, saying, \"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\" And, so far from promising victory, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> life, and worldly prosperity, to his followers, as a reward of their obedience to Him, He prepared them for suffering and death in his cause; even such as He endured Himself; and pronounced them \"blessed when men should hate and persecute\" them for His sake, saying, \"great is your reward in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>.\"\n\nFor, the rewards and punishments which formed the sanction of this New Dispensation were those of the next world, and those only. Jesus rebuked his disciples for proposing, in their zeal for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, to call <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> fire from heaven on a village which had rejected Him; as the Prophet Elias [Elijah] had been divinely commissioned to do, under the old dispensation. (Luke ix. 54.) Jesus reproved them, as \"not knowing what manner of spirit they were of,\" He having \"come not to destroy men's lives, but to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAVE\">save</a>.\"\n\nBut this was not from his regarding a rejection of Him as more pardonable than the sins of those who had lived before the days of the Gospel. He taught the reverse of this. For shortly after, when He sent out seventy disciples to preach the Gospel, He denounced heavier judgments than what had fallen on sinners of old, against such as should reject that Gospel. \"It shall be more tolerable,\" said He, \"for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SODOM\">Sodom</a> and Gomorrah\" (which did suffer destruction by fire from heaven) \"in the day of judgment, than for that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>.\" And while He forewarned his disciples that \"in the world they would have tribulation,\" He promised to the faithful Christian \"to raise him up at the last day,\" and to \"prepare a place\" for such, in his \"Father's house.\"\n\nThus different was the New Dispensation from the Old, in respect of the rewards and punishments which formed the sanction of each.\n\nThe Worship also that was required under the Gospel, was of a more spiritual character than that prescribed by the Law.\n\nIt is true, the Israelites were commanded to \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> the Lord their God, with all their heart, and with all their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, and with all their strength.\" But a great part of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of Him consisted (as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APOSTLE\">Apostle</a> Paul expresses it) \"in meats and drinks, and carnal ordinances\"\u2014that is, outward bodily acts; most of which had (as has been before observed) an inward hidden signification in reference to the Gospel.\n\n---\n\n1 \"I am not come,\" says our Lord, \"to destroy the Law and the Prophets, but to fulfil.\"\nJesus, on the contrary, tells the woman of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SAMARIA\">Samaria</a>, that the time is at hand \"when the true worshippers shall, neither on Mount Gerizim, nor at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, worship the Father;\" but that they \"shall worship Him in spirit and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>.\" (John iv.23.) What He means by worshipping in truth, and what the Apostle means by saying that \"the law was given by Moses, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> and truth came by Jesus Christ\" (John i.17), is not that the Mosaic religion was not true, but that its ordinances contained the shadow of that of which the Gospel contains the substance. The truth of the Gospel is not (in reference to the Law) truth as opposed to falsehood, but reality, as contrasted with shadows and figurative representations. Thus, we read in the Epistle to the Hebrews, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the blood of bulls and goats, &c., sanctify to the purifying of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>\" (that is, remove <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CEREMONIAL\">ceremonial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPURITY\">impurity</a>, so as to enable a man to attend the assemblies of worshippers), \"how much more shall the blood of Christ purify your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> from dead works.\"\n\nIn the Mosaic religion, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> is very great of what may be not improperly called \"Sacraments.\" For a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> portion of the very numerous ordinances of the LAW\u2014the various sacrifices, purifications, and other ceremonial observances,\u2014were of the nature of what we call Sacraments\u2014that is, outward visible signs [figures], divinely appointed, and having an inward meaning connected with religion. The worship, in short, of the Israelites, may be considered as almost made up of Sacraments.\n\nBut a great part of the inward signification of these Sacraments was hidden from the worshippers; though they were taught that a divine blessing would accompany their observance of those rites, in pious obedience to the Lord. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PASSOVER\">Passover</a>, for instance, all that they understood as signified in that ordinance, was the commemoration of their deliverance from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> which slew the Egyptians. But the more important part of its signification, the sacrifice of the true \"Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world,\" was not made known till the Gospel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a> appeared.\n\nUnder the Gospel, on the contrary, the religious rites instituted by Christ himself were only the Sacraments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BAPTISM\">Baptism</a> and the Lord's Supper: the one for the admission of members into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a>, and the other to commemorate his death for man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a>, and to represent our partaking of his Spirit. The one Sacrament denotes the spiritual Birth of the Christian; the other, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> support of his Spiritual Life.\u00b9\n\nAnd the signification of these two ordinances is much more clearly and fully explained to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> in the New Testament Scriptures, than the signification of the Mosaic ordinances was in the Law. And moreover, the directions given as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of observing these ordinances, are much less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> and particular than those given by Moses. For instance, there is nothing said in Scripture as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of leavened or unleavened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> at the Lord's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">Table</a>;\u2014or the posture of the communicants, or the words to be used, &c. These particulars, and also all other forms and ceremonies for religious worship, Jesus left to be regulated in and by each Church from time to time, with merely the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> from the Apostles, \"Let all things be done to edifying.\"\n\nUnder the LAW, in short, the worship prescribed contained a great number of outward acts, striking to the senses, and according to forms which were precisely laid down; while the inward signification of those forms was obscure and partially hidden. Under the Gospel, on the contrary, the worship prescribed was more spiritual; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> acts (as far as enjoined by Christ himself) being very few and simple, and without any precise directions as to the forms of them; while the inward signification of them is plainly made known.\n\nAnd in what relates to moral conduct also, the precepts given under the New Covenant, are much less numerous and less precise than those of the LAW. Not that Christians were meant to be less scrupulously careful in leading a virtuous life than the Israelites; but that they are left to regulate their conduct by the PRINCIPLES of\n\n\u00b9 John vi. 48\u201363. See also 1 Cor. xii. 13, where the Apostle gives exactly the above view of the two Sacraments, saying, \"By one Spirit ye are all baptized into one Body and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.\"\nthe Gospel, according to the best of their own judgment, instead of having a multitude of precise precepts laid down for their guidance.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">Just</a> as the christian worship was left to be regulated as to its FORMS, from time to time, by each Church, under the general principle of all \"being done to edifying,\" even so christian practice was left to be regulated by Christians themselves, in conformity with Gospel principles, and the examples set before us by Christ and his Apostles.\n\nThus not only does the Gospel require a morality in many respects higher and more perfect in itself than the Law, but it places morality universally on higher grounds.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">Gratitude</a> for the redeeming love of God in Christ, with mingled veneration and affection for the person of our great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a>, and an exalted emulation, leading us to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">tread</a> in his steps,\u2014an ardent longing to behold his glories and to enjoy his presence in the world to come,\u2014with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> effort to prepare for that better world,\u2014love towards our brethren for His sake who died for us and them,\u2014and, above all, the thought that the Christian is a part of \"the temple of the Holy Ghost\" who dwelleth in the Church,\u2014even the Spirit of Christ, \"without which we are none of His,\" a temple which we are bound to keep undefiled;\u2014these, and such as these, are the sublime principles of morality, into a conformity with which the Christian is to fashion his heart and his life; and they are such principles as the Mosaic dispensation could not furnish.\n\nThe Israelites, as not only living under a revelation which had but a shadow of the good things of the Gospel, but also as a dull and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a>-minded, and imperfectly civilised people, in a condition corresponding to that of childhood, were in few things left to their own moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>, but were furnished with precise rules in most points of conduct. These answered to the exact regulations under which children are necessarily placed, and which are gradually relaxed as they advance towards maturity; not by any means on the ground that good conduct is less required of men than children; but that they are expected to be more capable of regulating their own conduct by their own discretion, and of acting upon principle.\n\nWhen, then, the Mosaic code was abolished, we find no other system of rules substituted in its place. Our Lord and His Apostles enforced such duties as were the most liable to be neglected,\u2014corrected some prevailing errors,\u2014gave some particular directions which particular occasions called for,\u2014but laid down no set of rules for the conduct of a Christian: they laid down christian principles instead; they sought to implant christian dispositions. And this is the more remarkable, inasmuch as we may be sure, from the nature of man, that precise regulations, even though somewhat tedious to learn, and burdensome to observe, would have been highly acceptable to their converts. Hardly any restraint is so irksome to man (i.e. to \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> man\") as to be left to his own discretion, yet still required to regulate his conduct according to certain principles, and to steer his course through the intricate channels of life, with a constant vigilant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of his moral judgment. It is much more agreeable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> indolence (though at first sight the contrary might be supposed) to have a complete system of laws laid down, which are to be observed according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, not to the spirit,\u2014and which, as long as a man adheres to them, afford both a consolatory assurance of safety, and an unrestrained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> as to every point not determined by them,\u2014than to be called upon for incessant watchfulness,\u2014careful and candid self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>,\u2014and studious cultivation of certain moral dispositions.\n\nAccordingly, most, if not all systems of man's devising (whether corruptions of Christianity, or built on any other foundation) will be found, even in what appear their most rigid enactments, to be accommodated to this tendency of the human heart. When Mahomet, for instance, enjoined on his disciples a strict fast during a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, and an entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> from wine and from games of chance, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> of a precise portion of their property to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, leaving them at liberty, generally, to follow their own sensual and worldly inclinations, he imposed a far less severe task on them, than if he had required them constantly to control their appetites and passions, to repress covetousness, and to be uniformly temperate, charitable, and heavenly-minded. And had Paul been (as a false teacher\nalways will be) disposed to comply with the expectations and wishes which his disciples would naturally form, he would doubtless have referred them to some part of the Mosaic Law as their standard of morality, or would have substituted some other system of rules in its place. Indeed, there is strong reason to think (especially from what we find in 1st Corinthians), that something of this nature had actually been desired of him. He seems to have been applied to for more precise rules than he was willing to give; particularly as to the lawfulness of going to idol-feasts, and as to several points relative to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> and celibacy; concerning which and other matters, he gives briefly such directions as the occasion rendered indispensable, but breaks off into exhortations to \"use this world as not abusing it;\" and speedily recurs to the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the christian character, and the inculcation of christian principles. He will not be induced to enter into minute details of things forbidden and permitted,\u2014enjoined and dispensed with; and even when most occupied in repelling the suspicion that Gospel liberty exempts the Christian from moral obligation, instead of retaining or framing anew any system of prohibitions and injunctions, he urges upon his hearers the very consideration of their being exempt from any such childish trammels, as a reason for their aiming at a more perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> of life, on purer and more generous motives: \"Sin,\" he says, \"shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law but under grace:\" and he perpetually incites them to walk worthy of their vocation, on the ground of their being \"bought with a price;\" and bound to \"live unto Him who died for them;\"\u2014\"as risen with Christ\" to a new life of holiness,\u2014exhorted to \"set their affection on things above, not on things on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>;\"\u2014as \"living sacrifices\" to God;\u2014as \"the temple of the Holy Ghost,\" called upon to keep God's dwelling-place undefiled, and to abound in all \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of the Spirit,\" and as \"being delivered from the Law, that we should serve in newness of the Spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.\"\n\nHe who seeks, then (as many are disposed to do), either in the Old Testament, or in the New, for a precise code of laws by which to regulate his conduct, mistakes the character of our religion. It is indeed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, and a ruinous one, to think that we may \"continue in sin, because we are not under the law but under grace;\" but it is also an error, and a far <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONER\">commoner</a> one, to inquire of the Scriptures, in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> that may occur, what we are strictly bound to do or to abstain from, and to feel secure as long as we transgress no distinct commandment. But he who seeks with sincerity for christian principles will not fail to find them. If we endeavour, with the aid of the Holy Spirit, to trace on our own heart the delineation of the christian character which the Scriptures present, and to conform all our actions, and words, and thoughts, to that character, our heavenly Teacher will enable us to have a right judgment in all things, and we shall be \"led by the Spirit\" of Christ to follow his steps, and to \"purify ourselves even as He is pure:\" that when He shall appear, we may be made like unto Him, and may behold Him as He is.\n\nBesides Spirituality, another striking feature of the Christian Dispensation, as contrasted with the Mosaic, is its UNIVERSALITY. It was to be unlimited, both in time and in place. The Mosaic Law being only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> for the Gospel, was to come to an end on the establishment of the new Kingdom of Heaven, which is to continue to the end of the world.\n\nAnd again, the Old Dispensation was designed for one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>; the New for all nations. The \"People of God\" was, henceforth, to comprise, not merely the \"seed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> after the flesh,\" but all mankind, as many as would embrace the Gospel. \"As many as received Him (Jesus Christ), to them gave He power to become the sons of God.\" (John i.) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Moses, and of those who came after him under the Law, was, \"What nation is there so great, that hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is, in all things that we call upon Him for?\" and \"He hath not dealt so with any nation; neither have\n\n---\n\n1 Hence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Catholic (\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2\u2014universal) is applied to the Christian Church\u2014specially in opposition to the Jewish. It may be remarked, by the way, that the term Roman Catholic does, in strictness of speech, imply a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>,\u2014Roman suggesting a necessary connexion with one place, while Catholic denotes having no necessary connexion with any one place more than another.\nthe heathen knowledge of his laws.\" The language of Jesus Christ and his Apostles was, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature;\" \"Go and teach (make disciples of) all nations;\" \"There is neither Jew, nor Greek, barbarian, Scythian, bond, or free.\" And in writing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENTILE\">Gentile</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEVERS\">believers</a>, the Apostle calls them (Gal. vi. 16) \"the Israel of God;\" and says, \"if ye are Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>.\" (Gal. iii. 29.)\n\nHence it was, no doubt, that the Apostles never applied the term \"Christians\" to the members of any church. It was not, of course, that they were ashamed of it; but they seem to have chosen not to adopt any new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>, but to confine themselves to those which had been applied to God's People of old; in order to point out that He had now admitted Gentiles into the number.\n\nThe Israelites had always been called \"brethren,\" being of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RACE\">race</a>. They are also called a \"holy\" people (\"saints\"), as being dedicated to the Lord; and his \"chosen\" [\"elect\"] People. And hence Christians are called \"the brethren,\" the \"elect,\" and \"saints,\" (\u1f00\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03b9) that is holy, as being dedicated at baptism to the Lord Jesus.\n\nOne necessary circumstance in such a Dispensation, was, that it should not be like the Mosaic, a local religion. The Jews, indeed, clung (and still cling) to the notion that, even when all the world should be brought to the knowledge of the true God, still their nation should have a pre-eminence; and that the Temple of Jerusalem should be the great centre of religious worship for all mankind. And we know there are even some Christians who expect that Jesus Christ is to return to this earth in bodily person, and reign at Jerusalem in great worldly splendour for a thousand years. But such notions are quite at variance with the whole character of the Gospel, as described in our Sacred Books.\n\nThe Temple at Jerusalem\u2014\"the place which the Lord had chosen to cause his name to dwell there,\" that is, to manifest his presence\u2014was to be totally and finally destroyed. And Jesus declared, that \"wheresoever even two or three should be gathered together in his name, He would be there in the midst of them.\" And hence, a christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a>\u2014not a literal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>\u2014was to be henceforth a portion of the temple of the MOST <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">HIGH</a>.\n\n\"Know ye not,\" says the Apostle Paul, \"that your bodies are a temple of the Holy Ghost, which dwelleth in you?\" (1 Cor. vi. 19.)\n\nAnd as the collective body of worshippers was called a temple, so the individual Christians are called \"living <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>\" of God's temple. \"Ye as living stones, are builded together into an holy temple to the Lord\" (1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> ii. 6). Hence arose the use of the word \"edify,\" (\u1f10\u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c9) literally \"to build up\"\u2014as applied to christian instruction and exhortation.\n\nWhile Jesus Christ was on earth in bodily person, HE was the temple of the Lord; inasmuch as \"in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily\" (Col. ii. 9). And accordingly, He not only speaks expressly \"of the temple of his body\" (John ii. 21), but makes several allusions (which are often overlooked) to this character of Himself.\n\nAnd this, by the way, is a clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his claiming a divine character. For the Jews understood (as He well knew) by \"the temple of the Lord,\" not a synagogue,\u2014a place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> for worshippers, but \"the habitation where his honour (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>) dwelleth.\"\n\nAnd it is worth remarking, that they also understood his calling Himself the \"Son of God,\"\n\n---\n\n1 The word Christian (\u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2) occurs but three times in the New Testament, Acts xi. 26, xxvi. 28; 1 Peter iv. 16.\u2014In no one of these places do we find it applied by Christians themselves to one another. It is mentioned as a name first given to the disciples at Antioch in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, doubtless by the Romans, as the word is of Latin formation. King Agrippa, again, uses the word in speaking to Paul, and the Apostle Peter introduces it as denoting what was accounted a crime by the heathen rulers. \"If any man suffer for being a Christian, let him not be ashamed.\"\n\n2 There are two words in the original which are both translated \"Temple;\" \u1f05\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, that is, the \"sacred place,\" which included the courts of the Temple; and \u039d\u03b1\u03cc\u03c2, (from \u039d\u03b1\u03ce, \"to dwell\") the \"House of God,\" which was the building in which sacrifices were offered. For this was the main purpose of a temple; which was not (like the synagogues, and like our churches and chapels) a place for religious assemblies.\n\n\u039d\u03b1\u03cc\u03c2 is the word used by our Lord when he calls his body a temple, and by Paul, when he applies it to Christians.\n\n3 \u1f41 \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u1f26\u03bb\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03af \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03bb\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03af, not merely dwelt, as in our version, \"among us.\"\n\n4 So the Evangelist\u2014\"The Word became flesh and tabernacled\" (\u1f10\u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7) not merely dwelt, as in our version, \"among us.\"\nand saying, \"that God was his own proper Father,\" as a claim to be a divine person. His words, indeed, might, in themselves, conceivably, bear another meaning. But He must have known that they so understood Him. And if they had mistaken his meaning, He would not have failed to correct their mistake: else He would have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> false witness against Himself.\n\nThey rightly understood Him, therefore, to be claiming a divine character. And thereupon they pronounced him guilty of blasphemy (Matt. xxvi. 65), and liable to death by their Law (Deut. xviii. 20), as teaching men to worship another besides the true God.\n\nFor they did not expect that the Christ was to be a divine person; as is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> from their being unable to solve the question which Jesus put to them, about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>'s calling him LORD (Mark xii. 37). When therefore, they understood Him to \"make Himself God\" (John x. 33), this was so far from favouring their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in him as the Christ, that it convinced them of his being a false pretender and a blasphemer.\n\nWhen Jesus departed from the earth, He sent to his disciples the promised \"Comforter,\" to abide with them for ever;\" even the Holy Spirit, whose temple is the whole body of Christians throughout the world. And every christian congregation, as has been already observed, is a portion of this temple; each individual Christian being called in Scripture a \"living <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>\" of it.\n\nBut our Lord takes care to make his disciples understand that it is not a different Being they are to look for, and who is to be their new Master; but a different manifestation of the same God\u2014a return of their Master to them under a new character. For He says expressly, \"I will not leave you comfortless, I will come unto you:\"\u2014\"I will see you again; and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man taketh from you;\"\u2014\"if any man love me, he will keep my saying, and my Father will love him; and We will come unto him, and make our abode with him.\" And the like, in several other passages.\n\nAnd the Apostles, accordingly, speak of \"the LORD (that is, Jesus Christ) being the Spirit (2 Cor. iii. 17), and assure us that \"if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.\" (Rom. viii. 9.)\n\nThe same God, then, who to the Israelites, was made known only as Creator and Governor (God the Father), was afterwards manifested to Christians as being also the Redeemer (God the Son), and the Sanctifier (God the Holy Ghost): and He is to be acknowledged by them in this threefold manifestation, according to our Saviour's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INJUNCTION\">injunction</a> to \"baptise in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\"\n\nThere have been, therefore, in all, three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">Temples</a> of the ONE GOD; first, under the Old Dispensation, the Temple at Jerusalem; secondly, during the abode on earth of the Lord Jesus, \"the Temple of his Body;\" and, thirdly, (that which is also often called Christ's body.) (Eph. iv. 12, 16), the holy Catholic or Universal Church, comprising all believers throughout the world.\n\nThis third and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> manifestation of the ONE GOD plainly belongs to a Dispensation characterised (as we have said) by UNIVERSALITY.\n\nAnother distinguishing feature of the New Dispensation, was, as has been said, its UNITY (or Oneness); by which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>, that it not only admits all mankind to christian privileges, but all of them to equal privileges. \"There is,\" as the Apostle expresses it, \"one Lord, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, one baptism.\" \"There is neither Greek, nor Jew, barbarian, Scythian, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BONDMAN\">bondman</a>, or freeman.\" (Eph. iv. 5, and Col. iii. 11.)\n\nThis christian unity (\u1f41\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1) is often alluded to, and earnestly dwelt on, by our Sacred writers. But the passages relating to it are sometimes imperfectly understood, or entirely mistaken.\n\nIt does not mean agreement in doctrine, nor yet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCORD\">concord</a> and mutual good-will; though these are strongly insisted on by the Apostles. But the unity which they speak of is something distinct from these.\n\nNor, again, does it mean that all Christians belong, or ought to belong, to some one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> on earth. For this is what the Apostles never aimed at, and what never was actually the state of things, from the time that the christian religion extended beyond the city of Jerusalem.\n\nThe teaching of Scripture upon this subject,\nclearly is, that believers on earth are part of a great society (church or congregation), of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HEAD\">Head</a> is in heaven, and of which many of the members only \"live unto God,\" or exist in his counsels,\u2014some having long since departed, and some being not yet born. Of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> the centre cannot possibly be on earth; and, accordingly, the Apostle Paul expressly distinguishes the christian church [assembly or congregation] \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 from that of Israel:\u2014\"Ye [that is, ye Christians] are not come to the mount that might be touched; [as the Israelites were collected in a great assembly (those of them that were alive that day) round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SINAI\">Sinai</a>, as a holy place on earth] . . . . but ye are come to Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-ZION\">Zion</a>, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a>, to the general assembly and church of the first-born, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant\" (Heb. xii. 18-24). So, in the Epistle to the Galatians:\u2014\"Mount Sinai answered to Jerusalem which now is, and is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-BONDAGE\">bondage</a> with her children; but Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.\" (Gal. iv. 25, 26.)\n\nThe Universal Church of Christ may therefore be said to be ONE in reference to HIM, its supreme Head in heaven; but it is not one Community on earth. And even so the Human race is one, in respect of the one Creator and Governor; but this does not make it one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAMILY\">Family</a>, or one State.\n\nAll men, again, ought to live in peace, and to be kindly disposed towards every fellow-creature. And all are bound to agree in thinking and doing whatever is right. But they are not at all bound to live under one single government, extending over the whole World. Nor, again, are all nations bound to have the same form of government, regal or republican, &c. That is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> left to their discretion. But all are bound to do their best to promote the great objects for which all government is instituted:\u2014good order, security of person and property, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and public prosperity.\n\nAnd even so the Apostles founded christian communities, all based on the same principles, and having the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in view, but quite independent of each other, and having no one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> Head on Earth.\n\nThe Apostles, indeed, exercised a general government over the various churches which they founded; but it does not appear that they appointed any persons to succeed them in that general government. We read of their appointing \"Elders in every city,\" but we do not read of their setting, or intending to set, any one over the whole Church.\n\nAny one who looks at the account of Paul's taking leave of the Elders of Ephesus and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILETUS\">Miletus</a> (Acts xx.), whom he expected never to see again, will plainly see that he could not possibly have had any notion of any supreme central authority, lodged either in the church of Jerusalem, or of Rome, or in Peter and his successors, or in any General <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a>. For he there directly foretells that false teachers should arise out of their own body [that is, from amongst the clergy], and anxiously impresses on them the best advice he could think of for guarding against such a danger. Yet that advice is only to watch, and remember what he had taught them. This seems to imply that each particular church was left sufficient means within itself of ascertaining the true doctrine of Christ, continuing, and preserving it; but that the actual preservation of such doctrine depended on the watchfulness of the churches themselves. For the occasion was one on which he could not have failed to bid them have recourse, in case of any difficulties or disputes among themselves, (such as he actually foresaw,) to some central Authority, if any such had existed, or were to be set up.\n\nNor does the Apostle Peter (though writing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">Second</a> Epistle in the near prospect of death (2 Pet. i. 14, 15), and anxious to provide a record of his teaching that might last after his decease), say a word to the disciples of the duty of submitting to his successors; but refers them back for guidance to the words of the holy prophets, and the commandments of the apostles, and to his own letters, and to those of Paul.\n\nIn the beginning of the Revelation of John, too, we find the Lord addressing each of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> churches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> as severally independent of any earthly power, and responsible to Him alone for their conduct as christian churches.\nIt is plain, therefore, that the christian Unity spoken of in Scripture did not consist in the placing of all Christians in one Society under one government on Earth.\n\nIt consisted (as we have said) in the admission of all men to equal christian privileges, instead of having two or more different kinds or degrees of Christianity, for different classes of persons.\n\nNow, there did exist something of this kind under the Mosaic Dispensation. The \"devout Gentiles\" (sometimes called \"Proselytes of the Gate\"), were admitted to worship in the outer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of the Temple, and to frequent the Synagogues. Those who had embraced the whole Mosaic Law (who were called \"Proselytes of righteousness\") were accounted as ranking higher than the others, and next in holiness to the Israelites by birth. Then, of the born Israelites, the Levites were more especially dedicated to the Lord than those of the other Tribes, and were employed in his immediate Service about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABERNACLE\">Tabernacle</a>, or the Temple. Of the Levites themselves, again, the family of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AARON\">Aaron</a> were alone admissible to the priesthood. And lastly, of the Priests themselves, none except the high priest was permitted to enter the Holy of Holies,\u2014where he offered the yearly sacrifice on the great day of atonement.\n\nAnd these several gradations, it is to be observed, are something quite different from the various degrees of moral worth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, or of intelligence and knowledge, in individuals.\n\nOne Israelite (and the like may be said of Christians) might exceed another of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">Tribe</a> and Family, in pious obedience to the Lord; and a third might surpass them both. But these differences would not be distinctions introduced by the Mosaic Religion; but merely those of the individual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of those men. And again, a pious Israelite, of superior understanding, and of a reflecting turn of mind, and of more extensive knowledge than the generality, would have a clearer, and more intelligent, and more comprehensive view of some parts of the Revelation given him, and of God's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> generally, than another, equally pious, but of humbler powers and attainments. And the like must be the case with Christians also.\n\nBut these differences between one man and another, are such as we find to exist in reference to all subjects, and do not particularly pertain to the Mosaic system of Religion; not being introduced and created by it.\n\nThose distinctions, on the contrary, which were noticed just above, are such as did specially belong to the religion of Moses, and formed a part of the Dispensation.\n\nThe Gospel, on the other hand, admitted of no such gradations as those established under the Law.\n\nVarious Officers, indeed, were appointed in the christian churches; because no Society can subsist without them. But all persons, of whatever Race or Family, were admissible, if properly qualified, to any Office.\n\nAnd again, (as was said just above,) men of superior intelligence and mental cultivation, will be able, by piously and humbly employing their powers in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> (among other things) of the christian Scriptures, to take a clearer and more intelligent view of the Gospel revelation, than those of ordinary abilities and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>; provided they are careful not to indulge in rash conjectures respecting things beyond human reason, and which God has not thought fit to reveal.\n\nSuch men, if they do use this care, will find that the more they advance in general cultivation of mind, the more will the prospect of divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and goodness spread around them; the horizon, as it were, extending itself in proportion to their elevation.\n\nBut this (as was observed above) is a kind of distinction between man and man, which was not introduced by the Gospel, but takes place in all subjects.\n\nNor does such a distinction make one man more a Christian, properly speaking, than another. In fact, a learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">Philosopher</a> would be a worse Christian than pious men of ordinary ability and education, if he were content to remain, in point of religious knowledge, just on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with these, while in all other matters he was intellectually superior to them. He would be like a person\n\n---\n\n1 *Proselyte*, one who comes over to some religion or religious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>.\noffering as the *tithe* of an increased produce, the same *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a>* amount as would be a fair proportion from a smaller or less fertile field.\n\nAnd in respect of piety of sentiment, also, and purity of conduct, one man may be a better Christian than another, that is, he may make a *better use* of his christian privileges. But the Gospel itself does not exclude any man from any christian privileges to which it admits others.\n\nThis is one of the points wherein (as has been said) it differs from the Mosaic Law.\n\nAnd this feature of the Gospel was one which proved a great stumbling-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> to the Jews. They could not easily reconcile themselves to the thought of Gentiles being placed completely on a level with them. And they clung to the idea that the Jews by Race must continue to be in an especial manner God's peculiar People, even when both they and the Gentiles should have become subjects of Christ's kingdom. And even among the Gentile Christians themselves, there seems to have been a tendency to consider the different \"spiritual [miraculous] gifts\" bestowed on different persons, as dividing Christians into so many distinct Orders. This tendency we find the Apostle Paul earnestly contending against in several parts of his writings; especially in 1 Cor. xii.\n\nThe miraculous gifts were bestowed not for the benefit of the possessor, but of the Church. And they did not either *prove* the possessor to be peculiarly acceptable to God, or necessarily *make* him so. For Judas Iscariot, who afterwards betrayed his Master, had been endowed, along with the other Apostles, with miraculous powers. And our Lord declares that He will say, at the Day of Judgment, to some who shall boast of having, in his Name, \"done many mighty works,\" \"I know you not; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.\"\n\nYet in all ages of the Church, there has been a tendency, more or less, to draw some unwarranted distinctions between ordinary Christians, and those to whom the name of Saints has been confined, either from their having been inspired, like the Evangelists and Apostles, or from their being supposed to possess some extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> holiness, beyond what is expected of Christians generally.\n\nThe Apostles, on the contrary, (as was ob-\n\nserved above,) call *all* Christians \"Saints;\" as being all *dedicated* to Christ in Baptism, and all admitted to be equal partakers (as far as relates to their own holiness of character, and power of becoming acceptable to God) of his sanctifying Spirit. There is no hint given that a less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of personal holiness will suffice for us, than for an Apostle; and Peter, or Paul, however superior to us in their miraculous gifts, yet called themselves Saints in reference not to anything peculiar to them, but to what was *common* to them with us.\n\nNevertheless, one may find persons, even now, who seem to regard Christianity as not, in reality, one religion, but two; one, for persons of pre-eminent holiness, or who are admitted to certain superior christian privileges, beyond the generality; and the other for the multitude; who are to believe implicitly whatever the most eminent Saints think fit to impart, and to do whatever they bid them.\n\nBut nothing can be more at variance than such a notion is with the whole character of the Gospel Dispensation. For this was designed as a revelation to men of all classes, in every tolerably-civilised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. And the endeavour of the Apostles was to \"make known the mystery of the Gospel\" to *all*, in proportion as they were *able and willing* to receive it. And they laboured, by assiduous instruction and exhortation, to *make* men, more and more, thus able and willing. They urged them to \"grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.\" And they reckoned themselves to be \"pure from the blood of all men,\" only inasmuch as they \"had not shunned to declare to them *all* the counsel of God.\"\n\nWhen we look back to these distinguishing points in the Gospel Dispensation which have been here noticed\u2014its *Spirituality*, *Universality*, and *Unity*\u2014as well as to several other remarkable features of it, we cannot but perceive what a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> they afford of its divine origin.\n\nIt was altogether the most unlikely thing to have occurred to the mind of any man, whether dreaming enthusiast or crafty impostor. And of all men, Jews were the most unlikely to have\nimagined anything of the kind. Indeed, the great stumbling-block to the Jews was its being so utterly at variance (as has been remarked above) with all their most deeply-rooted prejudices, and all their long-cherished hopes.\n\nBut it was almost equally at variance with many of the notions of the Heathen also. And these latter had nearly as much difficulty in receiving a religion from Jews\u2014a people generally despised by them\u2014as the Jews had, in acknowledging the \"Gentiles\" as fellow-heirs with themselves. And both parties\u2014Jews and Gentiles\u2014had never conceived an idea of such a thing as a religion without any literal Temple, without an Altar, without Sacrifices, and without any Sacrificing Priest on earth.\n\nSuch a Religion could never have been invented, in those days, by any man, Jew or Gentile; and could never have been established throughout the chief part of the civilised World, except by the overpowering force of miraculous proofs.","sp":487,"ep":498},{"h":"INTRODUCTORY","t":"\u00a7 1. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAN\">Plan</a> of this Dissertation.\n\nThe year 1850 may be said to complete the Third century of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> scientific progress, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> the Fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we include its earliest dawn. To each of these ages of discovery may be assigned a peculiarity in the character of its improvements, and even in the methods which conduced to that improvement.\n\nBetween 1450 and 1550 (a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> so distinguished in letters and the arts), some great truths in physics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> had presented themselves to a few precocious minds, yet they had not received any public acknowledgment, nor perhaps an adequate demonstration. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALGEBRA\">Algebra</a> then first became a science. Leonardo da Vinci made the earliest steps since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, in rational <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, and Copernicus almost at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of this period promulgated the true system of the world.\n\nBut the next centenary (1550-1650) was the first of true scientific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>. Its characteristic feature was the vindication of observation and experiment as the prime essentials to the increase of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> knowledge, with the consequent repudiation of the dogmas of the schoolmen, and the baseless methods of a priori reasoning. The men of science formed a goodly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARRAY\">array</a> at this stirring time; and signal were their triumphs. Galileo was beyond all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. His sagacity, his knowledge, his versatility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a>, his ingenuity as an inventor, his success in prosecuting his discoveries, and his zeal and eloquence in making known their importance, gave him an enviable pre-eminence even amidst a mighty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a> laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the canons of a new method in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> which Gilbert and Kepler, as well as Galileo, had already acted on. Napier and Descartes prepared for the general application of mathematics in the coming struggle.\n\nThe hundred years which next succeeded (1650-1750) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the triumphant application of mathematics to Mechanics and Physics, and the establishment of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of any age, that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GRAVITATION\">Gravitation</a>. The preparatory labours of a hundred and fifty years were brought, chiefly by the unparalleled sagacity and genius of Newton, to a speedy and dazzling climax. His success brought numerous and worthy labourers into the field, but they found enough to do in gathering in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> which he had prepared for them.\n\nIf we look for the distinguishing characteristic of the centenary period <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> elapsed (1750-1850), we find it in this,\u2014that it has drawn far more largely upon Experiment as a means of arriving at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> than had previously been done. By a natural conversion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, the knowledge thus acquired has been applied with more freedom and boldness to the exigencies of mankind, and to the farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the secrets of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. If we compare the now extensive subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEAT\">Heat</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">Electricity</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNETISM\">Magnetism</a>, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of these sciences as understood in 1750, or if we think of the astonishing revival of physical and experimental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a> (which had well nigh slumbered for more than a century) during the too short lives of Young and Fresnel, we shall be disposed to admit\nthe former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the statement; and when we recollect that the same period has given birth to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>-engine of Watt, with its application to shipping and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RAILWAYS\">railways</a>,\u2014to the gigantic telescopes of Herschel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Rosse, wonderful as works of art as well as instruments of sublime discovery,\u2014to the electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TELEGRAPH\">telegraph</a>, and to the tubular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>,\u2014we shall be ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> the last part of the proposition, that science and art have been more indissolubly united than at any previous period.\n\nThe Dissertation of Professor Playfair closes with the period of Newton; that of Sir John Leslie, professedly devoted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the eighteenth century, embraces some matters which belong more properly to those which preceded and followed it. After considering how I might best carry out the plan of these essays, I have adopted the period from about the year 1775 to 1850 as the general limit of my review. We may imagine this period, of three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a century preceding the present time, to be divided into three lesser intervals of 25 years each, which have also some peculiar features of their own.\n\nFrom 1775 to 1800 many branches of science still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in the comparatively inert state which characterized a great part of the eighteenth century. There were, however, two or three notable exceptions. One was the continued successful solution of the outstanding difficulties of the Theory of Gravity applied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, a task in which the continental mathematicians, and of these, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>, Lagrange and Laplace, had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> rivals, or even coadjutors, on this side of the channel; Another was the foundation of Sidereal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a> by Sir William Herschel; and the last was the commencement of a system of Chemical Philosophy based on new and important experiments, and including the laws of heat in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, which at that period very naturally ranged themselves within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of the chemist. In this department two British and one foreign name stand conspicuous, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>, Cavendish, and Lavoisier. I do not of course <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to affirm that other branches of science were not cultivated with success within the exact period of which we speak. Electricity, for instance, first statical, afterwards that of the pile, had a share in the discoveries and speculations of the time. But these were rather the mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of what had previously been thought of; or the first dawn of future important results, whose development fills a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> space in the succeeding story. Volta and his inventions belong rather to the nineteenth than to the eighteenth century.\n\nThe first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the present century attained a higher and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> celebrity. Scarcely a branch of physical science but received important and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> additions. Physical Astronomy indeed, no longer filled so large a space in the page of discovery, simply because the exhaustive labours of the geometers of the former period had brought it to a stage of perfection nearly co-ordinate with the means of observation, and because, by the publication of the M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste, Laplace had rendered available M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste and precise the masses of scattered research accumulated by the labours of a century since the close of Newton's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of discovery. It was in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> a new book of \"Principia,\"\u2014not, indeed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of one, but of many; nor of a few years, but of two generations at least. Still there it was, a great monument of successful toil, which, like its prototype, was for many years to be studied, even by minds of the highest order, rather than to be enlarged.\n\nBut the other branches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Natural Philosophy</a> were now to make a stride, such as perhaps no preceding time had witnessed. The science of Optics was speedily expanded almost twofold, both in its facts and in its doctrines. Galvanic Electricity disclosed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of phenomena not less brilliant and unexpected in themselves than important from the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> they threw on the still dawning science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, and from the power of the tool which they placed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of philosophers. Before the first quarter of the present century closed, the important and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> suspected connection between Electricity and Magnetism was revealed, and its immediate consequences had been traced out with almost unparalleled ingenuity and expedition. The basis of the science of Radiant Heat, slightly anticipated by the philosophers of the eighteenth and even the seventeenth centuries (Lambert and Mariotte), was finally laid in a distinct form, assigning to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>, heat, an independent position dissociated from grosser matter, such as light had long enjoyed. Astronomy, though enriched on the very first night of the new century by the discovery of a small planet, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HERALD\">herald</a> of so many more of the same class, made perhaps less signal progress; but Chemistry, besides the aid it received from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the pile, had a triumph peculiarly its own in the addition of the comprehensive doctrine of Definite Proportions, destined to throw at some later time a steady light on the vexed question of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of matter. The great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of scientific names of the first order of merit concerned in these numerous discoveries marks the extraordinary fertility of the period. They are imperfectly comprehended in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a>: Young, Malus, Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Brewster, Fresnel, and Arago; Volta, Dalton, Davy, and Oersted; Prevost, Leslie, and Fourier; Gauss, Ivory, Olbers, Bessel, and Encke.\n\nOf the twenty-five years just elapsed, it is not so easy to speak with precision. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of criticism may be fairly uttered with that reserve which every one must feel in speaking of his immediate contemporaries. Yet it may perhaps be stated without just cause either of offence or regret, that it has not on the whole been characterized by the full maturity of so many commanding minds. Of the great discoverers of the former period, several survived and continued their efficient labours during no small por-\n\nPeriod 1825-1850.\ntion of the latter; and a few happily still remain to claim the respect and veneration of their disciples and successors. But the vast steps so recently made in Optics, in Electricity, in Magnetism, in Thermotics, and in Chemical principles, tended of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> to call forth such an amount of laborious detail in the defining and connecting of facts and laws, and the deductions of the theories started to explain them, as seemed to render fresh and striking originality somewhat hopeless, whilst they occasioned a vast amount of useful employment to minds of every order of talent. The undulatory Theory of Light, nobly blocked out by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASSIVE\">massive</a> labours of Young and Fresnel, has afforded still unexhausted material to the mathematician on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and to the experimentalist on the other; and ably have they fulfilled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> task, adding at the same time discoveries whose importance and difficulty would have made them still more prominent, had they not been the legitimate consequences of a still greater discovery already in our possession. Nearly the same might have been said for the sciences of Electricity, Electromagnetism, and Electro-chemistry, had not the comparative newness of the whole doctrine of these sciences, and the suddenness of their first rise, and, perhaps still more, the appearance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> of the very highest merit, Mr Faraday, who fortunately attached himself to this special department, made the last thirty years an almost unbroken period of discovery. Radiant Heat, too, has been successfully advanced by labours comparable perhaps to those which marked its first rise as a science, and some other topics connected with heat have risen into great and practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>. Astronomy has been prosecuted with a systematic assiduity and success, especially at the British and Russian national observatories, which yields to that of no former period, whilst physical astronomy has been cultivated by methods of still improved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, and has achieved one triumph which France need not grudge to England, nor England to France,\u2014so signal as to be placed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> consent in a position superior to any since the first publication of the theory of gravitation, more than a century and a half before. This was the prediction of the position in space of a planet whose existence was unknown except by the disturbance which it produced in the movements of another. Terrestrial Magnetism has, for the first time, aspired to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of an exact science. In an illustrious philosopher of Germany, it has found its Kepler; and the combination of national efforts in collecting reliable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> from the remotest corners of the globe is characteristic of the practical energy of the age. Pure Chemistry has been cultivated with extraordinary assiduity; but though some general principles have emerged, none are comparable, from their importance, to the discovery of Dalton. To cite, then, at present, but a few names, amongst the most conspicuous benefactors of science of the last, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> period, are MM. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRY\">Airy</a>, Cauchy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, and MacCullagh; MM. Faraday, Melloni, and Gauss; Sir John Herschel, M. Struve, and Lord Rosse; MM. Plana, Poisson, Leverrier, and Adams; MM. Mitscherlich, Liebig, and Dumas.\n\nIt seems to me impossible to exclude from a review, however slight, of contemporary progress in the exact sciences, the advances which have accrued to them both directly, and, as it were, reflexively, by the astonishing progress of the Mechanical Arts. The causes, indeed, which called them forth are somewhat different from those which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> in more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a>, though scarcely more difficult, studies. Increasing national wealth, numbers, and enterprise, are stimulants unlike the laurels, or even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> medals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a>, and the quiet applause of a few studious men. But the result is not less real, and the advance of knowledge scarcely more indirect. The masterpieces of civil engineering\u2014the Steam Engine, the Locomotive Engine, and the Tubular Bridge\u2014are only experiments on the powers of nature on a gigantic scale, and are not to be compassed without inductive skill as remarkable and as truly philosophic as any effort which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of science exerts, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> only the origination of great theories, of which one or two in a hundred years may be considered as a liberal allowance. Whilst then we claim for Watt a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> amongst the eminent contributors to the progress of science in the eighteenth century, we must reserve a similar one for the Stephenses and the Brunels of the present: and whilst we are proud of the changes wrought by the increase of knowledge during the last twenty-five years on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, we must recollect that these very changes, and the inventions which have occasioned them, have stamped perhaps the most characteristic feature\u2014its intense practicalness\u2014on the science itself of the same period.\n\nHaving thus briefly reviewed the course of discovery since the latter portion of the eighteenth century, I proceed in the succeeding chapters to attempt to sketch it more in detail, dividing the sciences into this groups, and in each of these endeavouring to present a lively view of its progress by connecting it with the individual career of the eminent men who have most contributed thereto, and introducing collaterally the chief results obtained by their contemporaries. In this manner I hope, on the one hand, to escape the formality of a history of science, and the meagre detail which our limits would prescribe to so vast a subject; and on the other to be enabled to impress upon the reader (as seems to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of these Essays) the leading facts and features of discovery in every age, together with the intellectual characteristics of the greatest minds which contributed to it.\n\nIt is with no overweening confidence that I lay the\nresult of this attempt before the reader. During the lengthened period of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of this Dissertation\u2014protracted by indisposition and untoward circumstances of different kinds, I have had abundant leisure to reflect on the advantages and disadvantages of a plan which I had sketched in the previous paragraphs, at the very opening of my task. I am aware that a rigid criticism awaits every attempt like the present. I am aware also, that it is far easier to detect real faults, especially of omission, than to make sufficient allowance for the exceeding difficulty and delicacy of the undertaking. I have but one ground of confidence, and that is so strong, that I trust it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> enable me calmly to meet every just critical reflection. I am conscious of having written in a spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> impartiality whether as regards persons or subjects, and that I have exercised to the full amount of my opportunities what powers of judgment I possess. I have striven to speak judicially and historically whether of friend or stranger, the dead or the living, Englishman or Foreigner. What I have felt the most constant effort, has been the needful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of meritorious names, far more numerous than those especially included and dwelt upon in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>. But this has appeared to me the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> point of my whole plan. The labourers in science have been in these latter days so numerous, that had I noticed, even briefly, every one who had made a real step in science, my pages must have been crowded by names and titles of books. Even with the extension of bulk to which this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> has gradually and unavoidably grown (nearly double of its projected amount), the reader would rather have been bewildered than led by the perusal of such a catalogue. Besides, since such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> historical synopsis forms very generally an introduction to the several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of the Encyclopedia, to repeat it all here would have been but a tedious redundancy. No one conversant with such matters will imagine that I have saved myself any labour by this particularity of selection. On the contrary, it would have cost no effort to enumerate under each subject the living or recently deceased authors upon it who are best known; such a detail must have left a vague and shadowy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the mind of the general reader, and when regard is paid to the necessary limits of the essay, and the multitude of technical details and technical words which there is no space to define and illustrate, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that the perusal must have been rendered as dry and unpalatable to those who seek general and elementary yet clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, as it would have been tantalizing and unsatisfactory to the accomplished student, or to the man of science in search of particular historical details.\n\nThe end at which I have aimed is to select the more striking landmarks of progress in each subject in each age, and endeavour to connect them with the character and position of all the more eminent discoverers, thus conveying to the general reader sufficient information on the limited number of particular subjects discussed, and interesting him not only in the science but in the individuals. Then, by a few slighter touches only, and the mention of some secondary names, to connect with one another these brighter periods of eminent progress, in which every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> and every age feels a just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>.\n\nThat by many I shall be considered to have dwelt too much on some eras of invention, and to have omitted others not less important, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of judgment which it is impossible not to anticipate, but equally impossible to prevent. I will only add that I have endeavoured to extend my impartiality to subjects as well as to persons; and that I have not intentionally dwelt longer on the topics of my own predilection than on those naturally considered by other persons equally or more important. Many subjects as well as persons familiarly known to me are scarcely, if at all, mentioned in these pages. To leave some definite and vivid impressions, selected solely for their importance, on the mind of my reader, has been the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> constantly before me during the composition of this work.\n\nIt will be seen from the preceding paragraphs, that I have deviated in some respects from the scheme of my two distinguished predecessors in the composition of the Dissertations on Science, Professor Playfair and Sir John Leslie. The essay of the former, which is the more finished and methodical, is admirably adapted to the period of the history of science of which he had principally to treat; the period, namely, of Galileo, Bacon, Newton, and Leibnitz. But the amount of material was smaller, and the principle of selection was also much simpler. The positive science of that age might almost be reduced to two heads, Astronomy, including its mechanical principles, and Optics. It was an age not more distinguished for the Truths it disclosed, than for the invention and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> appreciation of the Methods of Discovery. Inductive Logic, and Mathematical Logic applied for the first time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DYNAMICS\">dynamics</a>, very justly claimed a place in a dissertation on the progress of science, in a period when these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> doctrines and discoveries were the stepping <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> by which even the basement story of the Temple of Nature could alone be reached. The Philosophy of Bacon and the discovery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLUXIONS\">Fluxions</a>, occupied therefore, with much reason, a large portion of Professor Playfair's beautiful Dissertation; and it is impossible to regret that an intellect so admirably qualified for tracing and displaying the intimate and historical connection of branches of knowledge so varied in their principles and character, should have been thus congenially employed, to the delight and edification of readers of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of acquirement from the highest to the humblest.\n\nIn mentioning the name of my distinguished predecessor in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">Chair</a> of Natural Philosophy in the University of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, I willingly take the opportunity of noticing, in a few words, his peculiar merits, to which the Dissertation contained in\nBut the extended domain of the science of the last hundred years enhances vastly the difficulty of the subjects succinctly handled as one by Mr Playfair. The mechanical and experimental sciences alone constitute a body of knowledge so large that it is a responsibility sufficient for one person to attempt to grasp them all, and to set forth in order the steps of progress and improvement which have been so rapid, and even so startling. Since some of these have scarcely as yet been historically digested, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> features of contemporary discovery have not been gradually separated by the judgment of an impartial posterity from those slighter though praiseworthy details, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of time and advance of knowledge will throw into the shadows of distance,\u2014this difficult and most laborious task falls principally upon the reviewer. The length and breadth of the subject of Natural Philosophy, and the cumbrous and scattered depositories of knowledge in which its records must be sought, combine to render not only the undertaking an arduous one, but the result of it a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> more bulky than might be desired, or than was easily possible, in dealing with the glorious, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, history of Newton's age. It might be compared to the difference between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> a history of the Jews or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> and that of the whole of modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\n\nThe mere magnitude of the undertaking, then, might well excuse me from entering upon the cognate, but exceedingly distinct, subjects of the Logic of Inductive Discovery and the progress of the Pure Mathematics. But an equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> reason might be found in my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of inadequacy to undertake, whatever had been the dimensions of my work, a threefold scheme of such magnitude and difficulty. I do not think that any one person could be found to treat the whole as it ought to be treated, and I am certain that I am not that person.\n\nOne attempt\u2014a bold and successful one\u2014has been made, in our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, to unite two of the writings of three departments,\u2014I mean the History and the Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences. An Englishman Mill, philosopher of wonderful versatility, industry, and power has erected a permanent monument to his reputation in a voluminous work <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>. A slight inspection of that work will show how impracticable and self-destructive a plan it would have been to attempt anything like a systematic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of facts and speculations within our present limits. Mr J. Stuart Mill has also published a work bearing on the origin of our scientific knowledge, diametrically opposed in principle to the preceding one, yet marked by great ability. Such disquisitions belong more properly to the philosophy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind than of physics. After all, be it remembered that whatever has been learnt or discussed concerning the means of arriving at truth in Natural Science, it is not pretended that we have recently become possessed of any canons or rules of discovery superseding those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> principles of observation and experiment so well laid down by Bacon, and practised both\n\nthe present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> will bear an enduring testimony. Playfair's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> contributions to science were not so marked and considerable as to justify me in including his name in the comparatively brief catalogue of discoverers chronicled in the succeeding pages; but his efforts are, nevertheless, deserving of notice, and indirectly were perhaps hardly less beneficial. He was a most patient and admiring student of the greatest mathematical writers of his time, and, when we consider the singularly backward state of that science in Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> about the end of the last and commencement of the present century, it was of no small importance to find a man placed in the position of a public instructor able and willing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the splendid achievements of the continental mathematicians. By his lectures both on Mathematics and Natural Philosophy\u2014by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> articles in the Edinburgh Review\u2014by some of his original papers in the Transactions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Society of Edinburgh\u2014he contributed to this useful end, and would have done so still farther had he been enabled to complete the Dissertation which he so ably commenced. He had an excellent mathematical capacity, and mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, rather than power. His explanations, even of matters of inherent difficulty, are perspicuous and popular, qualities possessed by few of his contemporaries. His style has been pronounced by the highest authorities to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of clearness and eloquence. He was extensively read in subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a> and morals, as well as of pure science; and by a combination of talent rare, I am inclined to say, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree, his bent, though eminently mathematical, was also directed, with signal success (at first through his intimate friendship for Dr Hutton), to the very opposite studies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-GEOLOGY\">Geology</a> and Physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>, which may be said to have been the subjects of his predilection during the last twenty years of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Nor were these labours of the closest merely; he was far more intimately versed in the mineral structure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, from observation, than any except a few professed geologists; and he exceeded them all in the ability with which he explained and maintained the striking doctrines of the Huttonian theory. Though professedly the \"illustrator\" of the principles specifically but obscurely laid down by Hutton, he certainly added much of his own. There is no reason to doubt that Playfair first apprehended the telling power of glaciers as geological agents in modifying the surface of Alpine countries, a matter which has of late been so earnestly discussed by the ablest geologists.\n\nWhat adds to the singularity of the combination of tastes and talents which I have referred to, is, that he appears to have had the slightest possible taste for that art of experiment which he eloquently advocated, with Bacon, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> distinction of modern science. I may be wrong in stating it broadly, but I do not now recollect a single experimental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, much less discovery, which we owe to Playfair, I mean in the department of Natural Philosophy; for we cannot include astronomical measurements under this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, of which, indeed, it was the mathematical theory, and not the application to practice, which chiefly occupied him. The same was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> in Astronomy, which, of the mechanical sciences, interested him most. In two capacities he will be remembered,\u2014first, as the able, eloquent, and generally impartial and accurate Historian of Science; secondly, as the promoter, to so great a degree as to be considered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> founder, of modern Dynamical Geology. He was much beloved in private life, and was singularly free from the tendency to carping criticism and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> prejudices sometimes, unfortunately, found in men of letters. He was the intimate associate of Jeffrey and the other founders of the Edinburgh Review. His character has been drawn in three words by Sir James Mackintosh, and as happily contrasted with that of his illustrious friend:\u2014\"Playfair and Jeffrey; the first a person very remarkable for understanding, calmness, and simplicity, the second more lively, fertile, and brilliant than any Scotchman of letters\" (Life of Sir James Macintosh, ii. 251).\n\n1 Whewell's History and Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, 5 vols. 8vo.\n2 Mill's Logic, 2 vols. 8vo.\nbefore him and since by Galileo, Newton, and their disciples.\n\nWith regard to Pure Mathematics, and their progress during the last seventy years, to the difficulty arising from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> to which the review must have enlarged this Essay, and the enormous and disproportionate labour it must have cost (a labour far greater to the present writer than to one by taste and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> more addicted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of merely abstract Analysis), a conclusive argument against their systematic introduction into this historical sketch is to be found in the very nature of these modern improvements. All sciences\u2014but especially the abstract sciences\u2014tend to become more intensely technical the farther they are pursued. These especially are incapable of popular treatment, although in their applications to physical science they occasionally admit of it in a very remarkable manner. The progress of analysis cannot be even enunciated or expressed but in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of analysis, and the History becomes almost a Treatise, or, if not a Treatise, something nearly as technical. It is partly for this reason that the history of the Pure Mathematics has so seldom been even attempted to be written. Mathematicians have, since the time of D'Alembert, been noted for being more ready themselves to publish than to become acquainted with what others have done; and one consequence of this has been the formation of a mathematical literature, able, profound, and original, but cumbrous, fragmentary, and full of repetitions. Besides, the seventeenth century had attained the vantage-ground of those grand and striking improvements in methods to which no subsequent improvements, however real and ingenious, can by possibility compare. We shall never have inventions comparable, in universality and importance, to the application of Algebra to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a>, and the discovery of Fluxions. These also admit of being at least partly explained in language not obtrusively technical, and have been so explained by the facile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> of Playfair; but all subsequent discoveries have been but enlargements and improvements on these primary and distinguishing ones; and before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> at which our present discourse properly opens, even the larger generalizations of Newton's fertile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a>\u2014the method, namely, of Variations, and the integration of partial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENTIAL\">differential</a> equations, had been established, by the genius of Euler and Lagrange, on an impregnable basis.\n\nThe intense, and praiseworthy, and successful labours of their followers have been, then, chiefly devoted to the occupation of the fields of conquest thus summarily opened; or, rather, to storming, one by one, fortresses still unreduced, after the main resisting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> had been first routed in the open field. To quit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METAPHOR\">metaphor</a>, the efforts of mathematicians have for many years been chiefly applied to rendering possible the solution of problems involving quantities which actually occurred in the course of the rapid simultaneous advances of physical science. They are in a manner inseparable from the branches of physics in aid of which they were originally called forth, and will therefore be most properly noticed, however briefly, in the chapters of this Dissertation where their application is considered. Some farther observations on this subject will be found in the immediately succeeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the present Essay.\n\nIn reviewing the progress of science\u2014physical science in particular\u2014during the last seventy or eighty years, I have thought it advisable not to subdivide the subjects too minutely, and, following nearly the arrangements of Dr Whewell's excellent treatise, already quoted, I shall treat, in successive chapters, of Analytical Mechanics including Physical Astronomy as their loftiest and most successful application; of Astronomy as a science of observation; of Mechanics, with reference to the intimate constitution of matter, including <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYDRODYNAMICS\">Hydrodynamics</a>, Acoustics, and Civil Engineering; of Optics, or Light; of Heat, including the Daltonian theory of the gases and chemical elements; and, finally, of the large and comprehensive science of Electro-magnetism, including ordinary and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VOLTAIC_ELECTRICITY\">Voltaic Electricity</a>, Terrestrial Magnetism, and Diamagnetism the discovery of Dr Faraday.\n\nThe arrangement of the chapters is thus strictly Methodical; but in the subdivision into sections, I have allowed the Biographical principle to predominate, thus giving as much as possible a historical partly bi-character to the whole, and endeavouring to introduce the reader to the intellectual acquaintance of the eminent men who are selected for notice on the principles which have been already detailed. In some\n\n---\n\n1 Specimens of what a history of pure mathematics would be, and must be, are to be found in the able \"Reports\" of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PEACOCK\">Peacock</a> and Mr Leslie Ellis, in the Transactions of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">Association</a> for 1833 and for 1846. A glance at these profound and very technical essays will show the impossibility of a popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of treatment, whilst the difficulty and labour of producing such summaries may be argued from their exceeding rarity in this or any other language.\n\n2 The celebrated Lagrange, in his later years, contrasting the mathematical works of his own generation with those which he studied when a youth, is said to have observed\u2014\"I pity the young mathematicians who have so many theories to wade through. If I were to begin, I would not study; these large quarto volumes frighten me too much.\" (Thomas Young's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a>, vol. iv.) And it is stated that whilst his own most abstract investigations were conducted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, he kept the perusal of M. Gauss's writings for the tranquil retirement of the country,\u2014a distinction intelligible enough between the intense effort of invention more than sustained by the stress of genius which produces it, and the more languid exertion under the dead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of reasoning imposed upon the mind by the discoveries of another. Dr Young, in his biography of Lagrange, observes upon the voluminous mathematical literature of his time, that \"unless something be done to check the useless accumulation of weighty materials, the fabric of science will sink in a few ages under its own insupportable bulk.\" The fact is that a large proportion of the mathematical writings of even eminent authors are in a few years forgotten, or only casually consulted on some matter of history.\n\n3 History and Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences.\n\u00a7 2. On the relations between Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, and between the latter and the Mechanical Arts.\n\nThe object of this Dissertation has little in common with an attempt formally to subdivide human knowledge into compartments, and to assign their boundaries with metaphysical exactness. It is chiefly in their practical bearing on one another that they must be considered. If one science, like Mathematics, furnish the only sure step towards the understanding or the enlargement of another, as Astronomy or Optics, a practical link is constructed between them, which renders the progress of the one not independent of the progress of the other. The intimate and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> connection thus subsisting between Mathematics and Physics is to be found in almost an equal degree between Pure Physics and the Mechanical Arts, of which we take Civil Engineering to represent the department most cognate to that of Natural Philosophy, of which this Dissertation more especially treats.\n\nThe history of the last seventy or eighty years enforces this conclusion. The boundaries of Science and Art are as undefinable as those of \"fact\" and \"theory,\" or those which separate the kingdoms of nature from one another. There are arts which can hardly be called scientific, and there are others which have contributed more to the original stock of knowledge than they ever drew from it. These last are like the shoots of those tropical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> which at first are mere buds upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>, and are nourished solely by its juices, but which, when they reach the ground, plant themselves there, and become not only the props and stays of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> stem, but supply it from an ever-increasing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> with the sap which they originally borrowed.\n\nThe more closely we examine the subject, the more are we satisfied that it is impossible to teach science rightly without teaching its applications; and that the limit to which we are to do so is a limit depending solely on the judgment of the teacher, and on the special purpose of the lesson. But the progress of science is a lesson learnt from the great book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>; and if we are to feel the force of its teachings, we must consult, not one, but many of its pages. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">Looking</a> to the history of science since 1750, but especially during the present century, it is quite impossible not to admit how large a share the sciences of application have had in moulding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of men's thoughts and speculations, and in enabling, nay, compelling them to realize certain abstract notions far from easy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>. Instances of this are to be found in the force of percussion, the coexistence of vibrations in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> and other substances, and such notions of body as we derive from practical efforts of continually-increasing boldness to extend the scale of our constructions.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> of the relation between Mathematics and Physics, and of the latter to civil Engineering, is so close that the three subjects might almost be regarded as three terms of a continued proportion. What the second is to the first may be affirmed of the third relatively to the second. Physics may exist, at least to a limited extent, without a mathematical basis, as the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> long preceded a knowledge of the principles on which it is founded. But as knowledge advances it extends in both directions towards speculation and towards practical applications, but most towards the applications. This Bacon well understood, and he has consistently maintained, that knowledge, to be profitable to its cultivators, must also be fruitful to mankind. And all the history of science since Bacon's day has read this\n\n---\n\n1 I have borrowed but sparingly, in the following pages, from the existing compilations on the history of science. Indeed, a writer who intends to make a subject his own by a well-considered, fundamental plan of treating it, will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> such works principally as a guide to his own further inquiries, and to assist him in selecting the topics worthy of fullest discussion. In this respect Dr Whewell's excellent writings, already cited, have been of great use to me; and in the particular department of Astronomy, I have often referred to Mr Grant's valuable History of that science, as well as to the writings of Delambre, and the very elaborate Historical Essay by M. Gautier, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> of the Three Bodies, which is not, I think, noticed by Mr Grant, but which contains a most elaborate history of the researches of Lagrange and Laplace. In optics, I have consulted the systematic treatises of Dr Young, Sir D. Brewster, Sir J. Herschel, Dr Lloyd, M. Moligno, and M. Radicke; and so of other subjects. Gehler's Physikalischer Werterbuch, Fechner's Repertorium, and that of Dove, afford a vast amount of historical information. The Transactions and Proceedings of the various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>, British and Foreign, have of course furnished a great part of my information. Such strictly biographical details as I have made use of, have in general been very carefully taken from the best accessible authority.\nlesson more and more loudly in the ears of mankind. The era of Newton and Leibnitz was grandly distinguished by the continually increasing applications of mathematics to physics, whereof Newton was the great teacher; the century 1750\u20131850, whilst profiting by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> of the past, has added almost a new one in the eminently practical character of its science, and in the no less scientific character of its practice. The result of these gradual modifications of human knowledge has not been in the slightest degree injurious to the real progress of the more abstract ingredient of the mixed sciences. Did mathematics over flourish more vigorously than under Newton? Has pure physical science had greater triumphs than in the era of Volta, Watt, and Young? It was precisely because the new application of mathematics stimulated their growth, because abstract relations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> were vivified by concrete solutions of physical problems, that a new geometry arose. Dynamics could hardly be said to exist as a science without the invention of Fluxions as a language by which its conditions and results might be expressed; and from that time onwards, the necessities of the natural philosopher have been the prime sources of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a> to the geometer, while the subjects have become so blended that a mere discoverer in mathematics has become a singularity. It would be hardly possible to point out any mathematician of the highest class since Newton, or but a few of the second class, who have not contributed almost as much to physical science as they have to analysis. Of purely mathematical discoveries, the great majority have been called forth by the immediate necessity arising from some problem requiring solution in astronomy, mechanics, optics, or heat. Lagrange's method of Variations of arbitrary Constants in Integration, the artifices for the computation of attractions by Laplace's coefficients; the introduction of the method of factorials by Kramp in his solution of the problem of refraction, and numberless improvements in the Theory of Definite Integrals by Fourier and his successors, sufficiently warrant the statement, and show how richly the physical sciences have repaid to the purely mathematical ones the debt which they originally owed. One other conclusion may be drawn from these and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> facts. It is that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> arising out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> phenomena are more suggestive of the possible relations of number and quantity than is the most unlimited stretch of fancy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>; and I believe it will be conceded that, with few exceptions, theorems of the greatest value and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> have been more frequently discovered during the attempt to solve some physical or at least geometrical problem, than in comprehensive yet indefinite attempts to generalize the relations of abstract magnitude.\n\nThese views are strikingly confirmed by the historical fact of the paucity of pure mathematicians, and of distinct mathematical treatises of a strictly original character in an age distinguished by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of mathematical knowledge, and in countries (like France) most celebrated for its triumphs. There are not, perhaps, much more than half a dozen really great mathematicians of the last seventy years, who have not left treatises more numerous and more distinguished on physical science, treated mathematically, than on pure mathematics. Among the exceptions which more immediately occur, are Monge, Legendre, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABEL\">Abel</a>. And of distinct treatises, whilst we have the M\u00e9canique Analytique, the M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste, the Th\u00e9orie de la Chaleur, and numberless others, containing precious mathematical developments, in connection with the applications which suggested them, the purely mathematical memoirs of the same period are to be sought chiefly in the form of detached essays, in the ponderous volumes of Academical Transactions.\n\nOne point in the History of Mathematics has especial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> for the English reader, and as such may be touched upon here with reference to the progress of science for the last three quarters of a century. The national pride of England in the triumphs of Newton impelled her ablest mathematicians to attempt to carry forward the synthetic methods which he had chiefly used, at least in his published works, to the more arduous and intricate questions of Mechanics and Astronomy which presented themselves for solution in the course of the 18th century. MacLaurin was almost the last Englishman of that period whose mathematical writings came into direct competition with the rising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of Germany and France. The labours of Matthew Stewart, and Simpson were mostly geometrical; those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANDEN\">Landen</a> and Waring, though profound, created little general impression; and, gradually, the extent and difficulty of the foreign mathematics, increased by the use of the Leibnitzian notation of differentials which was absolutely unfamiliar in England, deterred almost everyone even from perusing the writings of Clairaut and D'Alembert, Lagrange and Laplace. Of the continental mathematicians, Euler was probably the best known, owing to the lucidity of his writings and their eminently practical tendencies. Some idea may be formed of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEGATION\">negation</a> of mathematical talent in Britain during the later portion of the last century, when we find D'Alembert declaring, in 1769, that if an Englishman is to be elected one of the eight foreign associates of the Academy of Sciences, he will vote for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> Stanhope as the best mathematician there, as he believes, not having read any of his works! If the choice was to be free, he should prefer M. de Lagrange! A more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a>, though unintentional satire on the state of Mathematics in this country could not have been written.\n\n1 Letters of eminent persons, addressed to David Hume, edited by Mr Burton, p. 215.\nThe commencement of a better era originated early in the present century, with Woodhouse at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, Edinburgh, and Playfair in Edinburgh, by both of whom the fundamental methods were introduced into the studies of their respective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>; whilst Ivory, a native of Scotland, was the first to challenge, by his writings, a place in the list of great living mathematicians. The systematic form of the M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste rendered the subject more accessible than were the countless memoirs by men of the highest name, which then filled the Transactions of Paris, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TURIN\">Turin</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>, and St Petersburg. But the notation of differentials, which could alone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> down the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> between the British and foreign mathematicians, was first introduced at Cambridge by the efforts of Sir John Herschel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAN\">Dean</a> Peacock about 1816, soon after which the translation of Lacroix's Differential Calculus, which they superintended, came into use as an university textbook. From this time the works of foreign mathematicians began to be more generally read, particularly the writings of Laplace and Poisson; and within ten or a dozen years subsequently, a few active and undaunted men, chiefly of the Cambridge school, such as Mr Airy and Sir John Lubbock, grappled with the outstanding difficulties of physical astronomy, whilst a larger number applied themselves to the most difficult parts of pure analysis, and acquired great dexterity in its use in the solution of geometrical and mechanical problems. Such, for example, were Mr Babbage, Mr De Morgan, Mr Murphy, and Mr Green; and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a> Sir William R. Hamilton and Mr MacCullagh, whose names will occur in other parts of this Dissertation.\n\nNo new calculus or great general method in analysis has resulted from these persevering labours, whether of British or foreign mathematicians, but an increased facility and power in applying the existing resources of mathematics to the solution of large classes of problems previously intractable, or resolved only indirectly or by approximation. The Integral Calculus, in particular, affords an almost boundless field for research, and each branch of science in succession\u2014not only Physical Astronomy, but Optics, Heat, Electricity, and Civil Engineering\u2014has offered problems of great importance, which awaited only the skill of the pure mathematician to resolve in a practical and finite form. Every year, and every civilized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, contribute to these real improvements. The principle of discontinuity, conspicuously introduced into the doctrine of the conduction of Heat in consequence of the abrupt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of physical circumstances at the boundary of the conducting body, enters largely into the speculations of mathematicians of the present century; and the doctrine of definite integrals so intimately connected with it has received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> extension. Next, analytical geometry has acquired a very great analytical enlargement and by attention principally to symmetry, geometry, in the arrangement of the results, solutions otherwise the most intricate are obtained with facility and directness. Of this we shall find examples in our history of the Undulatory Theory of Light. Lastly, The Calculus notwithstanding the pre-eminently practical character of the mathematics of the last age, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> geometers and analysts have found time to discuss the metaphysics of their respective sciences, both as regards the foundations of the Differential Calculus and as to the use of imaginary and other symbols in Algebra. An almost new branch of abstract science (though faintly foreshadowed by Leibnitz) has come into existence\u2014the separation of symbols of operation from symbols of quantity, and the treatment of the former like ordinary algebraic magnitudes. In some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> remarkable simplicity is thus introduced into the solution of problems, although perhaps few mathematicians would choose to depend implicitly upon the method in untried cases. Sir John Herschel and the late Mr Gregory were amongst the most active introducers of this new algebra, but few of the more eminent living British or foreign mathematicians have failed to contribute their share to this more metaphysical department of analysis.\n\nI shall now attempt to consider more particularly the reciprocal relations of pure physical science and the mechanical arts.\n\nThis is evidently a very intimate one. The discoveries of pure physics (such as Astronomy, Acoustics, Magnetism), are the results of either observation or experiment, and they consist in generalizations, by means of which a multitude of facts are reduced under one simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of a more general fact or principle. But instruments often very complicated are necessary for observation and for experiment; as telescopes in astronomy, organs in acoustics, properly magnetized and suspended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> bars in magnetism. Art is required to construct these. The highest possible degree of science, and the utmost\n\n---\n\n1 For example the Lucasian Professor at Cambridge, Mr Stokes, has effected two previously impracticable integrations, one occurring in the theory of the rainbow, the other in that of railway girder bridges.\n\n2 Mr Duncan Gregory, a promising mathematician who died 23rd February 1844, at the early age of 30, was the youngest son of Dr James Gregory, the late distinguished Professor of Medicine at Edinburgh. His name deserves a passing record, not only Gregory, from the influence he exercised on the progress of the English mathematics of his time, but as having revived the dormant character for this branch of learning, so long connected with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Gregory. He was, in fact, the lineal descendant of the inventor of the reflecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>. Mr Gregory was the first editor of the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, and author of an excellent book of Examples in the Differential and Integral Calculus, both of which have exercised a beneficial influence on the progress of science in England. He also wrote several original memoirs on the subjects referred to in the text. Mr Leslie Ellis, a man of congenial ability, has written a short but pleasing biography of his friend.\nmechanical skill, are both indispensable to make a telescope. A telescope then, though a mechanical invention, inasmuch as it is a deduction from physical principles, not an addition to them, is yet a deduction so ingenious\u2014so far from obvious\u2014so impossible to be conceived accidentally or by a loose thinker, and so easily made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of innumerable discoveries of the highest novelty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, that no historian of science ever thought of omitting the invention of the telescope, or of giving it an importance inferior to that of a discovery, containing as it did the germ of so many discoveries. In like manner a theory of optics might be written in which a telescope need never be mentioned; but would not the pedantry of such a work be obvious, or would any reasonable person wish to learn science after such a fashion?\n\nThe clear co-ordination of the parts of an invention towards the attainment of a given result, with a due regard to natural laws, and the properties of the substances used, constitutes the merit of the invention; and this merit may be irrespective of the precise importance of the end of the invention, which may be intended to promote science, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, or convenience, or even to satisfy mere curiosity. A telescope would have been a telescope still, could we have imagined it invented with no other object than a deer-stalker's sport; and so contrivances which in their origin and application seem remote from scientific uses, constitute nevertheless real steps in the progress of knowledge. The steam-engine is one striking example. Originally devised with an exclusively commercial object\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of the Cornish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> from subterranean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, it became in the hands of Watt, first an instrument for experiments on the relation of heat to matter; next, in its improved form, a beautiful exemplification of these laws, and an enduring monument of the sagacity and skill of its author, as well as the most important inorganic agent which exists in modifying the social condition of the entire globe. Finally, to illustrate the position from which we started, it becomes the instrument of fresh discoveries. This very engine has a theory to be worked out, probably unimagined even by its sagacious author\u2014its operation as an agent for obtaining power from matter by the application of heat, is shown to be in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> a single case of a more general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, including all kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> and all sorts of matter; and this more general theory of heat as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> power leads, once more, to new practical deductions, to the conditions under which such machines may be most usefully constructed and employed.\n\nEvery instrument, every construction, which is founded on a theory, and in which a certain complication of conditions is required to produce a certain result; a telescope, for example, or a steam-engine, or a bridge, is, in the first instance at least, an experiment. Few inventions are so simple and straightforward in their plan, are so independent of the seemingly capricious behaviour of matter under untried circumstances, or depend so entirely on physical laws thoroughly understood, that the inventor can await, without the pang\u2014at least of impatience\u2014if not of anxiety, the moment of the realization, by actual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, of his hopes and his calculations. We can all readily imagine the throb of anxiety with which Galileo pointed his glasses for the first time to the moon\u2014with which Watt saw the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> of his model exhausted, and the piston descend under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of his separate condenser\u2014and Stephenson, gazing on the stupendous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> tube at Conway resting for the first time straight as a ramrod on its two piers\u2014these are moments of anxiety and of triumph, which place the inventor of a machine and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a> of a structure on a par with the discoverer of a planet, or with the author of a theory. \"Whenever an original mind produces new combinations of thought and feeling,\" says Sir James Mackintosh, with equal impartiality and truth, \"whether its means be words or colours, or marble or sound, or command over the mighty agents of nature; whether the result be an epic poem, or a statue, or a steam-engine, we must equally reverence those transcendent faculties to which we give the name of genius.\" It is almost needless to add the caution, that such praise is only applicable when the invention is such as to call forth the qualities which distinguish the Philosopher. It is not the mere command over the agents of nature which challenges our admiration, it is the foresight, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, the constructive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>, the clear-sighted and confident anticipations of what will be the results of natural laws acting in given circumstances, these circumstances being in some essential particulars new. Merely to adopt known contrivances, where experience has already anticipated the result, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> judgment, but hardly genius; and to make contrivances in which the result depends rather upon laws of geometry than of physics, hardly come within the scope of these remarks.\n\nWatt's Parallel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">Motion</a>, perhaps the most ingenious of his inventions, would not have made a great reputation; nor does the endless variety of machines used in the arts, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>-making, stand higher. It is when the inventor places Matter in new relations to Force, or derives power from new sources, or teaches Light or Electricity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> under new conditions, that he becomes really a Mechanical Philosopher.\n\nIt is not given to man to endue matter with new properties, or to prescribe the laws under which his inventions are to take effect. A new motive power,\n\n---\n\n1 See Carnot, *Puissance Motrice du Feu*, and the writings of M. Clapeyron, Professor W. Thomson, &c.\n2 Speech at a meeting for erecting a monument to Watt, in Arago's Eloge of Watt.\na new form of construction, are experiments on the resources of nature under new conditions.\n\nIn fact, even in comparatively simple cases, we cannot set forces to act on matter, or dispose matter so as to resist force, without doing not only what we intend to do, but also a great deal more. Man may put powers in motion which he is unable to control; and whilst he calculates confidently upon the effects of such and such dispositions of force or resistance, he may overlook consequences equally necessary, because resulting from laws of nature which are either unknown to him, or the magnitude of which he had overlooked, in considering those only which he required. A complicated mechanical contrivance may be compared to the mathematical solution of a problem. It represents <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> a great deal more than is meant to be derived from it. It may represent several distinct results, some possible, some impossible, and of the former only one, it may be, congruous to the real conditions of the problem proposed. In mechanics, the laws of nature are as impatient of control as the laws of quantity in geometry, and the engineer may find, too late, that nature has solved his problem differently from what he expected. But even when successful, it is to be presumed that his own contrivance contains within it results unforeseen by himself. If he is wise he will become a student in his own workshop. The material contrivances are indeed his own, but the powers which they awaken or distribute are beyond his control. Even if his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of the equation be strictly correct, there may remain in the background others no less important.\n\nThe considerations here imperfectly laid before the reader are intended to justify the introduction of certain practical topics into the present Dissertation, which, though many readers will see their insertion without surprise, or would have been sorry to find them omitted, others possibly may think more or less independent of, and separable from a scheme already sufficiently extensive and intricate, if confined to mere subjects of scientific doctrine, to the exclusion of its applications. My chief reason for including such subjects as the steam-engine, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STRENGTH_OF_MATERIALS\">strength of materials</a> and some great examples of construction, and the electric telegraph, is that these important practical improvements are both historically and logically interwoven with the progress of pure or abstract physics. They have besides impressed upon the character of scientific discovery of the last hundred years a peculiar stamp which it would have been absurd to ignore while endeavouring, within a moderate compass, and in the plainest language, to convey a vivid though comprehensive sketch of the advancement of Natural Philosophy during this and the preceding, or rather two preceding generations.\n\nIt is not to be imagined that the difficulty of the problems which occupy the speculative philosopher, Lessons of ordinary experience, or the comprehensiveness of mind required for their solution, diminishes in any degree as we descend from the regions of pure science to the walks of everyday life\u2014from the vast periods and majestic motions which astronomy enables us to explain and predict, to the common details of the workshop and the railway. In fact, the former are to be regarded as the simpler investigations, whilst our terrestrial agents have their effects modified by the diversified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of aggregation and various mechanical properties of matter, and by the numerous modifications of force arising from heat, electricity, or magnetism, to which it may be exposed. We have as yet made but an insignificant advance towards that completer system of Natural Philosophy of which Newton's will form but one section, in which all the properties of matter and their consequences shall be as well understood as the particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of gravity is at present. Many of these are to be learned by daily observation of the effects which occur in the ordinary progress of civilization amongst us. We are continually performing experiments on a great scale and on purely commercial principles, which no individual philosopher or merely scientific society could have ventured to attempt. And in the midst of these appeals to experience, unexpected results are frequently occurring which send us back once more to the study of first principles, which, indeed, while they confound the empiric, do but establish the reputation of the philosophic engineer, who seldom fails to turn them to good account, both in his theory and practice.","sp":809,"ep":819},{"h":"JEREMY BENTHAM","t":"The general scheme of this Dissertation would be a sufficient reason for omitting the name of a living writer.

They are in general men of competent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, of superior understanding, who voluntarily embrace the laborious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of useful and noble sciences; who derive their opinions not so much from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> perusal of his writings, as from familiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> from whose lips these opinions are recommended by simplicity, disinterestedness, originality, and vivacity; aided rather than impeded by foibles not unamiable, enforced of late by the growing authority of years and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, and at all times strengthened by that undoubting reliance on his own judgment which mightily increases the ascendant of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> over those who approach him. As he and they deserve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of braving vulgar prejudices, so they must be content to incur the imputation of falling into the neighbouring vices of seeking distinction by singularity; of clinging to opinions because they are obnoxious; of wantonly wounding the most respectable feelings of mankind; of regarding an immense display of method and nomenclature as a sure token of a corresponding increase of knowledge; and of considering them-\nselves as a chosen few, whom an initiation into\nthe most secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> entitles\nto look <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with pity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not contempt, on the\nprofane multitude.

He is too little acquainted with\ndoubts to believe the honest doubts of others,\nand he is too angry to make allowance for their\nprejudices and habits.

This\nvolume, and especially the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a>, abounds in\nfine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> observation; it contains\nthe germs of most of his subsequent productions,\nand it is an early example of that disregard for\nthe method, proportions, and occasion of a writ-\ning which, with all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> readers, deeply af-\nfects its power of interesting or instructing.\n\nTwo years after, he published a most excellent\ntract on *The Hard Labour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BILL\">Bill</a>*, which, concur-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> with the spirit excited by Howard's inqui-\nries, laid the foundation of just reasoning on Re-\nformatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">Punishment</a>. The *Letters on Usury*\u00b9\nare perhaps the best specimen of the exhaustive\ndiscussion of a moral or political question, leav-\ning no objection, however feeble, unanswered,\nand no difficulty, however small, unexplained;\nremarkable also for the clearness and spirit of\nthe style, for the full exposition which suits them\nto all intelligent readers, for the tender and skilful\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> with which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> is touched, and for the\nurbanity of his admirable apology for projectors,\naddressed to Dr Smith, whose temper and manner\nhe seems for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to have imbibed. The *Intro-\nduction to the Principles of Morals and Politics*,\nprinted before the *Letters*, but published after\nthem, was the first sketch of his system, and is\nstill the only account of it by himself.\n\nThe great merit of this work, and of his other\nwritings in relation to *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">Jurisprudence</a>* properly so\ncalled, is not within our present scope. To the\nRoman jurists belongs the praise of having al-\nlotted a separate portion of their *Digest* to the\nsignification of the words of most frequent use\n\n\u00b9 They were addressed to Mr George Wilson, who retired from the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and died at Edin-\nburgh in 1816; an early friend of Mr Bentham, and afterwards an intimate friend of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Ellenborough, Sir Vicary Gibbs,\nand of all the most eminent of his professional contemporaries. The rectitude of judgment, purity of heart, elevation of ho-\nnour, the sternness only in integrity, the scorn of baseness, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> towards weakness, which were joined in him\nwith a gravity exclusive neither of feeling nor of pleasantry, contributed still more than his abilities and attainments of va-\nrious sorts, to a moral authority with his friends, and in his profession, which few men more amply possessed, or more uni-\nformly exercised. The same character, somewhat softened, and the same influence, distinguished his closest friend, the late\nMr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENS\">Lens</a>. Both were inflexible and incorruptible friends of civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, and both knew how to reconcile the\nwarmest zeal for that sacred cause, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> towards their opponents, which partisans, often more violent than steady,\ntreated as lukewarm. The present writer hopes that the good-natured reader will excuse him for having thus, perhaps un-\nseasonably, bestowed heartfelt commendation on those who were above the pursuit of praise, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of whose\ngood opinion and good-will help to support him under a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of faults and vices.\nin law and legal discussion. Bentham not only first perceived and taught the great value of an introductory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, composed of definitions of general terms, as subservient to brevity and precision in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a code, but he also discovered the unspeakable importance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> arrangement in jurisprudence, by rendering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of a proposed law in such an arrangement a short and easy test of the fitness of the proposal. But here he does not distinguish between the value of arrangement as scaffolding, and the inferior convenience of its being the very frame-work of the structure. Mr Bentham, indeed, is much more remarkable for laying down desirable rules for the determination of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a>, and the punishment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WRONGS\">wrongs</a>, in general, than for weighing the various circumstances which require them to be modified in different countries and times in order to render them either more useful, more easily introduced, more generally respected, or more certainly executed. The art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a> consists in thus applying the principles of jurisprudence to the situation, wants, interests, feelings, opinions, and habits, of each distinct community at any given time. It bears the same relation to jurisprudence which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> arts bear to pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a>. Many of these considerations serve to show, that the sudden establishment of new codes can seldom be practicable or effectual for their purpose; and that reformation, though founded on the principles of jurisprudence, ought to be not only adapted to the peculiar interests of a people, but engrained on their previous usages, and brought into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> with those national dispositions on which the execution of laws depends. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JUSTINIAN\">Justinian</a>, adopted at least the true principle, if they did not apply it with sufficient freedom and boldness. They considered the multitude of occasional laws, and the still greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of usages, opinions, and determinations, as the materials of legislation, not precluding, but demanding a systematic arrangement of the whole by the supreme authority. Had the arrangement been more scientific, had there been a bolder examination and a more free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> of many particular branches, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> would have been offered for liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> by modern lawgivers. It cannot be denied, without injustice and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a>, that Mr Bentham has done more than any other writer to rouse the spirit of juridical reformation, which is now gradually examining every part of law, and, when further progress is facilitated by digesting the present laws, will doubtless proceed to the improvement of all. Greater praise it is given to few to earn. It ought to satisfy Mr Bentham, for the disappointment of hopes which were not reasonable, that Russia should receive a code from him, or that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> could be brought to renounce the variety of her laws and institutions, on the single authority of a foreign philosopher, whose opinions had not worked their way either into legislation or into general reception in his own country. It ought also to dispose his followers to do fuller justice to the Romillys and Broughams, without whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and energy, as well as reason and eloquence, the best plans of reformation must have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> a dead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>,\u2014for whose sake it might have been fit to reconsider the obloquy heaped on their profession, and to show more general indulgence to all those whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> offence seems to consist in their doubts whether sudden changes, almost always imposed by violence on a community, be the surest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to lasting improvement.\n\nIt is unfortunate that Ethical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a>, with\n\n---\n\n1 Digest, lib. I tit. 16. De Verborum Significatione.\n2 See a beautiful article on Codification, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Review, vol. XXIX. p. 217. It need no longer be concealed that it was contributed by Sir Samuel Romilly. The steadfastness with which he held the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> in weighing the merits of his friend against his unfortunate defects, is an example of his union of the most commanding moral principle with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> so warm, that, if it had been released from that stern authority, it would not so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> have endured the coarseness and roughness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> concerns. From the tenderness of his feelings, and from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> never raised but by cruelty and baseness, as much as from his genius and his pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, sprung that original and characteristic eloquence, which was the hope of the afflicted as well as the terror of the oppressor. If his oratory had not flowed so largely from this moral source, which years do not dry up, he would not perhaps have been the only example of an orator who, after the age of sixty, daily increased in polish, in vigour, and in splendour.\n3 An excellent medium between those who absolutely require new codes, and those who obstinately adhere to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> usages, has been pointed out by M. Meyer, in his most justly celebrated work, Institutions Judiciaires des Principaux Pays de l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, tome I. Introduction, p. 8, 9. La Haye et Amst. 1819-23, 6 vols. 8vo.\nwhich we are now chiefly concerned, is not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> in which Mr Bentham has reached the most desirable distinction. It may be remarked, both in ancient and in modern times, that whatever modifications prudent followers may introduce into the system of an innovator, the principles of the Master continue to mould the habitual dispositions, and to influence the practical tendency of the School. Mr Bentham preaches the principle of utility with the zeal of a discoverer. Occupied more in reflection than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, he knew not, or forgot, how often it had been the basis, and how generally an essential part, of moral systems. That in which he really differs from others, is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> which he teaches, and the example which he sets, of constantly bringing that principle before us. This peculiarity appears to us to be his radical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. In an attempt, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> forbids the success, he seems to us to have been led into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> errors in moral theory, and to have given to his practical doctrine a dangerous taint.\n\nThe confusion of moral approbation with the moral qualities which are its objects, common to Mr Bentham with many other philosophers, is much more uniform and prominent in him than in most others. This general error, already mentioned at the opening of this Dissertation, has led him more than others to assume, that because the principle of utility forms a necessary part of every moral theory, it ought therefore to be the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> of human conduct. Now it is evident that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a>, rather tacitly than avowedly made, is wholly gratuitous. No practical conclusion can be deduced from the principle, but that we ought to cultivate those habitual dispositions which are the most effectual motives to useful actions. But before a regard to our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, or a desire to promote the welfare of men in general, be allowed to be the exclusive, or even the chief regulators of human conduct, it must be shown that they are the most effectual motives to such useful actions. It is demonstrated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> that they are not. It is even owned by the most ingenious writers of Mr Bentham's school, that desires which are pointed to general and distant objects, although they have their proper place and their due value, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> very faint and ineffectual inducements to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. A theory founded on utility, therefore, requires that we should cultivate, as excitements to practice, those other habitual dispositions which we know by experience to be generally the source of actions beneficial to ourselves and our fellows; habits of feeling productive of habits of virtuous conduct, and in their turn strengthened by the re-action of these last. What is the result of experience on the choice of the objects of moral culture? Beyond all dispute, that we should labour to attain that state of mind in which all the social affections are felt with the utmost warmth, giving birth to more comprehensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, but not supplanted by it; when the moral sentiments most strongly approve what is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and good, without being perplexed by a calculation of consequences, though not incapable of being gradually rectified by reason, whenever they are decisively proved by experience not to correspond in some of their parts to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> and perpetual effects of conduct. It is a false representation of human nature to affirm that \"courage\" is only \"prudence.\" They coincide in their effects, and it is always prudent to be courageous. But a man who fights because he thinks it more hazardous to yield, is not brave. He does not become brave till he feels cowardice to be base and painful, and till he is no longer in need of any aid from prudence. Even if it were the interest of every man to be bold, it is clear that so cold a consideration cannot prevail over the fear of danger. Where it seems to do so, it must be by the unseen power either of the fear of shame, or of some other powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, to which it lends its name. It was long ago with striking\n\n---\n\n1 See Notes and Illustrations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> V.\n2 Mr Mill's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">Analysis</a> of the Human Mind, vol. II, p. 237. It would be unjust not to say that this book, partly perhaps from a larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a>, holds out fairer opportunities of negotiation with natural feelings and the doctrines of former philosophers, than any other production of the same school. But this very assertion about courage clearly shows at least a forgetfulness that courage, even if it were the offspring of prudence, would not for that reason be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of it.\njustice observed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, that he who abstains from present gratification, under a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of its painful consequences, is only prudent, and that he must acquire a relish for excess on its own account, before he deserves the name of a temperate man. It is only when the means are firmly and unalterably converted into ends, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of forming the mind is completed. Courage may then seek, instead of avoiding danger. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">Temperance</a> may prefer abstemiousness to indulgence. Prudence itself may choose an orderly government of conduct, according to certain rules, without regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> in which it promotes welfare. Benevolence must desire the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of others, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of the consideration how far it is connected with that of the benevolent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>; and those alone can be accounted just who obey the dictates of justice from having thoroughly learned an habitual veneration for its strict rules and for its larger precepts. In that complete state the mind possesses no power of dissolving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of thought and feeling which impel it to action. Nothing in this argument turns on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between implanted and acquired principles. As no man can cease, by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of his, to see distance, though the power of seeing it be universally acknowledged to be an acquisition, so no man has the power to extinguish the affections and the moral sentiments, however much they may be thought to be acquired, any more than that of eradicating the bodily appetites. The best writers of Mr Bentham's school overlook the indissolubility of these associations, and appear not to bear in mind that their strength and rapid action constitute the perfect state of a moral agent.\n\nThe pursuit of our own general welfare, or of that of mankind at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, though from their vagueness and coldness they are unfit habitual motives and unsafe ordinary guides of conduct, yet perform functions of essential importance in the moral system. The former, which we call self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, preserves the balance of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> principles which regard ourselves ultimately, and contributes to subject them to the authority of the moral principles. The latter, which is general benevolence, regulates in like manner the equipoise of the narrower affections; quickens the languid, and checks the encroaching; borrows strength from pity, and even from indignation; receives some compensation, as it enlarges, in the addition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, for the weakness which arises from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a>; enables us to look on all men as brethren, and overflows on every sentient being. The general interest of mankind, in truth, almost solely affects us through the affections of benevolence and sympathy; for the coincidence of general with individual interest, even where it is certain, is too dimly seen to produce any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a> which can impel to, or restrain from action. As a general truth, its value consists in its completing the triumph of morality, by demonstrating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> impossibility of forming any theory of human nature which does not preserve the superiority of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> over vice; a great, though not a directly practical advantage.\n\nThe followers of Mr Bentham have carried to an unusual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> the prevalent fault of the more modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> of utility, who have dwelt so exclusively on the outward advantages of virtue as to have lost sight of the delight which is a part of virtuous feeling, and of the beneficial influence of good actions upon the frame of the mind. \"Benevolence towards others,\" says Mr Mill, \"produces a return of benevolence from them.\" The fact is true, and ought to be stated. But how unimportant is it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with that which is passed over in silence, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of the affection itself, which, if it could become lasting and intense, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the heart into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>! No one who has ever felt kindness, if he could accurately recall his feelings, could hesitate about their infinite superiority. The cause of the general neglect of this consideration is, that it is only when a gratification is something distinct from a state of mind, that we can easily learn to consider it as a pleasure. Hence the great error respecting the affections, where the inherent delight is not duly estimated, on account of that very peculiarity of being a part of a state of mind,\n\n---\n\n* See Notes and Illustrations, note W.\n* Analysis of the Human Mind, vol. II.\nwhich renders it unspeakably more valuable as independent of every thing without. The social affections are the only principles of human nature which have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> pains. To have any of these desires is to be in a state of happiness. The malevolent passions have properly no pleasures; for that attainment of their purpose which is improperly so called, consists only in healing or assuaging the torture which envy, jealousy, and malice, inflict on the malignant mind. It might with as much propriety be said that the toothache and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> have pleasures, because their removal is followed by an agreeable feeling. These bodily disorders, indeed, are often cured by the process which removes the suffering, but the mental distempers of envy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> are nourished by every act of odious indulgence which for a moment suspends their pain.\n\nThe same observation is applicable to every virtuous disposition, though not so obviously as to the benevolent affections. That a brave man is, on the whole, far less exposed to danger than a coward, is not the chief advantage of a courageous temper. Great dangers are rare; but the constant absence of such painful and mortifying sensations as those of fear, and the steady <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of superiority to what subdues ordinary men, are a perpetual source of inward enjoyment. No man who has ever been visited by a gleam of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a> can place any outward advantage of fortitude in comparison with the feeling of being always able fearlessly to defend a righteous cause. Even Humility, in spite of first appearances, is a remarkable example. It has of late been unwarrantably used to signify that painful consciousness of inferiority which is the first stage of envy. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> consecrated in Christian ethics to denote that disposition which, by inclining towards a modest estimate of our qualities, corrects the prevalent tendency of human nature to overvalue our merits and to overrate our claims. What can be a less doubtful or a much more considerable blessing than this constant sedative, which soothes and composes the irritable passions of vanity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>? What is more conducive to lasting peace of mind than the consciousness of proficiency in that most delicate species of equity which, in the secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>, labours to be impartial in the comparison of ourselves with others? What can so perfectly assure us of the purity of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of contemplating, not that excellence which we have reached, but that which is still to be pursued; of not considering how far we may outrun others, but how far we are from the goal?\n\nVirtue has often outward advantages, and always inward delights; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, though constant, strong, inaccessible, and inviolable, are not easily considered by the common observer as apart from the virtue with which they are blended. They are so subtile and evanescent as to escape the distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of all but the very few who meditate on the acts of mind. The outward advantages, on the other hand, cold, uncertain, dependent, and precarious as they are, yet stand out to the sense and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, may be handled and counted, and are perfectly on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the general apprehension. Hence they have become the almost exclusive theme of all moralists who profess to follow reason. There is room for suspecting that a very general illusion prevails on this subject. Probably the smallest part of the pleasure of virtue, because it is the most palpable, has become the sign and mental representative of the whole. The outward and visible sign suggests insensibly the inward and mental delight. Those who display the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> benefits of magnanimity and kindness, would speak with far less fervour, and perhaps less confidence, if their feelings were not unconsciously affected by the mental state which they overlook in their statements, though they feel some part of it when they write or speak on it. When they speak of\n\n---\n\n1 According to Cicero's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of fortitude, \"Virtus pugnans pro \u00e6quitate.\" The remains of the original sense of Virtus, Manhood, give a beauty and force to these expressions, which cannot be preserved in our language. The Greek Agre, and the German Tugend, originally denoted Strength, afterwards Courage, and at last Virtue. But the happy derivation of Virtus from Vir gives an energy to the phrase of Cicero, which illustrates the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of a skillful writer.\n\n2 Mr Mill's Analysis of the Human Mind, vol. II. p. 222.\n\n3 For a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of vanity, by a great orator, see the Rev. R. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>'s Sermon on Modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INFIDELITY\">Infidelity</a>.\nwhat is without, they feel what was within, and their words excite the same feeling in others.\n\nIs it not probable that much of our love of praise may be thus ascribed to humane and sociable pleasure in the sympathy of others with us? Praise is the symbol which represents sympathy, and which the mind insensibly substitutes for it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> and in language. Does not the desire of posthumous fame, in like manner, manifest an ambition for the fellow-feeling of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, when it is perfectly unproductive of any advantage to ourselves? In this point of view, it may be considered as the passion of which the very existence proves the mighty power of disinterested desire. Every other pleasure from sympathy is confined to the men who are now alive. The love of fame alone seeks the sympathy of unborn generations, and stretches the chain which binds the race of man together, to an extent to which hope sets no bounds. There is a noble, even if unconscious, union of morality with genius in the mind of him who sympathizes with the masters who lived twenty centuries before him, in order that he may learn to command the sympathies of the countless generations who are to come.\n\nIn the most familiar, as well as in the highest instances, it would seem, that the inmost thoughts and sentiments of men are more pure than their language. Those who speak of \"a regard to character,\" if they be serious, generally infuse into that word, unawares, a large portion of that sense in which it denotes the frame of the mind. Those who speak of \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>\" very often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> a more refined and delicate sort of conscience, which ought to render the more educated classes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> alive to such smaller wrongs as the laborious and the ignorant can scarcely feel. What heart does not warm at the noble exclamation of the ancient poet: \"Who is pleased by false honour, or frightened by lying infamy, but he who is false and depraved?\" Every uncorrupted mind feels unmerited praise as a bitter reproach, and regards a consciousness of demerit as a drop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> in the cup of honour. How different is the applause which truly delights us all, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the consciences of others are in harmony with our own! \"What,\" says Cicero, \"is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> but the concurring praise of the good, the unbought approbation of those who judge aright of excellent virtue!\" A far greater than Cicero rises from the purest praise of man, to more sublime contemplations.\n\nFame is no plant that grows on mortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>,\nBut lives and spreads aloft, by those pure eyes\nAnd perfect witness of all-judging Jove.\n\nThose who have most inculcated the doctrine of utility have given another notable example of the very vulgar prejudice which treats the unseen as insignificant. Tucker is the only one of them who occasionally considers that most important effect of human conduct which consists in its action on the frame of the mind, by fitting its faculties and sensibilities for their appointed purpose. A razor or a penknife would well enough cut cloth or meat; but if they were often so used, they would be entirely spoiled. The same sort of observation is much more strongly applicable to habitual dispositions, which, if they be spoiled, we have no certain means of replacing or mending. Whatever act, therefore, decomposes the moral machinery of mind, is more injurious to the welfare of the agent than most disasters from without can be; for the latter are commonly limited and temporary; the evil of the former spreads through the whole of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEALTH\">Health</a> of mind, as well as of body, is not only productive in itself of a greater sum of enjoyment than arises from other sources, but is the only condition of our frame in which we are capable of receiving pleasure from without. Hence it appears how incredibly absurd it is to prefer, on grounds of calculation, a present interest to the preservation of those mental habits on which our wellbeing depends. When they are most moral, they may often prevent us from obtaining advantages. It would be as absurd to desire to lower them for that reason, as it would be to weaken the body, lest its strength should render it more liable to contagious disorders of rare occurrence.\n\nIt is, on the other hand, impossible to combine the benefit of the general habit with the advantages of occasional deviation; for every such deviation either produces remorse, or weakens the habit, and prepares the way for its gradual destruction. He who obtains a fortune by the undetected forgery of a will, may indeed be\nhonest in his other acts; but if he had such a scorn of fraud before as he must himself allow to be generally useful, he must suffer a severe punishment from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONTRITION\">contrition</a>; and he will be haunted with the fears of one who has lost his own security for his good conduct. In all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, if they be well examined, his loss by the distemper of his mental frame will outweigh the profits of his vice.\n\nBy repeating the like observation on similar occasions, it will be manifest that the infirmity of recollection, aggravated by the defects of language, gives an appearance of more selfishness to man than truly belongs to his nature; and that the effect of active agents upon the habitual state of mind, one of the considerations to which the epithet \"sentimental\" has of late been applied in derision, is really among the most serious and reasonable objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a>. When the internal pleasures and pains which accompany good and bad feelings, or rather form a part of them, and the internal advantages and disadvantages which follow good and bad actions, are sufficiently considered, the comparative importance of outward consequences will be more and more narrowed; so that the Stoical philosopher may be thought almost excusable for rejecting it altogether, were it not an indispensably necessary consideration for those in whom right habits of feeling are not sufficiently strong. They alone are happy, or even truly virtuous, who have little need of it.\n\nThe later moralists who adopt the principle of utility, have so misplaced it, that in their hands it has as great a tendency as any theoretical error can have, to lessen the intrinsic pleasure of virtue, and to unfit our habitual feelings for being the most effectual inducements to good conduct. This is the natural tendency of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> which brings utility too closely and frequently into contact with action. By this habit, in its best state, an essentially weaker motive is gradually substituted for others which must always be of more force. The frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to utility as the standard of action tends to introduce an uncertainty with respect to the conduct of other men, which would render all intercourse insupportable. It affords also so fair a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> for selfish and malignant passions, as often to hide their nature from him who is their prey. Some taint of these mean and evil principles will at least creep in, and by their venom give an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a> not its own to the cold desire of utility. The moralists who take an active part in those affairs which often call out unamiable passions, ought to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> with peculiar watchfulness against such self-delusions. The sin that must most easily beset them, is that of sliding from general to particular consequences,\u2014that of trying single actions, instead of dispositions, habits, and rules, by the standard of utility,\u2014that of authorizing too great a latitude for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> and policy in moral conduct,\u2014that of readily allowing exceptions to the most important rules,\u2014that of too lenient a censure of the use of doubtful means when the end seems to them good,\u2014and that of believing unphilosophically, as well as dangerously, that there can be any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> or scheme so useful to the world as the existence of men who would not do a base thing for any public advantage. It was said of Andrew Fletcher, \"he would lose his life to serve his country, but would not do a base thing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> it.\" Let those preachers of utility who suppose that such a man sacrifices ends to means, consider whether the scorn of baseness be not akin to the contempt of danger, and whether a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> composed of such men would not be invincible. But theoretical principles are counteracted by a thousand causes, which confine their mischief as well as circumscribe their benefits. Men are never so good or so bad as their opinions. All that can be with reason apprehended is, that they may always produce some part of their natural evil, and that the mischief will be greatest among the many who seek excuses for these passions. Aristippus found in the Socratic representation of the union of virtue and happiness a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> for sensuality; and many Epicureans became voluptuaries in spite of the example of their master; easily dropping by degrees the limitations by which he guarded his doctrines. In proportion as a man accustoms himself to be influenced by the utility of particular acts, without regard to rules, he approaches to the casuistry of the Jesuits, and to the practical maxims of Caesar Borgia.\n\nInjury on this as on other occasions has been\nsuffered by Ethics, from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to Jurisprudence. The true and eminent merit of Mr Bentham is that of a reformer of jurisprudence. He is only a moralist with a view to being a jurist; and he sometimes becomes for a few hurried moments a metaphysician with a view to laying the foundation of both the moral sciences. Both he and his followers have treated Ethics too juridically. They do not seem to be aware, or at least they do not bear constantly in mind, that there is an essential difference in the subjects of these two sciences.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of law is the prevention of actions injurious to the community. It considers the dispositions from which they flow only indirectly, to ascertain the likelihood of their recurrence, and thus to determine the necessity and the means of preventing them. The direct object of Ethics is only mental disposition. It considers actions indirectly as the signs by which such dispositions are manifested. If it were possible for the mere moralist to see that a moral and amiable temper was the mental source of a bad action, he could not cease to approve and love the temper, as we sometimes presume to suppose may be true of the judgments of the Searcher of Hearts. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RELIGION\">Religion</a> necessarily coincides with morality in this respect; and it is the peculiar distinction of Christianity that it places the seat of virtue in the heart. Law and Ethics are necessarily so much blended, that in many intricate combinations the distinction becomes obscure. But in all strong cases the difference is evident. Thus, law punishes the most sincerely repentant; but wherever the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> of the penitent can be thought to be thoroughly purified, religion and morality receive him with open arms.\n\nIt is needless, after these remarks, to observe, that those whose habitual contemplation is directed to the rules of action, are likely to underrate the importance of feeling and disposition; an error of very unfortunate consequences, since the far greater part of human actions flow from these neglected sources; while the law interposes only in cases which may be called exceptions, which are now rare, and ought to be less frequent.\n\nThe coincidence of Mr Bentham's school with the ancient Epicureans in the disregard of the pleasures of taste and of the arts dependent on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, is a proof both of the inevitable adherence of much of the popular sense of the words \"interest\" and \"pleasure,\" to the same words in their philosophical acceptation, and of the pernicious influence of narrowing \"utility\" to mere visible and tangible objects, to the exclusion of those which form the larger part of human enjoyment.\n\nThe mechanical philosophers who, under Descartes and Gassendi, began to reform Physics in the seventeenth century, attempted to explain all the appearances of nature by an immediate reference to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of particles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> impelling each other in various directions, and with unequal force, but in all other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> alike. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> by impulse they conceived to be perfectly simple and intelligible. It never occurred to them, that the movement of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> when another is driven against it, is a fact of which no explanation can be given which will amount to more than a statement of its constant occurrence. That no body can act where it is not, appeared to them as self-evident as that the whole is equal to all the parts. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a> they understood that no body moves another without touching it. They did not perceive, that it was only self-evident where it means that no body can act where it has not the power of acting; and that if it be understood more largely, it is a mere assumption of the proposition on which their whole system rested. Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton reformed Physics, not by simplifying that science, but by rendering it much more complicated. He introduced into it the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a>, of which he ascertained many laws, but which even he did not dare to represent as being as intelligible and as conceivably ultimate as impulsion itself. It was necessary for Laplace to introduce intermediate laws, and to calculate disturbing forces, before the phenomena of the heavenly bodies could be reconciled even to Newton's more complex theory. In the present state of physical and chemical knowledge, a man who should attempt to refer all the immense variety of facts to the simple impulse of the Cartesians, would have no chance of serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of laws augments with the progress of knowledge. The\nspeculations of the followers of Mr Bentham are not unlike the unsuccessful attempt of the Cartesians. Mr Mill, for example, derives the whole theory of Government from the single fact, that every man pursues his interest when he knows it; which he assumes to be a sort of self-evident practical principle, if such a phrase be not contradictory. That a man's pursuing the interest of another, or indeed any other object in nature, is just as conceivable as that he should pursue his own interest, is a proposition which seems never to have occurred to this acute and ingenious writer. Nothing, however, can be more certain than its truth, if the term \"interest\" be employed in its proper sense of general wellbeing, which is the only acceptation in which it can serve the purpose of his arguments. If, indeed, the term be employed to denote the gratification of a predominant desire, his proposition is self-evident, but wholly unserviceable in his argument; for it is clear that individuals and multitudes often desire what they know to be most inconsistent with their general welfare. A nation, as much as an individual, and sometimes more, may not only mistake its interest, but, perceiving it clearly, may prefer the gratification of a strong passion to it. The whole fabric of his political reasoning seems to be overthrown by this single observation; and instead of attempting to explain the immense variety of political facts by the simple principle of a contest of interests, we are reduced to the necessity of once more referring them to that variety of passions, habits, opinions, and prejudices, which we discover only by experience. Mr Mill's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">Education</a> affords another example of the inconvenience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAPING\">leaping</a> at once from the most general laws, to a multiplicity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> appearances. Having assumed, or at least inferred from insufficient premises, that the intellectual and moral character is entirely formed by circumstances, he proceeds, in the latter part of the essay, as if it were a necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of that doctrine that we might easily acquire the power of combining and directing circumstances in such a manner as to produce the best possible character. Without disputing for the present the theoretical proposition, let us consider what would be the reasonableness of similar expectations in a more easily intelligible case. The general theory of the winds is pretty well understood; we know that they proceed from the rushing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> from those portions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> which are more condensed, into those which are more rarefied; but how great a chasm is there between that simple law and the great variety of facts which experience teaches us respecting winds! The constant winds between the tropics are large and regular enough to be in some measure capable of explanation; but who can tell why, in variable climates, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blows to-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> from the east, to-morrow from the west? Who can foretell what its shifting and variations are to be? Who can account for a tempest on one day, and a calm on another? Even if we could foretell the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and infinite variations, how far might we not still be from the power of combining and guiding their causes? No man but the lunatic in the story of Rasselas ever dreamt that he could command the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. The difficulty plainly consists in the multiplicity and minuteness of the circumstances which act on the atmosphere. Are those which influence the formation of the human character likely to be less minute and multiplied?\n\nThe style of Mr Bentham underwent a more remarkable revolution than perhaps befell that of any other celebrated writer. In his early works, it was clear, free, spirited, often and seasonably eloquent. Many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of his later writings retain the inimitable stamp of genius; but he seems to have been oppressed by the vastness of his projected works,\u2014to have thought that he had no longer more than leisure to preserve the heads of them,\u2014to have been impelled by a fruitful mind to new plans before he had completed the old. In this state of things, he\n\n---\n\n1 Essay on Government, originally printed in the Supplement to the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n2 The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of reasoning has been adopted by the writer of a late criticism on Mr Mill's Essay. See Edinburgh Review, No. 97, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1829.\n3 In the Supplement to the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\ngradually ceased to use words for conveying his thoughts to others, but merely employed them as a short-hand to preserve his meaning for his own purpose. It was no wonder that his language should thus become obscure and repulsive. Though many of his technical terms are in themselves exact and pithy, yet the overflow of his vast nomenclature was enough to darken his whole diction.\n\nIt was at this critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> that the arrangement and translation of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> were undertaken by M. Dumont, a generous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a>, who devoted a genius formed for original and lasting works, to diffuse the principles and promote the fame of his master. He whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> Mirabeau did not disdain to borrow,\u2014who, in the same school with Romilly, had studiously pursued the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> as well as the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>,\u2014was perfectly qualified to strip of its uncouthness a philosophy which he understood and admired. As he wrote in a general language, he propagated its doctrines throughout Europe, where they were beneficial to jurisprudence, but perhaps injurious to the cause of reformation in government. That they became more popular abroad than at home, is partly to be ascribed to the taste and skill of M. Dumont; partly to that tendency towards free speculation and bold reform which was more prevalent among nations newly freed, or impatiently aspiring to freedom, than in a people long satisfied with the possession of a system of government like that which others were struggling to obtain, and not yet aware of the imperfections and abuses in their laws, to the amendment of which a cautious consideration of Mr Bentham's works will undoubtedly most materially contribute.","sp":400,"ep":410},{"h":"MASTER OF TRINITY COLLEGE","t":"AND PROFESSOR OF <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">MORAL <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">PHILOSOPHY</a> IN THE UNIVERSITY OF <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">CAMBRIDGE</a>.\nDissertation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">Second</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVERTISEMENT\">Advertisement</a>.\n\nIn publishing a new edition of the *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*, the Proprietors think themselves fortunate in being able to accompany the following Dissertation with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">Preface</a> which presents a succinct and comprehensive view of its leading objects and doctrines. As allusion is there made to the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and interrupted manner\" in which it was written, and to the want of any notice of the recent Ethical speculations of the Continental Philosophers, it may be proper, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to the very eminent author, to lay before the reader the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, as given in the interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">Life</a>, lately published by his Son.\n\n\"The late Mr Dugald Stewart and Mr Playfair had agreed to furnish Dissertations, the one on the history of Metaphysical, Ethical, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> Philosophy, the other on the history of Mathematical and Physical Science, to be prefixed to the Supplement to the *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> was not completed by either of those illustrious writers. Both died before their respective portions of it were finished. The history of the mathematical and physical sciences, by the latter, was brought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> marked by the discoveries of Newton and Leibnitz; and the history of metaphysical philosophy was, by the former, brought down to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the last century. In treating this great branch of his subject, Mr Stewart has occasionally adverted to the kindred branches of ethics and politics; but there was wanting to the completion of his design a full view of the progress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> in those sciences, particularly during the eighteenth century. In 1828, a new and improved edition of the *Encyclop\u00e6dia*, being the seventh, was projected, and it was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the Editor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> for the improvement of this edition, to continue the magnificent historical Dissertations that had been published with the Supplement, and to prefix the whole, in their completed form, to this edition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. A proposal to write a Dissertation in continuation of that of Mr Stewart upon the Ethical and Political Philosophy of the last century, was, in August 1828, accordingly made to Sir James, by the Editor,\nMr Macvey Napier. Having already resolved to devote the remainder of his labours to British history, he had considerable difficulty in acceding to the proposal. But his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of the subject, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> wish to preserve some of his early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-READING\">reading</a> and reflections, and the entreaties of Mr Napier, who had a few years before been introduced to him by Mr Stewart, and with whom he was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of corresponding, prevailed over his scruples, and an agreement in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> for the execution of an historical Dissertation, embracing this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, and extending over the period that had been left untouched by his predecessor. It had originally been agreed, as above stated, that the Dissertation should include political as well as ethical philosophy, but the author's uncertain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, and the parliamentary duties of an interesting crisis, occasioned the abandonment of this part of the plan, and even obliged him to omit the history of the ethical philosophy of the Continent.\n\n\"In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Mr Napier, dated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1829, he says, 'I am now reconciled to my labour by a new rising hope, that it may enable me to make some of the contributions to Ethics which, in more ambitious days, I presumed to expect would have been more extensive.' And in another letter, written about the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, he thus expresses himself: 'You <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> see I have made some (I hope useful) additions to one of the sections, and I would have made more, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> I could have afforded the time. But alas! I have none to spare; otherwise, I like this sort of work much better than any other. Speaking of his progress, a little afterwards, he says, 'I begin to hope well of my discourse, which I endeavour to make a development of ethical principles, as they historically arose\u2014a new attempt in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>.'\n\n\"Again, he thus adverts to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> on Bishop <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a> then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> finished:\u2014'The part in which I think I have done most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, is that in which I have endeavoured to slip in a foundation under Butler's doctrine of the supremacy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>, which he left baseless.'\u2014When he came, in April 1829, to fear that it would be necessary to abandon all notice, not only of the progress of political philosophy, but also of the ethical philosophy of the Continent, he expressed great regret at the probable omission of this last section. 'I shall be quite sorry,' he said, 'if time should require the omission of the continental part, which would be the newest of the whole.'\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> one could be more thoroughly aware than himself of the imperfections that must attach to a work on such a subject, written by snatches, and amidst such frequent and sometimes distressing interruptions; and he accordingly mentions that it was very earnestly his wish 'to leave an addition of it, with such improvements as time, criticism, conversation, and reflection might suggest.' This very natural wish he unfortunately did not live <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> enough to have an opportunity afforded him of carrying into execution.\"\nA History of the Philosophy of Morals may, for many purposes, be considered as forming a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> portion of the Philosophy itself; and probably, to most readers, the portion which is by far the most agreeable. The writer of such a history, if it be worthy the name, must present all that has been done by the moralists of preceding times as steps in a progress; and must thus be led to point out the ultimate position which the subject has in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> assumed.\n\nThe history of ethical speculations which the following Dissertation contains, has, however, not only the merit of exhibiting the present condition of ethical philosophy, but has also a peculiar advantage in the point of view from which the subject is regarded; since the author's opinions were, in the main, those to which the most moderate and popular writers of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> had generally been led, and which had therefore most influenced general literature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> reasonings. A view of Moral Philosophy written in such a spirit, escapes, and may in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> correct, the exaggerations and paradoxes of new and immature theories.\n\nSome of Mackintosh's views were peculiarly his own, but much of his system of opinions was adopted from the doctrines of the great philosophers whom he here reviews. Perhaps some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> may be thrown on the following Dissertation, by stating the main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of both kinds, as they may be collected from the work itself; and this will be in some measure done in the present preface. Also, as the ethical system embraced by Mackintosh included some tenets which have in our own time been the subject of much controversy, and on which it appears to me that errors have been widely prevalent, I have ventured to make a few remarks, such as I thought most fitted to put the doctrines in their proper point of view. I may add, that as my author's survey is in a great measure restricted to British writers, I have not thought myself called on to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> which ethical speculations have recently assumed in France and Germany, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> of the indications which have appeared in the literature of our own country of the influence of these foreign impulses.\n\nThe views which Mackintosh entertained, and which were peculiarly the result of his own reasonings, are delivered in various parts of the Dissertation, but will perhaps become more intelligible by being stated as they are to be collected.\nfrom the whole. The work was written in an irregular and interrupted manner; a circumstance which introduced many repetitions, and a mixture of the didactic with the historical portions, which may have given rise to some confusion.\n\nI. The first main point in Mackintosh's view of ethics, is his opinion, that those which are usually termed the benevolent affections (as, for example, parental love and compassion) are properly described as disinterested. This doctrine he notices as one of the valuable truths which Butler brought clearly into view (p. 360); and he attaches to it so much consequence, that, in concluding his Dissertation (p. 432), he declares himself ready to relinquish his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, if it be proved to be at variance with the reality of the social affections, which he there speaks of as the most indisputable and the most important part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.\n\nOpinions opposite to this have been asserted in various forms: some, for instance, have said, that the affections are all merely forms of self-love; or that they are selfish; or that they really regard self; or have professed to deduce them from some selfish principle, as Hobbes from the love of power. A few remarks may here suffice on each of these modifications of the selfish system.\n\n(1.) Butler, and after him other writers, as well as Mackintosh, wish, for the sake of clearness, to confine the application of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> self-love to that cool and prudential regard to our own welfare which weighs and estimates the chances and means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>; and which is thus distinct from the passions and affections which impel us to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> immediately, without intervening reflection or calculation of consequences. It will probably be universally allowed, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> or pity, friendship or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> love, are clearly distinct from self-love, in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>. The term self-love has been objected to altogether by some persons, and Mackintosh himself appears to be dissatisfied with it (p. 422). Yet it seems to be not unapt to describe that state of mind in which we regard ourselves as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> and detached objects of solicitude, and provide for our own wellbeing, as we would do for that of a friend whose passions we can resist, and whose future and permanent good we try to secure, without losing our calmness of feeling and clearness of view. The self-love which aims at our own welfare in such a temper may make us do kind actions; but it is, in itself, broadly distinguished from kindness and love of other persons.\n\nBut further, it is argued by Butler and Mackintosh, that not only the benevolent affections, but the appetites also, are clearly distinguishable from this self-love. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> may, as Butler says, eat from self-love, out of a regard to his health; he may also eat from the appetite of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>; but the grounds of action are plainly different in the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. The gratification which results from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> does not make it an act of self-love. And just as little, they urge, does the gratification which accompanies the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a>, or any other benevolent affections, justify us in ascribing them to such self-love as we have described.\n\n(2.) As the object of the appetites is something different from ourselves and our own feelings, the object of the benevolent desires is so too. As food is the object of hunger, the gratification or the wellbeing of the child is the object of parental affection. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> which results when the object is attained is not the aim of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>, for it does not enter into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>; nor could we derive pleasure from the attainment of such objects except the desire had previously existed (pp. 360, 364). In conformity with this view, it is maintained by the writers of this school, that neither the appetites nor the desires can properly be called selfish. (Stewart, Outlines of Moral Philosophy, p. 86.)\n\nThe term selfish, which is, I think, not used by Butler in the part of his works now referred to, is, however, that about which the controversy on this subject has generally raged most hotly. In opposition to the opinion just stated, it has often been said, that the desire of power, of wealth, of superiority, of esteem, are selfish principles.\n\nIf it be contended that these desires (and the benevolent affections for the same reason) are selfish because they are felt by self, Mackintosh answers (p. 360), that acts of the understanding, and processes of reasoning, might be called selfish\non the same ground. But it is easily seen that something different from this is usually meant by the assertion. When it is popularly contended that the love of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, for instance, is a selfish principle of action, it is generally implied that this affection is more selfish than to common eyes it appears. The assertor gives himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> for having analysed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> in question into elements not immediately obvious\u2014for discerning that a feeling, which at first appears to have an elevated and exterior aim, has, in fact, latently, a reflex view and a lower object. The disposition which men have to be pleased with such attempts at the dissection of motives into baser elements, is widely prevalent: it is this disposition, for instance, which has given to the Maxims of La Rochefoucauld their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> and their popularity.\n\nBut the flashes of the epigrammatist, whatever applause they may excite, are not likely to be of much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> as a light to the philosophical reasoner; and the question, What motives can properly be called selfish, as a point of moral philosophy, must be decided in a very different spirit. Now, the popular disposition to detect selfishness in human motives is obviously accompanied by a depreciating estimate of the feelings in which this taint is perceived. But this disapproval, in spite of the conceit and ill-nature in which it may originate, manifestly implies a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that men's feelings may be, and ought to be, other than selfish; for how can we condemn a person for having selfish feelings only, if human nature admits of no others? The common application of the term selfish, implies a moral disapprobation as well as a metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>. We endeavour in vain to dissolve this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>; and yet, so long as it subsists, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> which we pronounce in some cases, implies the possibility of cases in which it is not deserved. If we despise the love of fame as a selfish motive, we reserve our admiration for motives of a different class. The emphasis with which we apply the term, implies that it is not universally applicable. But when we assert, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that all our affections are selfish, we employ the word in a technical manner, distinct from its common use. Now, where is the advantage to philosophy of telling us that our love of parents and friends, that our gratitude and compassion, are selfish feelings, if the assertion be true only when the word is used in a sense different from the common one? The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a> startles us; when explained, it ceases to shock; but why incur the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of such an explanation? It must be allowed that such affections as I have just mentioned deserve and attract our love and approbation as much as any feelings can do; why, then, use terms which seem fitted only to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> towards them our disapproval and aversion?\n\nWe may add, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a> (Lectures, vol. iv., p. 63), that if the benevolent and virtuous affections are to be called selfish, it will be necessary to form two divisions of selfish actions\u2014one containing those selfish actions in which self is the direct object; the other containing those very different selfish actions which are usually called disinterested. Till it is seen what advantage would be gained by this new nomenclature, it is surely better to use terms in their usual sense.\n\nIt is not easy to fix precise limits to the use of the term selfish, which thus denotes, not a positive philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a>, but a comparative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, to which some blame inevitably clings. Mackintosh says well (p. 360), \"The weakness of the social affections, and the strength of the private desires, properly constitute selfishness.\" And Stewart (Outlines, p. 114) gives nearly the same account of this word, which he illustrates by saying, \"Though we apply the epithet selfish to avarice, and to low and private sensuality, we never apply it to the desire of knowledge, or to the pursuits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, which are certainly sources of more exquisite pleasures than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> or sensuality can bestow.\"\n\n(3.) That the benevolent affections, in their usual form, have not self for their immediate object, is so evident that it needs hardly to be insisted on. In what sense can the mother who unhesitatingly exposes her life to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> that of her child, be said to regard herself, of whom she never once thinks? In what way does Desdemona act from self-regard, when, in the very\narticle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, she endeavours to shelter the reputation of the husband who murders her? To speak of self as the object of the regard or contemplation of the person acting in such instances, or in any instances in which the action proceeds directly from the benevolent affections, is to deprive words and phrases of all distinct and intelligible meaning and use.\n\n(4.) When any particular theory is propounded, by which the results of the benevolent affections are traced to some remote interested principle, a refutation of the theory is readily suggested by a consideration of the common characteristic circumstances of the affections. Thus, with regard to Hobbes' system\u2014that the affections have their origin in the love of power\u2014Butler answers briefly, but satisfactorily, that such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to anything at all resembling the known state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>;\u2014that we wish good to others quite independently of our being ourselves the authors of it;\u2014that we make distinctions among the objects of our good-will, where the love of power would make no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>;\u2014that the love of power would be gratified by doing harm as well as good, and that thus cruelty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> would be the same affection. (Sermon I, Note; and the following Dissertation, p. 337.) And if it were proposed to reduce the benevolent affections to any other system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> principles and associations of thought, it might be answered, that if these supposed original principles involve the desire of any besides physical pleasures (as the desire of wealth, power, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>), they themselves require analysis, at least as much as the affections. It is at least, as possible to love a father, as it is to desire his estate; and the greatest good that the estate can procure us, can hardly consist of anything more intelligible than filial love. Nor would such an hypothesis avail us; for the affections are, in the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of cases, far stronger than any aggregation of such supposed elements would make them. To what purpose do we associate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> with the desire of wealth, power, and dignity, in order to form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> affections, if we are compelled to allow that the whole feeling thus produced is greater than the sum of all its parts? To claim philosophical merit for such an analysis of the disinterested emotions into the effects of association of ideas, is to deprive the terms Association and Analysis of all meaning. Or how are our benevolent affections accounted for by the need we have of our friends as means, if this regard to the means be both much stronger and much more distinctly intelligible than the regard to the ends can ever become? Does not this shew that, in fact, the hypothetical end is not our end?\n\nOn such grounds, Mackintosh and other writers appear to do well in arranging the benevolent affections as a class of principles of action distinct from the desire of power, superiority, and the like. Those are not capable of being analysed into these, and we are sensible of an insurmountable incongruity when the two classes are brought into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>. If the love of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of love, of power, and similar ingredients, will it not follow, that if we expect to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> power by sacrificing a parent rather than by serving him, it is consistent with the nature of our best affections that we should do so! And is not this a conclusion too monstrous to be accepted by any moralist? The benevolent and family affections, and the desire of power, appear, then, to differ in some other way than in being modifications of the same elements; and, even if we choose (unphilosophically as it has appeared) to call the latter class of principles selfish, the former must be arranged in a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-GROUP\">group</a>, which we cannot designate better than by calling them disinterested.\n\nII. The next leading principles of Mackintosh's philosophy are, the independent existence and the supremacy of the conscience or moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>. Here also he ascribes to Butler the merit of having first brought these doctrines into a clear light (p. 361); though Hutcheson, who\n\n---\n\n1 Deedless. A guiltless death I die.\nEmilie. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>!\nDeedless. Nobody; I myself; farewell;\nCommend me to my kind <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">lord</a>; O farewell.\u2014(Died.)\nhad somewhat of a steadier view of this faculty, gave it the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>.\n\nThe question of the moral sense has been much discussed since Butler's time. It is not necessary here to go fully into this controversy, but I may be allowed to make a few remarks on some of the arguments connected with the following Dissertation.\n\n(1.) In the first place, as to the existence of the moral faculty. It is allowed on all sides that we have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of moral obligation; and the question is, Whether this conception can be resolved into some operation of the intellectual faculties, as the perception of general utility; or whether, on the contrary, it is incapable of being thus resolved, and must properly be ascribed to a separate faculty.\n\nIt will readily appear that the discussion of this question must be attended by great difficulties, for we cannot easily find a test to determine, or terms to express, the identity or the difference of our perceptions of the useful and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>. These internal perceptions can only be described by means of analogical and metaphorical language; and this must discharge its office very imperfectly. Even with respect to external senses, where the meaning of our terms is naturally much more clear and palpable, an exact treatment of such questions is far from easy. We cannot, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> language, convey a conception of the difference of sights and sounds. Is the perception of form a different faculty from the perception of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>? This question has been found extremely perplexing; we may therefore be certain that the question of the distinct existence of the moral faculty will require great clearness and steadiness of thought for its solution.\n\nBut still the question does not seem to be incapable of answer. Do we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the same thing when we say that an action is right, and when we say that it is, on the whole, and taken in all its consequences, useful? It must be observed, that the question is not, Whether right actions are, on the whole, useful; for that we will suppose to be granted; but it is, Whether, by describing them as right, we mean nothing more than that we believe them to be useful? If by right, and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> words, we intend some quality and attribute which useful and similar terms do not express, we must have the faculty of conceiving such a quality; and this faculty is the moral sense. Such a faculty Butler, and after him many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> writers, including Mackintosh, hold to be part of human nature. The following are some of the grounds for his opinion:\n\n(2.) The words which express what is morally right, and the related ideas, cannot be replaced by any different set of terms. Right, duty, what we ought to do, are not expressed to the satisfaction of any one by any phraseology borrowed from the consideration of consequences. They are as untranslatable into the language which contemplates utility alone, as the names of colours are incapable of being expressed by those denoting the properties of space. When I say that an act is my duty, that it is right, I give an entire assent to the rule which commands me to do it, whatever be the consequences. It may be true that all acts of duty are, taken in all their consequences, useful; but assuredly this is not what we mean, this is not the quality we ascribe to them, by the use of such terms.\n\nPerhaps the most distinctive of these terms is the word ought, and the corresponding words which occur in all languages. It is universally felt that when we say, in a moral sense, that we ought to do any action, we mean something different from saying it is advantageous in its consequences. This word ought, which, as Mackintosh says \"most perfectly denotes duty,\" appears to be the simplest and most universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of the moral sense.\n\n(3.) The impossibility of wresting this word, ought, to the side of the utilitarian theory, may, I think, be inferred from the amusing vehemence with which Mr Bentham endeavours to expel it from his territory. \"The talisman of arrogance, indolence, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, is to be found in a single word, an authoritative imposture, which in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> it will be frequently necessary to unveil. It is the word 'ought,' 'ought or ought not,' as circumstances may be.\"\n\n---\n\n1 Whewell's Elements of Morality, Art. 73. (2d Edition.)\nIn deciding you ought to do this, you ought not to do it, is not every question of morals set at rest?\n\n\"If the use of the word be admissible at all, it 'ought' to be banished from the vocabulary of morals.\" (Deontology, vol. i., p. 32.)\n\nTill this is done, he proposes to neutralise this obnoxious term by the use of another potent word\u2014\"why!\"\n\nIt is clear that the reason why the word so frequently occurs to excite Mr Bentham's displeasure is, that it refers to a universal and unavoidable aspect of actions, which men constantly recognise, and cannot help expressing in the words they familiarly employ. And Mr Bentham's \"why\" involves an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> no less dogmatical than that of which he complains; for by it he intends to prescribe that the answer shall be in no other language than that of the utilitarian theory.\n\n(4.) The unavoidable occurrence of the conception implied in the word ought, notwithstanding that it resists the attempt at analysis of which we have just spoken, may be inferred from its use by those whose theoretical views would lead them to reject it; as, for example, Mr Bentham himself. He supposes a controversy between an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and a modern moralist. (Deont., vol. i., p. 72.) \"The modern, as probably he will keep neither his principles nor his temper, says to the ancient, 'Your moral sense is nothing to the purpose; yours is corrupt, abominable, detestable; all nations cry out against you.' 'No such thing,' replies the ancient; 'and if they did, it would be nothing to the purpose: our business was to inquire, not what people think, but what they ought to think.'\" And this \"ought\" of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> is supposed to terminate the controversy, so far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> is concerned.\n\n(5.) It is, indeed, expressly allowed by Mr Bentham himself, that the word utility, and its conjugates, do not express our judgment in cases of moral conduct. \"The mind will not be satisfied,\" he says (vol. i., p. 35), \"with such phrases as\u2014'it is useless to commit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>,' or 'it would be useful to prevent it.'\" Surely we may be allowed to say that the reason why men are not satisfied with such phrases is, that they do not express their meaning. The repugnance and indignation with which we regard crimes and vices is something distinct from the perception of their results; and no word which expresses the transgression of utility satisfies us, except it also express the transgression of rectitude. Murder is harmful to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, but it is also wicked. The former expression <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a> the view of our understanding as to the consequences of the act; the latter expression conveys the feeling of our moral nature as to its moral quality: the utilitarian scheme of Mr Bentham appears to aim at confounding these assertions.\n\n(6.) But the same recognition of the difference of duty and usefulness in common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, which Mr Bentham has made in the passage just quoted, appears also in other circumstances; as, for instance, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the work already quoted, Deontology, and in the reasons assigned for coining such a name. This term is professedly chosen because \"utilitarianism offers too vague and undefined an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> to the mind.\" (Vol. i., p. 34.) If the word from which Deontology is derived had borrowed its meaning from the notion of utility alone, it is not likely that it would have become more intelligible by being translated out of Latin into Greek. But the term Deontology expresses Moral Science (and expresses it well), precisely because it signifies the Science of Duty, and contains no reference to utility. It is a term well chosen, to describe a system of ethics founded on any other than Mr Bentham's principle. Macintosh, who held that \u1fe5\u03b5\u1fd6 \u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2,\u2014what men ought to do,\u2014was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> notion of morality, might very properly have termed the science Deontology. The system of which Mr Bentham is the representative\u2014that of those who make\n\n---\n\n1 The title of this book is \"Deontology, &c., from the MSS. of Jeremy Bentham;\" but recently I have been blamed in a Review for citing it as his. (1852.)\n\n2 Perhaps the reader may be amused by Mr Bentham's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of winding up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>:\u2014\"Thereupon the modern kicks the ancient, or spits in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a>; or, if he is strong enough, throws him behind the fire. One can think of no other method that is at once natural and consistent, of continuing the debate.\" It is satisfactory to see that Mr Bentham does not seem to have thought the use of the word ought by the one party, though very provoking, justified the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> which he describes on the other side.\nmorality dependent on the production of happiness, has long been designated in Germany by the term *Eudemonism*, derived from the Greek word for happiness (*eudaimonia*). If we were to adopt this term we should have to oppose the Deontological to the Eudemonist school; and we must necessarily place those who hold a peculiar moral faculty,\u2014Butler, Stewart, Brown, Mackintosh,\u2014in the former, and those who are usually called utilitarian philosophers in the latter class.\n\n(7.) The irrelevancy of Paley's mode of treating the question of the moral sense is so generally allowed at present that we need not dwell on it here. But we may observe, that other mistakes, flowing from a like misapprehension, effect his analysis of virtue. He endeavours to make an advance in this inquiry by the question, \"Why am I obliged to keep my word, or to do any other moral act?\" And by his answer to this question, he reduces moral obligation to two elements\u2014external constraint, and the command of a superior. This attempt at an analysis of morality is singularly futile: for, of the two supposed elements, external constraint annihilates the morality of the act, and the reference to a superior presupposes moral obligation, since a superior is one whom it is our duty to obey. If Paley had stated his question in the simpler form, \"Why ought I to keep my word?\" he would have had before him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> more to the purpose of moral philosophy, and one to which his answer would have been palpably inapplicable.\n\n(8.) The argument hitherto urged has been, that the impossibility of resolving the ideas of moral right and duty into other ideas, borrowed from utility, is implied in the common use of language; and virtually acknowledged by utilitarian writers themselves. Other arguments may be drawn from the nature of the feelings with which we contemplate actions, and which, it has been truly said, are quite irreconcileable with the supposition that our moral estimate of actions arises from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> on happiness, and that our moral estimate of men looks only to their having calculated such consequences well or ill. Our admiration of the higher virtues, our indignation and scorn of the baser vices, are entirely different from an assent to, or dissent from, the agent's estimate of consequences. We can conceive a remorse for sins committed, which is something very distinct from a regret at having mistaken the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to happiness. A bad man, in a moral sense, is not merely a man who has had a bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> for calculating consequences, as he would be if morality resided in the intellect alone. But this argument has been sufficiently insisted upon by others.\n\n(9.) Thus, as we separate the affections from the desires, we distinguish the moral sense, or conscience, from both. Butler, and Mackintosh with him, express the relation of conscience to the other principles of action, by ascribing to it a *supremacy*, or a right of command. This language is metaphorical, but in that respect it does not differ from all the rest of the language which we use concerning mental operations and relations; and the material question is, whether, in this case, the language is intelligible. It is language which has been familiarly used from the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> to our own; and I think it will be seen by any one who reads with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> the pages of good writers who employ this language, as for instance Butler, that they have a distinct meaning in their minds, and that their expressions are fitted to convey it. Butler shews that prudential self-love is a principle differing from the desires and passions in other ways than in mere strength; and thus establishes that there is a difference of kind and order, as well as of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> and power, among our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> principles. He reminds us that we can conform our acts to rules, and that this differs from acting as we please, or obeying the strongest impulse; that man is intelligibly said to contain in his own mind a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of right action; that under the influence of such a principle he approves and condemns, and thus passes judgment on acts and dispositions; that this is the proper office of such a principle;\n\n---\n\n1. The use of the term *Supremacy*, ascribed to the conscience, is liable to convey an erroneous and dangerous doctrine, that every one's conscience is for him the supreme rule of right and wrong. The word *Authority*, which is all that Butler and Mackintosh's argument requires, avoids this inconvenience.\n\nSee the Preface to Whewell's edition of Butler's Three Sermons on Human Nature, and Whewell's Elements of Morality, art. 271, 2d edit. (Note added 1852.)\nand that right and authority are implied in this office. When we have distinguished the moral sense from the other faculties of our nature, such language appears to convey, as well as language can convey, the relation of that faculty to the others. \"To declare what ought and ought not to be done,\" it has been said, \"is the essence of command, that is, of moral command or rightful authority.\" And thus such authority belongs to the faculty which determines that some of our actions and emotions are, and others are not, what they ought to be.\n\nWe shall have to speak farther of this supremacy of conscience in treating of Mackintosh's explanation of it. But we may, in the first place, say a few words on the application of this doctrine to questions of ethics.\n\n(10.) Mackintosh has, with great propriety, insisted upon the importance of a distinction of two parts of Moral Philosophy, which are often confounded;\u2014the Theory of Moral Sentiments, and the Criterion of Morality, (p. 313.) The question of the independent existence and character of the moral faculty belongs to the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the subject; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of our system of ethics flows from the latter. There is no necessary collision between doctrines on these two points. We may hold that morality is an original quality of actions, and may still form our rules of morality by tracing the consequences of actions.\n\nThis distinction has often been neglected. Those who hold that utility constitutes morality, often call upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> of a moral sense, to show how the assertion of such a faculty leads us to distinguish right from wrong, or how it can supersede the criterion of general utility. To this it may be replied;\u2014that the existence of a moral conscience in man is an important truth, but that this truth alone cannot be expected to replace all the principles and deductions by which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> system of philosophical ethics is to be produced; that the construction of such a system is undoubtedly a difficult problem;\u2014but that we shall inevitably obtain an erroneous solution of the problem, if we do not take into our account the operation of the moral faculty. The criterion of utility cannot safely be applied without acknowledging the independent value of morality, any more than the moral faculty can always decide well without the consideration of consequences. For among the most important results of actions, we must include their effect upon the moral habits and feelings of men; and must consider these effects as claiming attention for their own sake. The promotion of human virtue must be our aim, as well as the augmentation of human happiness. We cannot by any analysis exclude the former of these ends; happiness depends on the exercise of the virtuous affections, far more clearly than virtue depends on the pursuit of happiness. The most wise and moderate of the utilitarian moralists do, accordingly, apply their method in this manner. Thus Paley, (B. III., p. III., c. III.) in estimating the guilt of corrupting a person to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of one offence, states it as one ground of condemnation, that such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEDUCTION\">seduction</a> is the destruction of the person's moral principle. And it appears, at present, to be generally allowed, that the utilitarian doctrine cannot be applied without considering the effect on the moral feelings of men as among the important consequences of action. \"It often happens,\" it is said, \"that an essential part of the morality or immorality of an action, or a rule of action, consists in its influence on the agent's own mind.\" \"Many actions moreover, produce effects on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of other persons besides the agent.\" The effects here spoken of are, in fact, effects on the moral habits of thought; and thus the existence of the moral attributes of the mind, as original and independent objects of the attention of the ethical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, is presupposed in this mode of applying the utilitarian scheme.\n\nIf, indeed, we take such good and bad consequences into the account;\u2014if among the useful effects of actions, we conceive the most useful to be the improvement of man's moral character;\u2014if, we frame our rules so that they shall conduct as much as possible to virtuous feeling, as well as to beneficial action,\u2014to purity of heart, as well as to rectitude of conduct;\u2014if we aim at man's general well-being, and not merely at his gratification;\u2014I know not what moralist would object to a criterion of morality so drawn from consequences, or would deny that the promotion of human happiness, and of human virtue, require the same practical rules. Mackintosh would un-\ndoubtedly have assented to this; for he not only allows the universal coincidence of virtue with utility in the largest sense (p. 417), but founds his recommendation of the highest forms of virtue on the advantage of virtuous habits and feelings, both to the possessor and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>; as when he speaks of the trite example of Regulus (p. 355), of the character of Andrew Fletcher (p. 399), and of the virtue of courage (p. 397). If we could take into due account the whole value of right principles, and the whole happiness produced by virtuous feelings, we could commit no practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in making the advantageous consequences of actions the measure of their morality.\n\nBut this can happen only by considering moral good as a primary object, valuable for its own sake; not by supposing that virtue is aimed at, as subservient to some other purpose of more genuine utility: and no sagacity or fairness in estimating useful consequences can stand as a substitute for the love of right itself. It is true, that honesty is the best policy; but he who is honest only out of policy, does not come up even to the vulgar notion of a virtuous man. If a man were tempted by the opportunity of gaining a large estate through a safe but fraudulent proceeding, the utilitarian doctrine would seem to recommend him to weigh both sides well, though it would direct him in conclusion to decide in favour of probity; but the common judgment of mankind would hardly deem him honest if he hesitated at all. And in like manner in regard to other temptations, the safety of virtue appears to consist so little in tracing all possible consequences, that it has been held, that to deliberate is to be lost, and that the only secure protection is that purity of mind which will not look at the prospect of sensual pleasure when it forms one side of the account. We cannot help saying with Cicero, \"H\u00e6c nonne est turpe dubitare philosophos, qua ne rustici quidem dubitant?\" (Off. iii. 19.)\n\nIndeed, it appears to be acknowledged by the advocates of the rule of utility, that it is not safe to apply the principle separately in each particular case. Mr Bentham has urged with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of expression (Deontology, vol. ii., ch. i.), the propriety of framing general rules, and conforming our practice invariably to these, so as to avoid the temptations of our frailty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> in particular instances. If a reverence for general maxims of morality, and a constant reference to the common precepts of virtue, take the place, in the utilitarian's mind, of the direct application of his principle, there will remain little difference between him and the believer in original moral distinctions; for the practical rules of the two will rarely differ, and in both systems the rules will be the moral guides of thought and conduct.\n\n(11.) But though the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> agree so far, there still will be found a deficiency on the part of the consistent utilitarian. A persuasion that moral good is something different from, and superior to, mere pleasure, is requisite to give our preference of it that tone of enthusiasm and affection which belongs to virtuous feeling. To approve a rule as right, is different from liking it as profitable; to admire an act of virtuous self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> as we are capable of admiring, is a feeling so different from the apprehension of any usefulness the act may have, that the comparison of the two things is altogether incongruous. The moral faculty converts our perception of the quality of actions into an affection of the strongest kind; nor can we be satisfied with any account of our moral sentiments which excludes this feature in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>. Thus, as we hold the affections to be motives of an order superior to the desires which have reference to ourselves only, we maintain the moral faculty, the conscience, the affection towards duty, to be a principle of action of an order superior both to the desires and to the other affections. Without the acknowledgement of this subordination, the language and feelings of men when they compare the claims of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> pleasure, of social affection, and of duty, are altogether unintelligible and absurd.\n\n(12.) Of those who have held the doctrine opposite of this, namely, that all these sentiments are composed of elements the same in kind, Paley has expressed the opinion in perhaps the most offensive form, being carried on partly by his love of clearness, and partly by his indifference to mere speculation. \"In this inquiry,\" he says, \"I will omit much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a> on the dignity and capacity of our nature,\"\nthe superiority of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> to the body, the rational to the animal part of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>: upon the worthiness, refinement, and delicacy of some satisfactions, and the meanness, grossness, and sensuality of others; because I hold that pleasures differ in nothing but in continuance and in intensity.\"\n\nIf we could use such a term without an unbecoming disrespect towards a virtuous and useful writer, this opinion might properly be called brutish, since it recognises no difference between the pleasures of man and those of the lowest animals. If we are to promote human happiness in this sense, I do not see how the same obligation does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> upon us to promote the happiness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a> with the same care. And if the pleasures of sense differ only in intensity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> from the pleasures of filial and parental affection, we ought to know how many days of luxurious living are equivalent to the pleasure of saving a father's life, that we may decide rightly when these claims happen to come in competition. If utilitarian moral obligation consists in being regulated by such calculations, we cannot be surprised at the disgust with which so many persons speak of the scheme which refers us to \"the calculations of utility.\"\n\n(13.) I shall not pretend to determine whether Mr Bentham, and those who agree with him, have sometimes overlooked the conditions under which alone their principle can be safely applied; or whether, at any period, they were justly liable to Mackintosh's censure (p. 392) of \"clinging to opinions because they are obnoxious; of wantonly wounding the most respectable feelings of mankind.\" In more recent times this cannot, I think, be said of them; for extreme opinions on the political questions of the day, however unfavourable may be their influence on the moral speculations with which they are combined, are not appropriately spoken of in such terms. At present I think we may discern in utilitarian writers a wish to conciliate rather than to shock the moral sympathies of their countrymen; and perhaps the opposite schools of moralists may thus be brought nearer to each other. If those who profess to make the utility of our actions the measure of their morality, include in utility the effect upon the moral habits of ourselves and others;\u2014if they repel with indignation the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> that they lose sight of virtuous feeling, and of the beneficial influence of good actions on the frame of mind;\u2014if they claim to have their estimate of good interpreted in the same way as Plato's; and speak of \"that generous and inspiring tone which gives so much of their usefulness as well as of their charm\" to writings such as his;\u2014if they even become discontented with the name of utility, and wish to have their science called deontology;\u2014the question at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> between them and their opponents ceases to be a difference of moral rule, and, almost, to be a discordance of moral feeling; and becomes rather a point of metaphysical analysis. They do not indeed become a deontological school, but they shew how near a eudemonist school may approach to being so.\n\nWhether such an approximation would gratify the writers to whom I refer, I have no means of knowing; and if I am told that I am mistaken in my interpretation of the indications to which I have alluded, I shall not attempt to maintain the opinion. It would be nothing new or strange if persons honestly seeking truth from different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, should be led towards the same point; but if they bring with them an angry and hostile spirit, they may approach only to quarrel more bitterly. It is, however, possible to seek truth of all kinds in a calm and charitable temper; and it would be very strange if moral truths were held to be an exception to the desirableness of doing this. Captiousness and petulance, fierceness and menace, personal contumely and angry buffoonery, may be used in this as in other discussions; but I conceive that no writer on morals, duly feeling the dignity and obligations of his office, will, by any act of his, recognise those who have recourse to such modes of treating the subject, as moral philosophers.\u00b9\n\nIII. I now proceed to notice a third principle which enters into Mackintosh's philosophy, and\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps we have now reached a period, when I may remark, without reviving any angry feelings, that these expressions were intended to refer to Criticisms of this Dissertation of Mackintosh which had been published, and especially to a Fragment on Mackintosh, the title of which was, I suppose, suggested by Bentham's Fragment on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>, the latter being a severe criticism on a portion of Blackstone's Commentaries. (Note added 1852.)\nwhich, in the way in which he holds it, is more peculiar to him than the two hitherto stated. He assents, in a great measure, to the explanation suggested by Hume and Smith (p. 376), but more fully developed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a> (p. 382), of the formation of our passions and affections, and even of our sentiments of virtue and duty, by means of \"the association of ideas.\" He further urges this theory more at length in his general remarks (p. 421).\n\n(1.) But into this view, as usually understood, he introduces several modifications; and, in particular, he asserts that the effect of such \"association\" may be something very different from the mere juxtaposition of the component elements. Thus he says that the result may be so entirely a single sentiment, that \"the originally separate feelings can no longer be disjoined\" (p. 384); and, moreover, that \"the compound may have properties not to be found in any of its component parts;\" as constantly happens, he observes, in material compounds.\n\nIt is clear that this view of the effect of the \"association of ideas,\" may give results very different from those often founded upon that doctrine. If we say that gratitude, or compassion, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a>, are only certain trains of pleasurable associations, we are generally understood to assert that we can again resolve those feelings into the constituent and associated elements; and that by so doing we may hope to reason upon them most philosophically and exactly. But Mackintosh's mode of considering these and other emotions would allow of neither of these inferences. He supposes \"association\" to be employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> rather than in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> of our moral sentiments; in awakening affections rather than in connecting notions.\n\n(2.) The ideas or the feelings which are concerned in this process, are said to be associated; but this is, he declares, a very inadequate word to express the \"complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> and fusion\" which occur (p. 381). This association presupposes laws and powers of the mind itself, according to which the conjunction produces its results. The celebrated comparison of the mind to a sheet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> is not just, except we consider that there may be in the paper itself many circumstances which affect the nature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> (p. 380). A recent writer, however, appears to me to have supplied us with a much more apt and beautiful comparison. Man's soul at first, says Professor Sedgwick, is one unvaried blank, till it has received the impressions of external <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. \"Yet has this blank,\" he adds, \"been already touched by a celestial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>; and, when plunged in the colours which surround it, it takes not its tinge from accident but design, and comes out covered with a glorious pattern.\"\n\n\u2014(Discourse on the Studies of the University, p. 54.) This modern image of the mind as a prepared blank, is well adapted to occupy a permanent place in opposition to the ancient sheet of white paper.\n\n(3.) Not only the word association, but also the word ideas, in the Lockian expression, appears to Mackintosh to be unsuited to its purpose: since an association takes place \"of thoughts with emotions, as well as with each other\" (p. 382). Our author has indeed shewn great solicitude to bring into clear view that part of our nature which he here distinguishes from thought:\u2014\"that other part of it, hitherto without any adequate name, which feels, and desires, and loves, and hopes, and wills\" (p. 336). After balancing the various terms which may be used to express the aggregate of such feelings, he inclines finally to call it the emotive or pathematic part of man (p. 380).\n\nThus the \"association of ideas,\" according to Mackintosh, would more properly be termed the composition of ideas and emotions. In his view of the composite, as losing all trace of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> composition, the author was, in some measure, following Hartley (p. 385), though he justly claims the credit (p. 384) of seeing more distinctly than his predecessors the important truth, that the compound may have properties not found in any of its component parts.\n\n(4.) Mackintosh maintains that this is by no means a modification of the selfish system (p. 407); for the \"affections and the moral senti-\n\n---\n\n1 These terms have not had much \"luck\" (to use Mackintosh's own phraseology in this passage). In common language, this part of our nature is often called the heart, as distinguished from the head. We may perhaps best describe it by the compound phrase used in the Dissertation itself; the desires and affections. Some recent writers have spoken of the emotional part of our nature. (1852.)\n\nDISS. II.\nments, though educed by association, only become what they are when they lose all trace of self-regard.\" \"If the affections be acquired, they are justly called natural; and if their origin be personal, their nature may and does become disinterested.\"\n\nIV. But we must now consider another peculiarity of Mackintosh's system; I speak of what he names his Theory of Conscience.\n\n(1.) Being persuaded, as we have seen, that the moral faculty exists and exercises a rightful supremacy over the active principles, he has attempted to explain and account for this relation of our emotions. His view is given in his remarks on Butler (p. 362), and again in his concluding remarks (p. 425). According to this theory, the moral faculty consists of a class of desires and affections which have dispositions and volitions for their sole object. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of our moral sentiments will, he conceives, explain their peculiar character and attributes. He expresses the relation which he wishes to describe, by saying that the moral sentiments are in contact with the will (p. 362); or, as he further elucidates this, \"they may and do stand between any other practical principle and its object, while it is absolutely impossible that any other shall intercept their connection with the will.\" The conscience requires virtuous acts and dispositions to action; and by such requisition it can check and control any desires of external objects; but no desire of any outward gratification can prevent the conscience from demanding a virtuous direction of the will; and this mental relation explains and justifies, Mackintosh conceives, that attribution of supremacy and command to the conscience on which moral writers have often insisted (p. 362).\n\n(2.) Thus conscience consists in, or rather results from, the composition of all those sentiments, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> object is a state of the will, intimately and inseparably blended, and held in a perfect state of solution (p. 424); and the conscience being thus represented as analogous to the desires, it implies, in the same way as other desires, a sense of what is grateful, and a faculty of dwelling, in thought, on the gratification so obtained.\n\n(3.) But if, in order further to develop this theory, it be asked what states of the will are thus agreeable to the conscience; or, in other words, what, according to this system, is the general character of the dispositions and actions which we consider good and right; Mackintosh's answer would be, that the conscience, being educated and awakened by certain processes of association, is thus composed of various elements, and finds good under various forms;\u2014that (p. 423) the beneficial volitions are delightful, and that, therefore, they strongly attract those affections which regard the will, and thus give rise to some of the elements of conscience;\u2014that our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> against those who disappoint our wish for the happiness of others, when in like manner detached from persons and transferred to dispositions, becomes a sense of justice, another element of conscience;\u2014that courage, energy, decision, when tamed by the society of the affections, and considered as dispositions only, become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>, and gratify the moral sense;\u2014and that even those habits which mainly affect our own good, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, when they become disposition and not calculation, are for like reasons, added to the constituents of conscience (p. 424).\n\n(4.) Thus the view of the nature of conscience here presented, explains how it is that the private desires and the social affections alike <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> under the authority of the moral faculty. The explanation of this community of rule in sentiments of so widely different nature, Mackintosh considers a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of the justice of his opinion (p. 425).\n\nWithout pronouncing a judgment on the truth of this theory, I hope I have faithfully represented the author's meaning. But he draws from the theory certain inferences, of which I may say a few words.\n\nV. Mackintosh, as we have seen, maintains that though the moral faculty is formed or educed by intercourse with the external world, it is a law of our nature; yet he allows that what this law prescribes, agrees with the rule, rightly understood, of bringing forth the greatest happiness. He was, therefore, naturally called upon to account for this coincidence. If moral approval be\na different sentiment from the estimation of general happiness, why does the moral sense of man invariably approve that which increases the happiness of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>? If this theory account for this phenomenon, such a circumstance will, he conceives, be a strong argument in its favour.\n\n(1.) He replies to this inquiry (p. 426), that all the separate objects which conscience approves, the social affections, the decisions of justice, the maxims of enlightened prudence, tend to the happiness of some part of the species, and and that thus the general rules of conscience must agree with the rules of the general happiness. All the acts which the moral faculty sanctions promote the welfare of some part of mankind, and all that reason has to do is to add up the items of the account. All the principles of which conscience is composed, converge towards the happiness of man; and therefore this may be taken as its central point. And thus the coincidence just noticed is not accidental, but is a necessary consequence of the theory.\n\n(2.) I will add, as a corollary to what Mackintosh has said, that a system of ethics, rightly constructed on the principle of promoting, in the greatest degree, the happiness of mankind, will coincide, in most of its rules of action, with a system founded on the supreme authority of conscience; but that, in order to apply safely and well the eudemonist principle, we must recollect that happiness consists rather in habits of the mind than in outward gratifications; and is to be sought rather by forming moral dispositions than by prescribing acts. In Paley's \"Moral Philosophy,\" we have a work framed on the eudemonist basis, which has for some time possessed considerable authority in this country, and has probably in no small degree influenced men's reasonings on such subjects in recent times. Without examining here how far Paley has always applied his principle under due conditions, and traced his consequences with a sufficiently enlarged survey, we may observe that there prevails through the work a tone of practical sagacity, good sense, and good feeling, which neutralizes most of its theoretical defects.\n\nVI. Some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARINGS\">bearings</a> of Mackintosh's theory may be noticed, and especially the view it offers of the relation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and morality. This agrees nearly with the doctrine of Butler, and many English divines, that conscience is one of the ways in which the commands of God are conveyed to us (p. 427). \"The completeness and rigour acquired by conscience when all its dictates are revered as the commands of a perfectly good and wise Being, are so obvious, that they cannot be questioned by any reasonable man, however wide his incredulity may be. It is thus that conscience can add the warmth of an affection to the inflexibility of principle and habit.\" Not only are we bound to accept all the precepts for the moral government of the will, disclosed either by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVELATION\">Revelation</a> or by reason, as undeniable rules for our feelings and actions; but the relations between man and his Maker, which religion teaches us, tend to make this a work of love, no less than of duty; and bestow on that improvement of our inward nature to which conscience is constantly urging us, an aspect of hope and joy, which human morality, without such aid, can hardly assume, and seldom long retain.\n\nVII. I will only refer to one other consequence of this theory of conscience of Mackintosh;\u2014the view it appears to him to supply of the celebrated question of Free-will (p. 430). Since conscience contemplates those dispositions only which depend on the will, it excludes all consideration of the cause in which the will originated: hence the voluntary dispositions appear as the first link of the chain; and, in the eye of conscience, will is the independent cause of action. Reason, on the other hand, must consider occurrences as bound together by the connection of cause and effect, and thus sees only the strength of the necessitarian system. Thus, while speculation appears to show that our actions are necessary, practice convinces us that they are free. The advocates of necessity and of free-will look at the question from different points of view,\u2014that of the understanding and that of the conscience. But the conscientious view being strengthened by the moral sympathy of mankind, is by far the most generally and strongly entertained.\n\nI shall here close my remarks on the Dissertation which the following pages contain. The theo-\nretical view of the nature, formation, and operation of our moral sentiments, which is given by the author, must be left to the consideration of those who pursue such speculations in a philosophical spirit and temper. His historical sketch of the progress of the subject has in it much to please and instruct, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> and improve the ethical student. There will be found several instances in which the phraseology is defective in clearness and simplicity; and in this, as in any work, if we pay no attention to the writer's aim, if we insist upon confounding what he has distinguished, and upon interpreting his language by an analysis which he did not acknowledge, we shall not obtain his sense, or any sense. But the reader who candidly seeks for the author's meaning will, I think, not fail to find it: and I am persuaded that most readers will derive pleasure from the comprehensive views, the tolerant temper, and the love of virtuous feeling and literary beauty which they will find pervading the work. His unfavourable judgments, in those cases in which he expresses such, are less severe than those of other philosophers, both in our own and in other countries, who look at the progress of moral philosophy from a like point of view; and he always appears to rejoice to give credit to any writers in whom he discovers the early gleams of those doctrines which he held to be important truths.\n\nIn the conclusion of his survey, he speaks of the spirit of speculation on this subject, as all but extinct in this country. I would willingly believe that this is too desponding a view of the fortunes of moral philosophy among us;\u2014that the youth of England are far from indifferent to the questions which concern the nature and laws of man's highest faculties, and which excite a vigorous and generous love of speculation in other parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. To such a result I look forward the more gladly, because I do not doubt that the reigning philosophy of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, even when it excites little direct attention, influences powerfully men's convictions and habits of thought; and I am persuaded that we cannot make the prevalent views of morals sounder, purer, and more philosophical, without improving the general intellectual and moral character of the educated classes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>.\n\nW. W.\nDissertation Second.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThe inadequacy of the words of ordinary language for the purposes of Philosophy, is an ancient and frequent complaint; of which the justness will be felt by all who consider the state to which some of the most important arts would be reduced, if the coarse tools of the common labourer were the only instruments to be employed in the most delicate operations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> expertness. The watchmaker, the optician, and the surgeon, are provided with instruments which are fitted, by careful ingenuity, to second their skill; the philosopher alone is doomed to use the rudest tools for the most refined purposes. He must reason in words of which the looseness and vagueness are suitable, and even agreeable, in the usual intercourse of life, but which are almost as remote from the extreme exactness and precision required, not only in the conveyance, but in the search of truth, as the hammer and the axe would be unfit for the finest exertions of skilful handiwork; for it is not to be forgotten, that he must himself think in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> words as unavoidably as he uses them in speaking to others. He is in this respect in a worse condition than an astronomer who looked at the heavens only with the naked eye, whose limited and partial observation, however it might lead to error, might not directly, and would not necessarily deceive. He might be more justly compared to an arithmetician compelled to employ numerals not only cumbrous, but used so irregularly to denote different quantities, that they not only often deceived others, but himself.\n\nThe Natural Philosopher and Mathematician have in some degree the privilege of framing their own terms of art; though that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> is daily narrowed by the happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of these great branches of knowledge, which daily mixes their language with the general vocabulary of educated men. The cultivator of Mental and Moral Philosophy can seldom do more than mend the faults of his words by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a>; a necessary but very inadequate expedient, in a great measure defeated in practice by the unavoidably more frequent recurrence of the terms in their vague than in their definite acceptation; in consequence of which the mind, to which the\ndefinition is faintly and but occasionally present, naturally suffers, in the ordinary state of attention, the scientific meaning to disappear from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a>, and insensibly ascribes to the word a great part, if not the whole, of that popular sense which is so very much more familiar even to the most veteran speculator. The obstacles which stood in the way of Lucretius and Cicero, when they began to translate the sublime philosophy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> into their narrow and barren tongue, are always felt by the philosopher when he struggles to express, with the necessary discrimination, his abstruse reasonings in words which, though those of his own language, he must take from the mouths of those to whom his distinctions would be without meaning.\n\nThe Moral Philosopher is in this respect subject to peculiar difficulties. His statements and reasonings often call for nicer discriminations of language than those which are necessary in describing or discussing the purely intellectual part of human nature; but his freedom in the choice of words is more circumscribed. As he treats of matters on which all men are disposed to form a judgment, he can as rarely hazard glaring innovations in diction, at least in an adult and mature language like ours, as the orator or the poet. If he deviates from common use, he must atone for his deviation by hiding it, and can only give a new sense to an old word by so skilful a position of it as to render the new meaning so quickly understood that its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> is scarcely perceived. Add to this, that in those most difficult inquiries for which the utmost coolness is not more than sufficient, he is often forced to use terms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> connected with warm feeling, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> praise, with severe reproach; which excite the passions of his readers when he most needs their calm attention and the undisturbed exercise of their impartial judgment. There is scarcely a neutral term left in Ethics; so quickly are such expressions enlisted on the side of Praise or Blame, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> of contending passions. A true philosopher must not even desire that men should less love virtue or hate vice, in order to fit them for a more unprejudiced judgment on his speculations.\n\nThere are perhaps not many occasions where the penury and laxity of language are more felt than in entering on the history of sciences where the first measure must be to mark out the boundary of the whole subject with some distinctness. But no exactness in these important operations can be approached without a new division of human knowledge, adapted to the present stage of its progress, and a reformation of all those barbarous, pedantic, unmeaning, and (what is worse) wrong-meaning names which continue to be applied to the greater part of its branches. Instances are needless where nearly all the appellations are faulty. The term <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">Metaphysics</a> affords a specimen of all the faults which the name of a science can combine. To those who know only their own language, it must, at their entrance on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, convey no meaning. It points their attention to nothing. If they examine the language in which its parts are significant, they will be misled into the pernicious error of believing that it seeks something more than the interpretation of nature. It is only by examining the history of ancient Philosophy that the probable origin of this name will be found, in the application of it, as the running title of several essays of Aristotle, which were placed in a collection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> of that great philosopher, after his treatise on Physics. It has the greater fault of an unsteady and fluctuating signification; denoting one class of objects in the seventeenth century, and another in the eighteenth\u2014even in the nineteenth not quite of the same import in the mouth of a German, as in that of a French or English philosopher; to say nothing of the farther objection that it continues to be a badge of undue pretension among some of the followers of the science, while it has become a name of reproach and derision among those who altogether decry it.\n\nThe modern name of the very modern science called Political Economy, though deliberately bestowed on it by its most eminent teachers, is perhaps a still more notable sample of the like faults. It might lead the ignorant to confine it to retrenchment in national expenditure; and a consideration of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a> alone would lead into the more mischievous error of believing it to teach, that national wealth is best promoted by\nthe contrivance and interference of lawgivers, in opposition to its surest doctrine, which it most justly boasts of having discovered and enforced.\n\nIt is easy to conceive an exhaustive analysis of Human Knowledge, and a consequent division of it into parts corresponding to all the classes of objects to which it relates\u2014a representation of that vast edifice, containing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of what is finished, a sketch of what is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, and even a conjectural outline of what, though required by completeness and convenience, as well as symmetry, is yet altogether untouched. A system of names might also be imagined derived from a few roots, indicating the objects of each part, and showing the relation of the parts to each other. An order and a language somewhat resembling those by which the objects of the sciences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a> have, in the eighteenth century, been arranged and denoted, are doubtless capable of application to the sciences generally, when considered as parts of the system of knowledge. The attempts, however, which have hitherto been made to accomplish the analytical division of knowledge which must necessarily precede a new nomenclature of the sciences, have required so prodigious a superiority of genius in the single instance of approach to success by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, as to discourage rivalry nearly as much as the frequent examples of failure in subsequent times. The nomenclature itself is attended with great difficulties, not indeed in its conception, but in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> and usefulness. In the Continental languages to the south of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>, the practice of deriving the names of science from Greek must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>; which would render the new names for a while unintelligible to the majority of men. Even in Germany, where a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> and fertile language affords unbounded liberty of derivation and composition from native roots or elements, and where the newly derived and compounded words would thus be as clear to the mind, and almost as little startling to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> of every man, as the oldest terms in the language, yet the whole nomenclature would be unintelligible to other nations. The intercommunity of the technical terms of science in Europe has been so far broken down by the Germans, and the influence of their literature and philosophy is so rapidly increasing in the greater part of the Continent, that though a revolution in scientific nomenclature be probably yet far distant, the foundation of it may be considered as already prepared.\n\nBut although so great an undertaking must be reserved for a second Bacon and a future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>, it is necessary for the historian of any branch of knowledge to introduce his work by some account of the limits and contents of the sciences of which he is about to trace the progress; and though it will be found impossible to trace throughout the treatise a distinct line of demarcation, yet a general and imperfect sketch of the boundaries of the whole, and of the parts of our present subject, may be a considerable help to the reader, as it has been a useful guide to the writer.\n\nThere is no distribution of the parts of knowledge more ancient than that of the Physical and Moral Sciences, which seems liable to no other objection, than that it does not exhaust the subject. Even this division, however, cannot be safely employed, without warning the reader, that no science is entirely insulated, and that the principles of one are often only the conclusions and results of another. Every branch of knowledge has its root in the theory of the Understanding, from which even the mathematician must learn what can be known of his magnitude and his numbers; and Moral Science is founded on that other hitherto unnamed part of the philosophy of human nature (to be constantly and vigilantly distinguished from Intellectual Philosophy), which contemplates the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a>, of desire and aversion, of pleasure and pain, of happiness and misery; and on which arise the august and sacred landmarks that stand conspicuous along the frontier between Right and Wrong.\n\nBut however multiplied the connections of the Moral and Physical Sciences are, it is not difficult to draw a general distinction between them. The purpose of the Physical Sciences throughout all their provinces, is to answer the question What is? They consist only of facts arranged according to their likeness, and expressed by general names given to every class\nof similar facts. The purpose of the Moral Sciences is to answer the question *What ought to be?* They aim at ascertaining the rules which *ought* to govern voluntary action, and to which those habitual dispositions of mind which are the source of voluntary actions *ought* to be adapted.\n\nIt is obvious that *Will*, *Action*, *Habit*, *Disposition*, are terms denoting facts in human nature, and that an explanation of them must be sought in Mental Philosophy; which, if knowledge be divided into Physical and Moral, must be placed among physical sciences; though it essentially differs from them all in having for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> object those laws of thought which alone render any other sort of knowledge possible. But it is equally certain that the word *Ought* introduces the mind into a new region, to which nothing physical corresponds. However philosophers may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> with this most important of words, it is instantly understood by all who do not attempt to define it. No civilized speech, perhaps no human language, is without correspondent terms. It would be as reasonable to deny that *Space* and *Greenness* are significant words, as to affirm that *Ought*, *Right*, *Duty*, *Virtue*, are sounds without meaning. It would be fatal to an Ethical Theory that it did not explain them, and that it did not comprehend all the conceptions and emotions which they call up. There never yet was a theory which did not attempt such an explanation.\n\n---\n\n**SECTION I.**\n\n*<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">Preliminary</a> Observations.*\n\nThere is no man who, in a case where he was a calm by-stander, would not look with more satisfaction on acts of kindness than on acts of cruelty. No man, after the first excitement of his mind has subsided, ever whispered to himself with self-approbation and secret joy that he had been guilty of cruelty or baseness. Every criminal is strongly impelled to hide these qualities of his actions from himself, as he would do from others, by clothing his conduct in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> of duty or of necessity. There is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> so rude as to be without a faint perception of a difference between right and wrong. There is no subject on which men of all ages and nations coincide in so many points as in the general rules of conduct, and in the qualities of the human character which deserve esteem. Even the grossest deviations from the general consent will appear, on close <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, to be not so much corruptions of moral feeling, as either ignorance of facts; or errors with respect to the consequences of action; or cases in which the dissentient party is inconsistent with other parts of his own principles, which destroys the value of his dissent; or where each dissident is condemned by all the other dissidents, which immeasurably augments the majority against him. In the first three cases he may be convinced by argument, that his moral judgment should be changed on principles which he recognises as just; and he can seldom, if ever, be condemned at the same time by the body of mankind who agree in their moral systems, and by those who on some other points dissent from that general code, without being also convicted of error by inconsistency with himself. The tribes who expose new-born <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a>, condemn those who abandon their decrepit parents to destruction. Those who betray and murder strangers, are condemned by the rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> which they acknowledge in their intercourse with their countrymen. Mr Hume, in a dialogue in which he ingeniously magnifies the moral heresies of two nations so polished as the Athenians and the French, has very satisfactorily resolved his own difficulties. \"In how many circumstances would an Athenian and a Frenchman of merit certainly resemble each other?\"\u2014Human-\nity, fidelity, truth, justice, courage, temperance, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a>, dignity of mind. The principles upon which men reason in morals are always the same, though their conclusions are often very different.\" He might have added, that almost every deviation which he imputes to each nation is at variance with some of the virtues justly esteemed by both; and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> condemnation of each other's errors which appears in his statement entitles us on these points to strike out the suffrages of both, when collecting the general judgment of mankind. If we bear in mind that the question relates to the coincidence of all men in considering the same qualities as virtues, and not to the preference of one class of virtues by some, and of a different class by others, the exceptions from the agreement of mankind, in their system of practical morality, will be reduced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> insignificance; and we shall learn to view them as no more affecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> of our moral faculties, than the resemblance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> and features is affected by monstrous conformations, or by the unfortunate effects of accident and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> in a very few individuals.\n\nIt is very remarkable, however, that though all men agree that there are acts which ought to be done, and acts which ought not to be done; though the far greater part of mankind agree in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of virtues and duties, of vices and crimes; and though the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, as it advances in other improvements, is as evidently tending towards the moral system of the most civilized nations, as children in their growth tend to the opinions as much as to the experience and strength of adults; yet there are no questions in the circle of inquiry to which answers more various have been given than\u2014How men have thus come to agree in the rule of life; Whence arises their general reverence for it; and What is meant by affirming that it ought to be inviolably observed? It is singular, that where we are most nearly agreed respecting rules, we should perhaps most differ as to the causes of our agreement, and as to the reasons which justify us for adhering to it. The discussion of these subjects composes what is usually called the Theory of Morals, in a sense not in all respects coincident with what is usually considered as Theory in other sciences. When we investigate the causes of our moral agreement, the term Theory retains its ordinary scientific sense; but when we endeavour to ascertain the reasons of it, we rather employ the term as importing the theory of the rules of an art. In the first case, Theory denotes, as usual, the most general laws to which certain facts can be reduced; whereas in the second, it points out the efficacy of the observance, in practice, of certain rules, for producing the effects intended to be produced in the art. These reasons also may be reduced under the general sense by stating the question relating to them thus:\u2014What are the causes why the observance of certain rules enables us to execute certain purposes? An account of the various answers attempted to be made to these inquiries, properly forms the History of Ethics.\n\nThe attentive reader may already perceive, that these momentous inquiries relate to at least two perfectly distinct subjects: 1. The nature of the distinction between right and wrong in human conduct, and 2. The nature of those feelings with which right and wrong are contemplated by human beings. The latter constitutes what has been called the Theory of Moral Sentiments; the former consists in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> into the Criterion of Morality in action. Other most important questions arise in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>. But the two problems which have been just stated, and the essential distinction between them, must be clearly apprehended.\n\n---\n\n*Philosophical Works*, vol. IV. p. 420, 422. Edinb. 1826.\n\n\" On convient le plus souvent de ces instincts de la conscience. La plus grande et la plus saine partie du genre humain leur rend t\u00e9moignage.

Anst. et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEIPZIG\">Leipzig</a>. 1765, 4to.)\n\nThere are some admirable observations on this subject in Hartley, especially in the development of the 49th Proposition. \"The rule of life drawn from the practice and opinions of mankind corrects and improves itself perpetually, till at last it determines entirely for virtue, and excludes all kinds and degrees of vice.\" (Observations on Man, I. 207.)\nby all who are desirous of understanding the controversies which have prevailed on ethical subjects. The discrimination has seldom been made by Moral Philosophers; the difference between the two problems has never been uniformly observed by any of them: and it will appear, in the sequel, that they have been not rarely altogether confounded by very eminent men, to the destruction of all just conception and of all correct reasoning in this most important, and perhaps most difficult of sciences.\n\nIt may therefore be allowable to deviate so far from historical order, as to illustrate the nature and to prove the importance of the distinction, by an example of the effects of neglecting it, taken from the recent works of justly celebrated writers; in which they discuss questions much agitated in the present age, and therefore probably now familiar to most readers of this Dissertation.\n\nDr Paley represents the principle of a moral sense as being opposed to that of utility. Now, it is evident that this representation is founded on a confusion of the two questions which have been stated above. That we are endowed with a moral sense, or, in other words, a faculty which immediately approves what is right and condemns what is wrong, is only a statement of the feelings with which we contemplate actions. But to affirm that right actions are those which conduce to the wellbeing of mankind, is a proposition concerning the outward effects by which right actions themselves may be recognised. As these affirmations relate to different subjects, they cannot be opposed to each other, any more than the solidity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> is inconsistent with the fluidity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; and a very little reflection will show it to be easily conceivable that they may be both true. Man may be so constituted as instantaneously to approve certain actions without any reference to their consequences; and yet reason may nevertheless discover, that a tendency to produce general happiness is the essential characteristic of such actions. Mr Bentham also contrasts the principle of utility with that of sympathy, of which he considers the moral sense as being one of the forms. It is needless to repeat, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> which affirm or deny anything of different subjects, cannot contradict each other. As these celebrated persons have thus inferred or implied the non-existence of a moral sense, from their opinion that the morality of actions depends upon their usefulness, so other philosophers of equal name have concluded, that the utility of actions cannot be the criterion of their morality, because a perception of that utility appears to them to form a faint and inconsiderable part of our moral sentiments, if indeed it be at all discoverable in them. These errors are the more remarkable, because the like confusion of perceptions with their objects, of emotions with their causes, or even the omission to mark the distinctions, would, in every other subject, be felt to be a most serious fault in philosophizing. If, for instance, an element were discovered to be common to all bodies which our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> perceives to be sweet, and to be found in no other bodies, it is apparent that this discovery, perhaps important in other respects, would neither affect our perception of sweetness, nor the pleasure which attends it. Both would continue to be what they have been since the existence of mankind. Every proposition concerning that element would relate to sweet bodies, and belong to the science of Chemistry; while every proposition respecting the perception or pleasure of sweetness would relate either to the body or mind of man, and accordingly belong either to the science of Physiology, or to that of Mental Philosophy. During the many ages which passed before the analysis of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>'s beams had proved them to be compounded of different colours, white objects were seen, and their whiteness was sometimes felt to be beautiful, in the very same manner as since that discovery. The qualities of light are the object of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a>; the nature of beauty can be as-\n\n---\n\n1 Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy. Compare book i. chap. v. with book ii. chap. vi.\n2 Introduction to the Principles of Morality and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">Legislation</a>, chap. ii.\n3 Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments, Part iv. Even Hume, in the third book of his Treatise of Human Nature, the most precise, perhaps, of his philosophical writings, uses the following as the title of one of the sections: \"Moral Distinctions derived from a Moral State.\"\ncertained only by each man's observation of his own mind; the changes in the living frame which succeed the refraction of light in the eye, and precede mental operation, will, if they are ever to be known by man, constitute a part of Physiology. But no proposition relating to one of these orders of phenomena can contradict or support a proposition concerning another order.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> of this latter case will justify another preliminary observation. In the case of the pleasure derived from beauty, the question whether that pleasure be original or derived is of secondary importance. It has been often observed that the same properties which are admired as beautiful in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, contribute also to his safety and speed; and they who infer that the admiration of beauty was originally founded on the convenience of fleetness and firmness, if they at the same time hold that the usefulness is gradually effaced, and that the admiration of a certain shape at length rises instantaneously without reference to any purpose, may, with perfect consistency, regard a sense of beauty as an independent and universal principle of human nature. The laws of such a feeling of beauty are discoverable only by self-observation. Those of the qualities which call it forth are ascertained by examination of the outward things which are called beautiful. But it is of the utmost importance to bear in mind, that he who contemplates the beautiful proportions of a horse, as the signs and proofs of security or quickness, and has in view these convenient qualities, is properly said to prefer the horse for his usefulness, not for his beauty; though he may choose him from the same outward appearance which pleases the admirer of the beautiful animal. He alone who derives immediate pleasure from the appearance itself, without reflection on any advantages which it may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, is truly said to feel the beauty. The distinction, however, manifestly depends, not on the origin of the emotion, but on its object and nature when completely formed. Many of our most important perceptions through the eye are universally acknowledged to be acquired. But they are as general as the original perceptions of that organ; they arise as independently of our will, and human nature would be quite as imperfect without them. An adult who did not immediately see the different distances of objects from his eye, would be thought by every one to be as great a deviation from the ordinary state of man as if he were incapable of distinguishing the brightest sunshine from the darkest midnight. Acquired perceptions and sentiments may therefore be termed natural, as much as those which are more commonly so called, if they be as rarely found wanting. Ethical theories can never be satisfactorily discussed by those who do not constantly bear in mind, that the question concerning the existence of a moral faculty in man which immediately approves or disapproves without reference to any further object, is perfectly distinct, on the one hand, from that which inquires into the qualities thus approved or disapproved; and on the other, from an inquiry whether that faculty be derived from other parts of our mental frame, or be itself one of the ultimate constituent principles of human nature.","sp":299,"ep":323},{"h":"MATHEMATICS","t":"1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GEOMETRY\">GEOMETRY</a>.\n\nThe great inheritance of mathematical knowledge which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> bequeathed to posterity could not, on the revival of learning, be immediately taken possession of, nor could even its existence be discovered, but by degrees. Though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the Mathematics had never been entirely abandoned, it had been reduced to matters of very simple and easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a>, such as were merely subservient to practice. There had been men who could compute the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>, draw a meridian line, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> even construct a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a>, in the worst of times; but between such skill, and the capacity to understand or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> to relish the demonstrations of Euclid, Apollonius, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, there was a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, and many difficulties were to be overcome, for which much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and much subsidiary knowledge, were necessary. The repositories of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> treasures were to be opened, and made accessible; the knowledge of the languages was to be acquired; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> were to be deciphered; and the skill of the grammarian and the critic were to precede, in a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that of the geometrician or the astronomer. The obligations which we have to those who undertook this laborious and irksome task, and who rescued the ancient books from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISONS\">prisons</a> to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and barbarism had condemned them, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> destruction by which they must soon have been overtaken, are such as we can never sufficiently acknowledge; and indeed we shall never know even the names of many of the benefactors to whom our thanks are due. In the midst of the wars, the confusion, and bloodshed, which overwhelmed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> during the middle ages, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> houses and monasteries afforded to the remains of ancient learning an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a>, which a salutary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> forced even the most lawless to respect; and the authors who have given the best account of the revival of letters, agree that it is in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> to those establishments\nthat we owe the safety of the books which have kept alive the scientific and literary attainments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome.\n\nThe study of the remains of antiquity gradually produced men of taste and intelligence, who were able to correct the faults of the manuscripts they copied, and to explain the difficulties of the authors they translated. Such were Purbach, Regiomontanus, Commandine, Maurolycus, and many others. By their means, the writings of Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, and Pappus, became known and accessible to men of science. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a> contributed its share towards this great renovation, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> was derived the knowledge of many Greek books, of the originals of which, some were not found till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> afterwards, and others have never yet been discovered.\n\nIn nothing, perhaps, is the inventive and elegant genius of the Greeks better exemplified than in their geometry. The elementary truths of that science were connected by Euclid into one great chain, beginning from the axioms, and extending to the properties of the five regular solids; the whole digested into such admirable order, and explained with such clearness and precision, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of superior excellence has appeared, even in the present advanced state of mathematical science.\n\nArchimedes had assailed the more difficult problems of geometry, and, by means of the method of Exhaustions, had demonstrated many curious and important theorems with regard to the lengths and areas of curves and the contents of solids. The same great geometer had given a beginning to physico-mathematical science, by investigating several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, and resolving several problems in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">Hydrostatics</a>.\n\nApollonius had treated of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONIC_SECTIONS\">Conic Sections</a>,\u2014the curves which, after the circle, are the most simple and important in geometry; and, by his elaborate and profound researches, had laid the foundation of discoveries which were to illustrate very distant ages.\n\nAnother great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, the Geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">Analysis</a>, ascribed very generally to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLATONIC\">Platonic</a> school, but most successfully cultivated by the geometer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> named, is one of the most ingenious and beautiful contrivances in the Mathematics. It is a method of discovering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> by reasoning concerning things unknown, or propositions merely supposed, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the one were given, or the other were really true. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> that is unknown, is only to be found from the relations which it bears to quantities that are known. By reasoning on these relations, we come at last to some one so simple, that the thing sought is thereby determined. By this analytical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, therefore, the thing required is discovered, and we are at the same time put in possession of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> by which new truths may be found out, and which, when skill in using it has been acquired by practice, may be applied to an unlimited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>.\n\nA similar process enables us to discover the demonstrations of propositions, supposed to be true, or, if not true, to discover that they are false.\n\nThis method, to the consideration of which we shall again have an opportunity of returning, was perhaps the most valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the ancient Mathematics, inasmuch as a method of discovering truth is more valuable than the truths it has already discovered. Unfortunately, however, the fragments containing this precious remnant had suffered more from the injuries of time than almost any other.\n\nIn the fifteenth century, Regiomontanus, already mentioned, is the mathematician who holds the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>. To him we owe many translations and commentaries, together with several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> and valuable works of his own. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">Trigonometry</a>, which had never been known to the Greeks as a separate science, and which took that form in Arabia, advanced, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of Regiomontanus, to a great degree of perfection, and approached very near to the condition which it has attained at the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. He also introduced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of decimal fractions into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a>, and thereby gave to that scale its full extent, and to numerical computation the utmost degree of simplicity and enlargement which it seems capable of attaining.\n\nThis eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was cut off in the prime of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and his untimely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, says Mr Smith, amidst innumerable projects for the advance-\nment of science, is even at this day a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of regret. He was buried in the Pantheon at Rome; and the honours paid to him at his death prove that science had now become a distinction which the great were disposed to recognise.\n\nWerner, who lived in the end of this century, is the first among the moderns who appears to have been acquainted with the geometrical analysis. His writings are very rare, and I have never had an opportunity of examining them. What I here assert is on the authority of Montucla, whose judgment in this matter may be safely relied on, as he has shown, by many instances, that he was well acquainted with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the analysis referred to. It is not a little remarkable that Werner should have understood this subject, when we find many eminent mathematicians, long after his time, entirely unacquainted with it, and continually expressing their astonishment how the ancient geometers found out those simple and elegant constructions and demonstrations, of which they have given so many examples. In the days of Werner there was no ancient book known, except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">Data</a> of Euclid, from which any information concerning the geometrical analysis could be collected; and it is highly to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, that, without any other help, he should have come to the knowledge of a method not a little recondite in its principles, and among the finest inventions either of ancient or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> science. Werner resolved, by means of it, Archimedes's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> a sphere into two segments, having a given ratio to one another. He proposed also to translate, from the Arabic, the work of Apollonius, entitled Sectio Rationis, rightly judging it to be an elementary work in that analysis, and to come next after the Data of Euclid.\n\nBenedetto, an Italian mathematician, appears also to have been very early acquainted with the principles of the same ingenious method, as he published a book on the geometrical analysis at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TURIN\">Turin</a> in 1585.\n\nMaurolycus of Messina flourished in the middle of the sixteenth century, and is justly regarded as the first geometer of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. Beside furnishing many valuable translations and commentaries, he wrote a treatise on the Conic Sections, which is highly esteemed. He endeavoured also to restore the fifth book of the Conics of Apollonius, in which that geometer treated of the maxima and minima of the conic sections. His writings all indicate a man of clear conceptions, and of a strong understanding; though he is taxed with having dealt in astrological prediction.\n\nIn the early part of the seventeenth century, Cavallieri was particularly distinguished, and made an advance in the higher geometry, which occupies the middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> between the discoveries of Archimedes and those of Newton.\n\nFor the purpose of determining the lengths and areas of curves, and the contents of solids contained within curve superficies, the ancients had invented a method, to which the name of Exhaustions has been given; and in nothing, perhaps, have they more displayed their powers of mathematical invention.\n\nWhenever it is required to measure the space bounded by curve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, the length of a curve, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> contained within a curve superficies, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> within the range of elementary geometry. Rectilineal figures are compared, on the principle of superposition, by help of the notion of equality which is derived from the coincidence of magnitudes both similar and equal. Two rectangles of equal bases and equal altitudes are held to be equal, because they can perfectly coincide. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> and an oblique angled parallelogram, having equal bases and altitudes, are shown to be equal, because the same triangle, taken from the rectangle on one side, and added to it on the other, converts it into the parallelogram; and thus two magnitudes which are not similar, are shown to have equal areas. In like manner, if a triangle and a parallelogram have the same base and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a>, the triangle is shown to be half the parallelogram; because, if to the triangle there be added another, similar and equal to itself, but in the reverse position, the two together <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> compose\n\n---\n\n1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>, p. 90. Regiomontanus was born in 1436, and died in 1476.\n2 See Montucla, Histoire des Math\u00e9maticiens, vol. I. p. 381.\na parallelogram, having the same base and altitude with the given triangle. The same is true of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of all other rectilineal figures; and if the reasoning be carefully analyzed, it will always be found to be reducible to the primitive and original idea of equality, derived from things that coincide or occupy the same space; that is to say, the areas which are proved equal are always such as, by the addition or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUBTRACTION\">subtraction</a> of equal and similar parts, may be rendered capable of coinciding with one another.\n\nThis principle, which is quite general with respect to rectilineal figures, must fail, when we would compare curvilineal and rectilineal spaces with one another, and make the latter serve as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of the former; because no addition or subtraction of rectilineal figures can ever produce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> which is curvilineal. It is possible, indeed, to combine curvilineal figures, so as to produce one that is rectilineal; but this principle is of very limited extent; it led to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUADRATURE\">quadrature</a> of the *lunule* of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a>, but has hardly furnished any other result which can be considered as valuable in science.\n\nIn the difficulty to which geometers were thus reduced, it might occur, that by inscribing a rectilineal figure within a curve, and circumscribing another round it, two limits could be obtained, one greater and the other less than the area required. It was also evident, that by increasing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and diminishing the sides of those figures, the two limits might be brought continually nearer to one another, and of course nearer to the curvilineal area, which was always intermediate between them. In prosecuting this sort of approximation, a result was at length found out, which must have occasioned no less surprise than delight to the mathematician who first encountered it. The result I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> is, that, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> figures was continually increased, by multiplying the number of the sides, and diminishing their size, there was an assignable *rectilineal* area, to which they continually approached, so as to come nearer it than any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> that could be supposed. The same limit would also be observed to belong to the circumscribed figures, and therefore it could be no other than the curvilineal area required.\n\nIt appears to have been to Archimedes that a truth of this sort first occurred, when he found that two-thirds of the rectangle, under the ordinate and abscissa of a parabola, was a limit always greater than the inscribed rectilineal figure, and less than the circumscribed. In some other curves, a similar conclusion was found; and Archimedes contrived to show that it was impossible to suppose that the area of the curve could differ from the said limit, without admitting that the circumscribed figure might become less, or the inscribed figure greater than the curve itself. The method of Exhaustions was the name given to the indirect demonstrations thus formed. Though few things more ingenious than this method have been devised, and though nothing could be more conclusive than the demonstrations resulting from it, yet it laboured under two very considerable defects. In the first place, the process by which the demonstration was obtained was long and difficult; and, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> place, it was indirect, giving no insight into the principle on which the investigation was founded. Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, it did not enable one to find out similar demonstrations, nor increase one's power of making more discoveries of the same kind. It was a demonstration purely synthetical, and required, as all indirect reasoning must do, that the conclusion should be known before the reasoning is begun. A more compendious, and a more analytical method, was therefore much to be wished for, and was an improvement which, at a moment when the field of mathematical science was enlarging so fast, seemed particularly to be required.\n\nCavallieri, born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a> in the year 1598, is the person by whom this great improvement was made. The principle on which he proceeded was, that areas may be considered as made up of an infinite number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> lines; solids of an infinite number of parallel planes; and even lines themselves, whether curve or straight, of an infinite number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. The cubature of a solid being thus reduced to the summation of a series of planes, and the quadrature of a curve to the summation of a series of ordinates, each of the investigations was reduced to something more simple. It added to this simplicity not a little, that the sums of se-\nries are often more easily found when the number of terms is infinitely great, than when it is finite, and actually assigned.\n\nIt appears that a tract on Stereometry, written by Kepler, whose name will hereafter be often mentioned, first led Cavalleri to take this view of geometrical magnitudes. In that tract, which was published in 1615, the measurement of many solids was proposed, which had not before fallen under the consideration of mathematicians. Such, for example, was that of the solids <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the revolution of a curve, not about its axis, but about any line whatsoever. Solids of that kind, on account of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> with the figure of casks, and vessels actually employed for containing liquids, appeared to Kepler to offer both curious and useful subjects of investigation. There were no less than eighty-four such solids, which he proposed for the consideration of mathematicians. He was, however, himself unequal to the task of resolving any but a small number of the simplest of these problems. In these solutions, he was bold enough to introduce into geometry, for the first time, the idea of infinitely great and infinitely small quantities; and by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> departure from the rigour of the science, he rendered it in fact a most essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. Kepler conceived a circle to be composed of an infinite number of triangles, having their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> in the centre of the circle, and their infinitely small bases in the circumference. It is to be remarked, that Galileo had also introduced the notion of infinitely small quantities, in his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> De Mechanica, where he treats of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> cut out of a hemisphere; and he has done the same in treating of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> of falling bodies. Cavalleri was the friend and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Galileo, but much more profound in the Mathematics. In his hands the idea took a more regular and systematic form, and was explained in his work on Indivisibles, published in 1635.\n\nThe rule for summing an infinite series of terms in arithmetical progression had been long known, and the application of it to find the area of a triangle, according to the method of indivisibles, was a matter of no difficulty. The next step was, supposing a series of lines in arithmetical progression, and squares to be described on each of them, to find what ratio the sum of all these squares bears to the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, taken as often as there are terms in the progression. Cavalleri showed, that when the number of terms is infinitely great, the first of these sums is just one-third of the second. This evidently led to the cubature of many solids.\n\nProceeding one step farther, he sought for the sum of the cubes of the same lines, and found it to be one-fourth of the greatest, taken as often as there are terms; and, continuing this investigation, he was able to assign the sum of the \\(n\\)th powers of a series in arithmetical progression, supposing always the difference of the terms to be infinitely small, and their number to be infinitely great. The number of curious results obtained from these investigations may be easily conceived. It gave, over geometrical problems of the higher class, the same power which the integral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a>, or the inverse method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLUXIONS\">fluxions</a> does, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> when the exponent of the variable quantity is an integer. The method of indivisibles, however, was not without difficulties, and could not but be liable to objection, with those accustomed to the rigorous exactness of the ancient geometry. In strictness, lines, however multiplied, can never make an area, or any thing but a line; nor can areas, however they may be added together, compose a solid, or any thing but an area. This is certainly true, and yet the conclusions of Cavalleri, deduced on a contrary supposition, are true also. This happened, because, though the suppositions that a certain series of lines, infinite in number, and contiguous to one another, may compose a certain area, and that another series may compose another area, are neither of them true; yet is it strictly true, that the one of these areas must have to the other the same ratio which the sum of the one series of lines has to the sum of the other series. Thus, it is the ratios of the areas, and not the areas absolutely considered, which are determined by the reasonings of Cavalleri; and that this determination of their ratios is quite accurate, can very readily be demonstrated by the method of exhaustions.\n\nThe method of indivisibles, from the great\nfacility with which it could be managed, furnished a most ready method of ascertaining the ratios of areas and solids to one another, and, therefore, scarcely seems to deserve the epithet which Newton himself bestows upon it, of involving in its conceptions something harsh, (durum) and not easy to be admitted. It was the doctrine of infinitely small quantities carried to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a>, and gave at once the result of an infinite series of successive approximations. Nothing, perhaps, more ingenious, and certainly nothing more happy, ever was contrived, than to arrive at the conclusion of all these approximations, without going through the approximations themselves. This is the purpose served by introducing into Mathematics the consideration of quantities infinitely small in size, and infinitely great in number; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> which, however inaccurate they may seem, yet, when carefully and analogically reasoned upon, have never led into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>.\n\nGeometry owes to Cavalleri, not only the general method just described, but many particular theorems, which that method was the instrument of discovering. Among these is the very remarkable proposition, that as four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, to the excess of the three angles of any spherical triangle, above two right angles, so is the superficies of the hemisphere to the area of the triangle. At that time, however, science was advancing so fast, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind was everywhere expanding itself with so much energy, that the same discovery was likely to be made by more individuals than one at the same time. It was not known in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> in 1632, when this determination of the area of a spherical triangle was given by Cavalleri, that it had been published three years before by Albert Girard, a mathematician of the Low Countries, of whose inventive powers we shall soon have more occasion to speak.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYCLOID\">Cycloid</a> afforded a number of problems, well calculated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> the proficient in the geometry of indivisibles, or of infinites. It is the curve described by a point in the circumference of a circle, while the circle itself rolls in a straight line along a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>. It is not quite certain when this curve, so remarkable for its curious properties, and for the place which it occupies in the history of geometry, first drew the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of mathematicians. In the year 1639, Galileo informed his friend Torricelli, that, forty years before that time, he had thought of this curve, on account of its shape, and the graceful form it would give to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> had endeavoured to find the area of the cycloid; but though he was one of those who first introduced the consideration of infinites into geometry, he was not expert enough in the use of that doctrine, to be able to resolve this problem. It is still more extraordinary, that the same problem proved too difficult for Cavalleri, though he certainly was in complete possession of the principles by which it was to be resolved. It is, however, not easy to determine whether it be to Torricelli, the scholar of Cavalleri, and his successor in genius and talents, or to Roberval, a French mathematician of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, and a man also of great originality and invention, that science is indebted for the first quadrature of the cycloid, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that its area is three times that of its generating circle. Both these mathematicians laid claim to it. The French and Italians each took the part of their own countryman; and in their zeal have so perplexed the question, that it is hard to say on which side the truth is to be found. Torricelli, however, was a man of a mild, amiable, and candid disposition; Roberval of a temper irritable, violent, and envious; so that, in as far as the testimony of the individuals themselves is concerned, there is no doubt which ought to preponderate. They had both the skill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> which fitted them for this, or even for more difficult researches.\n\nThe other properties of this curve, those that respect its tangents, its length, its curvature, &c. exercised the ingenuity, not only of the geometers just mentioned, but of Wren, Wallis, Huygens, and, even after the invention of the integral calculus, of Newton, Leibnitz, and Bernoulli.\n\nRoberval also improved the method of quadratures invented by Cavalleri, and extended his solutions to the case, when the powers of the terms in the arithmetical progression of which the sum was to be found were fractional; and\nWallis added the case when they were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>. Fermat, who, in his inventive resources, as well as in the correctness of his mathematical taste, yielded to none of his contemporaries, applied the consideration of infinitely small quantities to determine the maxima and minima of the ordinates of curves, as also their tangents. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BARROW\">Barrow</a>, somewhat later, did the same in England. Afterwards the geometry of infinites fell into the hands of Leibnitz and Newton, and acquired that new character which marks so distinguished an era in the mathematical sciences.\n\n2. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALGEBRA\">ALGEBRA</a>.\n\nIt was not from Greece alone that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> proceeded which dispelled the darkness of the middle ages; for, with the first dawn of that light, a mathematical science, of a name and character unknown to the geometers of antiquity, was received in Europe from Arabia. As early as the beginning of the thirteenth century, Leonardo, a merchant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a>, having made frequent visits to the East, in the course of commercial adventure, returned to Italy enriched by the traffic, and instructed by the science of those countries. He brought with him the knowledge of Algebra; and a late writer quotes a manuscript of his, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of 1202, and another that of 1228. The importation of algebra into Europe is thus carried back nearly 200 years farther than has generally been supposed; for Leonardo has been represented as flourishing in the end of the fourteenth century, instead of the very beginning of the thirteenth. It appears, by an extract from his manuscript, published by the above author, that his knowledge of algebra extended as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUADRATIC_EQUATIONS\">quadratic equations</a>. The language was very imperfect, corresponding to the infancy of the science; the quantities and the operations being expressed in words, with the help only of a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABBREVIATIONS\">abbreviations</a>. The rule for resolving quadratics by completing the square, is demonstrated geometrically.\n\nThough algebra was brought into Europe from Arabia, it is by no means certain that this last is its native country. There is, indeed, reason to think that its invention must be sought for much farther to the East, and probably not nearer than Indostan. We are assured by the Arabian writers, that Mahomet Ben <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MUSA\">Musa</a> of Chorasan, distinguished for his mathematical knowledge, travelled, about the year 959, into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, for the purpose of receiving further instruction in the science which he cultivated. It is likewise certain, that some books, which have lately been brought from India into this country, treat of algebra in a manner that has every appearance of originality, or at least of being derived from no source with which we are at all acquainted.\n\nBefore the time of Leonardo of Pisa, an important acquisition, also from the East, had greatly improved the science of arithmetic. This was the use of the Arabic notation, and the contrivance of making the same character change its signification, according to a fixed rule, when it changed its position, being increased tenfold for every place that it advanced towards the left. The knowledge of this simple but refined artifice was learned from the Moors by Gerbert, a monk of the Low Countries, in the tenth century, and by him made known in Europe. Gerbert was afterwards Pope, by the name of Silvester the Second, but from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> derived much less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> than from having instructed his countrymen in the decimal notation.\n\nThe writings of Leonardo, above mentioned, have remained in manuscript; and the first printed book in algebra is that of Lucas de Burgo, a Franciscan, who, towards the end of the fifteenth century, travelled, like Leonardo, into the East, and was there instructed in the principles of algebra. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> employed in his work, as in those of Leonardo, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> abbreviations of words. The letters \\( p \\) and \\( m \\)\n\n---\n\n1 He also was very skilful in the geometric analysis, and seems to have more thoroughly imbibed the spirit of that ingenious invention than any of the moderns before Halley.\n2 M. Cossali of Pisa, in a tract on the Origin of Algebra, 1797.\ndenote plus and minus; and the rule is laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, that, in multiplication, plus into minus gives minus, but minus into minus gives plus. Thus the first appearance of algebra is merely that of a system of short-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, or an abbreviation of common language, applied to the solution of arithmetical problems. It was a contrivance merely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> trouble; and yet to this contrivance we are indebted for the most philosophical and refined art which men have yet employed for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of their thoughts. This scientific language, therefore, like those in common use, has grown up slowly, from a very weak and imperfect state, till it has reached the condition in which it is now found.\n\nThough in all this the moderns received none of their information from the Greeks, yet a work in the Greek language, treating of arithmetical questions, in a manner that may be accounted algebraic, was discovered in the course of the next century, and given to the world, in a Latin translation, by Xylander, in 1575. This is the work of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIOPHANTUS\">Diophantus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, who had composed thirteen books of Arithmetical Questions, and is supposed to have flourished about 150 years after the Christian era. The questions he resolves are often of considerable difficulty; and a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> is displayed in stating them, so as to bring out equations of such a form as to involve only one power of the unknown quantity. The expression is that of common language, abbreviated and assisted by a few symbols. The investigations do not extend beyond quadratic equations; they are, however, extremely ingenious, and prove the author to have been a man of talent, though the instrument he worked with was weak and imperfect.\n\nThe name of Cardan is famous in the history of algebra. He was born at Milan in 1501, and was a man in whose character good and ill, strength and weakness, were mixed up in singular profusion. With great talents and industry, he was capricious, insincere, and vain-glorious to excess. Though a man of real science, he professed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>, and was such a believer in the influence of the stars, that he died to accomplish an astrological prediction. He remains, accordingly, a melancholy proof, that there is no folly or weakness too great to be united to high intellectual attainments.\n\nBefore his time very little advance had been made in the solution of any equations higher than the second degree; except that, as we are told, about the year 1508, Scipio Ferrei, Professor of Mathematics at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, had found out a rule for resolving one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of cubic equations, which, however, he concealed, or communicated only to a few of his scholars. One of these, Florido, on the strength of the secret he possessed, agreeably to a practice then common among mathematicians, challenged Tartalea of Brescia, to contend with him in the solution of algebraic problems. Florido had at first the advantage; but Tartalea, being a man of ingenuity, soon discovered his rule, and also another much more general, in consequence of which he came off at last victorious. By the report of this victory, the curiosity of Cardan was strongly excited; for, though he was himself much versed in the Mathematics, he had not been able to discover a method of resolving equations higher than the second degree. By the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> and importunate solicitation, he wrung from Tartalea the secret of his rules, but not till he had bound himself, by promises and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a>, never to divulge them. Tartalea did not communicate the demonstrations, which, however, Cardan soon found out, and extended, in a very ingenious and systematic manner, to all cubic equations whatsoever. Thus possessed of an important discovery, which was at least in a great part his own, he soon forgot his promises to Tartalea, and published the whole in 1545, not concealing, however, what he owed to the latter. Though a proceeding so directly contrary to an express stipulation cannot be defended, one does not much regret the disappointment of any man who would make a mystery of knowledge, or keep his discoveries a secret, for purposes merely selfish.\n\nThus was first published the rule which still bears the name of Cardan, and which, at this day, marks a point in the progress of algebraic investigation, which all the efforts of succeeding analysts have hardly been able to go beyond. As to the general doctrine of equations, it ap-\npears that Cardan was acquainted both with the negative and positive roots, the former of which he called by the name of false roots. He also knew that the number of positive, or, as he called them, true roots, is equal to the number of the changes of the signs of the terms; and that the coefficient of the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> is the difference between the sum of the true and the false roots. He also had perceived the difficulty of that case of cubic equations, which cannot be reduced to his own rule. He was not able to overcome the difficulty, but showed how, in all cases, an approximation to the roots might be obtained.\n\nThere is the more merit in these discoveries, that the language of algebra still remained very imperfect, and consisted merely of abbreviations of words. Mathematicians were then in the practice of putting their rules into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>. Cardan has given his a poetical dress, in which, as may be supposed, they are very awkward and obscure; for whatever assistance in this way is given to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, must be entirely at the expense of the understanding. It is, at the same time, a proof that the language of algebra was very imperfect. Nobody now thinks of translating an algebraic formula into verse; because, if one has acquired any familiarity with the language of the science, the formula will be more easily remembered than any thing that can be substituted in its room.\n\nItaly was not the only country into which the algebraic analysis had by this time found its way: in Germany it had also made considerable progress; and Stifelius, in a book of algebra, published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUREMBERG\">Nuremberg</a> in 1544, employed the same numeral exponents of powers, both positive and negative, which we now use, as far as integer numbers are concerned; but he did not carry the solution of equations farther than the second degree. He introduced the same charac-\n\nters for plus and minus which are at present employed.\n\nRobert Recorde, an English mathematician, published about this time, or a few years later, the first English treatise on Algebra, and he there introduced the same sign of equality which is now in use.\n\nThe properties of algebraic equations were discovered, however, very slowly. Pelitarius, a French mathematician, in a treatise which bears the date of 1558, is the first who observed that the root of an equation is a divisor of the last term; and he remarked also this curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of numbers, that the sum of the cubes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> numbers is the square of the sum of the numbers themselves.\n\nThe knowledge of the solution of cubic equations was still confined to Italy. Bombelli, a mathematician of that country, gave a regular treatise on Algebra, and considered, with very particular attention, the irreducible case of Cardan's rule. He was the first who made the remark, that the problems belonging to that case can always be resolved by the trisection of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>.\n\nVieta was a very learned man, and an excellent mathematician, remarkable both for industry and invention. He was the first who employed letters to denote the known as well as the unknown quantities; so that it was with him that the language of algebra first became capable of expressing general truths, and attained to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> which has since rendered it such a powerful instrument of investigation. He has also given new demonstrations of the rule for resolving cubic, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BIQUADRATIC\">biquadratic</a> equations. He also discovered the relation between the roots of an equation of any degree, and the coefficients of its terms, though only in the case where none of the terms are wanting, and where all the roots are real or positive. It is, indeed, extremely curious to remark, how gradually the truths of this\n\n---\n\n1 A passage in Bombelli's book, relative to the algebra of India, has become more interesting, from the information concerning the science of that country, which has reached Europe within the last twenty years. He tells us, that he had seen in the Vatican library, a manuscript of a certain Diophantus, a Greek author, which he admired so much, that he had formed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of translating it. He adds, that in this manuscript he had found the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> authors often quoted; from which it appeared that algebra was known to the Indians before it was known to the Arabians. Nothing, however, of all this is to be found in the work of Diophantus, which was published about three years after the time when Bombelli wrote. As it is, at the same time, impossible that he could be so much mistaken about a manuscript which he had particularly examined, this passage remains a mystery, which those who are curious about the ancient history of science would be very glad to have unravelled. See Hutton's History of Algebra.\nsort came in sight. This proposition belonged to a general truth, the greater part of which remained yet to be discovered. Vieta's treatises were originally published about the year 1600, and were afterwards collected into one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> by Schooten, in 1646.\n\nIn speaking of this illustrious man, Vieta, we must not omit his improvements in trigonometry, and still less his treatise on Angular Sections, which was a most important application of algebra to investigate the theorems, and resolve the problems of geometry. He also restored some of the books of Apollonius, in a manner highly creditable to his own ingenuity, but not perfectly in the taste of the Greek geometry; because, though the constructions are elegant, the demonstrations are all synthetical.\n\nAbout the same period, algebra became greatly indebted to Albert Girard, a Flemish mathematician, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> work, *Invention Nouvelle en Alg\u00e8bre*, was printed in 1669. This ingenious author perceived a greater extent, but not yet the whole of the truth, partially discovered by Vieta, viz. the successive formation of the coefficients of an equation from the sum of the roots; the sum of their products taken two and two; the same taken three and three, &c., whether the roots be positive or negative. He appears also to have been the first who understood the use of negative roots in the solution of geometrical problems, and is the author of the figurative expression, which gives to negative quantities the name of quantities less than nothing; a phrase that has been severely censured by those who forget that there are correct ideas, which correct language can hardly be made to express. The same mathematician conceived the notion of imaginary roots, and showed that the number of the roots of an equation could not exceed the exponent of the highest power of the unknown quantity. He was also in possession of the very refined and difficult rule, which forms the sums of the powers of the roots of an equation from the coefficients of its terms. This is the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of discoveries which the history of any algebraist could yet furnish.\n\nThe person next in order, as an inventor in algebra, is Thomas Harriot, an English mathematician, whose book, *Artis Analyticae Praxis*, was published after his death, in 1631. This book contains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENESIS\">genesis</a> of all equations, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> multiplication of simple equations; that is to say, it explains the truth in its full extent, to which Vieta and Girard had been approximating. By Harriot also, the method of extracting the roots of equations was greatly improved; the smaller letters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>, instead of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> letters employed by Vieta, were introduced; and by this improvement, trifling, indeed, compared with the rest, the form and exterior of algebraic expression were brought nearer to those which are now in use.\n\nI have been the more careful to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> very particularly the degrees by which the properties of equations were thus unfolded, because I think it forms an instance hardly paralleled in science, where a succession of able men, without going wrong, advanced, nevertheless, so slowly in the discovery of a truth which, when known, does not seem to be of a very hidden and abstruse nature. Their slow progress arose from this, that they worked with an instrument, the use of which they did not fully comprehend, and employed a language which expressed more than they were prepared to understand;\u2014a language which, under the notion, first of negative and then of imaginary quantities, seemed to involve such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> as the accuracy of mathematical science must necessarily refuse to admit.\n\nThe distinguished author of whom I have just been speaking was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> in 1560. He was employed in the second expedition sent out by Sir Walter Raleigh to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>, and on his return published an account of that country. He afterwards devoted himself entirely to the study of the Mathematics; and it appears from some of his manuscripts, lately discovered, that he observed the spots of the sun as early as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1610, not more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> later than Galileo. He also made observations on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>'s satellites, and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a> of 1607 and of 1618.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 The manuscripts which contain these observations, and probably many other things of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, are preserved in the collection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EGREMONT\">Egremont</a>, having come into the possession of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> from Henry Percy, Earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a>, a most liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of science, with whom Harriot appears to have chiefly lived after his return from Virginia.\nThe succession of discoveries above related brought the algebraic analysis, abstractly considered, into a state of perfection little short of that which it has attained at the present moment. It was thus prepared for the step which was about to be taken by Descartes, and which forms one of the most important epochs in the history of the mathematical sciences. This was the application of the algebraic analysis, to define the nature, and investigate the properties, of curve lines, and, consequently, to represent the notion of variable quantity. It is often said that Descartes was the first who applied algebra to geometry; but this is inaccurate; for such applications had been made before, particularly by Vieta, in his treatise on Angular Sections. The invention just mentioned is the undisputed property of Descartes, and opened up vast fields of discovery for those who were to come after him.\n\nThe work in which this was contained is a tract of no more than 106 quarto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>; and there is probably no book of the same size which has conferred so much and so just celebrity on its author. It was first published in 1637.\n\nIn the first of the three books into which the tract just mentioned is divided, the author begins with the consideration of such geometrical problems as may be resolved by circles and straight lines; and explains the method of constructing algebraic formulas, or of translating a truth from the language of algebra into that of geometry. He then proceeds to the consideration of the problem, known among the ancients by the name of the locus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-AD\">ad</a> quatuor rectas, and treated of by Apollonius and Pappus. The algebraic analysis afforded a method of resolving this problem in its full extent; and the consideration of it is again resumed in the second book. The thing required is, to find the locus of a point, from which, if perpendiculars be drawn to four lines given in position, a given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of these perpendiculars, in which the variable quantities are only of two dimensions, shall be always of the same magnitude. Descartes shows the locus, on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, to be always a conic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>; and he distinguishes the cases in which it is a circle, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELLIPSIS\">ellipsis</a>, a parabola, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPERBOLA\">hyperbola</a>. It was an instance of the most extensive investigation which had yet been undertaken in geometry, though, to render it a complete solution of the problem, much more detail was doubtless necessary. The investigation is extended to the cases where the function, which remains the same, is of three, four, or five dimensions, and where the locus is a line of a higher order, though it may, in certain circumstances, become a conic section. The lines given in position may be more than four, or than any given number; and the lines drawn to them may either be perpendiculars, or lines making given angles with them. The same analysis applies to all the cases; and this problem, therefore, afforded an excellent example of the use of algebra in the investigation of geometrical propositions. The author takes notice of the unwillingness of the ancients to transfer the language of arithmetic into geometry, so that they were forced to have recourse to very circuitous methods of expressing those relations of quantity in which powers beyond the third are introduced. Indeed, to deliver investigation from those modes of expression which involve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of ratios, and to substitute in their room the multiplication of the numerical measures, is of itself a very great advantage, arising from the introduction of algebra into geometry.\n\nIn this book also, an ingenious method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> tangents to curves is proposed by Descartes, as following from his general principles; and it is an invention with which he appears to have been particularly pleased. He says, \"Nec verebor dieere, problema hoc non modo eorum que scio utilissimum et generalissimum esse, sed etiam eorum quae in geometria scire unquam desideraverim.\" This passage is not a little characteristic of Descartes, who was very much disposed to think well of what he had done himself, and even to suppose that it could not easily\n\n---\n\n1 It will easily be perceived, that the word function is not contained in the original enunciation of the problem. It is a term but lately introduced into mathematical language, and affords here, as on many other occasions, a more general and more concise expression than could be otherwise obtained.\n\n2 Cartesi Geometria, p. 40.\nbe rendered more perfect. The truth, however, is, that his method of drawing tangents is extremely operose, and is one of those hasty views which, though ingenious and even profound, require to be vastly simplified, before they can be reduced to practice. Fermat, the rival and sometimes the superior of Descartes, was far more fortunate with regard to this problem, and his method of drawing tangents to curves is the same in effect that has been followed by all the geometers since his time; while that of Descartes, which could only be valued when the other was unknown, has been long since entirely abandoned. The remainder of the second book is occupied with the consideration of the curves, which have been called the Ovals of Descartes, and with some investigations concerning the centres of lenses; the whole indicating the hand of a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, and deserving the most diligent study of those who would become acquainted with this great enlargement of mathematical science.\n\nThe third book of the geometry treats of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of equations by geometric curves, and it also contains a new method of resolving biquadratic equations.\n\nThe leading principles of algebra were now unfolded, and the notation was brought, from a mere contrivance for abridging common language, to a system of symbolical writing, admirably fitted to assist the mind in the exercise of thought.\n\nThe happy idea, indeed, of expressing quantity, and the operations on quantity, by conventional symbols, instead of representing the first by real magnitudes, and enunciating the second in words, could not but make a great change on the nature of mathematical investigation. The language of Mathematics, whatever may be its form, must always consist of two parts; the one denoting quantities simply, and the other denoting the manner in which the quantities are combined, or the operations understood to be performed on them. Geometry expresses the first of these by real magnitudes, or by what may be called natural signs; a line by a line, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> by an angle, an area by an area, &c.; and it describes the latter by words. Algebra, on the other hand, denotes both quantity, and the operations on quantity, by the same system of conventional symbols. Thus, in the expression $x^3 - ax^2 + bx = 0$, the letters $a$, $b$, $x$, denote quantities, but the terms $x^3$, $ax^2$, &c. denote certain operations performed on those quantities, as well as the quantities themselves; $x^3$ is the quantity $x$ raised to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>; and $ax^2$ the same quantity $x$ raised to the square, and then multiplied into $a$, &c.; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>, by addition or subtraction, being also expressed by the signs $+$ and $-$.\n\nNow, it is when applied to this latter purpose that the algebraic language possesses such exclusive excellence. The mere magnitudes themselves might be represented by figures, as in geometry, as well as in any way whatever; but the operations they are to be subjected to, if described in words, must be set before the mind slowly, and in succession, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> is weakened, and the clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> rendered difficult. In the algebraic expression, on the other hand, so much meaning is concentrated into a narrow space, and the impression made by all the parts is so simultaneous, that nothing can be more favourable to the exertion of the reasoning powers, to the continuance of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, and their security against error. Another advantage resulting from the use of the same notation, consists in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of all the different relations among quantities to the simplest of those relations, that of equality, and the expression of it by equations. This gives a great facility of generalization, and of comparing quantities with one another. A third arises from the substitution of the arithmetical operations of multiplication and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, for the geometrical method of the composition and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of ratios. Of the first of these, the idea is so clear, and the work so simple; of the second, the idea is comparatively so obscure, and the process so complex, that the substitution of the former for the latter could not but be accompanied with great advantage. This is, indeed, what constitutes the great difference in practice between the algebraic and the geometric method of treating quantity. When the quantities are of a complex nature, so as to go beyond what in algebra is called the third power, the geometrical expression is so circuit-\nous and involved, that it renders the reasoning most laborious and intricate. The great facility of generalization in algebra, of deducing one thing from another, and of adapting the analysis to every kind of research, whether the quantities be constant or variable, finite or infinite, depends on this principle more than any other. Few of the early algebraists seem to have been aware of these advantages.\n\nThe use of the signs plus and minus has given rise to some dispute. These signs were at first used, the one to denote addition, the other subtraction, and for a long time were applied to no other purpose. But as, in the multiplication of a quantity, consisting of parts connected by those signs, into another quantity similarly composed, it was always found, and could be universally demonstrated, that, in uniting the particular products of which the total was made up, those of which both the factors had the sign minus before them, must be added into one sum with those of which all the factors had the sign plus, while those of which one of the factors had the sign plus, and the other the sign minus, must be subtracted from the same,\u2014this general rule came to be more simply expressed by saying, that in multiplication like signs gave plus, and that unlike signs gave minus.\n\nHence the signs plus and minus were considered, not as merely denoting the relation of one quantity to another placed before it, but, by a kind of fiction, they were considered as denoting qualities inherent in the quantities to the names of which they were prefixed. This fiction was found extremely useful, and it was evident that no error could arise from it. It was necessary to have a rule for determining the sign belonging to a product, from the signs of the factors composing that product, independently of every other consideration; and this was precisely the purpose for which the above fiction was introduced. So necessary is this rule in the generalizations of algebra, that we meet with it in Diophantus, notwithstanding the imperfection of the language he employed; for he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, that \\(\\alpha\\omega\\lambda\\eta\\sigma\\) into \\(\\alpha\\omega\\lambda\\eta\\sigma\\) gives \\(\\tau\\epsilon\\alpha\\gamma\\sigma\\eta\\sigma\\), &c. The reduction, therefore, of the operations on quantity to an arithmetical form, necessarily involves this use of the signs plus or minus; that is, their application to denote something like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> qualities in the objects they collect together. The attempts to free algebra from this use of the signs have of course failed, and must ever do so, if we would preserve to that science the extent and facility of its operations.\n\nEven the most scrupulous purist in mathematical language must admit, that no real error is ever introduced by employing the signs in this most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>. If the equation \\(x^5 + px^4 + qx + r = 0\\), be said to have one positive and two negative roots, this is certainly as exceptional an application of the term negative as any that can be proposed; yet, in reality, it means nothing but this intelligible and simple truth, that \\(x^5 + px^4 + qx + r = (x - a)(x + b)(x + c)\\); or that the former of these quantities is produced by the multiplication of the three binomial factors, \\(x - a, x + b, x + c\\). We might say the same nearly as to imaginary roots: they show that the simple factors cannot be found, but that the quadratic factors may be found; and they also point out the means of discovering them.\n\nThe aptitude of these same signs to denote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">contrariety</a> of position among geometric magnitudes, makes the foregoing application of them infinitely more extensive and more indispensable.\n\nFrom the same source arises the great simplicity introduced into many of the theorems and rules of the mathematical sciences. Thus, the rule for finding the latitude of a place from the sun's meridian altitude, if we employ the signs plus and minus for indicating the position of the sun and of the place relatively to the equator, is enunciated in one simple proposition, which includes every case, without anything either complex or ambiguous. But if this is not done,\u2014if the signs plus and minus are not employed, there must be at least two rules; one when the sun and place are on the same side of the equator, and another when they are on different sides. In the more complicated calculations of spherical trigonometry, this holds still more remarkably. When one would accommodate such rules to those who are unacquainted with the use of the algebraic signs, they are perhaps not to be expressed in less than four, or even six\ndifferent propositions; whereas, if the use of these signs is supposed, the whole is comprehended in a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>. In such cases, it is obvious that both the memory and understanding derive great advantage from the use of the signs, and profit by a simplification, which is the work entirely of the algebraic language, and cannot be imitated by any other.\n\nThat I might not interrupt the view of improvements so closely connected with one another, I have passed over one of the discoveries, which does the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to the seventeenth century, and which took place near the beginning of it.\n\nAs the accuracy of astronomical observation had been continually advancing, it was necessary that the correctness of trigonometrical calculation, and of course its difficulty, should advance in the same proportion. The signs and tangents of angles could not be expressed with sufficient correctness without decimal fractions, extending to five or six places below unity; and when to three such numbers a fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> was to be found, the work of multiplication and division became extremely laborious. Accordingly, in the end of the sixteenth century, the time and labour consumed in such calculations had become excessive, and were felt as extremely burdensome by the mathematicians and astronomers all over Europe. Napier of Merchiston, whose mind seems to have been peculiarly turned to arithmetical researches, and who was also devoted to the study of astronomy, had early sought for the means of relieving himself and others from this difficulty. He had viewed the subject in a variety of lights, and a number of ingenious devices had occurred to him, by which the tediousness of arithmetical operations might, more or less completely, be avoided. In the course of these attempts, he did not fail to observe, that whenever the numbers to be multiplied or divided were terms of a geometrical progression, the product or the quotient must also be a term of that progression, and must occupy a place in it pointed out by the places of the given numbers, so that it might be found from mere inspection, if the progression were far enough continued. If, for instance, the third term of the progression were to be multiplied by the seventh, the product must be the tenth; and if the twelfth were to be divided by the fourth, the quotient must be the eighth; so that the multiplication and division of such terms was reduced to the addition and subtraction of the numbers which indicated their places in the progression.\n\nThis observation, or one very similar to it, was made by Archimedes, and was employed by that great geometer to convey an idea of a number too vast to be correctly expressed by the arithmetical notation of the Greeks. Thus far, however, there was no difficulty; and the discovery might certainly have been made by men much inferior either to Napier or Archimedes. What remained to be done, what Archimedes did not attempt, and what Napier completely performed, involved two great difficulties. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, that the resource of the geometrical progression was sufficient, when the given numbers were terms of that progression; but if they were not, it did not seem that any advantage could be derived from it. Napier, however, perceived, and it was by no means obvious, that all numbers whatsoever might be inserted in the progression, and have their places assigned in it. After conceiving the possibility of this, the next difficulty was, to discover the principle, and to execute the arithmetical process, by which these places were to be ascertained. It is in these two points that the peculiar merit of his invention consists; and at a period when the nature of series, and when every other resource of which he could avail himself, were so little known, his success argues a depth and originality of thought which, I am persuaded, have rarely been surpassed.\n\nThe way in which he satisfied himself that all numbers might be intercalated between the terms of the given progression, and by which he found the places they must occupy, was founded on a most ingenious supposition; that of two points describing two different lines, the one with a constant velocity, and the other with a velocity always increasing in the ratio of the space the point had already gone over: the first of these would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> magnitudes in arithmetical, and the second magnitudes in geometrical progression. It is plain, that all numbers whatsoever would find their places among the magnitudes so gene-\nrated; and, indeed, this view of the subject is as simple and profound as any which, after two hundred years, has yet presented itself to mathematicians. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of deducing the results has been simplified; but it can hardly be said that the principle has been more clearly developed.\n\nI need not observe, that the numbers which indicate the places of the terms of the geometrical progression are called by Napier the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a> of those terms.\n\nVarious systems of logarithms, it is evident, may be constructed according to the geometrical progression assumed; and of these, that which was first contrived by Napier, though the simplest, and the foundation of the rest, was not so convenient for the purposes of calculation, as one which soon afterwards occurred, both to himself and his friend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIGGS\">Briggs</a>, by whom the actual calculation was performed. The new system of logarithms was an improvement, practically considered; but in as far as it was connected with the principle of the invention, it is only of secondary consideration. The original tables had been also somewhat embarrassed by too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> a connection between them and trigonometry. The new tables were free from this inconvenience.\n\nIt is probable, however, that the greatest inventor in science was never able to do more than to accelerate the progress of discovery, and to anticipate what time, \"the author of authors,\" would have gradually brought to light. Though logarithms had not been invented by Napier, they would have been discovered in the progress of the algebraic analysis, when the arithmetic of powers and exponents, both integral and fractional, came to be fully understood. The idea of considering all numbers as powers of one given number would then have readily occurred, and the doctrine of series would have greatly facilitated the calculations which it was necessary to undertake. Napier had none of these advantages, and they were all supplied by the resources of his own mind. Indeed, as there never was any invention for which the state of knowledge had less prepared the way, there never was anywhere more merit fell to the share of the inventor.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a>, also, not less than his great sagacity, may be remarked. Had the invention of logarithms been delayed to the end of the seventeenth century, it would have come about without effort, and would not have conferred on the author the high celebrity which Napier so justly derives from it. In another respect he has also been fortunate. Many inventions have been eclipsed or obscured by new discoveries; or they have been so altered by subsequent improvements, that their original form can hardly be recognised, and, in some instances, has been entirely forgotten. This has almost always happened to the discoveries made at an early period in the progress of science, and before their principles were fully unfolded. It has been quite otherwise with the invention of logarithms, which came out of the hands of the author so perfect, that it has never received but one material improvement,\u2014that which it derived, as has just been said, from the ingenuity of his friend in conjunction with his own. Subsequent improvements in science, instead of offering anything that could supplant this invention, have only enlarged the circle to which its utility extended. Logarithms have been applied to numberless purposes, which were not thought of at the time of their first construction. Even the sagacity of their author did not see the immense fertility of the principle he had discovered: he calculated his tables merely to facilitate arithmetical, and chiefly trigonometrical computation; and little imagined that he was at the same time constructing a scale whereon to measure the density of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, and the heights of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>; that he was actually computing the areas and the lengths of innumerable curves, and was preparing for a calculus which was yet to be discovered, many of the most refined and most valuable of its resources. Of Napier, therefore, if of any man, it may safely be pronounced, that his name will never be eclipsed by any one more conspicuous, or his invention superseded by anything more valuable.\n\nAs a geometrician, Napier has left behind him a noble monument in the two trigonometrical theorems, which are known by his name, and which appear first to have been communicated\nin writing to Cavalleri, who has mentioned them with great eulogy.\\(^1\\) They are theorems not a little difficult, and of much use, as being particularly adapted to logarithmic calculation. They were published in the *Canon Mirificus Logarithmorum*, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, in 1614.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n**SECTION II.**\n\n**EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION.**\n\nIn this section I shall begin with a short view of the state of Physical Knowledge before the introduction of the Inductive Method; I shall next endeavour to explain that method by an analysis of the *Novum Organum*; and shall then inquire how far the principles established in that work have actually contributed to the advancement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>.\n\n---\n\n**I. ANCIENT PHYSICS.**\n\nThough the phenomena of the material world could not but early excite the curiosity of a being who, like man, receives his strongest impressions from without, yet an accurate knowledge of those phenomena, and their laws, was not to be speedily acquired. The mere extent and variety of the objects were, indeed, such obstacles to that acquisition, as could not be surmounted but in the course of many ages. Man could not at first perceive from what point he must begin his inquiries, in what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> he must carry them on, or by what rules he must be guided. He was like a traveller going forth to explore a vast and unknown wilderness, in which a multitude of great and interesting objects presented themselves on every side, while there was no path for him to follow, no rule to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> his survey, and where the art of observing, and the instruments of observation, must equally be the work of his own invention. In these circumstances, the selection of the objects to be studied was the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a> rather than of reason, or of the passions and emotions, more than of the understanding. When things new, and unlike those which occurred in the course of every day's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, presented themselves, they excited wonder or surprise, and created an anxiety to discover some principle which might connect them with the appearances <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> observed. About these last, men felt no desire to be further informed; but when the common order of things was violated, and something new or singular was produced, they began to examine into the fact, and attempted to inquire into the cause. Nobody sought to know why a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> fell to the ground, why <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> ascended, or why the stars revolved round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. But if a fiery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-METEOR\">meteor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> across the heavens,\u2014if the flames of a volcano burst forth,\u2014or if an earthquake shook the foundations of the world, terror and curiosity were both awakened; and when the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a> had subsided, the latter was sure to become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>. Thus, to trace a resemblance between the events with which the observer was most familiar, and those to which he was less accustomed, and which had excited his wonder, was the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of inquiry, and produced the first advances towards generalization and philosophy.\\(^3\\)\n\nThis principle, which it were easy to trace,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Wallis, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OPERA\">Opera</a> Math.*, tom.

See *Scriptores Logarithmici*, 4to. vol. VI. p. 475.\n\n\\(^3\\) La maraviglia Dell' ignoranza \u00e8 la figlia,\nE del sapere La madre.\nfrom tribes the most rude and barbarous, to nations the most highly refined, was what yielded the first attempts toward classification and arrangement, and enabled man, out of individuals subject to perpetual change, to form certain fixed and permanent objects of knowledge\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, genera, orders, and classes, into which he has distributed these individuals. By this effort of mental abstraction, he has created to himself a new and intellectual world, free from those changes and vicissitudes to which all material things are destined. This, too, is a work not peculiar to the philosopher, but, in a certain degree, is performed by every man who compares one thing with another, and who employs the terms of ordinary language.\n\nAnother great branch of knowledge is occupied, not about the mere arrangement and classification of objects, but about events or changes, the laws which those changes observe, and the causes by which they are produced. In a science which treated of events and of change, the nature and properties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> came of course to be studied, and the ancient philosophers naturally enough began their inquiries with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of motion, or the determination of that in which it consists. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>'s definition is highly characteristic of the vagueness and obscurity of his physical speculations. He calls motion \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of a being in power, as far as in power;\" words to which it is impossible that any distinct idea can ever have been annexed.\n\nThe truth is, however, that the best definition of motion can be of very little service in Physics. Epicurus defined it to be the \"change of place,\" which is, no doubt, the simplest and best definition that can be given; but it must, at the same time, be confessed, that neither he, nor the moderns who have retained his definition, have derived the least advantage from it in their subsequent researches. The properties, or, as they are called, the laws of motion, cannot be derived from mere definition; they must be sought for in experience and observation, and are not to be found without a diligent comparison, and scrupulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of facts. Of such an examination, neither Aristotle, nor any other of the ancients, ever conceived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>; and hence those laws remained quite unknown throughout all antiquity.\n\nWhen the laws of motion were unknown, the other parts of Natural Philosophy could make no great advances. Instead of conceiving that there resides in body a natural and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> tendency to persevere in the same state, whether of rest or of motion, they believed that terrestrial bodies tended naturally either to fall to the ground, or to ascend from it, till they attained their own place; but that, if they were impelled by an oblique force, then their motion became unnatural or violent, and tended continually to decay. With the heavenly bodies, again, the natural motion was circular and uniform, eternal in its course, but perpetually varying in its direction. Thus, by the distinction between natural and violent motion among the bodies of the earth, and the distinction between what we may call the laws of motion in terrestrial and celestial bodies, the ancients threw into all their reasonings upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> subject a confusion and perplexity, from which their philosophy never was delivered.\n\nThere was, however, one part of physical knowledge in which their endeavours were attended with much better success, and in which they made important discoveries. This was in the branch of mechanics which treats of the action of forces in equilibrium, and producing not motion but rest; a subject which may be understood, though the laws of motion are unknown.\n\nThe first writer on this subject is Archimedes. He treated of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a>, and of the centre of gravity; and has shown that there will be an equilibrium between two heavy bodies connected by an inflexible rod or lever, when the point in which the lever is supported is so placed between the bodies, that their distances from it are inversely as their weights. Great ingenuity is displayed in this demonstration; and it is remarkable, that the author borrows no principle from experiment, but establishes his conclusion entirely by reasoning a priori. He assumes, indeed, that equal bodies, at the ends of the equal arms of a lever, will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> one another; and also, that a cylinder, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLELOPIPED\">parallelopiped</a> of homogeneous matter, will be balanced about its centre of magnitude. These, however, are not inferences\nfrom experience; they are, properly speaking, conclusions deduced from the principle of the sufficient reason.\n\nThe same great geometer gave a beginning to the science of hydrostatics, and discovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> which determines the loss of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> sustained by a body on being immersed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, or in any other fluid. His demonstration rests on a principle, which he lays down as a postulatum, that, in water, the parts which are less pressed are always ready to yield in any direction to those that are more pressed; and from this, by the application of mathematical reasoning, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of floating bodies is derived. The above is the same principle on which the modern writers on hydrostatics proceed; they give it, not as a postulatum, but as constituting the definition of a fluid.\n\nArchimedes, therefore, is the person who first made the application of Mathematics to Natural Philosophy. No individual, perhaps, ever laid the foundation of more great discoveries than that geometer, of whom Wallis has said with so much truth, \"Vir stupendae sagacitatis, qui prima fundamenta posuit inventionum fere omnium, in quibus promovendis vetas nostra gloriatur.\"\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> inquiries, begun by the geometer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>, were extended by Ctesibius and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERO\">Hero</a>; by Anthemius of Tralles; and, lastly, by Pappus Alexandrinus. Ctesibius and Hero were the first who analyzed mechanical engines, reducing them all to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of five simple mechanical contrivances, to which they gave the name of \u0394\u03c9\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1, or Powers, the same which they retain at the present moment.\n\nEven in mechanics, however, the success of these investigations was limited; and failed in those cases where the resolution of forces is necessary, that principle being then entirely unknown. Hence the force necessary to sustain a body on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined plane</a>, is incorrectly determined by Pappus, and serves to mark a point to which the mechanical theories of antiquity did not extend.\n\nIn another department of physical knowledge, astronomy, the endeavours of the ancients were also accompanied with success. I do not here speak of their astronomical theories, which were, indeed, very defective, but of their discovery of the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies, from the observations begun by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HIPPARCHUS\">Hipparchus</a>, and continued by Ptolemy. In this their success was great; and while the earth was supposed to be at rest, and while the instruments of observation had but a very limited degree of accuracy, a nearer approach to the truth was probably not within the power of human ingenuity. Mathematical reasoning was very skilfully applied; and no men whatever, in the same circumstances, are likely to have performed more than the ancient astronomers. They succeeded, because they were observers, and examined carefully the motions which they treated of. The philosophers, again, who studied the motion of terrestrial bodies, either did not observe at all, or observed so slightly, that they could obtain no accurate knowledge; and in general they knew just enough of the facts to be misled by them.\n\nThe opposite ways which the ancients thus took to study the Heavens and the Earth, observing the one, and dreaming, as one may say, over the other, though a striking inconsistency, is not difficult to be explained.\n\nNo information at all could be obtained in astronomy, without regular and assiduous observation, and without instruments capable of measuring angles, and of measuring time, either directly or indirectly. The steadiness and regularity of the celestial motions seemed to invite the most scrupulous attention. On the other hand, as terrestrial objects were always at hand, and spontaneously falling under men's view, it seemed unnecessary to take much trouble to become acquainted with them; and as for applying measures, their irregularity appeared to render every idea of such proceeding nugatory. The Aristotelian philosophy particularly favoured this prejudice, by representing the earth, and all things on its surface, as full of irregularity and confusion, while the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, dryness and moisture, were in a state of perpetual warfare. The unfortunate division of motion into natural and violent, and the distinction, still more unfortunate, between the properties of motion and of body, in the heavens and on the earth, prevented all intercourse between the astronomer and the naturalist, and all trans-\nference of the maxims of the one to the speculations of the other.\n\nThough, on account of this inattention to experiment, nothing like the true system of Natural Philosophy was known to the ancients, there are, nevertheless, to be found in their writings many brilliant conceptions, several fortunate conjectures, and gleams of the light which was afterwards to be so generally diffused.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANAXAGORAS\">Anaxagoras</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEDOCLES\">Empedocles</a>, for example, taught that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> shines by light borrowed from the sun, and were led to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, not only from the phases of the moon, but from its light being weak, and unaccompanied by heat. That it was a habitable body, like the earth, appears to be a doctrine as old as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-ORPHEUS\">Orpheus</a>; some lines, ascribed to that poet, representing the moon as an earth, with mountains and cities on its surface.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMOCRITUS\">Democritus</a> supposed the spots on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the moon to arise from the inequalities of the surface, and from the shadows of the more elevated parts projected on the plains. Every one knows how conformable this is to the discoveries made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>.\n\nPlutarch considers the velocity of the moon's motion as the cause which prevents that body from falling to the earth, just as the motion of a stone in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLING\">sling</a> prevents it from falling to the ground. The comparison is, in a certain degree, just, and clearly implies the notion of centrifugal force; and gravity may also be considered as pointed at for the cause which gives the moon a tendency to the earth. Here, therefore, a foundation was laid for the true philosophy of the celestial motions; but it was laid without effect. It was merely the conjecture of an ingenious mind, wandering through the regions of possibility, guided by no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, and having no principle which could give stability to its opinions. Democritus, and the authors of that physical system which Lucretius has so beautifully illustrated, were still more fortunate in some of their conjectures. They taught that the Milky Way is the light of a great number of small stars, very close to one another; a magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, which the latest improvements of the telescope have fully verified. Yet, as if to convince us that they derived this knowledge from no pure or certain source, the same philosophers maintained, that the sun and the moon are bodies no larger than they appear to us to be.\n\nVery just notions concerning comets were entertained by some of the ancients. The Chaldeans considered those bodies as belonging to the same order with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>; and this was also the opinion of Anaxagoras, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>, and Democritus. The remark of Seneca on this subject is truly philosophical, and contains a prediction which has been fully accomplished: \"Why do we wonder that comets, which are so rare a spectacle in the world, observe laws which to us are yet unknown, and that the beginning and end of motions, so seldom observed, are not yet fully understood?\"\u2014Veniet tempus, quo ista qua non latent, in lucem dies extrahat, et longioris axi diligentia: ad inquisitionem tantorum atas una non sufficit. Veniet tempus, quo posteri nostri lam aperta nos nescisse mirentur.\n\nIt was, however, often the fate of such truths to give way to error. The comets, which these ancient philosophers had ranked so justly with the stars, were degraded by Aristotle into meteors floating in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\">earth's</a> atmosphere; and this was the opinion concerning them which ultimately prevailed.\n\nBut, notwithstanding the above, and a few other splendid conceptions which shine through the obscurity of the ancient Physics, the system, taken on the whole, was full of error and inconsistency. Truth and falsehood met almost on terms of equality; the former, separated from its root, experience, found no preference above the latter; to the latter, in fact, it was generally forced to give way, and the dominion of error was finally established.\n\nOne ought to listen, therefore, with caution to the encomiums sometimes bestowed on the philosophy of those early ages. If these encomiums respected only the talents, the genius, the taste of the great masters of antiquity, we would subscribe to them without any apprehen-\n\n---\n\n1 Nat. Qu\u00e6st. lib. vii. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. xxv.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SION\">sion</a> of going beyond the truth. But if they extend to the methods of philosophizing, and the discoveries actually made, we must be excused for entering our dissent, and exchanging the language of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a> for that of apology. The infancy of science could not be the time when its attainments were the highest; and before we suffer ourselves to be guided by the veneration of antiquity, we ought to consider in what real antiquity consists. With regard to the progress of knowledge and improvement, \"we are more ancient than those who went before us.\"1\n\nThe human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RACE\">race</a> has now more experience than in the generations that are past, and of course may be expected to have made higher attainments in science and philosophy. Compared with Natural Philosophy, as it now exists, the ancient Physics are rude and imperfect. The speculations contained in them are vague and unsatisfactory, and of little value, but as they elucidate the history of the errors and illusions to which the human mind is subject. Science was not merely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, but often retrograde; the earliest opinions were frequently the best; and the reasonings of Democritus and Anaxagoras were in many instances more solid than those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> and Aristotle. Extreme credulity disgraced the speculations of men who, however ingenious, were little acquainted with the laws of nature, and unprovided with the great criterion by which the evidence of testimony can alone be examined. Though observations were sometimes made, experiments were never instituted; and philosophers who were little attentive to the facts which spontaneously offered, did not seek to increase their number by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> combinations. Experience, in those ages, was a light which darted a few tremulous and uncertain rays on some small portions of the field of science; but men had not acquired the power over that light which now enables them to concentrate its beams, and to fix them steadily on whatever object they wish to examine. This power is what distinguishes the modern Physics, and is the cause why later philosophers, without being more ingenious than their predecessors, have been infinitely more successful in the study of nature.\n\n2. NOVUM ORGANUM.\n\nThe defects which have been ascribed to the ancient Physics were not likely to be corrected in the course of the middle ages. It is true, that during those ages a science of pure experiment had made its appearance in the world, and might have been expected to remedy the greatest of these defects, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the attention of philosophers to experience and observation. This effect, however, was far from being immediately produced; and none who professed to be in search of truth ever wandered over the regions of fancy, in paths more devious and eccentric, than the first experimenters in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>. They had become acquainted with a series of facts so unlike to any thing already known, that the ordinary principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> were shaken or subverted, and the mind laid open to a degree of credulity far beyond any with which the philosophers of antiquity could be reproached. An unlooked-for extension of human power had taken place; its limits were yet unknown; and the boundary between the possible and the impossible was no longer to be distinguished. The adventurers in an unexplored country, given up to the guidance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, pursued objects which the kindness, no less than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of nature, has rendered unattainable by man; and in their speculations peopled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, the earth, and all the elements, with spirits and genii, the invisible agents destined to connect together all the facts which they knew, and all those which they hoped to discover. Chemistry, in this state, might be said to have an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELECTIVE\">elective</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> for all that was most absurd and extravagant in the other parts of knowledge; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALCHEMY\">alchemy</a> was its immediate offspring, and it allied itself in succession with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> of the Cabalists, the Rosicrucians, and the Theosophers. Thus a science, founded in experiment, and destined one day to afford\n\n---\n\n1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>.\nsuch noble examples of its use, exhibited for several ages little else than a series of illusory pursuits, or visionary speculations, while now and then a fact was accidentally discovered.\n\nUnder the influence of these circumstances arose Paracelsus, Van Helmont, Fludd, Cardan, and several others, conspicuous no less for the weakness than the force of their understandings; men who united extreme credulity, the most extravagant pretensions, and the most excessive vanity, with considerable powers of invention, a complete contempt for authority, and a desire to consult experience; but destitute of the judgment, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, and comprehensive views, without which the responses of that oracle are never to be understood. Though they appealed to experience, and disclaimed subjection to the old legislators of science, they were in too great haste to become legislators themselves, and to deduce an explanation of the whole phenomena of nature from a few facts, observed without accuracy, arranged without skill, and never compared or confronted with one another. Fortunately, however, from the turn which their inquiries had taken, the ill done by them has passed away, and the good has become permanent. The reveries of Paracelsus have disappeared, but his application of Chemistry to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PHARMACY\">Pharmacy</a> has conferred a lasting benefit on the world. The Arch\u00e6us of Van Helmont, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of spiritual agents with which the discovery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> had filled the imagination of that celebrated empiric, are laughed at, or forgotten; but the fluids which he had the sagacity to distinguish, form, at the present moment, the connecting principles of the new Chemistry.\n\nEarlier than any of the authors just named, but in a great measure under the influence of the same delusions, Roger Bacon appears to have been more fully aware than any of them of the use of experiment, and of mathematical reasoning, in physical and mechanical inquiries. But, in the thirteenth century, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> from the authority of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, even to nature herself, could not be made with impunity. Bacon, accordingly, incurred the displeasure both of the University and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a>; and this forms one of his claims to the respect of posterity, as it is but fair to consider <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> inflicted by the ignorant and bigoted as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to praise bestowed by the liberal and enlightened.\n\nMuch more recently, Gilbert, in his treatise on the Magnet, had given an example of an experimental inquiry, carried on with more correctness, and more enlarged views, than had been done by any of his predecessors. Nevertheless, in the end of the sixteenth century, it might still be affirmed, that the situation of the great avenue to knowledge was fully understood by none, and that its existence, to the bulk of philosophers, was utterly unknown.\n\nIt was about this time that Francis Bacon (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Verulam) began to turn his powerful and creative mind to contemplate the state of human knowledge, to mark its imperfections, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> its improvement. One of the considerations which appears to have impressed his mind most forcibly, was the vagueness and uncertainty of all the physical speculations then existing, and the entire want of connection between the sciences and the arts.\n\nThough these two things are in their nature so closely united, that the same truth which is a principle in science becomes a rule in art, yet there was at that time hardly any practical improvement which had arisen from a theoretical discovery. The natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> between the knowledge and the power of man seemed entirely interrupted; nothing was to be seen of the mutual support which they ought to afford to one another; the improvement of art was left to the slow and precarious operation of chance, and that of science to the collision of opposite opinions.\n\n\"But whence,\" said Bacon, \"can arise such vagueness and sterility in all the physical systems which have hitherto existed in the world? It is not certainly from any thing in nature itself; for the steadiness and regularity of the laws by which it is governed, clearly mark them out as objects of certain and precise knowledge. Neither can it arise from any want of ability in those who have pursued such inquiries, many of whom have been men of the highest talent and genius of the ages in which they lived; and it can, therefore, arise from nothing else but the perverseness and insufficiency of the methods...\"\nthat have been pursued. Men have sought to make a world from their own conceptions, and to draw from their own minds all the materials which they employed; but if, instead of doing so, they had consulted experience and observation, they would have had facts, and not opinions, to reason about, and might have ultimately arrived at the knowledge of the laws which govern the material world.\"\n\n\"As things are at present conducted,\" he adds, \"a sudden transition is made from sensible objects and particular facts to general propositions, which are accounted principles, and round which, as round so many fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>, disputation and argument continually revolve. From the propositions thus hastily assumed, all things are derived, by a process compendious and precipitate, ill suited to discovery, but wonderfully accommodated to debate. The way that promises success is the reverse of this. It requires that we should generalize slowly, going from particular things to those that are but one step more general; from those to others of still greater extent, and so on to such as are universal. By such means, we may hope to arrive at principles, not vague and obscure, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> and well defined, such as nature herself will not refuse to acknowledge.\"\n\nBefore laying down the rules to be observed in this inductive process, Bacon proceeds to enumerate the causes of error,\u2014the Idols, as he terms them, in his figurative language, or false divinities, to which the mind had so long been accustomed to bow. He considered this enumeration as the more necessary, that the same idols were likely to return, even after the reformation of science, and to avail themselves of the real discoveries that might have been made, for giving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> to their deceptions.\n\nThese idols he divides into four classes, to which he gives names, fantastical, no doubt, but, at the same time, abundantly significant:\n\n| Idola Tribus | Idols of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">Tribe</a> |\n|--------------|-------------------|\n| Specus       | of the Den        |\n| Fori         | of the Forum      |\n| Theatri      | of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEATRE\">Theatre</a>    |\n\n1. The Idols of the Tribe, or of the race, are the causes of error founded on human nature in general, or on principles common to all mankind. \"The mind,\" he observes, \"is not like a plain mirror, which reflects the images of things exactly as they are; it is like a mirror of an uneven surface, which combines its own figure with the figures of the object it represents.\"\u00b9\n\nAmong the idols of this class, we may reckon the propensity which there is in all men to find in nature a greater degree of order, simplicity, and regularity, than is actually indicated by observation. Thus, as soon as men perceived the orbits of the planets to return into themselves, they immediately supposed them to be perfect circles, and the motion in these circles to be uniform; and to these hypotheses, so rashly and gratuitously assumed, the astronomers and mathematicians of all antiquity laboured incessantly to reconcile their observations.\n\nThe propensity which Bacon has here characterized so well, is the same that has been, since his time, known by the name of the spirit of system. The prediction, that the sources of error would return, and were likely to infest science in its most flourishing condition, has been fully verified with respect to this illusion, and in the case of sciences which had no existence at the time when Bacon wrote. When it was ascertained, by observation, that a considerable part of the earth's surface consists of minerals, disposed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> strata, it was immediately concluded, that the whole exterior crust of the earth is composed, or has been composed, of such strata, continued all round without interruption; and on this, as on a certain and general fact, entire theories of the earth have been constructed.\n\nThere is no greater enemy which science has to struggle with than this propensity of the mind; and it is a struggle from which science is never likely to be entirely relieved; because, unfortunately, the illusion is founded on the same principle from which our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of knowledge takes its rise.\n\n2. The Idols of the Den are those that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>\n\n\u00b9 Novum Organum, lib. i. aph. 41.\nfrom the peculiar character of the individual. Besides the causes of error which are common to all mankind, each individual, according to Bacon, has his own dark cavern or den, into which the light is imperfectly admitted, and in the obscurity of which a tutelary idol lurks, at whose shrine the truth is often sacrificed.\n\nOne great and radical distinction in the capacities of men is derived from this, that some minds are best adapted to mark the differences, others to catch the resemblances, of things. Steady and profound understandings are disposed to attend carefully, to proceed slowly, and to examine the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> differences; while those that are sublime and active are ready to lay hold of the slightest resemblances. Each of these easily runs into excess; the one by catching continually at distinctions, the other at affinities.\n\nThe studies, also, to which a man is addicted, have a great effect in influencing his opinions. Bacon complains, that the chemists of his time, from a few experiments with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a> and the crucible, thought that they were furnished with principles sufficient to explain the structure of the universe; and he censures Aristotle for having depraved his Physics so much with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIALECTICS\">Dialectics</a>, as to render the former entirely a science of words and controversy. In like manner, he blames a philosopher of his own age, Gilbert, who had studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a> to good purpose, for having proceeded to form out of it a general system of philosophy. Such things have occurred in every period of science. Thus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> has been applied to explain the motion of the heavenly bodies; and, of late, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GALVANISM\">galvanism</a> and electricity together have been held out as explaining not only the affinities of Chemistry, but the phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>, and the laws of vegetable and animal life. It were a good caution for a man who studies nature, to distrust those things with which he is particularly conversant, and which he is accustomed to contemplate with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>.\n\n3. The Idols of the Forum are those that arise out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> or intercourse of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, and especially from language, or the means by which men communicate their thoughts to one another.\n\nMen believe that their thoughts govern their words; but it also happens, by a certain kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a>, that their words frequently govern their thoughts. This is the more pernicious, that words, being generally the work of the multitude, divide things according to the lines most conspicuous to vulgar apprehensions. Hence, when words are examined, few instances are found in which, if at all abstract, they convey ideas tolerably precise and well defined. For such imperfections there seems to be no remedy, but by having recourse to particular instances, and diligently comparing the meanings of words with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> archetypes from which they are derived.\n\n4. The Idols of the Theatre are the last, and are the deceptions which have taken their rise from the systems or dogmas of the different schools of philosophy. In the opinion of Bacon, as many of these systems as had been invented, so many representations of imaginary worlds had been brought upon the stage. Hence the name of idola theatri. They do not enter the mind imperceptibly, like the other three; a man must labour to acquire them, and they are often the result of great learning and study.\n\n\"Philosophy,\" said he, \"as hitherto pursued, has taken much from a few things, or a little from a great many; and, in both cases, has too narrow a basis to be of much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> or utility.\" The Aristotelian philosophy is of the latter kind; it has taken its principles from common experience, but without due attention to the evidence or the precise nature of the facts; the philosopher is left to work out the rest from his own invention. Of this kind, called by Bacon the sophistical, were almost all the physical systems of antiquity.\n\nWhen philosophy takes all its principles from a few facts, he calls it empirical,\u2014such as was that of Gilbert, and of the chemists.\n\nIt should be observed, that Bacon does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> the Physics of antiquity with being absolutely regardless of experiment. No system, indeed, however fantastical, has ever existed, to which that reproach could be applied in its full extent; because, without some regard to fact, no theory can ever become in the least degree plausible. The fault lies not, therefore, in the\nabsolute rejection of experience, but in the un-\nskilful use of it; in taking up principles lightly\nfrom an inaccurate and careless observation of\nmany things; or, if the observations have been\nmore accurate, from those made on a few facts,\nunwarrantably generalized.\n\nBacon proceeds to point out the circumstances,\nin the history of the world, which had hitherto\nfavoured these perverse modes of philosophizing.\nHe observes, that the periods during which sci-\nence had been cultivated were not many, nor of\nlong duration. They might be reduced to three;\nthe first with the Greeks; the second with the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>; and the third with the western na-\ntions, after the revival of letters. In none of\nall these periods had much attention been paid\nto Natural Philosophy, the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> of the\nsciences.\n\nWith the Greeks, the time was very short\nduring which physical science flourished in any\ndegree. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> Sages, with the exception\nof <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THALES\">Thales</a>, applied themselves entirely to morals\nand politics; and in later times, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>\nhad brought down philosophy from the heavens\nto the earth, the study of nature was generally\nabandoned. In the Roman republic, the know-\nledge most cultivated, as might be expected\namong a martial and ambitious people, was\nsuch as had a direct reference to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAR\">war</a> and poli-\ntics. During the empire, the introduction and\nestablishment of the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> drew the\nattention of men to theological studies, and the\nimportant interests which were then at stake\nleft but a small share of talent and ability to be\noccupied in inferior pursuits. The vast hie-\nrarchy which assumed the command both of\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> and the sceptre, while it occupied\nand enslaved the minds of men, looked with\nsuspicion on sciences which could not easily be\nsubjected to its control.\n\nAt the time, therefore, when Bacon wrote, it\nmight truly be said, that a small portion even\nof the learned ages, and of the abilities of learned\nmen, had been dedicated to the study of Natural\nPhilosophy. This served, in his opinion, to ac-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> for the imperfect state in which he found\nhuman knowledge in general; for he thought it\ncertain, that no part of knowledge could attain\nmuch excellence without having its foundation\nlaid in physical science.\n\nHe goes on to observe, that the end and ob-\nject of knowledge had been very generally mis-\ntaken; that many, instead of seeking through\nit to improve the condition of human life, by\nnew inventions and new resources, had aimed\nonly at popular applause, and had satisfied them-\nselves with the knowledge of words more than\nof things; while others, who were exceptions\nto this rule, had gone still farther wrong, by di-\nrecting their pursuits to objects imaginary and\nunattainable. The alchemists, for example, al-\nternately the dupes of their own credulity and\nof their own imposture, had amazed and tor-\nmented the world with hopes which were never\nto be realized. Others, if possible more vision-\nary, had promised to prolong life, to extinguish\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> and infirmity, and to give man a com-\nmand over the world of spirits, by means of\nmystic incantations. \"All this,\" says he, \"is\nthe mere boasting of ignorance; for, when the\nknowledge of nature shall be rightly pursued, it\nwill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to discoveries that will as far excel the\npretended powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a>, as the real exploits\nof Caesar and Alexander exceed the fabulous\nadventures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, or Amadis of\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>.\"\n\nAgain, the reverence for antiquity, and the\nauthority of great names, have contributed much\nto retard the progress of science. Indeed, the\nnotion of antiquity which men have taken up\nseems to be erroneous and inconsistent. It is\nthe duration of the world, or of the human race,\nas reckoned from the extremity that is past, and\nnot from the point of time which is present, that\nconstitutes the true antiquity to which the ad-\nvancement of science may be conceived to bear\nsome proportion; and just as we expect more\nwisdom and experience in an old than in a\nyoung man, we may expect more knowledge of\nnature from the present than from any of the\nages that are past.\n\n\"It is not to be esteemed a small matter\nin this estimate, that, by the voyages and travels\nof these later times, so much more of nature has\n\n---\n\n1 *Novum Organum*, lib. i. aph. 67.\nbeen discovered than was known at any former period. It would, indeed, be disgraceful to mankind, if, after such tracts of the material world have been laid open, which were unknown in former times,\u2014so many seas traversed,\u2014so many countries explored,\u2014so many stars discovered,\u2014philosophy, or the intelligible world, should be circumscribed by the same boundaries as before.\"\n\nAnother cause has greatly obstructed the progress of philosophy, viz. that men inquire only into the causes of rare, extraordinary, and great phenomena, without troubling themselves about the explanation of such as are common, and make a part of the general course of nature.\\(^1\\) It is, however, certain, that no judgment can be formed concerning the extraordinary and singular phenomena of nature, without comparing them with those that are ordinary and frequent.\n\nThe laws which are every day in action, are those which it is most important for us to understand; and this is well illustrated by what has happened in the scientific world since the time when Bacon wrote. The simple falling of a stone to the ground has been found to involve principles which are the basis of all we know in mechanical philosophy. Without accurate experiments on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of bodies at the surface of the earth, the objections against the earth's motion could not have been answered, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INERTIA\">inertia</a> of body would have remained unknown, and the nature of the force which retains the planets in their orbits could never have been investigated. Nothing, therefore, can be more out of its place than the fastidiousness of those philosophers who suppose things to be unworthy of study, because, with respect to ordinary life, they are trivial and unimportant. It is an error of the same sort which leads men to consider experiment, and the actual application of the hands, as unworthy of them, and unbecoming the dignity of science. \"There are some,\" says Bacon, \"who, delighting in mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>, are offended with our frequent reference to experiments and operations to be performed by the hand, things which appear to them mean and mechanical; but these men do in fact oppose the attainment of the object they profess to pursue, since the exercise of contemplation, and the construction and invention of experiments, are supported on the same principles, and perfected by the same means.\"\\(^2\\)\n\nAfter these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> discussions, the great restorer of philosophy proceeds, in the second book of the *Novum Organum*, to describe and exemplify the nature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDUCTION\">Induction</a>, which he deems essential to the right interpretation of nature.\n\nThe first object must be to prepare a history of the phenomena to be explained, in all their modifications and varieties. This history is to comprehend not only all such facts as spontaneously offer themselves, but all the experiments instituted for the sake of discovery, or for any of the purposes of the useful arts. It ought to be composed with great care; the facts accurately related, and distinctly arranged; their authenticity diligently examined; those that rest on doubtful evidence, though not rejected, being noted as uncertain, with the grounds of the judgment so formed. This last is very necessary; for facts often appear incredible, only because we are ill informed, and cease to appear marvellous, when our knowledge is farther extended.\n\nAll such facts, however, as appear contrary to the ordinary course of our experience, though thus noted down and preserved, must have no weight allowed them in the first steps of investigation, and are to be used only when the general principle, as it emerges from the inductive process, serves to increase their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>.\n\nThis record of facts is what Bacon calls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">Natural History</a>; and it is material to take notice of the comprehensive sense in which that term is understood through all his writings. According to the arrangement of the sciences, which he has explained in his treatise on the *Advancement of Knowledge*, all learning is classed relatively to the three intellectual faculties of Memory, Reason, and Imagination. Under the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Novum Organum*, lib. i. aph. 119.\n\n\\(^2\\) *Impetus Philosophici Opera*, p. 681, Franc. ad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOEN\">Moen</a>. 1665, folia.\nfirst of these divisions is contained all that is merely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NARRATION\">Narration</a>, or History, of whatever kind it may be. Under the second are contained the different sciences, whether they respect the Intellectual or the Material world. Under the third are comprehended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POETRY\">Poetry</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">Fine Arts</a>. It is with the first of these classes only that we are at present concerned. The first two divisions of it are Sacred and Civil History, the meaning of which is sufficiently understood. The third division is Natural History, which comprehends the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the facts relative to inanimate matter, and to all animals, except man. Natural History is again subdivided into three parts: 1. The history of the phenomena of nature, which are uniform; 2. Of the facts which are anomalous or extraordinary; 3. Of the processes in the different arts.\n\nWe are not to wonder at finding the processes of the arts thus enrolled among the materials of Natural History. The powers which act in the processes of nature and in those of art are precisely the same, and are only directed, in the latter case, by the intention of man, toward particular objects. In art, as Bacon elsewhere observes, man does nothing more than bring things nearer to one another, or carry them farther off; the rest is performed by nature, and, on most occasions, by means of which we are quite ignorant.\n\nThus, when a man fires a pistol, he does nothing but make a piece of flint approach a plate of hardened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>, with a certain velocity. It is nature that does the rest;\u2014that makes the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RED\">red</a>-hot and fluid globules of steel, which the flint had struck off, communicate their fire to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, and, by a process but little understood, set loose the elastic fluid contained in it; so that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a> is produced, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> propelled with astonishing velocity. It is obvious that, in this instance, art only gives certain powers of nature a particular direction.\n\nTo the rules which have been given from Bacon, for the composition of Natural History, I may be permitted to add this other,\u2014that theoretical language should, as much as possible, be avoided. Appearances ought to be described in terms which involve no opinion with respect to their causes. These last are the objects of separate examination, and will be best understood if the facts are given fairly, without any dependence on what should yet be considered as unknown. This rule is very essential where the facts are in a certain degree complicated; for it is then much easier to describe with a reference to theory than without it. It is only from a skilful physician that you can expect a description of a disease which is not full of opinions concerning its cause. A similar observation might be made with respect to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>; and with respect to no science more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-GEOLOGY\">geology</a>.\n\nThe natural history of any phenomenon, or class of phenomena, being thus prepared, the next object is, by a comparison of the different facts, to find out the cause of the phenomenon, its form, in the language of Bacon, or its essence. The form of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> in body is something convertible with that quality; that is, where it exists, the quality is present, and where the quality is present, the form must be so likewise. Thus, if transparency in bodies be the thing inquired after, the form of it is something in which, wherever it is found, there is transparency; and, vice versa, wherever there is transparency, that which we have called the form is likewise present.\n\nThe form, then, differs in nothing from the cause; only we apply the word cause where it is event or change that is the effect. When the effect or result is a permanent quality, we speak of the form or essence.\n\nTwo other objects, subordinate to forms, but often essential to the knowledge of them, are also occasionally subjects of investigation. These are the latent process, and the latent schematism; latens processus, et latens schematismus. The former is the secret and invisible progress by which sensible changes are brought about, and seems, in Bacon's acceptation, to involve the principle, since called the law of continuity, according to which, no change, however small, can be effected but in time. To know the relation between the time and the change effected in it, would be to have a perfect knowledge of the latent process. In the firing of a cannon, for example, the succession of events during the short interval between the application of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> and the expulsion of the ball, constitutes\na latent process of a very remarkable and complicated nature, which, however, we can now trace with some degree of accuracy. In mechanical operations, we can often follow this process still more completely. When motion is communicated from any body to another, it is distributed through all the parts of that other, by a law quite beyond the reach of sense to perceive directly, but yet subject to investigation, and determined by a principle which, though late in being discovered, is now generally recognised. The applications of this mechanical principle are perhaps the instances in which a latent, and indeed, a very recondite process, has been most completely analyzed.\n\nThe latent schematism is that invisible structure of bodies, on which so many of their properties depend. When we inquire into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of crystals, or into the internal structure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, &c. we are examining into the latent schematism. We do the same when we attempt to explain elasticity, magnetism, gravitation, &c. by any peculiar structure of bodies, or any arrangement of the particles of matter.\n\nIn order to inquire into the form or cause of anything by induction, having brought together the facts, we are to begin with considering what things are thereby excluded from the number of possible forms. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> is the first part of the process of induction: it confines the field of hypothesis, and brings the true explanation within narrower limits. Thus, if we were inquiring into the quality which is the cause of transparency in bodies; from the fact that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a> is transparent, we immediately exclude rarity or porosity, as well as fluidity, from those causes, the diamond being a very solid and dense body.\n\nNegative instances, or those where the given form is wanting, are also to be collected.\n\nThat glass, when pounded, is not transparent, is a negative fact, and of considerable importance when the form of transparency is inquired into; also, that collections of vapour, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> and fogs, have not transparency, are negative facts of the same kind. The facts thus collected, both affirmative and negative, may, for the sake of reference, be reduced into tables.\n\nBacon exemplifies his method on the subject of Heat; and, though his collection of facts be imperfect, his method of treating them is extremely judicious, and the whole disquisition highly interesting. He here proposes, as an experiment, to try the reflection of the heat of opaque bodies. He mentions also the vitrum calendarum, or thermometer, which was just then coming into use. His reflections, after finishing his enumeration of facts, show how sensible he was of the imperfect state of his own knowledge.\n\nAfter a great number of exclusions have left but a few principles, common to every case, one of these is to be assumed as the cause; and, by reasoning from it synthetically, we are to try if it will account for the phenomena.\n\nSo necessary did this exclusive process appear to Bacon, that he says, \"It may perhaps be competent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a>, or superior intelligences, to determine the form or essence directly, by affirmations from the first consideration of the subject. But it is certainly beyond the power of man, to whom it is only given to proceed at first by negatives, and, in the last place, to end in an affirmative, after the exclusion of everything else.\"\n\nThe method of induction, as laid down here, is to be considered as applicable to all investigations where experience is the guide, whether in the moral or natural world. \"Some may doubt whether we propose to apply our method of investigation to natural philosophy only, or to other sciences, such as logic, ethics, politics. We answer, that we mean it to be so applied. And as the common logic, which proceeds by the syllogism, belongs not only to natural philosophy, but to all the sciences, so our logic, which proceeds by induction, embraces every thing.\"\n\nThough this process had been pursued by a person of much inferior penetration and sagacity to Bacon, he could not but have discovered that all facts, even supposing them truly and accurately recorded, are not of equal value in\nthe discovery of truth. Some of them show the thing sought for in its highest degree, some in its lowest; some exhibit it simple and uncombined, in others it appears confused with a variety of circumstances. Some facts are easily interpreted, others are very obscure, and are understood only in consequence of the light thrown on them by the former. This led our author to consider what he calls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">Prerogative</a> Instantiarum, the comparative value of facts as means of discovery, or as instruments of investigation. He enumerates twenty-seven different species, and enters at some length into the peculiar properties of each. I must content myself, in this sketch, with describing a few of the most important, subjoining, as illustrations, sometimes the examples which the author himself has given, but more frequently such as have been furnished by later discoveries in science.\n\nI. The first place in this classification is assigned to what are called instantiae solitariae, which are either examples of the same quality existing in two bodies which have nothing in common but that quality, or of a quality differing in two bodies which are in all other respects the same. In the first instance, the bodies differ in all things but one; in the second, they agree in all but one. The hypotheses that in either case can be entertained, concerning the cause or form of the said quality, are reduced to a small number; for, in the first, they can involve none of the things in which the bodies differ; and, in the second, none of those in which they agree.\n\nThus, of the cause or form of colour now inquired into, instantiae solitariae are found in crystals, prisms of glass, drops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a>, which occasionally exhibit colour, and yet have nothing in common with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, which possess colour permanently, except the colour itself. Hence Bacon concludes, that colour is nothing else than a modification of the rays of light, produced, in the first case, by the different degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a>; and, in the second, by the texture or constitution of the surfaces of bodies. He may be considered as very fortunate in fixing on these examples; for it was by means of them that Newton afterwards found out the composition of light.\n\nOf the second kind of instantiae solitariae, Bacon mentions the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> or coloured veins which occur in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> or marble, and yet hardly differ in substance or in structure from the ground of the stone. He concludes, very justly, from this, that colour has not much to do with the essential properties of body.\n\nII. The instantiae migrantes exhibit some nature or property of body, passing from one condition to another, either from less to greater, or from greater to less; arriving nearer perfection in the first case, or verging towards extinction in the second.\n\nSuppose the thing inquired into were the cause of whiteness in bodies; an instantia migrans is found in glass, which, when entire, is without colour, but, when pulverized, becomes white. The same is the case with water unbroken, and water dashed into foam. In both cases, the separation into particles produces whiteness. So also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of fluidity to metals by the application of heat, and the destruction of that fluidity by the abstraction of heat, are examples of both kinds of the instantiae migrans. Instances of this kind are very powerful for reducing the cause inquired after into a narrow space, and for removing all the accidental circumstances. It is necessary, however, as Bacon very justly remarks, that we should consider not merely the case when a certain quality is lost, and another produced, but the gradual changes made in those qualities during their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIGRATION\">migration</a>, viz. the increase of the one, and the corresponding diminution of the other. The quantity which changes proportionally to another, is connected with it either as cause and effect, or as a collateral effect of the same cause. When, again, we find two qualities which do not increase proportionally, they afford a negative instance, and assure us that the two are not connected simply as cause and effect.\n\nThe mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> is the great theatre of the instantiae migrantes, where the same nature is seen in all gradations, from the most perfect\nstate, till it become entirely evanescent. Such are the shells which we see so perfect in figure and structure in limestone, and gradually losing themselves in the finer marbles, till they can no longer be distinguished. The use, also, of one such fact to explain or interpret another, is nowhere so well seen as in the history of the mineral kingdom.\n\nIII. In the third place are the *instantiae ostensae*, which Bacon also calls *elucescentiae* and *pr\u00e6dominantes*. They are the facts which show some particular nature in its highest state of power and energy, when it is either freed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPEDIMENTS\">impediments</a> which usually counteract it, or is itself of such force as entirely to repress those impediments. For as every body is susceptible of many different conditions, and has many different forms combined in it, one of them often confines, depresses, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a> another entirely, so that it is not easily distinguished. There are found, however, some subjects in which the nature inquired into is completely displayed, either by the absence of impediments, or by the predominance of its own power.\n\nBacon instances the thermometer, or *vitrum calendare*, as exhibiting the expansive power of heat, in a manner more distinct and measurable than in common cases. To this example, which is well chosen, the present state of science enables us to add many others.\n\nIf the weight of the air were inquired into, the Torricellian experiment, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a>, affords an *ostensive instance*, where the circumstance which conceals the weight of the atmosphere in common cases, namely, the pressure of it in all directions, being entirely removed, that weight produces its full effect, and sustains the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> in the tube. The barometer affords also an example of the *instantia migrans*, when the change is not total, but only partial or progressive. If it be the weight of the air which supports the mercury in the tube of the barometer, when that weight is diminished, the mercury ought to stand lower. On going to the top of a mountain, the weight of the incumbent air is diminished, because a shorter column of air is to be sustained; the mercury in the barometer ought therefore to sink, and it is found to do so accordingly.\n\nThese are instances in which the action of certain principles is rendered visible by the removal of all the opposing forces. One may be given where it is the distinct and decisive nature of the fact which leads to the result.\n\nSuppose it were inquired, whether the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> had ever been covered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. If we look at the stratified form of so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> a portion of the earth's surface, we cannot but conclude it to be very probable that such land was formed at the bottom of the sea. But the decisive proof is afforded by the shells and corals, or bodies having the perfect shape of shells and corals, and of other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> exuviae, which are found imbedded in masses of the most solid rock, and often on the tops of very high mountains. This leaves no doubt of the formation of the land under the sea, though it does not determine whether the land, since its formation, has been elevated to its present height, or the sea depressed to its present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>. The decision of that question requires other facts to be consulted.\n\nIV. The *instantia clandestina*, which is, as it were, opposed to the preceding, and shows some power or quality just as it is beginning to exist, and in its weakest state, is often very useful in the generalization of facts. Bacon also gave to this the fanciful name of *instantia crepusculi*.\n\nAn example of this may be given from hydrostatics. If the suspension of water in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> tubes be inquired into, it becomes very useful to view that effect when it is least, or when the tube ceases to be capillary, and becomes a vessel of a large diameter. The column is then reduced to a slender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of water, which goes all round the vessel; and this, though now so inconsiderable, has the property of being independent of the size of the vessel, so as to be in all cases the same when the materials are the same. As there can be no doubt that this ring proceeds from the attraction of the sides, and of the part immediately above the water, so there can be no doubt that the capillary suspension, in part at least, is derived from the same cause. An effect of the opposite kind takes place when a glass vessel is filled with mercury.\n\nV. Next to these may be placed what are called *instantiae manipulares*, or collective instances,\nthat is, general facts, or such as comprehend a great number of particular cases. As human knowledge can but seldom reach the most general cause or form, such collective instances are often the utmost extent to which our generalization can be carried. They have great value on this account, as they likewise have on account of the assistance which they give to further generalization.\n\nOf this we have a remarkable instance in one of the most important steps ever taken in any part of human knowledge. The laws of Kepler are facts of the kind now treated of, and consist of three general truths, each belonging to the whole planetary system; and it was by means of them that Newton discovered the principle of gravitation. The first is, that the planets all move in elliptical orbits, having the sun for their common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>; the next, that about this focus the radius vector of each planet describes equal areas in equal times; the third and last, that the squares of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERIODIC\">periodic</a> times of the planets are as the cubes of their mean distances from the sun. The knowledge of each of these was the result of much research, and of the comparison of a vast multitude of observations, insomuch that it may be doubted if ever three truths in science were discovered at the expense of so much labour and patience, or with the exertion of more ingenuity and invention in imagining and combining observations. These discoveries were all made before Bacon wrote, but he is silent concerning them; for the want of mathematical knowledge concealed from his view some of the most splendid and interesting parts of science.\n\nAstronomy is full of such collective instances, and affords them, indeed, of the second and third order, that is to say, two or three times generalized. The astronomer observes nothing but that a certain luminous disk, or perhaps merely a luminous point, is in a certain position, in respect of the planes of the meridian and the horizon, at a certain moment of time. By comparing a number of such observations, he finds that this luminous point moves in a certain plane, with a certain velocity, and performs a revolution in a certain time. Thus, the periodic time of a planet is itself a collective fact, or a single fact expressing the result of many hundred observations. This holds with respect to each planet, and with respect to each element, as it is called, of the planet's orbit, every one of which is a general fact, expressing the result of an indefinite number of particulars. This holds still more remarkably of the inferences which extend to the distances of the planet from the earth, or from the sun. The laws of Kepler are therefore collective facts of the second, or even a higher order; or such as comprehend a great number of general facts, each of which is itself a general fact, including many particulars. It is much to the credit of astronomy, that, in all this process, no degree of truth or certainty is sacrificed; and that the same demonstrative evidence is preserved from the lowest to the highest point. Nothing but the use of mathematical reasoning could secure this advantage to any of the sciences.\n\nVI. In the next place may be ranked the instances which Bacon calls analogous, or parallel. These consist of facts, between which an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> or resemblance is visible in some particulars, notwithstanding great diversity in all the rest. Such are the telescope and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>, in the works of art, compared with the eye in the works of nature. This, indeed, is an analogy which goes much beyond the mere exterior; it extends to the internal structure, and to the principle of action, which is the same in the eye and in the telescope,\u2014to the latent schematism, in the language of Bacon, as far as material substance is concerned. It was the experiment of the camera obscura which led to the discovery of the formation of the images of external objects in the bottom of the eye by the action of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRYSTALLINE\">crystalline</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENS\">lens</a>, and the other humours of which the eye is formed.\n\nAmong the instances of conformity, those are the most useful which enable us to compare productions of an unknown formation, with similar productions of which the formation is well understood. Such are basalt, and the other trap rocks, compared with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a> thrown out from volcanoes. They have a structure so exactly similar, that it is hardly possible to doubt that their origin is the same, and that they are both produced by the action of subterraneous fire. There are, however, amid their similarity, some very re-\nmarkable differences in the substances which they contain, the trap rocks containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCAREOUS_SPAR\">calcareous <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SPAR\">spar</a>, and the lava never containing any. On the supposition that they are both of igneous origin, is there any circumstance, in the conditions in which heat may have been applied to them, which can account for this difference? Sir James <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>, in a train of most philosophical and happily-contrived experiments, has explained the nature of those conditions, and has shown that the presence of calcareous spar, or the want of it, may arise from the greater or less compression under which the fusion of the basalt was performed. This has served to explain a great difficulty in the history of the mineral kingdom.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARATIVE_ANATOMY\">Comparative anatomy</a> is full of analogies of this kind, which are most instructive, and useful guides to discovery. It was by remarking in the blood-vessels a contrivance similar to the valves used in hydraulic engines, for preventing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a>-current of a fluid, that Harvey was led to the discovery of the circulation of the blood. The analogies between natural and artificial productions are always highly deserving of notice.\n\nThe facts of this class, however, unless the analogy be very close, are apt to mislead, by representing accidental regularity as if it were constant. Of this we have an example in the supposed analogy between the colours in the prismatic spectrum and the divisions of the monochord. The colours in the prismatic spectrum do not occupy the same proportion of it in all cases; the analogy depends on the particular kind of glass, not on any thing that is common to all refraction. The tendency of man to find more order in things than there actually exists, is here to be cautiously watched over.\n\nVII. Monodic, or singular facts, are the next in order. They comprehend the instances which are particularly distinguished from all those of the genus or species to which they belong. Such is the sun among the stars, the magnet among stones, mercury among metals, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> fountains among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, the elephant among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a>. So also among the planets, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a> is singular from his ring; the new planets are so likewise from their small size, from being extrazodiacal, &c.\n\nConnected with these are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and deviating instances, in which nature seems to depart from her ordinary course. Earthquakes, extraordinary tempests, years of great scarcity, winters of singular severity, &c. are of this number. All such facts ought to be carefully collected; and there should be added an account of all monstrous productions, and of every thing remarkable for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> and its rareness. Here, however, the most severe criticism must be applied; every thing connected with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> is suspicious, as well as whatever relates to alchemy or magic.\n\nA set of facts, which belongs to this class, consists of the instances in which stones have so often of late years been observed to fall from the heavens. Those stones are so unlike other atmospherical productions, and their origin must be so different from that of other minerals, that it is scarcely possible to imagine any thing more anomalous, and more inconsistent with the ordinary course of our experience. Yet the existence of this phenomenon is so well authenticated by testimony, and by the evidence arising from certain physical considerations, that no doubt with respect to it can be entertained, and it must therefore be received, as making a part of the natural history of meteors. But as every fact, or class of facts, which is perfectly singular, must be incapable of explanation, and can only be understood when its resemblance to other things has been discovered; so at present we are unable to assign the cause of these phenomena, and have no right to offer any theory of their origin.\n\nVIII. Another class of facts is composed of what Bacon calls instantiae comitatus, or examples of certain qualities which always accompany one another. Such are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> and heat,\u2014flame being always accompanied by heat, and the same degree of heat in a given substance being always accompanied with flame. So also heat and expansion,\u2014an increase of heat being accompanied with an increase of volume, except in a very few cases, and in circumstances very particular.\n\nThe most perfect instantia comitatus known, as being without any negative, is that of body and weight. Whatever is impenetrable and inert, is also heavy in a degree proportional to\nits inertia. To this there is no exception, though we do not perceive the connection as necessary.\n\nHostile instances, or those of perpetual separation, are the reverse of the former.\n\nExamples of this are found in air, and the other elastic fluids, which cannot have a solid form induced on them by any known means, when not combined with other substances. So also in solids, transparency and malleability are never joined, and appear to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a>, though it is not obvious for what reason.\n\nIX. Passing over several classes which seem of inferior importance, we come to the *instantia crucis*, the division of this experimental logic which is most frequently resorted to in the practice of inductive investigation. When, in such an investigation, the understanding is placed in *equilibrio*, as it were, between two or more causes, each of which accounts equally well for the appearances, as far as they are known, nothing remains to be done but to look out for a fact which can be explained by the one of these causes, and not by the other: if such a one can be found, the uncertainty is removed, and the true cause is determined. Such facts perform the office of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, erected at the separation of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, to direct the traveller which he is to take; and, on this account, Bacon gave them the name of *instantia crucis*.\n\nSuppose that the subject inquired into were the motion of the planets, and that the phenomena which first present themselves, or the motion of these bodies in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>, could be explained equally on the Ptolemaic and the Copernican system, that is, either on the system which makes the earth, or that which makes the sun, the centre of the planetary motions; a cautious philosopher would hesitate about which of the two he should adopt, and notwithstanding that one of them was recommended by its superior simplicity, he might not think himself authorized to give to it a decided preference above the other. If, however, he consider the motion of these bodies in latitude, that is to say, their digressions from the plane of the ecliptic, he will find a set of phenomena which cannot be reconciled with the supposition that the earth is the centre of the planetary motions, but which receive the most simple and satisfactory explanation from supposing that the sun is at rest, and is the centre of those motions. The latter phenomena would therefore serve as *instantia crucis*, by which the superior credibility of the Copernican system was fully evinced.\n\nAnother example which I shall give of an *instantia crucis* is taken from Chemistry, and is, indeed, one of the most remarkable experiments which has been made in that science.\n\nIt is a general fact observed in Chemistry, that metals are always rendered heavier by calcination. When a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of tin or lead, for instance, is calcined in the fire, though every precaution is taken to prevent any addition from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a> of ashes, coals, &c., the absolute weight of the mass is always found to be increased. It was long before the cause of this phenomenon was understood. There might be some heavy substance added, though what it was could not easily be imagined; or some substance might have escaped, which was in its nature light, and possessed a tendency upwards. Other phenomena, into the nature of which it is at present unnecessary to inquire, induced chemists to suppose, that in calcination a certain substance actually escapes, being present in the regulus, but not in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALX\">calx</a> of the metal. This substance, to which they gave the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHLOGISTON\">phlogiston</a>, was probably that which, by its escape, rendered the metal heavier, and must, therefore, be itself endued with absolute levity.\n\nThe *instantia crucis* which extricated philosophers from this difficulty, was furnished by an experiment of the celebrated Lavoisier. That excellent chemist included a quantity of tin in a glass retort, hermetically sealed, and accurately weighed together with its contents; he then applied the necessary heat, and when the calcination of the tin was finished, he found the weight of the whole precisely the same as before. This proved that no substance, which was either light or heavy, in a sensible degree, had made its way through the glass. The experiment went still farther. When the retort was cooled and opened, the air rushed in; so that it was evident that a part of the air had disappeared, or had lost its elasticity. On weighing the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, it was now found that its weight was increased by ten grains; so that ten\ngrains of air had entered into the retort when it was opened. The calx was next taken out, and weighed separately, and it was found to have become heavier by ten grains precisely. The ten grains of air then which had disappeared, and which had made way for the ten grains that rushed into the retort, had combined with the metal during the process of calcination.\n\nThe further prosecution of this very decisive experiment led to the knowledge of that species of air which combines with metals when they are calcined. The doctrine of phlogiston was of course exploded, and a creature of the imagination replaced by a real existence.\n\nThe principle which conduits to the contrivance of an experimentum crucis is not difficult to be understood. Taking either of the hypotheses, its consequences must be attempted to be traced, supposing a different experiment to be made. This must be done with respect to the other hypothesis, and a case will probably at last occur, where the two hypotheses would give different results. The experiment made in those circumstances will furnish an instantia crucis.\n\nThus, if the experiment of calcination be performed in a close vessel, and if phlogiston be the cause of the increase of weight, it must either escape through the vessel, or it must remain in the vessel after separation from the calx. If the former be the case, the apparatus will be increased in weight; if the latter, the phlogiston must make its escape on opening the vessel. If neither of these be the case, it is plain that the theory of phlogiston is insufficient to explain the facts.\n\nThe experimentum crucis is of such weight in matters of induction, that in all those branches of science where it cannot easily be resorted to, (the circumstances of an experiment being out of our power, and incapable of being varied at pleasure) there is often a great want of conclusive evidence. This holds of agriculture, medicine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> economy, &c. To make one experiment, similar to another in all respects but one, is what the experimentum crucis, and, in general, the process of induction, principally requires; but it is what, in the sciences just named, can seldom be accomplished. Hence the great difficulty of separating the causes, and allotting to each its due proportion of the effect.\n\nMen deceive themselves in consequence of this continually, and think they are reasoning from fact and experience, when, in reality, they are only reasoning from a mixture of truth and falsehood. The only end answered by facts so incorrectly apprehended, is that of making error more incorrigible.\n\nOf the twenty-seven classes into which instantiae are arranged by the author of the Novum Organum, fifteen immediately address themselves to the Understanding; five serve to correct or to inform the Senses; and seven to direct the hand in raising the superstructure of Art on the foundation of Science. The examples given above are from the first of these divisions, and will suffice for a summary. To the five that follow next, the general name of instantiae lampadis is given, from their office of assisting or informing the senses.\n\nOf these the instantiae januae assist the immediate action of the senses, and especially of sight. The examples quoted by Bacon are the microscope and telescope, (which last he mentions as the invention of Galileo) and he speaks of them with great admiration, but with some doubt of their reality.\n\nThe instantiae citantes enable us to perceive things which are in themselves insensible, or not at all the objects of perception. They cite or place things, as it were, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of the senses, and from this analogy to judicial proceedings is derived the name of instantiae citantes. Such, to employ examples which the progress of science has unfolded since the time of Bacon, are the air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a> and the barometer for manifesting the weight and elasticity of air; the measurement of the velocity of light, by means of the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter, and the aberration of the fixed stars; the experiments in electricity and galvanism, and in the greater part of pneumatic chemistry. In all these instances things are made known which before had entirely escaped the senses.\n\nThe instantiae viae are facts which manifest the continuous progress of nature in her operations. There is a propensity in men to view nature as it were at intervals, or at the ends of fixed periods, without regarding her gradual and un-\nceasing action. The desire of making observation easy is the great source of this propensity. Men wish for knowledge, but would obtain it at the least expense of time and labour. As there is no time, however, at which the hand of nature ceases to work, there ought to be none at which observation ceases to be made.\n\nThe *instantiae persecantes*, or *vellicantes*, are those which force us to attend to things which, from their subtilty and minuteness, escape common observation.\n\nSome of Bacon's remarks on this subtilty are such as would do credit to the most advanced state of science, and show how much his mind was fitted for distinguishing and observing the great and admirable in the works of nature.\n\nThe last division contains seven classes, of which I mention only two. The experiments of this division are those most immediately tending to produce the improvement of art from the extension of science. \"Now there are,\" says Bacon, \"two ways in which knowledge, even when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> in itself, may fail of becoming a safe guide to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>; and these are either when it is not sufficiently precise, or when it leads to more complicated means of producing an effect than can be employed in practice. There are therefore two kinds of experiments which are of great value in promoting the alliance between knowledge and power;\u2014those which tend to give accurate and exact measures of objects, and those which disencumber the processes deduced from scientific principles, of all unnecessary operations.\"\n\nIn the *instantiae radii* we measure objects by lines and angles; in the *instantiae curriculi*, by time or by motion.\n\nTo the former of these classes are to be referred a number of instruments which now constitute the greater part of the apparatus of Natural Philosophy. Though Bacon had a just idea of their utility in general, he was unacquainted with most of them. The most remarkable at present are those that follow.\n\n1. Astronomical instruments, or, more generally, all instruments for measuring lines and angles.\n\n2. Instruments for measuring weight or force; such are the common balance, the hydrostatic balance, the barometer, the instruments used in England by Cavendish, and in France by Coulomb, which measure small and almost insensible actions by the force of torsion.\n\nThese last rather belong to the class of the *instantiae lactae*, where force is applied as the measure of force, than to the *instantiae radii*.\n\n3. The thermometer, newly invented in the time of Bacon, and mentioned by him under the name of *Vitrum Calendare*, an instrument to which we owe nearly all the knowledge we have of one of the most powerful agents in nature, viz. Heat.\n\n4. The hygrometer, an instrument for measuring the quantity of humidity contained in the air; and in the construction of which, after repeated failures by the most skilful experimenters, the invention of Professor Leslie now promises success. Almost every one of these instruments, to which several more might be added, has brought into sight a new country, and has enriched science not only with new facts, but with new principles.\n\nAmong the remarks of Bacon on the *experimenta radii*, some are very remarkable for the extent of view which they display even in the infancy of physical science. He mentions the forces by which bodies act on one another at a distance, and throws out some hints at the attraction which the heavenly bodies exert on one another.\n\n\"Inquirendum est,\" says he, \"si sit vis aliqua magnetica quae operetur per consensum inter globum terrae et ponderosa, aut inter globum lunae et aquas maris, aut inter celum stellatum et planetas, per quam avocentur et attollantur ad sua apogea; haec omnia operantur ad distantias admodum longinquas.\"\n\nUnder the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the *instantia curriculi*, or the measuring of things by time; after remarking that every change and every motion requires time, and illustrating this by a variety of instances, he has the following very curious anticipation of facts, which appeared then doubtful, but which subsequent discovery has ascertained:\n\n---\n\n1 *Novum Organum*, lib. ii. aph. 41.\n2 Ibid. aph. 45.\n\"The consideration of those things produced in me a doubt altogether astonishing, viz. Whether the face of the serene and starry heavens be seen at the instant it really exists, or not till some time later; and whether there be not, with respect to the heavenly bodies, a true time and an apparent time, no less than a true place and an apparent place, as astronomers say, on account of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a>. For it seems incredible that the species or rays of the celestial bodies can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the immense interval between them and us in an instant, or that they do not even require some considerable portion of time.\"\n\nThe measurement of the velocity of light, and the wonderful consequences arising from it, are the best commentaries on this passage, and the highest eulogy on its author.\n\nSuch were the speculations of Bacon, and the rules he laid down for the conduct of experimental inquiries, before any such inquiries had yet been instituted. The power and compass of a mind which could form such a plan beforehand, and trace not merely the outline, but many of the most minute ramifications, of sciences which did not yet exist, must be an object of admiration to all succeeding ages. He is destined, if indeed any thing in the world be so destined, to remain an instantia singularis among men, and as he has had no rival in the times which are past, so is he likely to have none in those which are to come. Before any parallel to him can be found, not only must a man of the same talents be produced, but he must be placed in the same circumstances; the memory of his predecessor must be effaced, and the light of science, after being entirely extinguished, must be again beginning to revive. If a second Bacon is ever to arise, he must be ignorant of the first.\n\nBacon is often compared with two great men who lived nearly about the same time with himself, and who were both eminent reformers of philosophy, Descartes and Galileo.\n\nDescartes flourished about forty years later than Bacon, but does not seem to have been acquainted with his writings. Like him, however, he was forcibly struck with the defects of the ancient philosophy, and the total inaptitude of the methods which it followed, for all the purposes of physical investigation. Like him, too, he felt himself strongly impelled to undertake the reformation of this erroneous system; but the resemblance between them goes no farther; for it is impossible that two men could pursue the same end by methods more diametrically opposite.\n\nDescartes never proposed to himself anything which had the least resemblance to induction. He began with establishing principles, and from the existence of the Deity and his perfections, he proposed to deduce the explanation of all the phenomena of the world, by reasoning a priori. Instead of proceeding upward from the effect to the cause, he proceeded continually downward from the cause to the effect. It was in this manner that he sought to determine the laws of motion, and of the collision of bodies, in which last all his conclusions were erroneous. From the same source he deduced the existence of a plenum, and the continual preservation of the same quantity of motion in the universe; a proposition which, in a certain sense, is true, but in the sense in which he understood it, is altogether false. Reasonings of the kind which he employed may possibly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a>, as Bacon observed, with intelligences of a higher order than man, but to his case they are quite inapplicable. Of the fruit of this tree nature has forbidden him to eat, and has ordained that, with the sweat of his brow, and the labour of his hands, he should earn his knowledge as well as his subsistence.\n\nDescartes, however, did not reject experiment altogether, though he assigned it a very subordinate place in his philosophy. By reasoning down from first principles, he tells us that he was always able to discover the effects; but the number of different shapes which those effects might assume was so great, that he could not determine, without having recourse to experiment, which of them nature had preferred to the rest. \"We employ experiment,\" says he, \"not as a reason by which any thing is proved, for we wish to deduce effects from their causes, and not conversely causes from their effects. We\n\n---\n\n1 Novum Organum, lib. ii. aph. 46.\nappeal to experience only, that out of innumerable effects which may be produced from the same cause, we may direct our attention to one rather than another.\" It is wonderful, that Descartes did not see what a severe censure he was here passing on himself; of how little value the speculations must be that led to conclusions so vague and indefinite; and how much more philosophy is disgraced by affording an explanation of things which are not, than by not affording an explanation of things which are.\n\nAs a system of philosophy and philosophic investigation, the method of Descartes can, therefore, stand in no comparison with that of Bacon. Yet his Physics contributed to the advancement of science, but did so, much more by that which they demolished, than by that which they built up. In some particular branches the French philosopher far excelled the English. He greatly improved the science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>, and in the pure mathematics, as has been already shown, he left behind him many marks of a great and original genius. He will, therefore, be always numbered among those who have essentially contributed to the advancement of knowledge, though nothing could be more perverse than his method of philosophizing, and nothing more likely to impede the progress of science, had not an impulse been at that time given to the human mind which nothing could resist.\n\nGalileo, the other rival and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> of Bacon, is, in truth, one of those to whom human knowledge is under the greatest obligations. His discoveries in the theory of motion, in the laws of the descent of heavy bodies, and in the motion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROJECTILES\">projectiles</a>, laid the foundation of all the great improvements which have since been made by the application of Mathematics to Natural Philosophy. If to this we add the invention of the telescope, the discoveries made by that instrument, the confirmations of the Copernican system which these discoveries afforded, and, lastly, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and argument with which he combated and exposed the prejudice and presumption of the schools, we must admit that the history of human knowledge contains few greater names than that of Galileo. On comparing him with Bacon, however, I have no hesitation in saying, that the latter has given indications of a genius of a still higher order. In this I know that I differ from a historian who was himself a philosopher, and whose suffrage, of consequence, is here of more than ordinary weight.\n\n\"The great glory of literature,\" says Hume, \"in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, during the reign of James, was Lord Bacon. If we consider the variety of talents displayed by this man, as a public speaker, a man of business, a wit, a courtier, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, an author, a philosopher, he is justly entitled to great admiration. If we consider him merely as an author and a philosopher, the light in which we view him at present, though very estimable, he was yet inferior to his contemporary Galileo, perhaps even to Kepler. Bacon pointed out, at a distance, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to philosophy; Galileo both pointed it out to others, and made himself considerable advances in it. The Englishman was ignorant of geometry; the Florentine revived that science, excelled in it, and was the first who applied it, together with experiment, to natural philosophy. The former rejected, with the most positive disdain, the system of Copernicus; the latter fortified it with new proofs, derived both from reason and the senses. Bacon's style is stiff and rigid; his wit, though often brilliant, is also often unnatural and far-fetched. Galileo is a lively and agreeable, though somewhat a prolix writer.\"\n\nThough it cannot be denied that there is considerable truth in these remarks, yet it seems to me that the comparison is not made with the justness and discrimination which might have been expected from Hume, who appears studiously to have contrasted what is most excellent in Galileo with what is most defective in Bacon. It is true that Galileo showed the way in the application of mathematics and of geometry to physical investigation, and that the immediate utility of his performance was greater than that of Bacon's, as it impressed more movement on the age in which he lived, example being always so much more powerful than precept. Bacon, indeed, wrote for an age more enlightened than\n\n---\n\n1 History of England, vol. VI. Appendix.\nhis own, and it was long before the full merit of his work was understood. But though Galileo was a geometer, and Bacon unacquainted with the mathematics,\u2014though Galileo added new proofs to the system of the earth's motion, which Bacon rejected altogether,\u2014yet is it certain, I think, that the former has more fellows or equals in the world of science than the latter, and that his excellence, though so high, is less unrivalled. The range which Bacon's speculations embraced was altogether immense. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> a penetrating eye on the whole of science, from its feeblest and most infantine state, to that strength and perfection from which it was then so remote, and which it is perhaps destined to approach to continually, but never to attain. More substitutes might be found for Galileo than for Bacon. More than one could be mentioned, who, in the place of the former, would probably have done what he did; but the history of human knowledge points out nobody of whom it can be said, that, placed in the situation of Bacon, he would have done what Bacon did\u2014no man whose prophetic genius would have enabled him to delineate a system of science which had not yet begun to exist\u2014who could have derived the knowledge of what ought to be from what was not, and who could have become so rich in wisdom, though he received from his predecessors no inheritance but their errors. I am inclined, therefore, to agree with D'Alembert, \"that when one considers the sound and enlarged views of this great man, the multitude of the objects to which his mind was turned, and the boldness of his style, which unites the most sublime images with the most rigorous precision, one is disposed to regard him as the greatest, the most universal, and the most eloquent of philosophers.\"\n\n3. REMARKS, &c.\n\nIt will hardly be doubted by any one who attentively considers the method explained in the Novum Organum, which we have now attempted to sketch, that it contains a most comprehensive and rigorous plan of inductive investigation. A question, however, may occur, How far has this method been really carried into practice by those who have made the great discoveries in Natural Philosophy, and who have raised physical science to its present height in the scale of human knowledge? Is the whole method necessary, or have not circumstances occurred, which have rendered experimental investigation easier in practice than it appears to be in theory? To answer these questions completely, would require more discussion than is consistent with the limits of this Dissertation: I shall, therefore, attempt no more than to point out the principles on which such an answer may be founded.\n\nIn a very extensive department of physical science, it cannot be doubted that investigation has been carried on, not perhaps more easily, but with a less frequent appeal to experience, than the rules of the Novum Organum would seem to require. In all the physical inquiries where mathematical reasoning has been employed, after a few principles have been established by experience, a vast multitude of truths, equally certain with the principles themselves, have been deduced from them by the mere application of geometry and algebra.\n\nIn mechanics, for example, after the laws of motion were discovered, which was done by experiment, the rest of the science, to a great extent, was carried on by reasoning from those laws, in the same manner that the geometer makes his discoveries by reasoning on the definitions, by help of a few axioms, or self-evident propositions. The only difference is, that, in the one case, the definitions and axioms are supplied solely from the mind itself; while, in the other, all the definitions and axioms which are not those of pure geometry, are furnished by experience.\n\nBacon certainly was not fully aware of the advantages that were thus to accrue to the physical sciences. He was not ignorant, that the introduction of mathematical reasoning into those sciences is not only possible, but that, un-\n\n---\n\n1 Discours Pr\u00e9liminaire de l'Encyclop\u00e9die.\n2 The part of Mechanics which involves only statical considerations, or the equilibrium of forces, is capable of being treated by reasoning a priori entirely, without any appeal to experience. This will appear, when the subject of Mechanics is more particularly treated of.\nder certain conditions, it may be attended with the greatest advantage. He knew also in what manner this application had been abused by the Platonists, who had attempted, by means of geometry, to establish the first principles of Physics, or had used them, in axiomatis constitutio, which is exactly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> belonging exclusively to experience. At the same time, he pointed out, with great precision, the place which the Mathematics may legitimately occupy, as serving to measure and compare the objects of physical inquiry. He did not, however, perceive beforehand, nor was it possible that he should, the vast extent to which the application of that science was capable of being carried. In the book De Augmentis, he has made many excellent remarks on this subject, full of the sagacity which penetrated so far into futurity, but, nevertheless, could only perceive a small part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> which the genius of Newton was afterwards to unfold.\n\nHence, the route which leads to many of the richest and most fertile fields of science, is not precisely that which Bacon pointed out; it is safer and easier; so that the voyager finds he can trust to his chart and compass alone, without constantly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> out, or having the sounding-line perpetually in his hand.\n\nAnother remark I must make on Bacon's method is, that it does not give sufficient importance to the instantiae radii, or those which furnish us with accurate measures of physical quantities. The experiments of this class are introduced as only subservient to practice; they are, however, of infinite value in the theoretical part of induction, or for ascertaining the causes and essences of the things inquired into. We have an instance of this in the discovery of that important truth in physical astronomy, that the moon is retained in her orbit by the force of gravity, or the same which, at the earth's surface, makes a stone fall to the ground. This proposition, however it might have been suspected to be true, could never have been demonstrated but by such observations and experiments as assigned accurate geometrical measures to the quantities compared. The semidiameter of the earth; the velocity of falling bodies at the earth's surface; the distance of the moon, and her velocity in her orbit\u2014all these four elements must have been determined with great precision, and afterwards compared together by certain theorems deduced from the laws of motion, before the relation between the force which retains the moon in her orbit, and that which draws a stone to the ground, could possibly be discovered. The discovery also, when made, carried with it the evidence of demonstration; so that here, as in many other cases, the instantiae radii are of the utmost importance in the theoretical part of Physics.\n\nAnother thing to be observed is, that, in many cases, the result of a number of particular facts, or the collective instance arising from them, can only be found out by geometry, which, therefore, becomes a necessary instrument in completing the work of induction. An example, which the science of optics furnishes, will make this clearer than any general description. When light passes from one transparent medium to another, it is refracted, that is, it ceases to go on in a straight line, and the angle which the incident ray makes with the superficies which bounds the two media, determines that which the refracted ray makes with the same superficies. Now, if we would learn anything about the relation which these angles bear to one another, we must have recourse to experiment; and all that experiment can do is, for any particular angle of incidence, to determine the corresponding angle of refraction. This may be done in innumerable cases; but, with respect to the general rule which, in every possible case, determines the one of those angles from the other, or expresses the constant and invariable relation which subsists between them,\u2014with respect to it, experiment gives no direct information. The methods of geometry must therefore be called in to our assistance, which, when a constant though unknown relation subsists between two angles, or two variable quantities of any kind, and when an indefinite number of values of those quantities are given, furnishes infallible means of discovering that unknown relation, either accurately, or at least by approximation. In this way it has been found, that, when the two media remain the same, the cosines of the angles above mentioned have a constant ratio to one another. Thus\nit appears, that, after experiment has done its utmost, geometry must be applied before the business of induction can be completed. This can only happen when the experiments afford accurate measures of the quantities concerned, like the *instantiae radii*, *curricula*, &c.; and this advantage of admitting generalization with so much certainty is one of their properties, of which it does not appear that even Bacon himself was aware.\n\nAgain, from the intimate connection which prevails among the principles of science, the success of one investigation must often contribute to the success of another, in such a degree as to make it unnecessary to employ the complete apparatus of induction from the beginning. When certain leading principles have been once established, they serve, in new investigations, to narrow the limits within which the thing sought for is contained, and enable the inquirer to arrive more speedily at the truth.\n\nThus, suppose that, after the nature of the reflection and refraction of light; and particularly of the colours produced by the latter, had been discovered by experiment, the cause of the rainbow were to be inquired into. It would, after a little consideration, appear probable, that the phenomenon to be explained depends on the reflection and refraction of light by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> falling from a cloud opposite to the sun. Now, since the nature of reflection and refraction are supposed known, we have the principles previously ascertained which are likely to assist in the explanation of the rainbow. We have no occasion, therefore, to enter on the inquiry, as if the powers to be investigated were wholly unknown. It is the combination of them only which is unknown, and our business is to seek so to combine them, that the result may correspond with the appearances. This last is precisely what Newton accomplished, when, by deducing from the known laws of refraction and reflection the breadth of the coloured arch, the diameter of the circle of which it is a part, and the relation of the latter to the place of the spectator and of the sun, he found all these to come out from his calculus, just as they are observed in nature. Thus he proved the truth of his solution by the most clear and irresistible evidence.\n\nThe strict method of Bacon is therefore only necessary where the thing to be explained is new, and where we have no knowledge, or next to none, of the powers employed. This is but rarely the case, at least in some of the branches of Physics; and, therefore, it occurs most commonly in actual investigation, that the inquirer finds himself limited, almost from the first outset, to two or three hypotheses, all other suppositions involving inconsistencies which cannot for a moment be admitted. His business, therefore, is to compare the results of these hypotheses, and to consider what consequences may in any case arise from the one that would not arise from the other. If any such difference can be found, and if the matter is a subject of experiment, we have then an *instantia crucis* which must decide the question.\n\nThus, the *instantia crucis* comes in real practice to be the experiment most frequently appealed to, and that from which the most valuable information is derived.\n\nIn executing the method here referred to, the application of much reasoning, and frequently of much mathematical reasoning, is necessary, before any appeal to the experiment can be made, in order to deduce from each of the hypotheses an exact estimate of the consequences to which it leads. Suppose, for instance, that the law by which the magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> decreases in its intensity, as we recede from its poles, were to be inquired into. It is obvious that the number of hypotheses is here indefinite; and that we have hardly any choice but to begin with the simplest, or with that which is most analogous to the law of other forces propagated from a centre. Whatever law we assume, we must enter into a good deal of geometric reasoning, before a conclusion can be obtained, capable of being brought to the test of experience. The force itself, like all other forces, is not directly perceived, and its effects are not the result of its mere intensity, but of that intensity combined with the figure and magnitude of the body on which it acts; and, therefore, the calculus must be employed to express the measure of the effect, in terms of the intensity and the distance only. This being done, the hypothesis which gives results most nearly corresponding to the facts observed, when the mag-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NET\">net</a> acts on the same body, at different distances, must be taken as the nearest approximation to the truth. We have here an instance of the use of hypothesis in inductive investigation, and, indeed, of the only legitimate use to which it can ever be applied.\n\nIt also appears that Bacon placed the ultimate object of philosophy too high, and too much out of the reach of man, even when his exertions are most skilfully conducted. He seems to have thought, that, by giving a proper direction to our researches, and carrying them on according to the inductive method, we should arrive at the knowledge of the essences of the powers and qualities residing in bodies; that we should, for instance, become acquainted with the essence of heat, of cold, of colour, of transparency. The fact however is, that, in as far as science has yet advanced, no one essence has been discovered, either as to matter in general, or as to any of its more extensive modifications. We are yet in doubt, whether heat is a peculiar motion of the minute parts of bodies, as Bacon himself conceived it to be; or something emitted or radiated from their surfaces; or lastly, the vibrations of an elastic medium, by which they are penetrated and surrounded. Yet whatever be the form or essence of heat, we have discovered a great number of its properties and its laws; and have done so, by pursuing with more or less accuracy the method of induction. We have also this consolation for the imperfection of our theoretical knowledge, that, in as much as art is concerned, or the possession of power over heat, we have perhaps all the advantages that could be obtained from a complete knowledge of its essence.\n\nAn equal degree of mystery hangs over the other properties and modifications of body; light, electricity, magnetism, elasticity, gravity, are all in the same circumstances; and the only advance that philosophy has made toward the discovery of the essences of these qualities or substances is, by exploding some theories, rather than by establishing any,\u2014so true is Bacon's maxim, that the first steps in philosophy necessarily consist in negative propositions. Besides this, in all the above instances the laws of action have been ascertained; the phenomena have been reduced to a few general facts, and in some cases, as in that of gravity, to one only; and for aught that yet appears, this is the highest point which our science is destined to reach.\n\nIn consequence of supposing a greater perfection in knowledge than is ever likely to be attained, Bacon appears, in some respects, to have misapprehended the way in which it is ultimately to become applicable to art. He conceives that, if the form of any quality were known, we should be able, by inducing that form on any body, to communicate to it the said quality. It is not probable, however, that this would often lead to a more easy and simple process than that which art has already invented. In the case of colour, for example, though ignorant of its form, or of the construction of surface which enables bodies to reflect only light of a particular species, yet we know how to communicate that power from one body to another. Nor is it likely, though this structure were known with ever so great precision, that we should be able to impart it to bodies by any means so simple and easy, as by the common process of immersing them in a liquid of a given colour.\n\nIn some instances, however, the theories of Chemistry have led to improvements of art very conformable to the anticipations of the Novum Organum. A remarkable instance of this occurs in the process for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLEACHING\">bleaching</a>, invented by Berthollet. It had been for some time known, that the combination of the chemical principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> with the colouring matter in bodies, destroyed or discharged the colour; and that, in the common process of bleaching, it was chiefly by the union of the oxygen of the air with the colouring matter in the cloth that this effect was produced. The excellent chemist just named conceived, therefore, that if the oxygen could be presented to the cloth in a dense state, and, at the same time, feebly combined with any other body, it might unite itself to the colouring matter so readily, that the process of bleaching would by that means be greatly accelerated. His skill in Chemistry suggested to him a way in which this might easily be done, by immersing the cloth in a liquid containing much oxygen in a loose state, or one in which it was\nslightly combined with other substances; and the effect followed so exactly, that he was able to perform in a few hours what required weeks, and even months, according to the common process. This improvement, therefore, was a real gift from the sciences to the arts; and came nearly, though not altogether, up to the ideas of Bacon. I suspect not altogether, because the manner in which oxygen destroys the colour of bodies, or alters the structure of their surfaces, remains quite unknown.\n\nIt was natural, however, that Bacon, who studied these subjects theoretically, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> nowhere any practical result in which he could confide, should listen to the inspirations of his own genius, and ascribe to philosophy a perfection which it may be destined never to attain. He knew, that from what it had not yet done, he could conclude nothing against what it might hereafter accomplish. But after his method has been followed, as it has now been, with greater or less accuracy, for more than two hundred years, circumstances are greatly changed, and the impediments which, during all that time, have not yielded in the least to any effort, are perhaps never likely to be removed. This may, however, be a rash inference; Bacon, after all, may be in the right; and we may be judging under the influence of the vulgar prejudice, which has convinced men in every age, that they had nearly reached the farthest verge of human knowledge. This must be left for the decision of posterity; and we should rejoice to think, that judgment will hereafter be given against the opinion which at this moment appears most probable.","sp":558,"ep":598},{"h":"NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">NOTE</a> A, p. 321.\n\nThe remarks of Cicero on the Stoicism of Cato are perhaps the most perfect specimen of that refined raillery which attains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of the orator without general injustice to the person whose authority is for the moment to be abated.\n\n\"Accessit his doctrina non moderata, nec mitis, sed, ut mihi videtur, paulo asperior et durior quam aut veritas aut natura patiatur.\" After an enumeration of the Stoical paradoxes, he adds: \"Hec homo ingeniosissimus M.

One step more would have led him to acknowledge that all erroneous judgment is involuntary, and there-\nfore inculpable and unpunishable, however pernicious.\n\nHis attempt to reconcile foreknowledge with contingency (V. 1300\u20131327), is a remarkable example of the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> subtlety to keep up the appearance of a struggle where it is impossible to make one real effort.\n\nBut the most dangerous of all the deviations of Scotus from the system of Aquinas is, that he opened the way to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the distinction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and wrong depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> will of the Eternal Mind. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> power of the Deity, according to him, extends to all but contradictions. His regular power (ordinata) is exercised conformably to an order established by himself; \"si placet voluntati, sub qua <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERA\">libera</a> est, recta est lex.\" (Scot. V. 1368, et seq.)\n\nNote E, p. 325.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> is quoted on this subject by Marcus Aurelius, in a manner which shows, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> there had been any doubt, the meaning to be, that all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> is involuntary.\n\nEvery mind is unwillingly led from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>.\n\nAugustin closes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> line of ancient testimony to the involuntary character of error: \"Quis est qui velit decipi? Fallere nolunt bo-ni; falli autem nec boni volunt nec mali.\" (Aug. Serm. de Verbo.)\n\nNote F, p. 326.\n\nFrom a long, able, and instructive dissertation by the commentator on Scotus, it appears that this immoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOGMA\">dogma</a> was propounded in terms more bold and startling by Ockham, who openly affirmed, that \"moral evil was only evil because it was prohibited.\" \"Ockhamus, qui putat quod nihil posset esse malum sine voluntate prohibitiva Dei, hancque voluntatem esse liberam; sic ut posset <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAM\">cam</a> non habere, et consequenter ut posset fieri quod nul-la prorsus essent mala.\" (Scot. VII. p. 859.) But, says the commentator, \"Dico primo legem naturalem non consistere in jussione ulla qua sit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTUS\">actus</a> voluntatis Dei. Haec est communissima theologorum sententia.\" (Scot. VII. p. 858.) And indeed the reason urged against Ockham completely justifies this approach to unanimity. \"For,\" he asks, \"why is it right to obey the will of God? Is it because our moral faculties perceive it to be right? But they equally perceive and feel the authority of all the primary principles of morality; and if this answer be made, it is obvious that those who make it do in effect admit the independence of moral distinctions on the will of God.\"\n\n\"If God,\" said Ockham, \"had commanded his creatures to hate himself, hatred of God would have been praiseworthy.\" (Domin. Soto de Justitia et Jure, lib. ii. quest. 3, \"Utrum precepta Decalogi sint dispensabilia;\" a book dedicated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Carlos, the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> II.) Suarez, the last scholastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, rejected the Ockhamical doctrine, but allowed will to be a part of the foundation of morality. \"Voluntas Dei non est tota ratio bonitatis aut maliitiae.\" (Suarez de Legibus, lib. ii. 66, p. 71. edit. Lond. 1679.)\n\nAs the great majority of the Schoolmen supported their opinion of this subject by the consideration of eternal and immutable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of right and wrong in the divine intellect, it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> that the Nominalists, of whom Ockham was the founder, who rejected all general ideas, should also have rejected those moral distinctions which were then supposed to originate in such ideas. Gerson was a celebrated Nominalist; and he was the more disposed to follow the opinions of his master, because they agreed in maintaining the independence of the State on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a>, and the superiority of the Church over the Pope.\n\nNote G, p. 326.\n\nIt must be premised that Charitas among the ancient divines corresponded with \u0395\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 of the Platonists, and with the \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 of later philosophers, as comprehending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of all that is lovable in the Creator or his creatures. It is the theological <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>, and corre-\nsponds with no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> moralists. \"Cum objectum amoris sit bonum, dupliciter potest aliquis tendere in bonum aliquius rei; uno modo, quod bonum illius rei ad alterum referat, sicut amat quis vinum in quantum dulcedinem vini peroptat; et hic amor vocatur a quibusdam amor concupiscentiae. Amor autem iste non terminatur ad rem qua dicitur amari, sed reflectitur ad rem illam cui optatur bonum illius rei. Alio modo amor fortior in bonum aliquius rei, ita quod ad rem ipsam TERMINATUR; et hic est amor benevolentiae. Qua bonum nostrum in Deo perfectum est, sicut in causa universali bonorum; ideo bonum in ipso esse magis naturaliter complacet quam in nobis ipsis: et ideo etiam amore amicitiae naturaliter Deus ab homine plus seipso dilitur.\"\n\nThe above quotations from Aquinas will probably be sufficient for those who are acquainted with these questions, and they will certainly be thought too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> by those who are not. In the next question he inquires, whether in the love of God there can be any view to reward. He appears to consider himself as bound by authority to answer in the affirmative; and he employs much ingenuity in reconciling a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of reward with the disinterested character ascribed by him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with all the affections which terminate in other beings.\n\n\"Nihil aliud est merces nostra quam perfrii Deo. Ergo charitas non solum non excludit, sed etiam facit habere oculum ad mercedem.\" In this answer he seems to have anticipated the representations of Jeremy Taylor (Sermon on Growth in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">Grace</a>); of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SHAFTESBURY\">Shaftesbury</a> (Inquiry concerning Virtue, book i. part iii. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. 3); of Mr T. Erskine (Freeness of the Gospel, Edinb. 1828); and more especially of Mr John Smith (Discourses, Lond. 1660). No extracts could convey a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the observations which follow, unless they were accompanied by a longer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the technical language of the Schoolmen than would be warranted on this occasion. It is clear that he distinguishes well the affection of piety from the happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, which, as he cautiously expresses it, \"are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of a reward,\" just as the consideration of the pleasures and advantages of friendship may enter into the affection and strengthen it, though they are not its objects, and never could inspire such a feeling. It seems to me also that he had a dimmer view of another doctrine, by which we are taught, that though our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> be not the end which we pursue in loving others, yet it may be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> cause of the insertion of disinterested affections into the nature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. \"Ponere mercedem aliquam finem amoris ex parte amati, est contra rationem amicitiae. Sed ponere mercedem esse finem amoris ex parte amantis, non tamen ultimum, prout scilicet ipse amor est quaedam operatio amantis, non est contra rationem amicitiae. Possum operationem amoris amare propter aliquid aliud, salva amicitia. Potest habecas charitatem habere oculum ad mercedem, uti ponat beatitudinem creatam finem amoris, non autem finem amati.\" Upon the last words my interpretation chiefly depends. The immediately preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> must be owned to have been founded on a distinction between viewing the good fruits of our own affections as enhancing their intrinsic pleasures, and feeling love for another on account of the advantage to be derived from him; which last is inconceivable.\n\nNote H, p. 326.\n\n\"Potestas spiritualis et secularis utraque deducitur a potestate divina; ideo in tantum secularis est sub spirituali, in quantum est a Deo supposita; scilicet, in his quae ad salutem animae pertinent. In his autem quae ad bonum civile spectant, est magis obediendum potestati seculari; sicut illud Matthaei, 'Reddite quae sunt Caesaris Caesaris.' What follows is more doubtful. \"Nisi forte potestati spirituali etiam potestas secularis conjungatur, ut in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PAPA\">Papa</a>, qui utrinque potestatis apicem tenet.\" (VIII. 435.) Here, says the French editor, it may be doubted whether Aquinas means the Pope's temporal power in his own dominions, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> authority indirectly extending over all for the sake of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. My reasons for adopting the more rational <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> are shortly these:\u20141. The text of Matthew is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> an assertion of the independence of both powers, that it would be the height of extravagance to quote it as an authority for the dependence of the state. At\nmost it could only be represented as reconcilable with such a dependence in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>.\n\n2. The word *forte* seems manifestly to refer to the territorial sovereignty acquired by the Popes. If they have a general power in secular affairs, it must be because it is necessary to their spiritual authority; and in that case to call it fortuitous would be to ascribe to it an adjunct destructive of its nature. 3. His former reasoning on the same question seems to be decisive. The power of the Pope over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, he says, is not founded merely in his superior nature, but in their authority being altogether derived from his, as the proconsular power from the imperial. Therefore he infers that this case is not analogous to the relation between the civil and spiritual power, which are alike derived from God. 4. Had an Italian monk of the twelfth century really intended to affirm the Pope's temporal authority, he probably would have laid it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in terms more explicit and more acceptable at Rome. Hesitation and ambiguity are here indications of unbelief. Mere veneration for the apostolical see might present a more precise determination against it, as it caused the quotation which follows, respecting the primacy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>. (*Aquinas Opera*, VIII. 434, 435.)\n\nA mere abridgement of these very curious passages might excite a suspicion that I had tinctured Aquinas unconsciously with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of my own opinions. Extracts are very difficult, from the scholastic method of stating objections and answers, as well as from the mixture of theological authorities with philosophical reasons.\n\n**Note I**, p. 328.\n\nThe debates in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a> (1546), between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOMINICANS\">Dominicans</a> who adhered to Aquinas, and the Franciscans who followed Scotus on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> sin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a>, and grace, are to be found in Fra Paolo, *Istoria del Concilio Tridentino*, lib. ii. They show how much metaphysical controversy is hid in a theological form, how many disputes of our times are of no very ancient origin, and how strongly the whole western church, through all the divisions into which it has been separated, has manifested the same unwillingness to avow the Augustinian system, and the same fear of contradicting it. To his admirably clear and short statement of these abstruse controversies, must be added that of his accomplished opponent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Pallavicino (lib. vii. and viii.), who shows still more evidently the strength of the Augustinian party, and the disposition of the Council to tolerate opinions almost Lutheran, if not accompanied by revolt from the Church. A little more compromising disposition in the Reformers might have betrayed reason to a prolonged thraldom. We must esteem Erasmus and Melanchthon, but we should reserve our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a> and Calvin. The Scotists maintained their doctrine of merit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONGRUITY\">congruity</a>, waived by the Council, and soon after condemned by the Church of England; by which they meant that they who had good dispositions always received the divine grace, not indeed as a reward of which they were worthy, but as aid which they were fit and willing to receive. The Franciscans denied that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> was in the power of man. \"I Francescani lo negavano seguendo Scoeto, qual vnole che siccome dalle dimostrazioni per necessit\u00e0 nasce la scienza, cosi dalle persuasioni nasce la fede; e ch'essa \u00e8 nell'intelletto, il quale \u00e8 agente naturale, e mosso naturalmente dall'oggetto. Allegavano l'esperienza, che nessuno pu\u00f2 credere che vuole, ma quello che gli par vero.\" (Fra Paolo, *Istoria del Concilio Tridentino*, I. 193. edit. Helmstadt, 1763, 4to.)\n\nCardinal Sforza Pallavicino, a learned and very able Jesuit, was appointed, according to his own account, in 1651, many years after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Fra Paolo, to write a true history of the Council of Trent, as a corrective of the misrepresentations of the celebrated Venetian. Algernon Sidney, who knew this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COURT\">court</a> historian at Rome, and who may be believed when he speaks well of a Jesuit and a Cardinal, commends the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to his father, Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a>. At the end of Pallavicino's work is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of three hundred and sixty errors in matters of fact, which the Papal party pretend to have detected in the independent historian, whom they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a>, and, in either case, with hypocrisy.\nNOTE K, p. 330.\n\n\"Hoc tempore, Ferdinando et Isabella regnantibus, in academia Salmantina jacta sunt robustioris theologiae semina; ingentis enim famae vir Franciscus de Victoria, non tam lucubrationibus editis, quamvis haec non magne molis at magni pretii sint, sed doctissimorum theologorum educatione, quando fuisset sacre scientiae honos inter mortales, vehementer laudabatur.\" (Antonii Bibl.

In his book De Justis Belli Causis contra Indos suscepti, he contended only that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-KING\">king</a> might justly \"ad ditionem Indos, non herilem sed regiam et civilem, lege belli redigere.\" (Antonius in voce Sepulveda: Bibl. Hisp. Nova, tom. i. p. 703.)\n\nBut this smooth and specious language covered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>. Had it entirely prevailed, the cruel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the defeat of the advocate of the oppressed would alone have remained; the limitations and softenings employed by their opponent to obtain success would have been speedily disregarded and forgotten.\n\nCovarruvias, another eminent Jurist, was sent by Philip II. to the Council of Trent, at its renewal in 1560, and, with Cardinal Buoncompagni, drew up the decrees of reformation.

What is called Sublapsarian Calvinism,\nwhich was the doctrine of the most eminent\nmen, including Augustin and Calvin himself,\nascribed to God, and to man before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, what\nis called free-will, which they even own still to\nexist in all the ordinary acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, though it\nbe lost with respect to religious morality. The\ndecree of election, on this scheme, arises from\nGod's foreknowledge that man was to fall, and\nthat all men became thereby with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> liable\nto eternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. The election of some to\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of divine goodness, and the\npreterition of the rest was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> and justice.\n\nThis sublapsarian predestination is evidently irreconcilable with the doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, which considers free-will, or volitions not caused by motives, as absolutely inconsistent with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of an intelligent being; which is, that he acts from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a>, or, in other words, with a purpose.\n\nThe supralapsarian scheme, which represents the fall itself as fore-ordained, may indeed be built on necessitarian principles. But on that scheme original sin seems wholly to lose that importance which the former system gives it as a revolution in the state of the world, requiring an interposition of divine power to remedy a part of its fatal effects. It becomes no more than the first link in the chain of predestined offences. Yet both Catholic and Protestant predestinarians have borrowed the arguments and distinctions of philosophical necessitarians. One of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> of Jansenius, condemned by the bull of Innocent X. in 1653, is, that \"to merit or demerit in a state of lapsed nature, it is not necessary that there should be in man a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> free from necessity; it is sufficient that there be a liberty free from constraint.\" (Dupin, Histoire de l'Eglise en abr\u00e9g\u00e9, si\u00e8cle xvii, livre iv, chap.viii, p. 193.) Luther, in his once famous treatise de Servo Arbitrio against Erasmus (printed in 1526), expresses himself as follows: \"Hic est fidei summus gradus, credere illum esse elementem qui tam paucos salvat, tam multos damnat; credere justum qui sua voluntate nos necessario damnabiles facit, ut videatur, ut Erasmus refert, delectari cruciatibus miserorum, et odio potius quam amore dignus.\" My <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of this stern and abusive book is not paged. In another passage, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a> the distinction between co-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> and necessity as familiar a hundred and thirty years before it was proposed by Hobbes, or condemned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANSENISTS\">Jansenists</a>. \"Necessario dico, non coacte, sed, ut illi dicunt, necessitate immutabilitatis, non coactionis; hoc est, homo, cum vocat Spiritus Dei, non quidem violentia, velut raptus obtorto collo, nolens facit malum, quemadmodum fur aut latro nolens ad poenam ducitur, sed sponte et libera voluntate facit.\" He uses also the illustration of Hobbes, from the difference between a stream forced out of its course and freely flowing in its channel.\n\nNote P, p. 368.\n\nThough some parts of the substance of the following letter have already appeared in various forms, perhaps the account of Mr Hume's illness, in the words of his friend and physician Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>, will be acceptable to many readers. I owe it to the kindness of Mrs Baillie, who had the goodness to copy it from the original, in the collection of her late learned and excellent husband, Dr Baillie. Some portion of what has been formerly published I do not think it necessary to reprint.\n\nFrom Dr Cullen to Dr Hunter.\n\n\"My Dear Friend,\u2014I was favoured with yours by Mr Halket on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a>, and have answered some part of it by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> whom I was otherwise obliged to write by; but as I was not certain how soon that might come to your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, I did not answer your postscript; in doing which, if I can oblige you, a part of the merit must be that of the information being early, and I therefore give it you as soon as I possibly could. You desire an account of Mr Hume's last days, and I give it you with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; for though I could not look upon him in his illness without much concern, yet the tranquillity and pleasantry which he constantly discovered did even then give me satisfaction, and, now that the curtain is dropped, allows me to indulge the less alloyed reflection. He was truly an example des grands hommes qui sont morts en plaisantant....For many weeks before his death he was very sensible of his gradual decay; and his answer to inquiries after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> was, several times, that he was going as fast as his enemies could wish, and as easily as his friends could desire. He was not, however, without a frequent recurrence of pain and uneasiness; but he passed most part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>-room, admitted the visits of his friends, and, with his usual spirit, conversed with them upon literature, politics, or whatever else was accidentally started. In conversation he seemed to be per-\nfectly at ease, and to the last abounded with that pleasantry, and those curious and entertaining anecdotes, which ever distinguished him. This, however, I always considered rather as an effort to be agreeable; and he at length acknowledged that it became too much for his strength. For a few days before his death, he became more averse to receive visits; speaking became more and more difficult for him, and for twelve hours before his death his speech failed altogether. His senses and judgment did not fail till the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of his life. He constantly discovered a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> and care of his friends; and, amidst great uneasiness and languor, never betrayed any peevishness or impatience. This is a general account of his last days; but a particular fact or two may perhaps convey to you a still better idea of them.\n\nAbout a fortnight before his death, he added a codicil to his will, in which he fully discovered his attention to his friends, as well as his own pleasantry. What little wine he himself drank was generally port, a wine for which his friend the poet [John Home] had ever declared the strongest aversion. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> bequeaths to his friend John one bottle of port; and, upon condition of his drinking this even at two down-sittings, bestows upon him twelve dozen of his best claret. He pleasantly adds, that this subject of wine was the only one upon which they had ever differed. In the codicil there are several other strokes of raillery and pleasantry, highly expressive of the cheerfulness which he then enjoyed. He even turned his attention to some of the simple amusements with which he had been formerly pleased. In the neighbourhood of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BERWICKSHIRE\">Berwickshire</a> is a brook, by which the access in time of floods is frequently interrupted. Mr Hume bequeaths L100 for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> over this brook, but upon the express condition that none of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> for that purpose shall be taken from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a> in the neighbourhood, which forms part of a romantic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> in which, in his earlier days, Mr Hume took particular delight. Otherwise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> to go to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>.\n\nThese are a few particulars which may perhaps appear trifling; but to me no particulars seem trifling that relate to so great a man. It is perhaps from trifles that we can best distinguish the tranquillity and cheerfulness of the philosopher, at a time when the most part of mankind are under disquiet, anxiety, and sometimes even horror....I had gone so far when I was called to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and I have returned only so long before the post as to say, that I am most affectionately yours,\n\n\"William Cullen.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, 17th September 1776.\"\n\nNote Q, p. 369.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PYRRHO\">Pyrrho</a> was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with carrying his scepticism so far as not to avoid a carriage if it was driven against him. \u00c6nesidemus, the most famous of ancient sceptics, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> vindicates the more ancient doubter from such lunacy, of which indeed his having lived to the age of ninety seems sufficient to acquit him. (Diog. Laert. lib. ix. sect. 62.)\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">Brief</a> and imperfect as our accounts of ancient scepticism are, it does appear that their reasoning on the subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAUSATION\">causation</a> had some resemblance to that of Mr Hume. (Ibid. ix. sect. 97.) It is perhaps impossible to translate the important technical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> \u03c4\u03b1 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3. It comprehends two or more things as related to each other\u2014both the relative and correlative taken together as such. Fire considered as having the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> wood is \u03c4\u03b1 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3. The words of Laertius may therefore be nearly rendered into the language of modern philosophy as follows: \"Causation they take away thus. A cause is so only in relation to an effect. What is relative is only conceived, but does not exist. Therefore cause is a mere conception.\"\n\nThe first attempt to prove the necessity of belief in a divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>, by demonstrating that natural reason leads to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> scepticism, was made by Algazel, a professor at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAGDAD\">Bagdad</a>, in\nthe beginning of the twelfth century of our era; whose work entitled *The Destruction of the Philosopher* is known to us only by the answer of Averroes, called *Destruction of the Destruction*. He denied a necessary connection between cause and effect; for of two separate things, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> of the existence of one does not necessarily contain the affirmation of the existence of the other; and the same may be said of denial. It is curious enough that this argument was more especially pointed against those Arabian philosophers who, from the necessary connection of causes and effects, reasoned against the possibility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>; thus anticipating one doctrine of Mr Hume, to impugn another. (Tenneman, *Gesch. der Phil.* VIII. 387.)\n\nThe same attempt was made by the learned but unphilosophical Huet, bishop of Avranches (*Quaestiones Abetanae*, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAEN\">Caen</a>, 1690, and *Trait\u00e9 de la Foiblisse de l'Esprit Humain*, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a>, 1723). A similar motive urged Berkeley to his attack on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLUXIONS\">Fluxions</a>. The attempt of Huet has been lately renewed by the Abb\u00e9 Lamennais, in his treatise on *Religious Indifference*; a fine writer, whose apparent reasonings amount to little more than well-varied assertions, and well-disguised assumptions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> to be proved.\n\nTo build religion upon scepticism is the most extravagant of all attempts; for it destroys the proofs of a divine mission, and leaves no natural means of distinguishing between revelation and imposture. The Abb\u00e9 Lamennais represents authority as the sole ground of belief. Why? If any reason can be given, the proposition must be false; if none, it is obviously a mere groundless assertion.\n\n**Note R**, p. 372.\n\nCasanova, a Venetian doomed to solitary imprisonment in the dungeons at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> in 1755, thus speaks of the only books which for a time he was allowed to read. The title of the first was *La Cit\u00e9 Mystique de S\u0153ur Marie de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a>, appel\u00e9e d'Agrada*.\n\n\"J'y lus tout ce que peut enfanter l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> exalt\u00e9e d'une vierge Espagnole extravagan-\n\nment d\u00e9vote, cloitr\u00e9e, m\u00e9lancolique, ayant des directeurs de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>, ignorans, faux, et d\u00e9vots. Amoureuse et amie tr\u00e8s intime de la Sainte Vierge, elle avait re\u00e7u ordre de Dieu m\u00eame d'\u00e9crire la vie de sa divine m\u00e8re. Les instructions n\u00e9cessaires lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies par le Saint Esprit. Elle commen\u00e7ait la vie de Marie, non pas du jour de sa naissance, mais du moment de son immacul\u00e9e conception dans le sein de sa m\u00e8re <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>. Apr\u00e8s avoir narr\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail tout ce que sa divine h\u00e9ro\u00efne fit les neuf mois qu'elle a pass\u00e9 dans le sein maternel, elle nous apprend qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de trois ans elle balayait la maison, aid\u00e9e par neuf cents domestiques, tous anges, command\u00e9s par leur propre <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Michel. Ce qui frappe dans ce livre est l'assurance que tout est dit de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONNE\">bonne</a> foi. Ce sont les visions d'un esprit sublime, qui, sans aucune <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OMBRE\">ombre</a> d'orgueil, ivre de Dieu, croit ne r\u00e9v\u00e9ler que ce que l'Esprit Saint lui inspire.\" (M\u00e9moires de Casanova, IV. 343. Leipsic, 1827.)\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>'s confinement to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> produced such an effect on the author, who, though an unbeliever and a debauchee, was then enfeebled by melancholy, bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and bad food, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> was haunted, and his waking hours disturbed by its horrible visions. Many years after, passing through Agrada in Old Castile, he charmed the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> of that village by speaking of the biographer of the virgin. The priest showed him all the spots which were consecrated by her presence, and bitterly lamented that the Court of Rome had refused to canonize her. It is the natural reflection of the writer, that the book was well qualified to turn a solitary prisoner mad, or to make a man at large an atheist. It ought not to be forgotten, that the inquisitors of state at Venice, who proscribed this book, were probably of the latter persuasion. It is a striking instance of the infatuation of those who, in their eagerness to rivet the bigotry of the ignorant, use means which infallibly tend to spread utter unbelief among the educated. The book is a disgusting, but in its general outline seemingly faithful, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the dissolute manners spread over the Continent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> in the middle of the eighteenth century.\n\"The Treatise on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAR\">War</a> and Peace, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on Human Understanding, the Spirit of Laws, and the Inquiry into the Causes of the Wealth of Nations, are the works which have most directly influenced the general opinion of Europe during the two last centuries. They are also the most conspicuous landmarks in the progress of the sciences to which they relate. It is remarkable that the defects of all these great works are very similar. The leading notions of none of them can, in the strictest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, be said to be original, though Locke and Smith in that respect surpass their illustrious rivals. All of them employ great care in ascertaining those laws which are immediately deduced from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, or directly applicable to practice; but apply metaphysical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> principles with considerable negligence. None pursues the order of science, beginning with first elements, and advancing to more and more complicated conclusions; though Locke is perhaps less defective in method than the rest. All admit digressions which, though often intrinsically excellent, distract attention, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the chain of thought. None of them is happy in the choice, or constant in the use, of technical terms; and in none do we find much of that rigorous precision which is the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of philosophical language. Grotius and Montesquieu were imitators of Tacitus,\u2014the first with more gravity, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> with more vivacity; but both were tempted to forsake the simple diction of science, in pursuit of the poignant brevity which that great historian has carried to a vicious excess. Locke and Smith chose an easy, clear, and free, but somewhat loose and verbose style\u2014more concise in Locke\u2014more elegant in Smith,\u2014in both exempt from pedantry, but not void of ambiguity and repetition. Perhaps all these apparent defects contributed in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> to the specific usefulness of these great works; and, by rendering their contents more accessible and acceptable to the majority of readers, have more completely blended their principles with the common opinions of mankind.\" (Edinburgh Review, vol. XXXVI. p. 244.)\n\nA little before, in the same treatise, appears a great part of the substance of the famous maxim, *Nil est in intellectu quod non prius fuit in sensu.* \u1f29\u03bd\u1f76 \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03b4\u03b5\u03be\u03af\u1fb3 \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03af, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ad\u03b2\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae\u03bd. (Ibid. 47.)\n\nIn the tract on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">Memory</a> and Reminiscence we find his enumeration of the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>. \u0394\u03b9\u1f70 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03c2, \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u1f45\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u1f72\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd, \u1f22 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c7\u1f72\u03c2. (Ibid. II. 86.) If the latter word be applied to time as well as space, and considered as comprehending causation, the enumeration will coincide with that of Hume. The term *\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2* is as significant as if it had been chosen by Hobbes. But it is to be observed, that these principles are applied only to explain memory.\n\nSomething has been said on the subject, and something on the present writer, by Mr Coleridge, in his unfortunately unfinished work called Biographia Literaria, chap. v., which seems to justify, if not to require, a few remarks. That learned gentleman seems to have been guilty of an oversight in quoting as a distinct work the Parva Naturalia, which is the collective name given by the scholastic translators to those treatises of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> which form the second volume of Duval's edition of his works, published at Paris in 1639. I have already acknowledged the striking resemblance of Mr Hume's principles of association to those of Aristotle. In answer, however, to a remark of Mr Coleridge, I must add, that the manuscript of a part of Aquinas which I bought many years ago (on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of a bookseller's catalogue) as being written by Mr Hume, was not a copy of the Commentary on the Parva Naturalia, but of Aquinas's own Secunda Secundae; and that, on examination, it proves not to be the handwriting of Mr Hume, and to contain nothing written by him. It is certain that, in the passages immediately preceding the quotation, Aristotle explains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> as depending on a general law,\u2014that the idea of\nan object will remind us of the objects which immediately preceded or followed when originally perceived. But what Mr Coleridge has not told us is, that the Stagyrite confines the application of this law exclusively to the phenomena of recollection alone, without any glimpse of a more general operation extending to all connections of thought and feeling,\u2014a wonderful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, indeed, even so limited, of the sagacity of the great philosopher, but which for many ages <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> barren of farther consequences. The illustrations of Aquinas throw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the original doctrine, and show that it was unenlarged in his time. \"When we recollect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>, the thought of Plato occurs 'as like him.' When we remember Hector, the thought of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACHILLES\">Achilles</a> occurs 'as contrary.' The idea of a father is followed by that of a son 'as near.'\" (Aquinas, Opera, I. pars ii. p. 62, et seq.) Those of Ludovicus Vives, as quoted by Mr Coleridge, extend no farther.\n\nBut if Mr Coleridge will compare the parts of Hobbes on Human Nature which relate to this subject, with those which explain general terms, he will perceive that the philosopher of Malmesbury builds on these two foundations a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the human understanding, of which reasoning is only a particular case. In consequence of the assertion of Mr Coleridge, that Hobbes was anticipated by Descartes in his excellent and interesting discourse on Method, I have twice repurred that work in quest of this remarkable anticipation, though, as I thought, well acquainted by my old studies with the writings of that great philosopher. My labour has, however, been vain. I have discovered no trace of that or of any similar speculation. My edition is in Latin by Elzevir, at Amsterdam, in 1650, the year of Descartes's death. I am obliged, therefore, to conjecture that Mr Coleridge, having mislaid his references, has, by mistake, quoted the discourse on Method, instead of another work; which would affect his inference from the priority of Descartes to Hobbes. It is not to be denied, that the opinion of Aristotle, repeated by so many commentators, may have found its way into the mind of Hobbes, and also of Hume; though neither might be aware of its source, or even conscious that it was not originally his own. Yet the very narrow view of association by Locke, his apparently treating it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, and the silence of common books respecting it, afford a presumption that the Peripatetic doctrine was so little known, that it might have escaped the notice of these philosophers, one of whom boasted that he was unread, and the other is not liable to the suspicion of unacknowledged borrowing.\n\nTo Mr Coleridge, who distrusts his own power of building a bridge by which his ideas may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> into a mind so differently trained as mine, I venture to suggest, with that sense of his genius which no circumstance has hindered me from seizing every fit occasion to manifest, that more of my early years were employed in contemplations of an abstract nature, than of those of the majority of his readers; that there are not, even now, many of them less likely to be repelled from doctrines by singularity or uncutness; more willing to allow that every system has caught an advantageous glimpse of some side or corner of the truth; more desirous of exhibiting this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a> of the fragments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> by attempts to translate the doctrine of one school into the language of another\u2014who, when he cannot discover a reason for an opinion, considers it as important to discover the causes of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> by the philosopher; believing, in the most unfavourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, that one of the most arduous and useful researches of mental philosophy is to explore the subtle illusions which enable great minds to satisfy themselves by mere words, before they deceive others by payment in the same counterfeit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>. These habits, together with the natural influence of my age and avocations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> me to suspect that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> philosophy I am nearer to indifference than to an exclusive spirit. I hope that it can neither be thought presumptuous nor offensive in me to doubt, whether the circumstance of its being found difficult to convey a metaphysical doctrine to a person who, at one part of his life, made such studies his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> pursuit, may not imply either error in the opinion, or defect in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>.\nA very late writer, who seems to speak for Mr Bentham with authority, tells us that \"the first time the phrase of 'the principle of utility' was brought decidedly into notice, was in the 'Essays, by David Hume,' published about the year 1742. In that work it is mentioned as the name of a principle which might be made the foundation of a system of morals, in opposition to a system then in vogue, which was founded on what was called the '<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>.' The ideas, however, there attached to it, are vague, and defective in practical application.\" (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> Review, No. xxi.) If these few sentences were scrutinized with the severity and minuteness of Bentham's Fragment on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>, they would be found to contain almost as many misremembrances as assertions. Utility is not \"mentioned,\" but fully discussed, in Mr Hume's Discourse. It is seldom spoken of by \"name.\" Instead of charging it with \"vagueness,\" it would be more just to admire the precision which it combines with beauty. Instead of being \"defective in practical application,\" perhaps the desire of rendering it popular has crowded it with examples and illustrations taken from life. To the assertion that \"it was opposed to the moral sense,\" no reply can be needful but the following words extracted from the Discourse itself: \"I am apt to suspect that reason and sentiment concur in almost all moral determinations and conclusions. The final sentence which pronounces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> and actions amiable or odious, probably depends on some internal sense or feeling, which nature has made universal in the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>.\" (An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, sect. i.) The phrase \"made universal,\" which is here used instead of the more obvious and common word \"implanted,\" shows the anxious and perfect precision of language, by which a philosopher avoids the needless decision of a controversy not at the moment before him.\n\nA writer of consummate ability, who has failed in little but the respect due to the abilities and character of his opponents, has given too much countenance to the abuse and confusion of language exemplified in the well-known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> of Pope,\n\nModes of self-love the Passions we may call.\n\"We know,\" says he, \"no universal proposition respecting human nature which is true but one\u2014that men always act from self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>.\" (Edinburgh Review, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1829.) It is manifest from the sequel, that the writer is not the dupe of the confusion; but many of his readers may be so. If, indeed, the word self-interest could with propriety be used for the gratification of every prevalent desire, he has clearly shown that this change in the signification of terms would be of no advantage to the doctrine which he controverts. It would make as many sorts of self-interest as there are appetites, and it is irreconcilably at variance with the system of association embraced by Mr Mill. To the word self-love <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a> properly assigns two significations: 1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROSS\">Gross</a> self-love, which consists in the pursuit of the greatest pleasures, from all those desires which look to individual gratification; or, 2. refined self-love, which seeks the greatest pleasure which can arise from all the desires of human nature,\u2014the latter of which is an invaluable, though inferior principle. The admirable writer whose language has occasioned this illustration, who at an early age has mastered every species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, will doubtless hold fast to simplicity, which survives all the fashions of deviation from it, and which a man of a genius so fertile has few temptations to forsake.","sp":440,"ep":453},{"h":"SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL HAVING FOUND IT REQUISITE IN THE COURSE OF HIS ARDUOUS OBSERVATIONS ON THE SUN TO DEVISE","t":"r William Herschel having found it requisite in the course of his arduous observations on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVISE\">devise</a> means for preventing the intense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of its rays from reaching the eye, was naturally led to observe the effect of different coloured glasses, and even of coloured liquids in this respect. He also placed thermometers in different parts of the spectrum formed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a>, in order to discover which of the rays it was most important to exclude. The singular result at which he arrived was this, that the intensity of heat accompanying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of the sun not only increases from the violet to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RED\">red</a> end of the spectrum (as was already known), but is more intense quite beyond the red, and gradually diminishes in force for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> way farther. This result was keenly contested by Leslie, but was confirmed by Englefield and Davy. Berard admitted the existence of invisible heating rays from the sun, but yet found the maximum effect within the red. Seebeck, by numerous experiments, proved that the position of the maximum depended on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the prism, being found even in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> ray when a prism of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WATER\">water</a> is employed, whilst with flint glass it always occurs in the space beyond the red. The rationale of this curious result was first discovered by Melloni, whose labours <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be detailed in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>; and it was shown to depend on the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> exercised on the heat of the several rays of the spectrum by the differing material of the prisms.\n\nHerschel made a very great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of experiments on the transmission both of solar and fire-heat through different kinds of glass and other bodies. But they were rough trials, giving a sort of practical test of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, rather than admitting of accurate estimations of the quantities of transmitted heat. It was impossible, for instance, to infer from them the degree in which the warmth induced in the glass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> other medium by the heat which it absorbed, tended to raise the indications of the thermometer beyond; although such an effect was manifest from the results of the experiments themselves. Hence it was open to an objector to deny the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> transmission of radiant heat through such bodies as glass, except in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of the sun and of brilliant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a>, when it cannot be doubted.\n\nPrevost had proved to his own satisfaction the immediate transmission of heat derived from bodies even when below the temperature of visible redness, by using thin screens of glass, and renewing them frequently before they could have absorbed much heat. Maycock obtained a similar result; but De la Roche is due not only the establishment of this fact beyond any reasonable doubt, but also the discovery of certain laws of its operation which are inexplicable on any other supposition but that of immediate transmission. One of these laws, for instance, was this, that when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of thin glasses are interposed between a source of heat and a thermometer, each successive glass transmits a larger proportion than the previous ones of the heat which falls upon it. De la Roche rightly accounted for this significant fact by assuming that heat is not homogeneous, and that the heat which has once passed through glass has lost the rays which glass most easily intercepts. He farther found that the susceptibility of heat to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through glass increases rapidly with the temperature of its source. The experiments of De la Roche <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> from 1812.\n\nThe next step was made by Professor Powell of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> (1825). He showed that the quality of the heat transmitted by glass is not the same as that of the incident heat. This he proved by ascertaining the proportion of heat absorbed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> relatively to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> surface. This proportion was invariably increased by the interposition of glass. Mr Powell concludes that heat consists of two kinds intimately mixed. That of which the absorption depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the surface on which it falls, is usually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a>, and is most easily transmitted by glass. That kind of heat which is equally absorbed by black and white surfaces is totally devoid of light, and is sometimes considered as pure radiant heat.\n\nIt will be sufficient here to refer to an interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DEW\">Dew</a>, published by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WELLS\">Wells</a> in 1815, in which he applies Leslie's experiments on the radiating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of dew.\npower of different surfaces to account for the apparently capricious formation of dew in different situations,\u2014establishing that it is moisture deposited from the lowest stratum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> upon surfaces cooled below the \"dew-point,\" by their unrequited radiation of heat towards a clear sky. A slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, by continually restoring the equilibrium of temperature to the surface, prevents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a>.\n\n\u00a7 8.

With the exception of the excellent researches of De la Roche on the immediate transmission of radiant heat through glass (mentioned in the preceding Section), but which that ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> did not live to extend and complete, little of importance was done between the researches of Leslie and those of Melloni, of which we are now to speak.\n\nMacedonio Melloni, a native of Parma in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, became associated as an experimenter, probably about the year 1828 or 1829, with Nobili, a skilful and ingenious physicist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-REGGIO\">Reggio</a> (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MODENA\">Modena</a>). Nobili was well known by his experiments on galvanic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">Electricity</a> and on Electro-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNETISM\">Magnetism</a>. He was also the great improver of Schweigger's Multiplier, rendering it an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of precision; and to him we owe the happy and ingenious application of Thermo-Electricity to the measurement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> effects of heat.\n\nThe Thermo-Multiplier, a thermometer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> delicacy, though improved by Melloni, was (as has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> been stated) the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of Nobili. It consists of two portions, a sentient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> and an indicating part. The first is composed of a number of short thin bars of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BISMUTH\">bismuth</a>, arranged like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> faggot, pairs of bars being soldered together in consecutive order at the opposite ends of the faggot, so as to form a single bent metallic conductor. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the junctions exposed at one end of the faggot are subjected to heat, and those at the other end kept cool, the effect will be a thermo-electric current of considerable intensity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the pile. This current is conveyed by means of two wires from the opposite ends of the system, which are connected with a delicate galvanometer which forms the indicating part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>. In practice, one end of the pile, armed with a conical reflector for concentrating the rays of heat, is exposed to a calorific source whose radiant effect is to be measured, whilst the other end is carefully screened from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> influences. The deviations of the galvanometer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> indicate the heating effect as on the scale of a thermometer. The precautions required in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the instrument, and in the interpretation of its results, are too numerous to be mentioned here.\n\nNobili, in conjunction with Melloni, applied the thermo-multiplier (amongst other experiments) to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the instantaneous transmission of heat through glass and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and liquid bodies.\n\nFrom 1831, this enquiry was conducted nearly exclusively by Melloni, who about that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a> settled first in Geneva and then in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, having been compelled, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> grounds, to quit Italy. His first and most important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> memoir was presented to the Academy of Sciences early in 1833, and was received with marked coldness, if not incredulity, by that body. A few months later, the writer of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> had an opportunity of seeing Melloni's experiments in Paris, and he made known their importance at the immediately succeeding meeting of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">Association</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> long time awarded their Rumford medal to Melloni, after which mark of foreign approbation, he first obtained a hearing from the Institute of France. The most considerable result at which he had then arrived was this: that rock-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> possesses a power approached by any other substance of transmitting heat of any temperature and from whatever source, with extremely little loss; and as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this, that heat wholly devoid of luminosity, such as that from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water, or even the heat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, may be refracted by prisms and lenses of rock-salt exactly in the same manner as light is refracted by glass. The reality of these effects (which had excited the persevering scepticism of the Parisian savans) was demonstrated by a great number of most ingenious experiments, in which every possible source of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> and confusion was avoided or allowed for.\n\nMelloni even believed that the loss observed in passing heat of any temperature, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> or low, through polished screens of rock-salt, was precisely the same; and, moreover, that it occurred entirely at the two surfaces by partial reflection, so that the solid medium was absolutely transparent for every kind of heat. It is certain that the loss is in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> small; but this almost paradoxical conclusion has not been completely confirmed by those who have repeated his experiments. The important and unexpected discovery of the nearly complete transparency of rock-salt for heat, enables us to construct complex thermotic apparatus for refracting and concentrating it, analogous to those of glass which are used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>.\n\nThe next point clearly made out by Melloni, was the specific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of different bodies in sifting the\nThe specific rays of heat they transmit, stopping altogether certain action of different substances. Substances, in general, transmit most readily the heat on the rays radiated by surfaces having a high temperature; this had already been shown to be true in the case of glass by De la Roche. That experimenter had also demonstrated (as we have seen in Art. 704) that successive plates of glass intercept a constantly decreasing percentage of the heat incident upon them. This may be explained by supposing radiant heat to be, like the light of the sun or of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a>, containing rays of different qualities, some of which are easily transmitted and others are wholly stopped by glass. And if we pursue the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> with respect to other substances, we may imagine (for the sake of illustration) heat to be coloured, and that different media, though equally transparent and colourless as regards light\u2014such as glass, rock-crystal, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> a specific action on the rays of heat, each transmitting certain portions of the heat and stopping others. Rock-salt alone (according to Melloni) is absolutely colourless with respect to heat, transmitting all its varieties with uniform facility. Thus equally thick and equally clear plates of salt, glass, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, transmit, out of 100 rays of heat from different sources the following proportions:\n\n| Heat from | Heat from | Heat from | Heat at |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| Rock-salt | 92        | 92        | 92      |\n| Plate-glass | 39       | 24        | 6       |\n| Alum      | 9         | 2         | 0       |\n\nLet, however, heat which has been sifted by a plate of alum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on another similar plate, then instead of 9 per cent., 90 per cent. will be transmitted. On the other hand, if we unite two plates of opposite transmissive qualities, as alum and green glass, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> is almost absolutely opake, just as a combination of two coloured glasses giving different pure tints (say red and green) would be opake for light.\n\nThe working out of this beautiful enquiry is entirely due to Melloni; and he has published a separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on the \"Coloration of Heat.\" He also rendered it probable that the rays most easily absorbed by glass and bodies generally are the least refrangible; and this has been made certain by direct experiments by the author of this Dissertation, who, by a peculiar method, founded on the Total Reflection of heat within a prism of rock-salt, has obtained the following Indices of Refraction:\n\n- Heat from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> refractive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a>: 1.531\n- Do. passed through glass: 1.647\n- Do. do. alum: 1.558\n- Mean luminous ray: 1.562\n\nMelloni ingeniously applied the facts previously mentioned to explain the variable position of the hottest part of the spectrum, as observed by Sir William Herschel and others. It depends on the nature of the prism employed. In a prism of rock-salt, the hottest part of the spectrum is as far beyond the extreme visible red, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between that red and the yellow ray in an opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>.\n\nThrough the intervention of Arago and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Humboldt, Melloni ultimately obtained permission to return to Italy and to reside at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, where he spent his latter years. He ceased, however, to prosecute his researches on radiant heat with the same energy, under circumstances of ease and comparative affluence, that he had done in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of distress and obscurity. Nevertheless, several original papers were written by him at this period, as well as the condensed account of his earlier researches on the Coloration of Heat, of which only the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> appeared. Melioni died of cholera at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PORTICI\">Portici</a>, in August 1854, aged 53.\n\nThe analogy of Radiant Heat to light, strikingly established by Melloni, with respect to the diversified refrangibility and other qualities of the various radiations emitted by one or different sources, suggests an enquiry as to the intimate nature of these two agencies. No answer is likely to be so conclusive as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to the test of Polarization, which, in the case of light, has been so remarkably explained by the theory of the transverse undulations of a medium. Some years before any of Melloni's papers appeared,\u2014indeed, before he had entered on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> just noticed,\u2014the writer of the present Dissertation had attempted, by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> thermometers, to test the polarizability of heat. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> was not a new one; but, except in the case of the heat of the solar rays, the results seemed to be inconclusive, or were even wholly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>. Berard had, indeed, not long after the discovery by Malus of luminous polarization by reflection, repeated (in 1812) that experiment with sun-heat, and also with the heat emanating from terrestrial sources; and as he believed with success. I have ventured to call his experiments inconclusive, because others besides myself vainly endeavoured to repeat them. Professor Powell failed with ordinary thermometers, and at a later period Nobili announced a decidedly negative result, obtained with the thermo-multiplier. Simple radiant heat, he affirmed, is not polarizable by reflection.\n\nI have just referred to my own early experiments on the subject (which were likewise inconclusive), in order to explain that it was natural, on hearing of the application of the thermo-multiplier to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> radiant heat, that I should wish to repeat them with the new instrument. This I did in 1834. I first succeeded in proving the polarization of heat by tourmaline (which Mel-\n\n---\n\n1 La Thermochroise, ou la Coloration Calorifique.

As the plate of mica used for depolarization was made to rotate in its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, the amount of heat shown by the galvanometer was found to fluctuate just as the amount of light received by the eye under similar circumstances would have done. This experiment which, with the others just mentioned, was soon repeated and confirmed by other observers, still remains the only one proving the double refraction of heat unaccompanied by light; and though somewhat indirect, it will hardly be regarded by competent judges as otherwise than conclusive.

I also succeeded in repeating Fresnel's experiment of producing circular polarization by two internal reflections. The substance used was of course rock-salt.\n\n\u00a7 9. M. REGNAULT.\u2014Numerical Laws of Expansion by Heat; Rudberg.\u2014Vaporization; Dulong.\u2014Latent Heat; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYGROMETRY\">Hygrometry</a>.\n\nThe limits of this Essay will not permit me to do more than allude in very general terms to the meritorious services of M. Henri-Victor Regnault in the science of heat. In the seventh section of this chapter I have mentioned his name in connection with that of Dulong, whose researches he has prosecuted, and whose position in the Coll\u00e8ge de France he now fills.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of M. Regnault has been devoted chiefly to heat in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>\u2014to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> and vaporization. I have already said, in speaking of Dulong, that, in point of numerical precision in the results of experimental physics, the French are unrivalled. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> which they have shown in the construction of apparatus, skill in its use, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> in deducing results with due attention to every numerical correction, have not been equalled either in England or Germany, much less elsewhere.\n\nWe must, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> that doubts were first thrown upon the accuracy of Gay-Lussac's coefficient of the expansion of the gases (0.375 of the volume of expansion at 32\u00b0 for the expansion between 32\u00b0 and 212\u00b0) by Rudberg a Swedish philosopher, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> determined a new coefficient (0.3645). M. Regnault finds for air of the ordinary density a coefficient nearly the same as that of Rudberg, but differing slightly for the same fluid under differing pressures, and also for the various gases. The expansibility of all of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> appears to tend to the same limiting value when they are sufficiently attenuated. As a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> to these experiments, the expansion of mercury was ascertained by its hydrostatic equilibrium at different temperatures, as had already been done by Dulong, and with almost coincident results. The dilatation of mercury was used to ascertain that of the glass vessels employed.\n\nThe irregularity of the dilatation of glass is one of\n\n---\n\n1 *Annales de Chimie*, tom. iv. (1833).\n2 I was led to polarize heat by transmission through mica films from having observed the extraordinary permeability of those films to radiant heat, and from the facility of adapting them to tubes applied to the pile. The idea of using bundles of mica for reflecting heat did not occur to me until some time after. But I cannot here omit mentioning a circumstance of which I only became aware some years after the publication of my researches. In arranging my correspondence, I found some letters from Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Brewster, with whom I had communicated as to the best means of polarizing heat, during my earliest and unsuccessful attempts with common thermometers. In one of these letters he recommends, among other methods, the reflection of radiant heat from mica bundles. This suggestion was not put into practice; for, owing to change of residence and other circumstances, my attention was diverted to other subjects, and only recalled, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of some years (as stated in the text), to the polarization of heat, by the invention of the Thermomultiplier. Nor was Sir D. Brewster's suggestion recollected by me until I accidentally met with it (after another long interval), in the manner which I have just stated. I am glad to have an opportunity of acknowledging the friendly assistance and encouragement in all matters of science which at an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> I received from him when I was an obscure, though ardent student, and when he was my only scientific adviser.\n3 I have not thought it proper to go into farther details concerning my own experiments on radiant heat. Those who desire more information will find it in Professor Powell's Second Report on Radiant Heat, in the *Brit. Assoc. Reports* for 1840. But I may here state, that M. Melloni's first experiments on polarization were made with mica piles, furnished to him by myself in 1835.\n4 M. Regnault's experiments were published in 1841. Professor Magnus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> was at the same time engaged on similar experiments, and with nearly coincident results. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> contains the summary of all these experiments:\n\n| Coefficients of expansion of gases. | Value |\n|-------------------------------------|-------|\n| Dalton's coefficient                | 0.391 |\n| Gay-Lussac's coefficient            | 0.375 |\n| Rudberg's coefficient               | 0.3645|\n| M. Regnault's coefficient (from the expansion observed under a constant pressure) | 0.367 |\n| M. Regnault's coefficient (from the elasticity observed under a constant volume) | 0.3665|\n| M. Magnus' coefficient (from the elasticity observed under a constant volume) | 0.3665|\n\nDalton's experiments were made between 55\u00b0 and 212\u00b0, and after allowing for the expansion of glass, he obtains for the relative volumes of air at those temperatures 1000 and 1325, giving \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) of the volume at 55\u00b0 for 1\u00b0 Fahr., or \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) of the volume at 32\u00b0, which agrees with the coefficient given above. See *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a>*, vol. v., p. 598-9.\nthe great difficulties not only of these enquiries, but generally, in constructing comparable thermometers. It varies so much with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of the glass as to leave a serious amount of uncertainty in the measure of temperatures above that of boiling water. M. Regnault has had the perseverance himself to graduate the thermometers which he uses.\n\nThese enquiries were in some measure introductory to the determination of the elasticities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> at different temperatures, which had been already ascertained with so much care by Dulong (nominally in conjunction with Arago and other academicians), as to leave little need for their repetition, except on the ground of the uncertainty of the indications at high temperatures of the thermometers which they used. All M. Regnault's results are most carefully expressed in terms of temperatures measured on an air thermometer corrected for the expansion of glass. They agree well with those previously ascertained by Dulong.\n\nIn connection with this subject, the important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of the latent heat of steam at different temperatures has been correctly ascertained for the first time by M. Regnault. Watt maintained that the sum of the sensible and latent heats of steam is constant at all temperatures; Southern and others, on the contrary, believed that the latent heat has a constant value, whatever be the temperature of vaporization. M. Regnault shows that the true law is intermediate. The latent heat diminishes as the sensible heat of steam increases, but in a slower proportion.\n\nOur author also followed the steps of his predecessor Dulong in verifying the law of Mariotte and Law of Boyle on the compressibility of the gases. He found Mariotte to be indeed very approximately true, yet not absolutely so for any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>. For atmospheric air and for most other gases the compression increases rather faster than the strict proportionality to the pressures would assign. In hydrogen gas the contrary is the case. This result, together with that on the dilatation of different gases, shows (if fully confirmed hereafter) that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> simplicity or uniformity of result is not by any means a sure ground of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> as to a law of nature. That simplicity often appears to be predictable only of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> condition of matter which we may assign or imagine, but which we rarely if ever find realized amongst the bodies around us.\n\nThe preceding investigations, the result of an amount of minute and assiduous labour almost fearful to contemplate, are to be found collected in the 21st volume of the Memoirs of the French Academy of Sciences, which they entirely occupy.\n\nM. Regnault has elsewhere published analogous researches on the Specific Heat of a great variety of substances, and on the theory and practice of Hygrometry, both of which are highly interesting and important, but which I have not here space to analyze. He is also favourably known as the author of an excellent treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, and in fact sits in the Institute as a member of the Chemical Section. He now directs the manufactory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a> at Sevres; and being still in the prime of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, much may yet be hoped from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> to science.","sp":964,"ep":968},{"h":"SPECULATIVE MATHEMATICS","t":"1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GEOMETRY\">GEOMETRY</a>.\n\nPure Geometry is in strictness limited to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> equality of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, and spaces, whether superficial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>.

That acute people nearly completed the Elements of Geometry; and carrying their speculations beyond the properties of the Circle, they investigated the Sections of the Cone, and traced the character of some of the Higher Curves. The demonstrations left by the Greek Geometers are models of accuracy, clearness, and elegance\u2014admirably calculated for training the minds of youth to habits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> reasoning and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> arrangement. The circumspection of those great instructors of mankind in distinguishing the several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, and marking the limitations of a proposition, though frequently bordering on prolixity, might serve to warn the rapid cultivator of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALGEBRA\">Algebra</a> against indulging the tendency to hasty generalization which has given rise to the various paradoxes, and even palpable absurdities, that still disfigure the excellence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> art.

It imbues the mind with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and elegance which insensibly extend their influence over the culture of the other sciences. The most curious and difficult portion, however, of the Greek Geometry, has unfortunately been transmitted to us in a mutilated and imperfect state, which has often tortured the skill of commentators and mathematicians to restore it. Soon after the revival of letters, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> works of the Greek Geometers were translated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> by Commandine; but of Apollonius' Conics several books are wanting, and some parts of the Collections of Pappus exhibit only detached fragments. Near the close of the sixteenth century, and early in the seventeenth, Vieta, from a few scattered hints, restored the lost Tract on Tangencies, Fermat framed some beautiful separate demonstrations, and Snellius reproduced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLANE\">Plane</a> Loci, but in a tasteless shape. Soon afterwards Viviani, the surviving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Galileo, supplied the fifth book of Apollonius, and with such remarkable\nsuccess, that on comparing his production with an Arabic version <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> then discovered, he appeared to have surpassed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>. Huygens' afterwards gave, in the purest taste, some specimens of the Ancient Geometry. A Collection of the Mathematical Treatises of the Greeks respecting the Art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAR\">War</a> was now published in a magnificent folio from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Press at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. But a more extensive undertaking was planned by our oriental traveller Bernard, to print at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of the Greek Geometers, filling up the blanks from the inspection of Arabic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">Manuscripts</a>. In pursuance of this scheme, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Gregory edited Euclid, and Dr Halley Apollonius, while he restored likewise the Tracts on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">Section</a> of Ratio and of Space. After an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of fourscore years, Torelli's elegant edition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, purchased in Italy, has issued from the same press. Every lover of science would rejoice to see a portion of those ample funds that have been provided at Oxford for the encouragement of such expensive works, appropriated to the republication of Pappus' Mathematical Collections, of which several manuscripts exist far more complete than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> printed by Comman-\n\nThe relish for the Ancient Geometry has been\n\n---\n\n1 Born at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HAGUE\">Hague</a> in 1629, and son of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> of Zuylichem, Secretary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>; completed his mathematical studies at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> under Schooten, and printed a beautiful tract on the Circle and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPERBOLA\">Hyperbola</a> in 1651. But after visiting different countries, he published in 1638 his original and immortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled Horologium Oscillatorium. Having successfully applied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> and the spiral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> to regulate the motions of clocks and watches, he was anxious to accommodate those instruments to the finding of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. For that purpose he visited England, where he was treated with distinction by the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>. From there he returned to France, having visited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">High</a> School, to accept of a larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a>, and fix his abode at Paris. There he resided till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> became impaired, and in 1691 he retired to the lesser enjoyment of his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The same pursuits, however, engaged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> at the Hague on the 8th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1693. He was one of the clearest writers and most elegant geometers of modern times, and his powers of invention have seldom been surpassed. The finished works of Huygens have been collected at two several times into three quarto volumes.\n\n2 Nephew to the famous James Gregory, born at Aberdeen in 1661, completed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, and was appointed Professor of Mathematics in that University in 1683, the office having been suffered to remain vacant for eight years after the death of his uncle. In 1691 he had sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> to obtain the Savilian professorship at Oxford, and had the honorary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> in Physic conferred on him by the University. He published his Elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a> in 1702, and in the following year brought out his Edition of Euclid. He had made some progress in preparing the Conics of Apollonius, but fell a sacrifice in 1710 to an attack of malignant small-pox, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAIDENHEAD\">Maidenhead</a>, where he chanced to stop at the Inn, on his return from a visit to Bath. He possessed some learning, but his genius was of a very inferior order to that of his uncle.\n\n3 Edmund Halley, born in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> October 29, 1656, the son of a substantial citizen\u2014educated at St Paul's school, and sent to Oxford in 1673\u2014sailed for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of St Helena in November 1676, and returned with his catalogue of fixed stars after an absence of exactly two years\u2014elected immediately fellow of the Royal Society, and departed for that learned body in 1679 to visit Hevelius at Danzig, and examine his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a>\u2014spent the years 1680 and 1681 in France and Italy. In 1684, having turned his attention to Kepler's problem, he tried, as some other mathematicians about this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIME\">time</a> had done, to derive it from a graduated central force, but was unable to find any geometric demonstration; and not obtaining any help so he abandoned this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOOKER\">Hooker</a> or Wren had recourse to Newton, who astonished him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a> by the store of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> discoveries, condensed into eight general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>. He overcame the scruples of the modest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, and prevailed with him to arrange the materials of the Principia, of which he superintended the publication in 1687, having written the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a> and some elegant recommedatory verses. Halley now gave a geometrical construction of the higher equations, computed the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, and formed tables of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ANNUITIES\">annuities</a>. For the purpose of improving Nautical Science, he had the command of the Paramour Pink, with which he sailed from England on the 24th November 1698, traversed the Atlantic, and crossed the Equinoctial Line; but his crew growing sick and mutinous, he was obliged to return in the following June. Invested with fuller powers, he set sail again in September, and spent twelve months in exploring both hemispheres, and during the year after his return, he delineated and published his famous magnetical chart. He was next employed on a survey of the British Channel, and then sent by the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a> to assist her ally the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> of Germany in forming a harbour at the bottom of the Adriatic. On his return he was appointed, in November 1703, Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford, having been thwarted before in a similar canvass by clerical influence. He now set about recovering the works of Apollonius; studied as much Arabic as enabled him to translate the tract on the Section of Ratio, and he restored the other tract on the Section of Space from the hints left by Pappus. These pieces, in a small octavo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, appeared in 1719, but five years afterwards came forth, in a splendid folio, his edition of the Conics, with the eighth book restored, and the additional tractise of Serenus. In 1719 Halley was appointed astronomer royal, and resided at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a> during the rest of his life, devoting his advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> to the careful and assiduous observation of the Heavens. He completed even his rejected task of embracing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of fifteen years. A paralytic stroke paralyzed him in 1737, from which he partially recovered, but his strength declined insensibly, and he expired on the 14th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1742. Few philosophers have contributed more largely to the advancement of useful knowledge. Ingenuity, ardour, indefatigable perseverance, learning, and general information, were possessed by Dr Halley in a most eminent degree; and having mingled in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> scenes of life, he had the rare advantage of combining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> with the habits of social intercourse.\n\n4 Born in 1721 at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VERONA\">Verona</a>, where he died in 1701. He studied at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a>, and became a great linguist, a good mathematician, and an excellent critical scholar. Being in easy circumstances, he devoted his whole time to literary pursuits, and carried his admiration of the Ancient Geometry almost to a pitch of bigotry.\nlonger preserved in Italy and in England than over the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> person ever cultivated that fine science with more assiduity, perseverance, and success, than our countryman Dr Robert Simson of Glasgow, the learned and critical editor of Euclid's Elements. In this department he concentrated his whole efforts, and appears, from his familiarity with the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of demonstration, to have inhaled the very spirit of the Greeks. In 1749, he published his Restoration of the books of Apollonius on Plane Loci, which by its fulness and peculiar elegance leaves scarcely a shadow of regret for the loss of the original. Simson pursued his researches in the Ancient Analysis through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> life, and not only restored various fragments, but threw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on some very difficult and abstruse questions connected with it. A posthumous volume, printed in 1776, at the expense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> Stanhope, besides many fine geometrical speculations, contains the first satisfactory exposition of Porisms, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> advanced by Pappus had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> regarded as an incomprehensible enigma. But from the unvarying tenor of his studies, the Scotch professor became a rigorist for the Ancient Analysis, and rejected with disdain the most obvious improvements in the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a>.\n\nIt deserves remark, that mathematical demonstration, being addressed to the eye rather than to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, must attain its greatest perspicuity when the successive steps of reasoning are seized at a glance. This is effected by adopting the symbols of Algebraic Notation, the most concise and perfect of all written <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>; nor is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and logical accuracy of the procedure in any degree impaired by such a transparent covering.\n\nDr Matthew Stewart of Edinburgh, who had been the pupil of Dr Simson, and possessed a\n\n---\n\n* Born at Kirtoshall in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-AYRSHIRE\">Ayrshire</a> on 14th October 1667, studied at Glasgow, and made such progress in elementary geometry, that at the early age of 22 he had an offer of the professorship of mathematics, which was immediately expected to become vacant in that University. Feeling his deficiency, however, he obtained leave of a year's absence, which he spent in London under the tuition of Humphry Ditton, and was admitted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> on the 20th of November 1711. His time seems afterwards to have been mostly spent in discharging the duties of his office, the intervals being allotted to the solution of geometrical problems, the perusal of the older mathematicians, and to miscellaneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-READING\">reading</a>. He led the life of a recluse, and all his steps were formal and methodical; yet his disposition was amiable, and he indulged at stated times in easy conviviality. He sent two papers, geometrical and algebraical, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">Indeterminate</a> Problems, to the Royal Society in 1723 and 1733, gave his restoration of the Loci Plani in 1748, published his Comic Sections in 1735, produced the Latin edition of Euclid's Elements in a quarto volume in 1756, which he compressed in 1760 into an English octavo, to which he annexed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> in 1762. It contains only the first six books of the original, with the eleventh and twelfth, the rest of the books being omitted as of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> in the present state of science. Perhaps the selection should have been carried farther. This edition is correct and creditable to the compiler, and has obtained prodigious success. Nay, the very Scottisms with which it abounds appear now to be adopted at Oxford and Cambridge as the appropriate diction of the Ancient Geometry. Simson quite idolized his original. He had a fine taste for geometry, some talents of invention, and considerable attainments as a scholar, but without any great force of intellect. In his latter years, from excessive veneration of the Greek Geometry, he not only viewed the Cartesian method with aversion, but began to regard the Fluxionary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CALCULUS\">Calculus</a> with mistrust and suspicion. He became emeritus professor in 1761, and died on the 2nd of October 1768.\n\n* Born in 1717 at Rothsay, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of Bute, of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> his father was minister, and studied years at Glasgow, where he distinguished himself; to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> further instruction, in 1736 he removed to Edinburgh, where he cultivated the society of the celebrated MacLaurin, while he corresponded with Simson, his old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>. He now prosecuted geometrical studies with ardour, and put forth his uncommon powers of invention; and after he became minister at Roseneath, he found leisure in the study of the most scientific subjects. On the occasion of a vacancy of the mathematical chair at Edinburgh by the death of MacLaurin, he was induced to draw out the substance of his most profound geometrical investigations, which he printed under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of General Theorems, in a small volume, about the close of 1746. This publication secured his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>, and after some delay he was appointed professor in September 1747. He now enjoyed a situation most congenial to his taste, and favourable to the exercise of his rare talents. Ambitious to apply his beloved geometry to unravel questions which were believed to demand all the resources of algebraic art, he discovered a solution of Kepler's problem at once simple and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a>, and greatly surpassing in beauty the more laboured efforts of calculation. This investigation was inserted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> volume of the Transactions of the Edinburgh Society, which appeared in 1756. Encouraged by such success, he five years afterwards produced his Physical and Mathematical Tracts; a very ingenious and elegant work, which would have been clearer had the author only admitted an abbreviation by the simpler algebraic symbols. About this time the results of the observations of the Transit of Venus, which had been expected to give the true distance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">Sun</a>, were found to be unsatisfactory and discordant. Stewart therefore published in 1763, as a sequel to his Tracts, a theoretical solution of the problem; in which he was directed by Geometry to the exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the Lunar Apogee, a question that, since the analysis of Newton, had perplexed the greatest mathematicians. But he was not equally felicitous in Determining the Solar Distance, which required the invention of the problem, and involved some deceitful and precarious compensations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. This pamphlet was his last production, having printed only a few months before an octavo volume under the title of Propositions Mathematicae Demonstratae. These propositions, however, derive their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> merit from the manner of the author's conducting geometrical analysis and synthesis. But his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a> of genius was already nearly extinguished. Dr Stewart fell into a state of bad health, and having devolved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of teaching on his son, then a youth of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, he retired in 1772 to a small paternal property in Ayrshire, where he chiefly spent the rest of his days, and died on the 23rd of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1783.\nmuch richer invention, was likewise an able and zealous promoter of the Greek Geometry, which he directed besides to the investigation of certain difficult parts of Physical Astronomy. But though managed with sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> he employed was hardly fitted for exploring the more abstruse and recondite problems, which often require all the concentrated powers of the Modern Analysis. The conclusions at which he arrived display much elegance, though merely approximative, and devoid of the precision that is indispensable in the present advanced state of Astronomical Science.\n\nI need not stop to notice the attempts of other English mathematicians, to restore some fragments of Apollonius. After the principal demonstration was obtained, there could be little difficulty in evolving its different phases, and modifying it to the several cases. Playfair's elucidation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of Porisms is entitled to higher distinction.\n\nIt has often been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of surprise, that the Greeks should have spent so much ingenuity, and set such a high value on the Geometrical Construction of Problems. But the application of Geometry served them in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the purpose of calculation, and became a sort of substitute for the tedious and laborious operations of their imperfect system of Arithmetic. Accustomed, as we are, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> facility of computing by help of the Arabic ciphers, we can form no adequate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the toil of working with alphabetic numerals, though the Greeks had made some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> improvements in their system of notation. They could extract laboriously the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SQUARE\">Square</a> Root of a number, but never attained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">Cube</a> Root, which it appears was first discovered many centuries afterwards by the Arabians. Hence undoubtedly the solicitude of the Greeks to solve, by a Geometrical, or even a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">Mechanical</a> Construction, the famous Delian Problem, or the Duplication of the Cube.\n\nIt would seem that, in finding the square root, the Greek mathematicians must have employed certain methods of abbreviation which are not explained. Archimedes, in his famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUADRATURE\">Quadrature</a> of the Circle, to which he approximated by measuring the successive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> and circumscribing polygons, having occasion repeatedly to extract the square root, expressed the value by fractions, and yet with such felicity as always to adopt the lowest integral numerator and denominator. He thus discovered that the circumference of a circle is less than $3\\frac{1}{7}$ times and greater than $3\\frac{10}{71}$ times its diameter, or that their ratio lies between the ratios 7 to 22 and of 71 to 223. This approximation within the limits of the 2000th and 4000th parts, might be sufficient for ordinary practice. But Apollonius and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> afterwards approached a hundred times nearer. Yet no farther advances were made in solving that important problem, which required the most refined address, till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of near a thousand years, when the Arabians became possessed of the denary system of notation, and carried the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> for the circumference of a circle to ten decimal places. But this elaborate result was imperfectly known to the revivers of science in Europe; and Vieta, Adrianus Romanus, and others, exerted their ingenuity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> in extending the earlier solution. The simplest and most elegant is that of 113 to 355, an approximation differing scarcely by the ten millionth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, which was discovered about the year 1585 by the elder Adrian Metius, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> engineer in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>. His countrymen Van Keulen and Snellius, in the next century, pushed the expression for the circumference of the circle to 35 figures. But the progress of the higher analysis opened more easy and rapid modes of approximation. In the early part of the eighteenth century, Sharp and Ma-\n\n---\n\n1 This ratio, it may be observed, is easily derived from the limits assigned by Archimedes, for $71 + 7 \\times 6 = 113$, and $223 + 22 \\times 6 = 255$.\n\n2 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> Sharp, born at Little Horton, in the West Riding of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, in 1651, was apprenticed to a merchant at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>; but preferring the study of mathematics, he supported himself by teaching a school in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>. Here he engaged as amanuensis to Flamsteed, and became his assistant when the Royal Observatory was erected at Greenwich in 1676. His services were most essential in every department. He constructed optical and astronomical instruments, observed stars, calculated tables, and delineated celestial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARTS\">charts</a>. His peculiar neatness of execution is displayed in a small geometrical work which he published in 1717. About that time he seems to have retired to his native village, where he led the life of a hermit, but esteemed for his quiet and beneficent disposition. He died in 1742.\nchin computed in England the quadrature of the circle to 75 and 100 places of decimals, and Lagny in France advanced to 128 figures. But these labours were outdone by Vega, an officer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a> in the Austrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, who amused his leisure during a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a>, in employing one of Euler's formulae to derive the length of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> from the tangents of fractional arcs, carried the expression to 140 decimal places. This was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> of calculation; and though no doubt superfluous, it might at least convince any judicious person of the impossibility of stating the ratio of the diameter to the circumference in finite terms. Yet the squaring of the circle is a problem which has at all times fascinated the attention and bewildered the reason of many superficial or antiquated students in Geometry. The incom-\n\nmensurability of the circle, which James Gregory had attempted to prove in 1661, was finally demonstrated a century afterwards by Lambert, from an ingenious transformation of the known series for the quadrantial arc in terms of its tangent or the radius. The same ingenious mathematician likewise proposed several neat geometrical constructions, for approximating to the length of arcs of a circle still more nearly than the methods given by Fermat, Gregory, Huygens, and others.\n\nElementary Plane Geometry rests on the combined properties of the straight line and the circle. Many important additions have been made to the digest of Euclid; and several eminent mathematicians of the eighteenth century have corrected, simplified, and essentially improved the only valuable portion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> work. Some\n\n---\n\n1 John Machin, elected professor of Astronomy in Gresham <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> in 1713, and became secretary of the Royal Society. He had the reputation of being an able mathematician, yet his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> on the Laws of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">Moon</a>'s Motion, in which he attempted to rectify the Principe, was but a superficial performance. He died in 1751.\n\n2 This excellent mathematician, who published in 1794 a complete collection of Logarithmic Tables and Analytical Formulas, was eight years afterwards robbed and barbarously murdered by a miller, in whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> he lodged, and his body thrown into the Danube.\n\n3 It may be sufficient perhaps to notice the Elements of Geometry by Thomas Simpson, and the similar treatises in the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> by Clairaut and Legendre. These productions all unite clearness with precision; and excluding whatever appears superfluous, they still comprise the whole series of connected propositions. Simpson's unpretending volume is neat and very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a>, yet sufficiently perspicuous. The Geometry of Clairaut is still shorter, but has an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of originality, being designed to show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a>, or to guide the learner through his efforts at the solution of geometric problems, to discover the great elementary truths. He followed the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, and with more complete success, in his excellent Elements of Algebra. But the Geometry by Legendre claims much higher merit, and is perhaps the best on the whole that has yet appeared. It were vain, however, to expect perfection; the steps of his demonstrations are sometimes incomplete, and his entire separation of the problems is at least a very questionable improvement. The notes he has added are valuable, but appear disproportioned to the text, and certainly too profound for beginners. This elegant geometer attempted to found the comparison of triangles on abstract considerations derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of functions. But such restorings a priori are fallacious, involving unperceived some metaphysical assumptions.\n\nThe works now mentioned might suffice for the instruction of practical or professional men; but the pursuit of a liberal education aspires to greater attainments. The main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is to sharpen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of perception, and invigorate by due exercise the tone of the intellectual powers. For contributing to that effect, the fulness and circumspection of the ancient mode of demonstration are admirably calculated. It seemed, therefore, an estimable task to select the scattered wrecks of the Greek Analysis, and dispose them into a form accessible to ordinary students. The beauty of the propositions concerning Loci was particularly striking.\n\nIt would be preposterous, however, to hold up the Elements of Euclid as a standard of instruction in Geometry for the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. They were composed before the invention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">Trigonometry</a>, and probably designed chiefly as an introduction to the Pythagorean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>. Hence the large portion of them devoted to the relations of numbers, and the properties of the regular polygons and solids. By common consent, therefore, the greater part of the system is now laid aside, and the other books are commonly altered or curtailed in practice. Many trivial propositions occur in the third book; several of the fourth have little interest; and it may abate that extravagant praise which several mathematicians have lavished on the Doctrine of Proportion contained in the fifth book, to know that it really cannot be taught. But the language employed in that celebrated conclusion for want of appropriate technical terms, is often vague and indistinct. The word <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, for instance, has no less than three different significations; and other examples of a like confusion might be easily cited. In some cases, the demonstrations of Euclid are imperfect or inconclusive. Thus, the reasoning in the twenty-fourth proposition of the first book applies only to the particular position of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>; an objection first started by Thomas Simpson, to the great annoyance of his critical namesake. But similar oversight was made in the demonstration of the seventh proposition of the same book, which fails <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the figure be changed. Both these propositions are only of consequence as auxiliaries in the train of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>. But of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> property of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> lines, the demonstration rests on the mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> of an intricate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a>. In a few cases the reasoning is unnecessarily complicated, from the peculiar conceptions of the author. Thus, the noted fifth proposition of the first book is of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. Its demonstration implies the reversed application, at least mentally, of the isosceles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>; but Euclid evades or disguises the process, by producing the sides of the triangle, and forming two interwoven triangles, which are virtually adapted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INVERSION\">inversion</a>, and the annexed triangles being then taken away, the equality of the angles at the base hence follows. But the last is the only step wanted, and the other two were evidently superfluous. This stumbling proposition has been called the Pons Asinorum; and no wonder that the beginner should feel puzzled at seeing such a parade of argument end in so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> a result.\nremarkable propositions, derived from sources beyond the usual scope of Geometry, are yet assimilated with that science. Of such accessions, one of the most beautiful is the late curious and unexpected discovery of Gauss, that, besides the ordinary regular polygons, a numerous class more complex, including the next polygon of seventeen sides, are capable of being inscribed within a circle, by a mere geometrical construction.\n\nIn solving the common problems, the straight line and the circle are generally combined, which requires the application of both the ruler and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPASSES\">compasses</a>. Schooten effected by the ruler alone several simple constructions, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> particularly in castrametation. But the late Masechon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BERGAMO\">Bergamo</a>, in a small work which appeared in 1795, made a beautiful addition to Elementary Geometry, by the solution of a variety of problems, especially those concerning the inscription of the regular polygons, with the help exclusively of compasses. Such speculations, however, are in a great measure extraneous to the science.\n\nThe theory of Lines of the Second Order forms one of the finest speculations of the more advanced geometry. These curves were derived from the Section of the Cone; but the clearest and most philosophical way of treating them is by considering their description on a plane. The distinguishing property of the foci was known to Apollonius, but the advantage of its application overlooked. The Parabola forms the intermediate transition of the Ellipse to the Hyperbola, the remote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> stretching farther out, till it vanishes into indefinite space, again to re-appear on the opposite side. The features of the Parabola are therefore not strictly included in the phases of the Ellipse and Hyperbola. The more comprehensive relation of the distances of any point in the curve from a focus and the directrix is mentioned by Pappus, but the beauty of that locus was not perceived till Boscovich, in 1752, deduced the properties of those lines from it in a string of corollaries, more ingenious than elegant. This essay was compressed and methodized by Thomas Newton in 1794; and in the same year Walker, a respectable mathematician, unaware of what had been already done, produced a work on a similar plan, of which the first part occupied a quarto volume, composed indeed after the manner of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, but so exceedingly prolix in diction as to have very few readers.\n\nAn elegant mode of investigating curves of the second or higher orders, is to consider them as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the conditional intersection of angles or lines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> about fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>. The property had been stated generally in the Principia, but was expanded in 1720 by Maclaurin in his Geometria Organica. The intersections of Polar Radiants were discussed by Brackenridge in 1733. The subject has been again revived, and prosecuted with great ingenuity and research, by the celebrated Carnot, under the denomination of Transversals.\n\nNo part of Geometry has been more improved in the course of the last century than Trigonometry, which is not only simplified but much extended in its application. The theory of planes and solids has likewise been cultivated with eminent success. As the position of a point on a plane is assigned by referring it to two co-ordinate lines, so the place of a point in space may be determined by its distances from three planes which are mutually perpendicular. The properties of a line of single curvature may be derived from the equation of its co-ordinates; the properties of a curved surface can likewise be deduced from its triple shades, or the perpendicular projections on the three planes. Such is the process employed by Monge in his Descriptive\n\n---\n\n1 Gauss found that the expression for the multiple cosine is always decomposable into binomial factors, and hence concluded that any regular polygon, the number of whose sides is a prime, and denoted by $2^n + 1$, may be inscribed in a circle by mere Elementary Geometry. These numbers form the series 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537, &c. of which the first two only were known before.\n\n2 Born in 1759; died at Paris, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 14, 1800. His tract on the Compasses happening to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of General Bonaparte during his first triumphant campaign in Italy, this extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was so struck with its ingenuity, that, on his return to Paris, he communicated, in conversation, some of the propositions to the members of the Institute. The book was immediately translated into French, and the author promoted to a place of trust and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a> in the Italian Republic.\n\n3 Gaspard Monge, born in 1746 at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUNE\">Beaune</a>, and educated at the Jesuits' seminary at Lyons. His uncommon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> procured him admission into the Military School at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MEZIERES\">Mezieres</a>, where he soon became assistant teacher. Disgusted\nGeometry, which may be considered as the completion of the analytical method of Descartes. It furnishes direct and general solutions of several important problems, especially of those relating to the intersection of planes and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of solids. Descriptive Geometry comprehends also the theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">Perspective</a>, which was founded by Ubaldi, and long afterwards recast and simplified by Brook Taylor, and rendered still more practical by Lambert.\n\n2. ARITHMETIC.\n\nTo express large numbers by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> additions being impossible, it soon became necessary to arrange them on a scale of ascending progression. The simplest mode was evidently to repeat the same root of the scale; and as men in the earlier periods of society used to reckon with the ten fingers of both hands, they were led by Nature herself to frame the Denary System of Numeration. If they had likewise formed marks for a Digital Notation, they would have completed the bases of Arithmetic. But unfortunately the Alphabetic Characters had been introduced before distinct symbols were contrived to represent numbers. The letters designed merely for written language, came hence among all nations to be employed besides in numeral notation, though hardly manageable, and ill adapted to any regular system of arrangement. In the application of those characters the ancient Greeks showed great ingenuity, by distinguishing them into three classes, appropriated to the ascending progression of units, tens, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>. In this way they reached the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of a thousand, and by employing as an auxiliary the capital M, they could indicate myriads or ten thousands. The triple series of thousands up to a million were more easily denoted, however, by placing a dash under the successive sections of letters. But Archimedes indicated a mode of obtaining almost unbounded extension of this system, by decomposing the elements of the notation into periods of ascending myriads. Apollonius simplified the plan, by adopting a thousand as the root of the progressive scale. Had he proceeded only a little farther, and rejected the letters, except the first class denoting digits, he would have rendered his notation perfect, and have achieved one of the most useful and prolific discoveries ever made. Ptolemy afterwards advanced much nearer to this ultimate object, by employing, in his Trigonometrical Tables, the descending Sexagesimal Scale, suggested by the subdivision of the circumference of a circle into degrees, of which sixty, or the root of this scale, correspond nearly to the length of the radius. It would seem, however, that, during the interval between Archimedes and Ptolemy, the Greek Arithmetic had received some essential improvements in practice; for the Sicilian geometer, by a very tedious and operose process, of which he gives merely the results, was content with stating the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of a circle as intermediate between that of 7 to 22 and of 71 to 223, differing therefore by a 1200th part from the truth; whereas the chords computed by the astronomer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> for every half degree of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a> are correct to the last place, and consequently never deviate by a 300,000th part of the whole.\n\nWith the tedious and operose methods of calculation then practised among engineers, he sought to shorten the road by recurring to general principles and the aid of Geometry. Thinking closely on that subject, he matured a regular system, which has changed the theory of planes and solids. The ardour of his pursuits was infused into his pupils, and the frequent communications he made to learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> rapidly extended his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>. In 1790 he was joined with Besout as acting professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYDRODYNAMICS\">Hydrodynamics</a> at the Louvre, a place erected by the patriotic minister Turgot, which required him to reside at Paris only during half the year. But three years afterwards, on being appointed to succeed Bezout as Examiner of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARINE\">Marine</a>, he fixed his permanent abode in the capital, and engaged in the experiments and discussions of the philosophers. He became a warm partisan of the Revolution, and contributed his utmost efforts to promote the various plans adopted by its leaders. But he deserved praise for the great concern he took in founding the Polytechnic School, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> eventually productive of the very best effects. Having accompanied Bonaparte to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, he returned with the fruit of his observations to share in the fortunes of that wonderful man. He resumed with lustre the place of professor, and continued to delight the numerous pupils by his kind attention and the clearness and expansion of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ORAL\">oral</a> discourses. But on the second return of the Bourbons in 1815, he felt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of their vengeance. The Institute was remodelled, and the Polytechnic School suppressed. This sad reverse preyed on his spirits, and produced alienation of mind; in which melancholy state he languished for some time, and expired on the 26th July 1818.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who cared only about objects of vulgar ambition, overlooked the refined mode of Greek Notation, and remained satisfied with their own very clumsy and involved system, which could with difficulty represent a large number, but was absolutely disqualified for serving in any way the purposes of calculation. They were obliged therefore to have recourse to counters, and by help of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABACUS\">Abacus</a>, or decimal board, they performed the ordinary operations of summing accounts. This humble expedient was practised in Europe till the seventeenth century, and is still used by the traders throughout the Chinese Empire, its application being there facilitated by the prevalence of the decimal subdivision of weights, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, and coins.\n\nThe discovery of the Denary Notation, so beautiful and simple in its application, is commonly referred to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, though neither the place nor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of its origin has been ascertained. It was unknown to the Arabian astronomers till near the close of the eleventh century of our era, and even at this period its expressions appear sometimes intermingled with the alphabetic numerals. But the advantages of the system were soon perceived; and the Tables of Sines and Tangents calculated by those laborious mathematicians are now found, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the manuscripts belonging to the University of Leyden, to be correct to the tenth decimal figure. The Arabians transmitted the new system of notation to the flourishing colony of their countrymen in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, whence it was slowly communicated to the several Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">States</a> over Europe. This change was effected chiefly by the calendars or perpetual almanacs compiled in the Moorish seminaries, and eagerly purchased by the various monasteries and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a> throughout Christendom. Yet the Arabic ciphers appear to have remained unknown in every part of Europe beyond Spain, before the middle of the fourteenth century; nor in mercantile transactions were they commonly adopted till near two centuries later. It is a singular circumstance that the advantages of employing the descending progression in the nicer calculations were not sooner perceived, especially after the use which Ptolemy had made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEXAGESIMALS\">sexagesimals</a>. Stevinus was the first who distinctly introduced the practice of decimal fractions in 1585, though Regiomontanus had made a great step towards that improvement, which Ramus even indirectly employed. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> downwards might seem as easy as to reckon upwards. But the mode of denoting the ranks of decimals was then most cumbrous, the successive numerals, like the indices in Algebra, being inclosed in small circles. Bayer in 1619 proposed to substitute for these complex marks an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACCENT\">accent</a> repeated. It was our illustrious countryman Napier, however, that brought the notation of decimals to its ultimate simplicity, having proposed in his Rhabdologia, printed ten years earlier, to reject entirely the marks placed over the fractions, and merely to set a point at the end of the units. But his sublime invention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">Logarithms</a> about this epoch eclipsed every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> improvement, and as far transcended the denary notation, as this had surpassed the numeral system of the Greeks.\n\nVarious speculations have been framed regarding the properties of the different arithmetical scales. Leibnitz fancied important advantages to accrue from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of the Binary Scale, which operates with extreme facility, and requires only a single character besides the zero. This progression mounts so slowly, however, that it cannot express a large number without employing a multitude of terms. But the Duodecimal Notation, which is partially admitted in the uncial subdivisions, would evidently answer the best for general practice. It proceeds faster than the Denary Scale, and is less subject to be affected by fractions, since its root has no fewer than four divisors, while ten admits only of two. Still these advantages would not compensate for its want of conformity with the train of ordinary language. The Decimal Arithmetic would soon generally supersede the use of every other kind of fractions, if it were likewise in practice combined with an extensive decimal subdivision of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WEIGHTS_AND_MEASURES\">weights and measures</a>.\n\nThe curious or mystical properties of numbers have at all times fixed the attention of mankind. Square numbers, denoting the sides of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>-angled triangle, were sought for by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PYTHAGOREANS\">Pythagoreans</a>, who gave a very simple rule\nto compute them. Perfect numbers, or such as may be composed by the addition of their aliquot parts, could not fail to excite admiration; and Euclid produced an elegant theorem for discovering them. It is remarkable that these numbers should appear frequent at first in the series, and afterwards occur only at wide intervals. Thus, below 10,000, there are four perfect numbers; but the last of the succeeding four includes no fewer than nineteen ciphers. The moderns have advanced farther, and imagined what are called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMICABLE\">Amicable</a> numbers, on all which subjects Euler has shown his ingenuity and unrivalled analytical skill.\n\nIt is less a matter of speculation, while it is of considerable consequence in the practice of calculation, to assign the Prime Numbers, or such as admit of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, and to resolve the Composite Numbers into their several factors. No general method has yet been devised for the investigation of Primes, though by the researches of Bachet and Fermat in the seventeenth century, and of Euler, Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss, in the eighteenth, they are now reduced to certain constant forms, which may facilitate their discovery. By an extension of the method called the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a sort of mechanical process, the prime numbers are separated from the ordinary progression. In this way several authors have constructed tables of Primes, and of Composite Numbers, with their various factors or divisors. Lindenau proceeded to a hundred thousand, but Chera has lately carried the enumeration as high as ten millions.\n\nThe formation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MAGIC\">Magic</a> Squares, by which the numbers in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> order are disposed in cells, so that each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> gives an equal sum, remounts to high antiquity. They have been regarded in the east as charms or talismans, of great potency in the tide of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> affairs. The digital squares from 3 to 9 were dedicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> stars, including the sun and moon, which in the astrological visions were believed to rule the successive days of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. The people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SIAM\">Siam</a> had learned a very simple method of filling up those squares; but some European Mathematicians have since amused themselves with such arithmetical curiosities. Stifels, in his *Arithmetica Integra*, incidentally treated of Magic Squares, yet without naming them. He was immediately followed in a small arithmetical treatise by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Riese; but the French seem to have directed most attention to those scientific recreations. From the latter part of the 17th till beyond the middle of the 18th century, a succession of ingenious persons were at pains to improve and extend the construction. Frenicle, Poignard, Delahire, Ons-en-Bray, and Rallier des Ourmes, are entitled to particular notice.\n\nThe construction of Magic Squares belongs to the class of problems styled Indeterminate, which depend on variable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a>, and therefore admit of very numerous answers. Thus, Frenicle, who successfully studied this subject near the beginning of the last century, showed that the first sixteen of the natural numbers could be formed into a Magic Square in not fewer than 880 different ways. Analysts have since tried to narrow those changes, and augment the difficulty of the investigation, by annexing other conditions. Dr Franklin produced, by dint of perseverance, what he called a Magic Square of Squares, and a Magical Circle. De la Hire treated the formation of Magic Squares with such copious detail as to leave very little to be done by his successors. Yet several eminent mathematicians have occasionally reverted to this amusing subject. Even the great Euler has not disdained to direct his transcendant skill in algebraic analysis to the solution of\n\n---\n\n1 See notes to the *Elements of Geometry*. Euler has demonstrated that every number whatever consists of not more than four squares. An example may be given of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of numbers between 10 and 20: 10 = 9 + 1, 11 = 9 + 1 + 1, 12 = 9 + 1 + 1 + 1, 13 = 9 + 4, 14 = 9 + 4 + 1, 15 = 9 + 4 + 1 + 1, 17 = 16 + 1, 18 = 16 + 1 + 1, 19 = 16 + 1 + 1 + 1, 20 = 16 + 4.\n\n2 It may gratify the curious to see the series 6, 26, 496, 8128, 33550336, 8589869056, 137438691328, and 20989139001138654128. These numbers are obtained by multiplying the 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 16, 18, and 30 powers of 2 by its 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 31 divisors diminished by unit.\n\n3 The first in modern times who studied Magic Squares was Agrrippa of Nettesheim, who gave in his book *de Occulta Philosophia*, printed in 1533, the Sigilla Iovis, Martis, Solis, Venus, Mercurii, and Lunae.\n\n4 Born at Paris in 1640, and died in 1718, a man of some attainments, and great application\u2014well acquainted with the details of surveying, and of practical astronomy.\nproblems connected with the theory of Magic Squares.\n\nAnother portion of Arithmetic, not merely curious, but of material importance in the application of that science, has been much cultivated during the eighteenth century. If both the terms of a proper fraction be divided by the numerator, there <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> result an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> fraction, having unit for its numerator, and an integer, conjoined with another fraction of smaller terms, for its denominator. But this new fraction may be again broken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in the same way, and the process of decomposition renewed successively, till a fraction with an integral denominator is at length obtained. This mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> is therefore the very same as what is employed in finding a common measure or divisor, only the several quotients are here preserved. When the original fraction is expressed by rational numbers, its decomposition must always terminate; but if the numerator and denominator be mutually incommensurable, the process of evolving their elements will never draw to a conclusion. The fractions which thence arise may simply repeat, or they may circulate at short intervals or periods, or they may succeed each other without any sort of order whatever. But it is evident that such progressive subdivision must approach constantly nearer to the true value, and that the resulting fractions, if successively recombined, will exhibit a series of approximations.\n\nThe fractions of this kind were first noticed by Lord Brounker, who proposed one of them to express the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of a circle, which Dr Wallis afterwards investigated. Huygens perceived the utility of employing such fractions to represent approximate ratios, and in this way he found convenient small numbers to represent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> and pinions of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PLANETARIUM\">Planetarium</a>. But the subject appears to have lain neglected till 1737, when Euler explored it with his usual depth and felicity, in a distinct memoir published in the Petersburg Transactions. He may consequently be regarded as the real founder of the Theory of Continued Fractions, to which indeed he gave the appellation they have since retained. It was a favourite speculation of that great analyst, who resumed the subject at different times, and widely extended its application. Euler showed how to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> any quadratic equation into a Continued Fraction, and demonstrated that the expression for an irrational square root consists of terms which either repeat or circulate in regular periods. A cube root may likewise be expressed by a Continued Fraction, but its terms can have no sort of order in their sequence. As these Fractions, in approaching to their ultimate value, oscillate continually between excess and defect, they are always capable of being changed into Converging Series, affected by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> signs of plus and minus, and the transformation may be reversed. By this method the very ingenious Lambert converted the series of Gregory and Leibnitz for the length of a quadrant into a Continued Fraction, whose terms have a regular and incessant circulation, and hence proved (what had only been presumed before) that the Circle is incommensurable. But he was enabled to proceed still farther, and to establish, that even the square of the number\n\n---\n\n1 Cornelius Capito printed, in 1767, at Gl\u00fcckstadt, a short treatise on Magic Squares, in which he proposed to vary their construction no fewer than a million times. But the latest and completest work on this curious subject was compiled by the late Professor Mollweide of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEIPZIG\">Leipzig</a>, the ingenious editor of Kl\u00fcgel's valuable Mathematisches W\u00f6rterbuch.\n\n2 Born in 1620, and died in 1684; an able mathematician, but an unprincipled courtier.\n\n3 This very remarkable man was born November 23, 1616, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASHFORD\">Ashford</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>\u2014educated at Cambridge\u2014became chaplain to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> Vere in 1643, and was then led to cultivate the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECIPHERING\">deciphering</a>, in which he acquired such skill, as to be afterwards frequently employed by the Long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> in examining intercepted dispatches. Through that interest he was appointed to a sequestered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> in London, and chosen in 1644 one of the scribes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">Assembly</a> of Divines. But his austere occupation did not divert him from the nobler pursuits of philosophy and science; and being appointed by the Parliamentary commissioners in 1649, Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford, he continued regularly to discharge the duties of that office. He had afterwards some hot disputes with Hobbes, who, though a most ingenious metaphysician, unfortunately mistook his own blunders for discoveries in Mathematics. Wallis maintained a large correspondence with men of science, and assiduously contributed to the progress of philosophical discovery during that active period. The moderation of his character assured him the possession of the places he held at the Restoration; and though he found leisure to compose a very learned grammatical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> of the English language, and sometimes indulged his early taste for controversial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, he devoted the greater part of a long life to the laborious cultivation and extension of the various departments of Mathematical Science. His works are voluminous, and display great erudition, talents for deep research, and originality of conception. He died on the 28th October 1703, and was succeeded in the chair by Dr Halley.\nexpressing the circumference is likewise irrational.\\(^1\\)\n\nLagrange has since recommended and explained the application of Continued Fractions to the solution of numerical equations. These fractions may be readily changed into Recurring Series,\\(^2\\) which, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of small roots, are often beautifully simple and remarkably convergent. But sometimes they betray the opposite tendency to diverge; and the great object of Lagrange was to remove that defect. Euler, in several of his last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> and opuscules, directed them to indeterminate problems, to the finding of maxima and minima, and to the development and integration of certain analytical formulae. Nothing can exceed the beauty of some of these speculations.\n\nIt is a singular fact, that though Continued Fractions had their origin in this island, they were afterwards almost wholly overlooked by our mathematicians. Scarcely thirty years have passed away since the attention of the curious was again recalled to them. But an acquaintance with the transformation of those fractions would prove extremely useful to practical men, by furnishing a variety of short approximations, which are easily remembered and readily applied. Ordinary computations in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MENSURATION\">mensuration</a>, in the comparison of different weights and measures, and in several standard proportions, might thus be much abbreviated without any sensible inaccuracy. The method proposed by Lambert for decomposing fractions into progressions that have their denominators formed by successive multipliers, could be employed in a similar way; but its application is somewhat difficult and intricate.\\(^5\\)\n\nTo facilitate the operations of arithmetic, tables have been digested of the powers and products of numbers. The most astonishing work of that kind, including all the multipliers from one to one thousand, was produced by Hervart, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>, in 1610, only four years before the invention of Logarithms, the want of which it could in some faint degree have supplied. But tables of products in a less unwieldy shape are still occasionally used for abridging the labour of calculation. A notable improvement has been lately introduced by the substitution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">Quarter</a> Squares, grounded on the known property that the product of any two numbers is equal to the fourth part of the excess of the square of their sum above the square of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>. A single page might comprise as many of those numbers as, by simple addition and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUBTRACTION\">subtraction</a>, would exhibit an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of products equal to those contained in Hervart's enormous folio.\\(^4\\)\n\nIt would be a great improvement in elementary education to introduce into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> a more extended multiplication <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, including at least all the products of the numbers from 1 to 25. A very useful practice has been adopted lately in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of Germany, to accustom learners to the readiness of mental calculation.\\(^5\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of a circle having unit for its diameter is expressed by the alternating series \\(1 - \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{9} - \\frac{1}{16} + \\ldots\\), which was converted by Euler into the continued fraction\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{9}{2 + \\frac{25}{2 + \\frac{49}{2 + \\ldots}}}}, \\quad \\text{the numerators being the squares of the odd numbers.}\n\\]\n\nThis extension never stops, and consequently the fraction is not reducible to finite terms. The square of the expression runs into a similar infinitude.\n\n\\(^2\\) It deserves to be mentioned that Girard first gave the simple recurring series which expresses the parts of a line divided into extreme and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> ratio. It is formed by the continued addition of the two preceding terms. Thus \\(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, \\ldots\\). The square of each number in this series differs from the product of the two numbers which include it, only by unit alternately in excess and defect: Thus \\(8^2 = 64 = 5 \\times 13 - 1, 13^2 = 169 = 8 \\times 21 + 1\\).\n\n\\(^3\\) For an explication of Lambert's method of decomposing fractions, see Philosophy of Arithmetic.\n\n\\(^4\\) A large table of multiplication, from 1 to 10,000, and a specimen of quarter squares, extending to a million, may be seen in the treatise quoted above.\n\n\\(^5\\) It is called Kopfrechnung or calculating by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. Three works are current on this subject, those of Biermann, Heuss, and K\u00f6hler\u2014published between 1790 and 1816.\n3. ALGEBRA.\n\nALGEBRA derives its immense superiority over the ancient analysis from the very complete system of notation which it has at length attained. Each step of an investigation being now registered in the clearest and most precise manner, the mind is relieved from the fatigue of carrying forward the whole of a continuous chain of reasoning. It can rest at any place and again resume the process of deduction with the greatest facility. But this perfection of pictured language has been the result of a series of slow and successive improvements. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIOPHANTUS\">Diophantus</a>, who, soon after the Christian era, composed a large treatise on the resolution of certain arithmetical problems, a portion of which work is preserved, made the first attempt towards an abbreviated form of analysis. The symbols he used were, however, exceedingly few, being the initials or terminations of the ordinary words, only somewhat modified. It deserves remark, that Diophantus viewing a number as composed from another by the addition or subtraction of a third, he termed this last one abundant or deficient, and gave a rule for the multiplication of those affected numbers, similar to what is now applied to the signs plus and minus. His treatise passed into the hands of the Arabians, who studied the numerical properties with much ardour, but made no advances in refining or simplifying the form of notation. From them again this higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of arithmetic was transplanted into Italy, probably during the fourteenth century, by Leonard, a merchant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a>, who had travelled long in the East. A series of works on Arithmetic and Geometry were published between the years 1470 and 1487 by Pacioli, a Minorite Friar, who in 1494 brought out his Arte Maggiore, or what he says was vulgarly called the Regola de la Cosa, or Algebra and Almucabala, the first appellation derived from the Italian Cosa, denoting the Thing sought, and the other borrowed from the Arabic words expressing Resolution and Composition. After the appearance of this elementary digest, Algebra was cultivated in Italy, during the first half of the sixteenth century, with great industry and success. Ferreo, Tartalea, and especially Cardan, made rapid advances in the new science. This ingenious though very singular person not only gave the solution of Cubic Equations which bears his name, but discovered the leading properties of equations in general, distinguishing their roots into the true and the fictitious; and besides improved the notation by employing frequently the letters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>. The Italians, however, still used contracted words for symbols, and the initials p. and m. for the signs of plus and minus. In 1572, Bombelli of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, retaining this embarrassed mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, composed a regular summary of Algebra, which he enriched with Ferrari's rule for resolving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BIQUADRATIC\">biquadratic</a> equations. In the meanwhile the knowledge of the analytic art had penetrated into Germany, where it received its capital improvement in notation from the systematic genius of that people. The change was chiefly effected by the industry of Stifels, a Protestant minister and zealous follower of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a>, who in 1544 published his Arithmetica Integra. In that remarkable work he first introduced the symbols + and \u2014 for plus and minus, and the character \u221a (or a contracted R) for Radix or root; and he represented unknown quantities by the capital letters A, B, C, &c. and intimated the successive powers and their reciprocals by an ascending and descending series of exponents. Nor was his merit confined to algebraic writing: the en-\n\n---\n\n1 Born at Eslingen, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, in 1590, and died at Jena in 1667. Though a profound and inventive mathematician, he seems to have imbued all the wild enthusiasm of that convulsed period. Captivated perhaps by the wonderful properties of numbers, he fancied, as other ingenious persons have since done, that he could interpret the visions of the Apocalypse, and foretell the end of the world. He was so imprudent as to place that awful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> very near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. Early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of the day predicted in the year 1553, he assembled his trembling flock in a wide open field, where he endeavoured to season their minds for the tremendous change by fervid prayers and pathetic exhortations. The sky was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a>, the darkness thickened, a portentous silence prevailed, and the preacher rolled his thunders with overpowering energy. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> soon passed away, the sun shone forth in his wonted splendour, and all nature smiled. The populace recovered their agitated spirits; and now breathing rage and disdain, they chased the unlucky prophet home with volleys of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>.\nthusiasm of the age seems to have roused the spirit of invention in him; and Stifels anticipated some of the later discoveries, pointed out the nature of Logarithms, explained the properties of figurate numbers, and showed how the co-efficients of the powers of a binomial quantity may be derived from the columns of what has been since called the arithmetical triangle. Scheubel a few years afterwards pursued the same path, yet without adding anything material to the science. In this state it made its way at last into England, where Recorde, an ingenious though unfortunate man, printed the Cossic Art at London in 1553. He was the first to propose the sign = for equality, but made no other advances; and during a period of most active enterprise, till the close of the century, Algebra was not cultivated at all in this country.\n\nIn the meanwhile France continued the pursuit of the mathematical sciences. Ramus had revived those abstract studies; but Vieta, who succeeded him, and flourished between the years 1570 and 1600, rose by his numerous discoveries to much higher eminence; a lawyer by profession, yet a man of great learning, and gifted with profound and original genius, conjoined with the most indefatigable application. Vieta introduced the literal or specious Algebra, and thus rendered its procedure quite general, by employing the Roman capitals always to denote numbers, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-VOWELS\">vowels</a> being appropriated to unknown quantities. He likewise traced various distinctions, and framed several significant terms, which are still retained. But while he improved the analytical symbols, he greatly extended the theory of equations, and cultivated with success the prolific and important subject of angular sections.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a> at this period equally displayed the spirit of invention. Stevin of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BRUGES\">Bruges</a>, born about the middle of the sixteenth century, was an engineer eminently skilled both in the theory and practice of his profession, possessing great original powers of mind. He reduced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STATICS\">Statics</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">Hydrostatics</a> to their simplest principles; and in his Arithmetic or Algebra, printed in 1585, he extended the range of calculation by several fine improvements and discoveries. Marking the unknown quantity with a small circle, he denoted its power by inserting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a>; and was enabled, by prefixing a fraction, to represent also the roots. But, besides improving and simplifying the symbols, he enriched the analytic art by his inventions, and gave a general method for the resolution of numerical equations. The works of Stevin were, in 1625, collected and expanded by his countryman Girard, a man likewise of most original conception, who eagerly promoted the objects of science. Four years afterwards this editor produced a small tract exclusively his own, and full of new and ingenious deductions. He there gave a very complete theory of equations, distinguishing them into their several orders, and proving that they had always a corresponding number of roots; he showed how these roots are successively combined in forming the co-efficients of the several terms; and finally anticipated the remarkable rule discovered by Newton, to find the sums of their different powers. Girard was possessed of fancy as well as invention; and his fondness for philological speculation led him to frame new terms, and to adopt certain modes of expression which are not always strictly logical. Though he stated well the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> of the signs plus and minus, in reference to mere geometrical position, he first introduced the very inaccurate phrases of greater and less than nothing, and began the unfortunate appellation of impossible quantities.\n\nIt is indeed the reproach of modern analysis to be clothed in such loose and figurative language, which has created mysticism, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a>, and misconception. The Algebraist, confident in the accuracy of his results, whenever they\n\n---\n\n1 Robert Recorde, born of a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, about the year 1506\u2014studied at Oxford, and elected a fellow there in 1531. He embraced the medical profession, but taught mathematics at both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>, and afterwards in London, where between the years 1551 and 1557 he published several elementary treatises on Geometry and Algebra, with quaint titles. But Recorde was unfortunate, and having been thrown into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLEET\">Fleet</a> for debt, he died a prisoner in 1558.\n\n2 Albert Girard published his edition of Stevin's Arithmetic in 1629, and his own discoveries in Algebra in a small quarto at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> in 1629. He died in 1633, and his widow the year after put forth his complete collection of Stevin's works.\nbecome significant, hastens through the successive steps to a conclusion, without stopping to mark the conditions and restrictions implicated in the problem. This rapidity of operation, though in many respects most advantageous, yet affords less mental exercise than the cautious and guarded procedure of the Greeks. It will not be deemed foreign to the scope of this discourse, to remark, that the signs plus and minus confer no distinctive character, but merely indicate that the number to which they are prefixed, is to be annexed to some other number, or disjoined from it. The terms additive and subtractive would express correctly their whole import. The rules for the involution of those signs are derived from the consideration of the properties of compounds, arising from the addition or multiplication, for instance, of the binomials $a \\pm b$ and $c \\pm d$. The operation proceeds by detail; but the real meaning of the notation may be suspended, and it becomes significant only after the several members have been recombined. A number, in strict language, is altogether devoid of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, and can be reckoned neither positive or affirmative, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>, which designations are accidents, and not attributes. In proposing these terms, Vieta did not, therefore, discriminate the precise nature of the symbols; and his powerful example has continued to infect the language and darken the conceptions of algebraists. A disposition has also prevailed in modern times, of hastening to general conclusions, although the data be limited or imperfect. Such careless deductions are but awkwardly amended, by the adoption of expedients more like the fictions of lawyers than the reasonings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> logicians. The introduction of equal and impossible roots of equations served only to restrict the ordinary rules, which had been made too general, representing the number of roots as always equal to the index of the highest power. The involution or repeated multiplication of binomials will produce the successive orders of expressions, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> into equations on the supposition that any one of them vanishes or has its parts mutually balanced. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> of this proposition will not always hold true. That every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> expression is resolvable into as many binomial factors as the index of its highest power signifies. Several forms even of the quadratic or cubic expressions resist all binomial decomposition. But it is a property demonstrated, that every higher expression whatever may be resolved into binomial or trinomial factors, or into simple or quadratic elements. Impossible quantities are thus merely the symbolical exhibition of the binomial factors of a quadratic or trinomial expression which is irreducible; and\n\n---\n\n1 This distinction might perhaps have satisfied the scruples of the late venerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Maseres, who wrote an express treatise against the abuse of the Negative Sign, which he came to view with a sort of aversion as the main source of the incorrect language and vague conception so prevalent among algebraists. Though not quite entitled to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of a discoverer, that excellent person deserves a place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Mathematics, for his valuable contributions, and his zeal in unwearyed exertions to promote accurate science. He was an able geometer, a profound constitutional lawyer, a man of sound and most extensive learning, and of very general information. But he possessed the higher qualities of our nature, and combined liberality of sentiment and unbending integrity with the feelings of a kind, generous, and social disposition. His Elements of Trigonometry was the completest treatise in English at the period of its appearance. He afterwards improved the solutions of cubic and biquadratic equations, and illustrated the methods of approximating to the resolution of equations in general. But the most important service he rendered to mathematical science consists in reprinting at great expense, and chiefly for distribution, the series of original authors in logarithms, with ample annotations, in six large quarto volumes. From his anxiety to be perspicuous, he was apt to fall into the opposite extreme of tiresome prolixity.\n\nThe grandfather of Maseres was an officer in the French guards, born in the district of Bearn, and a Huguenot, who, on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, retired to Holland, and transferring his services to the Prince of Orange, accompanied the Preserver of our liberties into England, and sought by his side in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>. The grandson having embraced the profession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, was soon after the peace of 1763, probably on account of his intimate acquaintance with French language and customs, appointed Attorney General of Quebec, where he resided till 1776. At leaving his charge, he visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BOSTON\">Boston</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NEW_YORK\">New <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, while that agitation was fermenting which burst into open revolt. Soon after his return to England, he published in successive volumes his Canadian Preacher, in which he refuted the despotic maxims of Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MANSFIELD\">Mansfield</a>, and earnestly recommended conciliatory measures with our American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>. But it was a time of infatuation and disarray. Maseres by his firmness gave mortal offence to the courtiers, and never obtained any promotion, farther than the small sinecure office of Curistor Baron of Exchequer. But fortune has abundantly provided for all his wants, and he enjoyed unbroken health, and the renovating pleasures of study and social intercourse. The Baron had composed a full and learned treatise on Life Annuities, and submitted a plan for securing small pensions from Government to each of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> who could not be capable of contributing during the vigour of their days. This he concluded by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BILL\">Bill</a> which passed the Commons, but was lost in the House of Lords, through the influence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">Bishops</a>, who seem to have considered pauperism as a right appendage to their splendid ecclesiastic establishment. He died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-REIGATE\">Reigate</a> in May 1824, at the very advanced age of 98.\nthe mark of impossibility is removed, either by a change of the signs, or by a recombination that restores those factors to their primitive binomial form. Such notation may indicate the limits of a problem, and seems to originate in neglecting the previous statement of the limitations. In reference to Geometry, the impossible expressions intimate the transition of the circle into the equilateral hyperbola, or of arcs into logarithms.\n\nThe publication of the Geometry of Descartes in 1637 is justly deemed an epoch in the history of analytical science. The capacious mind of the author seized on all the preceding discoveries, and moulded them with his original inventions into a regular and comprehensive system. He gave rapidity to the writing of Algebra by the introduction of small characters, and rendered the distinction more palpable between known and unknown quantities, by the appropriation of the initial and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> letters of the alphabet. He adopted the notation of the integral exponents or indices, as reduced to its simplest form by Herigon; and this apparently very slight improvement led, in the sequel, to the most important results. Though the index was at first merely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> for the repeating of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> in the involution of powers, yet it acquired a most extensive import when it came to be treated abstractly as a number. The prefixing of the subtractive sign changed the expression into its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a>, and the substituting of a fraction converted it into the symbol of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EVOLUTION\">evolution</a> or the extraction of roots. Nothing can better illustrate the efficiency of a systematic notation, as an instrument for enabling the intellect to pursue and generalize its deductions, than the successive modifications which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> suggested in the marking of exponents, during the short period from Descartes to Newton.\n\nBut the French philosopher effected a revolution in scientific procedure, by applying (what his countryman Vieta had only partially attempted before) the symbols and calculations of Algebra to the solution of geometrical problems. By referring curve lines to co-ordinates or mutual perpendiculars, he expressed their relations by equations, of which he distinguished the rank and composition. He showed that a biquadratic equation is, by the help of indeterminate co-efficients, resolved into two quadratics, and may be constructed by combining a circle with a conic section. The construction of a cubic equation was somewhat simpler, though derived from the same principles. But Descartes proceeded still farther, and represented what are now called curves of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> curvature, by reducing them, by a series of perpendiculars, to some plane of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a>. These were all important advances in mathematical speculation.\n\nAttempts have been made to apply the Cartesian method even to Elementary Geometry, which is in fact to convert a clear and simple train of reasoning into a sort of hard mechanical process of calculation. This change, were it attainable, would be the reverse of an improvement. It would extinguish that fine study which affords the best exercise and discipline of the intellectual powers. The wonderful dexterity and readiness which men of such teeming invention as the Bernoullis, Euler, and Lagrange generally displayed in managing algebraic analysis, appear to have seduced their admirers into an over-estimate of its real advantages. The constructions derived from algebra very seldom reach the purity and elegant simplicity of the geometrical methods. In those cases where Geometry\n\n---\n\n1 A very simple problem will illustrate this: Suppose it were required, from a given point, to draw a tangent to a given circle. The construction would be, to join the centre with the given point, and upon the connecting line describe a circle to cut the former in the points of contact. It is evident, that if the given point occupied the extremity of the diameter, there would be only one point of contact; and if it lay within the circle, there could be none. This construction hence intimates sufficiently the conditions of the problem; and yet it fails in the case where the circle described merges in the given point, and consequently ceases to determine the position of the tangent. The algebraical solution, if rightly interpreted, gives similar information. Let \\( r \\) denote the radius of the given circle, and \\( s \\) the distance from its centre to the given point; then \\( \\sqrt{a^2 - r^2} \\) will express the length of the tangent, which only requires to be inflicted to the given circumference. But if the given point fall on that circumference, then \\( s = r \\) and the origin and termination of the tangent coincide, leaving its position undetermined. Again, if the given point <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> within the circle, \\( s \\) will be less than \\( r \\), and consequently the subtractive portion \\( r^2 \\) will predominate over the other portion \\( a^2 \\), and the compound radical \\( \\sqrt{a^2 - r^2} \\) become impossible. It serves to show, however, that by a change of condition the problem would be rendered soluble.\nis most felicitous, they betray the features of a clumsy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> combination. The application of Algebra should therefore be reserved for the most arduous and complicated problems in the Higher Geometry.\n\nIn the latter part of the seventeenth, and during the course of the eighteenth century, Algebra still continued to advance; and though it underwent no revolution, it acquired greater perfection in all its details. The construction of cubic and biquadratic equations, which Descartes had effected by combining a circle with a parabola, was afterwards improved; but Newton proposed the Conchoid as the curve best adapted for the practical solution of such problems. Leibnitz succeeded in conquering the irreducible case of Cardan, by a bold application of the binomial theorem, having converted the cubic roots of the compound expressions into two series, with alternate imaginary terms, which are extinguished by their conjunction. In examining generally the nature of cubic equations, their solution came afterwards to be referred to the trisection of a Circular or Hyperbolic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SECTOR\">Sector</a>, and was therefore accomplished by the application of a table either of Sines or of Logarithms. The theory of the Section of Angles and of Ratios, founded by the ingenuity of Cotes, furnished a clue to the resolution of certain forms of the Higher Equations. But though Euler solved biquadratics in a different way from that of Descartes, all attempts to find directly the roots of the fifth and the superior orders of equations had totally failed. It became necessary therefore to have recourse to the approximative methods of resolving equations. Successive improvements in the process of calculation were made by Raphson, Halley, Lagny, and Taylor; so that little seemed wanting for any practical end.\n\nDuring the last century likewise the method of series, so various and extensive in its application, was cultivated with the greatest success. About the years 1714 and 1718, Montmort\\(^1\\) and James Bernoulli employed it in the investigation of the Laws of Chance. But De Moivre,\\(^2\\) a French refugee, and a man of learning and profound science, carried these researches much farther, having devoted his time professionally to the calculation of probabilities, and of the values of life-annuities. In 1730, he published an original work, which, besides other useful inventions, explained the properties of a Recurring Series, that always repeats the same succession of co-efficients in distinct sequences. About the same time, Stirling\\(^3\\) brought out a complete treatise on Series, in which he advanced by a different road to consider their convergence, interpolation, and summation. This ingenious\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A man of some rank, and an able mathematician, born in 1673 at Paris, where he died in 1719.\n\n\\(^2\\) Abraham De Moivre, born in 1667 at Vitri in Champagne. Being a Protestant, he was obliged at the age of eighteen to seek shelter in England after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Having shown an early taste for Mathematics, he continued to prosecute the study as a profession. He supported himself creditably in exile, by giving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> and reading public lectures. His analytical discoveries extended his fame, and his good conduct insured him respect. He embraced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NEWTONIAN_PHILOSOPHY\">Newtonian Philosophy</a>, and made some improvements on it. He generalized Cotes' famous theorem of the section of a circle, but turned his attention chiefly to the method of series, which he applied successfully to the doctrine of annuities and chances. After his reputation for such calculations had been established, it is said that he spent a great part of the day at Slaughter's Coffee-House, in St Martin's Lane, where he was ready to answer any question of that nature propounded to him, for the fee of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GUINEA\">guinea</a>. His principal work on the Doctrine of Chances was published in 1738, but the enlarged and improved edition bears date 1756. De Moivre lived to a great age, but in his advanced years he was subject to obstinate fits of sleeping, and in that torpid state he remained for at least seven weeks, till death closed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> in November 1754.\n\n\\(^3\\) James Stirling, born about the year 1690 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-STIRLINGSHIRE\">Stirlingshire</a>, where his father owned a small property. He was educated at Glasgow, and sent by that University on Snell's Foundation to Balliol College in Oxford. During his retreat there he applied himself so diligently to the study of Mathematics, that he printed in 1717 a small tract on Lines of the Third Order, with new solutions of one or two difficult problems by the fluxionary calculus. He then repaired to London, and becoming acquainted with the Younger Maimonides, he accepted an invitation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, where he resided several years, and taught Mathematics. The vicinity of Pascal gave him an opportunity of acquiring the friendship of Nicholas Bernoulli, nephew of the two elder Bernoullis, who was Mathematical Professor in the University. During his stay at Venice, Stirling contrived to gain access to the manufacture of glass plates, and escaping at some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> risk, he is said to have transferred the secret to England. He now conducted a mathematical or nautical school on Tower Hill, while he maintained a correspondence with the philosophers both abroad and at home. Here he published his great work on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFERENTIAL\">Differential</a> Method and Series in 1730. After toiling in his academy several years, he was induced to leave London, and undertake the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">Mines</a> at Leadhills in Scotland. In that elevated district near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANQUHAR\">Sanquhar</a> he resided during the rest of his life, and by his skill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> he greatly improved the operations of extracting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> ore. He now held a profitable employment, but his high mathematical fame would have secured him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of succeeding Maclaurin in 1746, if he had not at that unhappy period been tainted with Jacobite principles. In his latter years he seems to have confined his attention to practical concerns, and died at Leadhills in 1772.\nmathematician followed no general procedure, but showed great felicity and address in transforming one series into another. The subject was at different times partially extended by Simpson, Maclaurin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LANDEN\">Landen</a>, Lorgna, Hutton, Waring, Pfaff, and Kramp. Euler handled Series with his usual fulness, perspicuity, and penetration; and yet Lagrange and Laplace, in surveying that field, have gleaned fresh discoveries, which the latter of these illustrious men applied most happily to develope the Theory of Probabilities.\n\nThe composition of equations was at the same time investigated with more address and precision. The rule for distinguishing the positive and negative roots from the alternating signs, which Descartes had merely stated, now received a strict demonstration by Segner. The mode of finding the impossible roots, or rather the quadratic factors, of an equation, which Newton probably had inferred from mere induction, was traced by Maclaurin to its real source. D'Alembert proved that every irrational expression is reducible to the form $A^2 = \\sqrt{B^2}$; or, in other words, that every compound expression of a higher order may be resolved either into simple or quadratic factors. This is the most important conclusion perhaps relating to the nature of equations. But the general theory was never so clearly and completely discussed as by Gauss, in a small work published by him in 1779. Various methods, and several of them elegant, have been proposed by Euler and others for simplifying and expediting the approximation to the roots of equations. When a question involved the powers and products of more than one unknown quantity, it exercised the skill of algebraists to separate them; but Bezout has brought the mode of this elimination into a regular system, which removes all the difficulties. Among the promoters of Algebraical Science may be ranked our countryman Dr Waring, a profound analyst, but unfortunately an obscure and confused writer. His Miscellanea Analytica and other detached pieces discover uncommon penetration and originality of conception, and though neglected at home, they have, notwithstanding their repulsive form, been duly appreciated by the great mathematicians on the Continent.\n\nThe latest improvement that Algebra has received consists in the Combinatorial Analysis, which may be viewed as an important extension of the principles of the binomial theorem. Vieta traced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of the doctrine, which was successively enlarged by Mersenne, Guldinus, Schooten, Pascal, Wallis, James Bernoulli, De Moivre, and Euler. But it has received its greatest expansion in Germany, and chiefly from the laborious and persevering researches of Hindenburg, who first published a tract on this subject in 1779, and resumed the discussion in the years 1793, 1794, and 1795. He was followed in the same line of investigation by Bureckhardt, Rothe, De Prassi, and Pfaff; and this interesting branch of analysis now forms a part of the algebraical course pursued in the German States. It throws much light on the theory of equations, renders more general the method of series, and facilitates the calculation of chances.\n\nIn the application of Algebra to Geometry, Euler, pursuing the route marked out in 1727 by Frederick Mayer, has given such extension to the properties of Angular Sections, as to create almost a new science, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the appellation of the Arithmetic of Series. Vieta prepared the\n\n---\n\n1 Stephen Bezout, born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NEMOURS\">Nemours</a> on the 31st March 1730\u2014led accidentally to the study of Geometry, and fired by the perusal of the El\u00e9gies of Fontenelle. Having soon distinguished himself by proficiency in Mathematical Science, he was appointed Examiner to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NAVY\">Navy</a> in 1763, and Examiner of the Artillery Department 1768. In the discharge of his duty in those offices, he gained the love and respect of the youth by his impartiality, kindness, and solicitude for their advancement. He published The General Theory of Equations in 1779, and gave further proofs of his original inventive powers in other occasional Memoirs. But he owed his celebrity chiefly to the excellent Course of Mathematics compiled for professional education, which is highly esteemed and generally adopted on the Continent. The constitution of Bezout was prematurely exhausted, and he died of a malignant fever on the 27th of September 1783.\n\n2 Edward Waring, born near Shrewsbury in 1736. He studied at Cambridge, where he distinguished himself so much in abstruse calculations, that he was elected, after a hard contest, Lucasian professor of Mathematics in January 1760. He led the life of a recluse student, and though a man of great worth, he was unloved by his extreme diffidence for the general intercourse of society. His latter years appear to have been spent at his place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NATIVITY\">nativity</a>, where he died on the 15th August 1798. Waring had not entirely confined his application to mathematical research; he printed a metaphysical tract of considerable merit, which was distributed among his friends; and it deserves mention, that he there distinctly brought forward the philosophical view of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAUSATION\">Causation</a> which is now very generally embraced.\nway, and the Bernoullis had advanced far in the research, but it was reserved for their great disciple to expand and convert their conclusions into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> body of doctrine. This important branch of Analysis has continued to be much cultivated in Germany, under the more expressive name of Goniometry, which was first applied by Lagney in the Parisian Transactions for 1724, to an ingenious method proposed by him for measuring angles. Pfaff has lately enlarged it with the properties of the multiple tangents, and his countryman Mollweide has likewise made some valuable additions. The store of formulae now collected is of the utmost utility in transforming and reducing into practical operation the different series adopted by Physical Astronomy.\n\nAlgebra has also been applied with advantage to Goniometry generally, as comprehending the solution of the cases both in Plane and Spherical Trigonometry. This was early attempted by Girard, but carried to its completion by Euler and Lagrange. Some concise and elegant formulae have been deduced, which facilitate and diversify the practice of computation. In short, if Algebra were purged of the vicious language and inaccurate conceptions that pervade it, and which were early introduced by the confidence of rapid and careless calculators, it might at last claim the character of a perfect science.\n\nThe number of elementary treatises of Algebra which have been produced in various languages during the currency of the eighteenth century, appears quite incredible. They are almost ephemeral, and assume every feature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a>, superficial or profound, from the size of a primer to the magnitude of a lexicon. A very few of those works claim the highest praise, and may retain their hold of education. The Algebra of Euler is in various respects a most remarkable production. That illustrious analyst, when totally deprived of sight in his advanced age, dictated it in the German language to a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a>, whom he trained for an amanuensis. He was obliged therefore to be plain, distinct, and perspicuous; and these qualities he combined with richness of invention. The second volume had an air of originality, which made it peculiarly interesting. It treated of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIOPHANTINE_PROBLEMS\">Diophantine Problems</a>, and the resolution of Indeterminate Equations, and was afterwards expanded in the French version by the masterly annotations of Lagrange. In our own language, MacLaurin's Elements of Algebra, though a posthumous work, is perhaps the ablest on the whole, and the most complete. The bulky volumes of Dr Sanderson, which were likewise printed after the death of the author, are commendable chiefly as the production of an ingenious person, afflicted from infancy with the calamity of total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>; they have little claims to depth, originality, or logical precision, but possess the merit of being eminently clear, methodical, and copious even to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>. The Algebra of Thomas Simpson is a work of an opposite description\u2014brief, condensed, and marked with traits of invention. Passing over the numerous smaller treatises which have run through the schools, the compilation of Emerson deserves notice. It forms part of the Cyclomathesis, or\n\n---\n\n1 This consists in performing by the help of compasses a repeated decomposition, similar to what is effected in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of a common to a continued fraction. There being in practice generally a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> of errors, the numerical relation hence derived approximates to great precision. The method may be applied to the comparison either of arcs or of straight lines.\n\n2 The collection of formulae by Hirsch deserves particular commendation.\n\n3 A very simple and regular method of solving such questions is given in the second volume of the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\n\n4 Nicholas Sanderson, born at Thurlestone in Yorkshire in 1682. When only twelve months old, he lost both eyeballs by small-pox; but showing early capacity, he was sent to the free-school at Penistone, where he made great proficiency in the knowledge of the classics, and soon understood the works of the ancient Geometers when read to him in the original Greek. He afterwards profited by the kind instructions of some mathematical friends, and found himself so far advanced in science, that at the age of 25 he repaired to Cambridge, and established his fame in that university by the warmth and splendour of his lectures on the Newtonian Philosophy. He was encouraged by the gentleness of Whiston, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> no rival; and, on the ejection of that amiable enthusiast in 1711 for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> or dogmatism, succeeded to the Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics, the duties of which he continued henceforth to perform with zeal and assiduity. The faculties of touch and hearing he possessed in a wonderful degree; and he was a lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, breathing a free and open conversation. But sedentary habits impaired his vigorous constitution, and he died of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> on the 19th of April 1739.\n\n5 William Emerson, born in June 1701 at Hurworth, a village near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DARLINGTON\">Darlington</a>\u2014the son of a schoolmaster, who taught him Mathematics, and left him a small property, which he occupied and cultivated.

Nothing is more wanted for the purpose of education than a classical treatise on Algebra, which, avoiding all vague terms and hasty analogies, should unfold the principles with simplicity and rigid accuracy, and follow the train of induction with close and philosophical circumspection.\n\n4. THE HIGHER CALCULUS.\n\nLeibnitz, at his death, left the Calculus which he had framed in a most flourishing condition. The superiority of its algorithm, joined to the ardour of his disciples and successors the Bernoullis, gave it the complete possession of the Continent. But in England, the Method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FLUXIONS\">Fluxions</a>, now greatly in arrear, was cultivated only by a very few aspirants. Its inventor had vacillated about the notation he should adopt, and the unfortunate marking by points appeared the first time in one of the volumes of Dr Wallis' works, printed in 1699. Newton had published nothing separately on the subject, till the Tract on Fluxions, drawn from the recesses of his closet, made its appearance in 1704; which, though full of ingenuity, was then decidedly imperfect and insufficient. But Cotes and Taylor laboured successfully in extending the analytical discoveries of their great master. The former, one of the brightest mathematicians whom England has produced, died at an early age, after achieving, however, some fine analytical discoveries. Besides producing the beautiful geometrical theorem on which is founded the application of Binomial Factors, he constructed an ample Table of Fluxes or Integrals, which were solved by the decomposition of fractions, by Logarithms or Circular Arcs. Other ingenious problems are introduced in his posthumous volume entitled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONIA\">Harmonia</a> Mensurarum, published in 1722 by his relative and successor Dr Smith; but for want of the author's revision, this profound tract is unluckily so concise and obscure as to need a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a>. Some of the propositions were neatly demonstrated by John Bernoulli; but De Moivre considerably extended the doctrine, which was afterwards reduced into a systematic form by Walmesley.\n\nDr Brook Taylor was a man of rich invention and elegant accomplishments, who supported with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> the reputation of English science. He was indeed our only mathematician that,\n\nand considerable talent of invention; but affected singularity, and indulged coarse boorish habits. Having a mechanical turn, he constructed his own instruments, and delineated all the figures he wanted. His best work, perhaps, was the treatise of Increments, but his System of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a> has had the greatest currency among all ranks of students. In the decline of life he suffered much from the cruel attacks of gout, and died after a lingering illness on the 20th May 1762.\n\nThe earliest mode used by Newton for denoting Fluxions seems to have been a zero prefixed to the variable quantity. Thus, the fluxion of $x^2$ was written $x^{2-1} \\cdot dx$. It is evident therefore that the great inventor must have then had nearly the same conception of the Infinitesimals as his rival Leibnitz.\n\nRoger Cotes, born July 10, 1682, at Burwash in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEICESTERSHIRE\">Leicestershire</a>, of which his father was rector. Having shown an early and decided inclination to Mathematics, he was encouraged by his uncle, the Rev. John Smith, who carried the boy to his house in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LINCOLNSHIRE\">Lincolnshire</a>, and carefully instructed him in the principles of science. Hence he removed to St Paul's school, where he made great progress in classical attainments, but still found leisure to cultivate his favourite studies. Thus accomplished, he was sent to Trinity College at Cambridge, and advanced through all the gradations with unrivalled distinction. In January 1706, he was elected unanimously to the chair of Astronomy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Experimental Philosophy</a>, which had been just founded by Archdeacon Plume. He took orders in 1713, and at the desire of Dr Bentley superintended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> of the second edition of the Principia, to which he furnished a learned and ingenious preface. His genius and uncommon talents had raised the highest expectations, when a putrid fever snatched him away in the full tide of vigour, on the 5th of June 1716. Newton in his latter days used often to exclaim with a modest feeling of regret, \"If Cotes had lived we should have known something.\" This very promising philosopher was perhaps rather fastidious; for, except a short but ingenious essay on Logarithms, he produced nothing of decided importance during his lifetime. The papers left by him in an imperfect and unfinished state were collected and published with some annotations by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a> and successor Dr Robert Smith.\n\nBorn in affluent circumstances at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EDMONTON\">Edmonton</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a> in 1655; studied at Cambridge, where he distinguished himself, and passed through the successive gradations with the greatest applause. The mathematical and physical sciences were his favourite pursuits, but he embraced general learning and cultivated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">fine arts</a>, being especially fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> and music. Fortune enabled him to indulge his taste. He held the office of Secretary to the Royal Society for a few years, and afterwards visited the Continent. His mind was most acute and inventive; but, though methodical on the whole, he was at no pains to unfold his original conceptions. He died at an early age in 1731.\nafter the retreat of Newton, could safely enter the lists with the Bernoullis. His most original work, the *Methodus Incrementorum*, published in 1715, unfolded the elements of the increase and decrease of a variable quantity or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>. It was a fine extension of the Differential or Fluxionary Calculus, and constituted a new and important branch of the Higher Analysis, which has since received an appropriate algorithm, and acquired the appellation of *Finite Differences*. The *Method of Increments* was applied to the summation of series, and a variety of difficult problems, of which it afforded easy and rapid solutions. It furnished the first investigation of the motions of a vibrating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>, showing that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONIC\">harmonic</a> curve is a Trochoid or Prolate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYCLOID\">Cycloid</a>. Among other improvements, it contained the celebrated theorem for the expansion of a magnitude, arising from the combination of its successive orders of differentials, which has deservedly retained the name of its ingenious author. This elegant formula is of extensive use in almost every analytical inquiry, and even performs the inverse process of Fluxions, by exhibiting in many cases at once the resulting fluent or integral. But the notation employed was imperfect, consisting merely of accents instead of points; and the Tract, like other works of Taylor, affected a degree of brevity which borders on obscurity. It was therefore elucidated by Nicole, an eminent French mathematician, in a series of able dissertations, between the years 1717 and 1727. The Taylorian Theorem itself has been successively modified, transformed, and extended by Maclaurin, Lagrange, and Laplace, whose names are attached to their several formul\u00e6.\n\nThe Italian mathematicians contributed materially to the progress of the Higher Calculus. The Integration of a class of Differential Equations was proposed by Count Riccati, and solved in different ways by himself and the sons and nephews of the first Bernoullis. Manfredi\\(^1\\) in 1707 gave a skilful solution of differential equations of the first degree; and in 1722, Vincent, the son of James Riccati, pursued likewise the same road. A curious kind of problems was started by Fagnano,\\(^2\\) another Italian Count, to determine those Elliptical or Hyperbolic Arcs, which have their difference expressed by an algebraical quantity. This led Euler, in 1756, to invent a very comprehensive method of determining particular integrals, that Lagrange improved in 1766 and 1769, and which he himself again simplified in 1778. Our ingenious countryman Landen has chanced to fall into a similar train, having in 1775 converted the formula for the rectification of the Hyperbola into another which includes two arcs of an Ellipse, together with an algebraical quantity. The rectification of the Ellipse has been since improved by Legendre and Ivory.\n\nTo obtain the differential of any integral expression, is always practicable; the great difficulty consists in reversing the problem, and finding the integral which corresponds to a given differential equation. Such equation must be rendered complete before the integration is effected. It was hence a question of much importance, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> unavailing efforts, by determining the conditions necessarily required for integration. Euler, as usual, was the first to discover the rule in 1736; but, only three years afterwards, it was without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> produced by Fontaine and Clairaut. At a later period, Euler extended the conditions of integrability to the higher orders of Differential Equations, which Condorcet demonstrated with equal simplicity and elegance.\n\nThe Modern Analysis thus constantly advancing, received a capital extension about the middle of the last century, by what is termed the *Calculus of Partial Differences*, which applies with singular felicity to the solution of the most arduous and recondite physical problems. It would be difficult to communicate any distinct conception of this subtle doctrine to the uninitiated, but the object proposed may be stated generally as, the method of finding the function of several\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Born at Bologna in 1674\u2014appointed professor of Mathematics there in 1696, and astronomer to the Institute of Bologna in 1711.

His mathematical researches were published in two volumes quarto, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PESARO\">Pesaro</a>, in 1750. He devoted much attention to the remarkable properties of the curves called Lemniscata.\nvariable quantities, from the relation merely of the Differential Co-efficients contained in their Complete Differential. The first specimen of this sort of Integration was given by Euler in 1734; but D'Alembert expanded the process in his Discourse on the General Cause of Winds, which appeared in 1749. It was likewise employed by both these illustrious mathematicians in the rigorous solution of the problem of the vibrating musical string, the position of any point in the harmonic curve depending evidently on the interval of time, as well as on the relation between the absciss and ordinate. But Euler left nothing unfinished. In 1762 he resumed the subject of Partial Differences, and gave a complete explication of its principles, embodying the mode of calculation by an appropriate Algorithm, in a memoir of the Petersburg Acts, entitled, Investigatio functionum ex data differentia- lium conditione. But still further progress was made by him in the third volume of his immortal work on the Differential and Integral Calculus, which came out in 1770. Euler, having then advanced to differential equations of the second order, digested the whole doctrine of Partial Differences into a clear and systematic form. Yet several important additions and improvements have been since contributed to this intricate subject by Lagrange and Laplace, by Nieuport and Trembley.\n\nThe last great accession to the Higher Analysis, and somewhat resembling the method of Partial Differences, is the Calculus of Variations. Of this fine theory, the first trace was shown by the rapid genius of Leibnitz, in his mode of differentiating a curve whose equation itself is supposed to undergo the minutest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>. The controversies of the Bernoullis concerning Isoperimeters and Lines of the Swiftest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">Descent</a>, augmented greatly the various resources of that kind of Analysis. But Euler, combining their discoveries, produced a new and direct mode of finding such Maxima and Minima, and compressed the solutions into a systematic form, in a distinct treatise published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAUSANNE\">Lausanne</a> in 1744. This elaborate performance led the way for the simpler and most elegant and comprehensive doctrine created by the early genius of Lagrange, and invested by him with a commodious notation.\n\nEuler, who was far superior to any feeling of jealousy, readily embraced this improvement, and bestowed on it the denomination of the Calculus of Variations, of which he explained the principles and application, after the most complete manner, in a tract appended to the third volume of his great work. The distinction between Differentials and Variations is rather subtle, yet may be easily conceived by considering the nature of the Parabola. When an ordinate shifts into a proximate position, both it and the corresponding absciss acquire Differentials; but if the Parameter suffer the minutest alteration, the whole trace of the curve will vary, and the infinitesimal mutation which the ordinate thence undergoes is termed its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">Variation</a>. The algorithm adopted to denote Variations consists of the Greek letters instead of the Roman or Italic, which have been appropriated to the ordinary Differentials. The modes of Integration used in both forms are fortunately convertible.\n\nThe Integration of Differential Equations has at length, perhaps, nearly attained that degree of perfection of which it is susceptible. A multitude of expedients are devised for effecting the process in particular cases, but no general and direct method has been yet found. To integrate a differential equation of the first order composed of two variable quantities, is the problem originally known by the title of the Inverse Method of Tangents, and is commonly solved by the separation of the indeterminate members, which brings it to a question of Quadratures. Some equations consist of parts which, though not separately integrable, will yet admit of integration when combined. Others are integrated by the inverse method of factors; but the process by successive approximations may be regarded as in most cases the preferable mode. The skill of the analyst is chiefly displayed in the evolution of series the most converging.\n\nOf the Theory of the Infinitesimal Calculus, various modifications have been offered during the course of the eighteenth century, which help to elucidate the subject by their contrast, and may be regarded as fine speculations, though they should lead to no material improvements in the practice. The notion of flowing quantities,\nfirst proposed by Newton, and from which he framed the terms Fluxions and Fluents, appears, on the whole, very clear and satisfactory; nor should the metaphysical objection of introducing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of motion into Geometry have much weight. Maclaurin was induced, however, by such cavilling, to devote half a volume to an able but superfluous discussion of this question. As a refinement on the ancient process of Exhaustions, the noted method of Prime and Ultimate Ratios, or of the Relations of Vanishing or Evanescent Quantities, which Newton preferred in the Principia, deserves the highest praise for accuracy of conception. It has been justly commended by D'Alembert, who expounded it copiously, and adopted it as the basis of the Higher Calculus. The same doctrine was likewise elucidated by our acute countryman Robins, who did not scruple to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> the occasion of making a coarse attack on the great Euler. Landen, one of those men so frequent in England whose talents surmount their narrow education, produced, in 1758, a new form of the Fluxionary Calculus, under the title of Residual Analysis, which, though framed with little elegance, may be deemed, on the whole, an improvement on the method of ultimate ratios. To confer more consequence on his innovation, he contrived likewise a set of symbols, and applied his algorithm to the solution of different problems. But it never obtained any currency, and soon fell into oblivion.\n\nThe method of Analytical or Derivative Functions, which has since acquired such celebrity, was darkly anticipated by Dr Waring, one of the profoundest but most obscure of algebraical writers. This elegant theory was concisely sketched by Lagrange in 1772, and enlarged thirty years afterwards into a distinct work; the same subject having been treated very fully and somewhat differently by Arbogast in 1800. It is grounded chiefly on the inversion of Taylor's theorem, the co-efficients of the several terms of a Derived or Expanded Function involving the successive orders of its Differentials. But Lagrange deduces the formula from considerations purely analytical, and endeavours thence to erect a science on strict logical principles, entirely disengaged from ideas of Infinitesimals or of Vanishing Ratios. It may however be doubted whether, with all his ingenuity, he has attained that object, or gained, indeed, any real advantage. A mathematician so deeply imbued as that sublime genius with the spirit of calculation, would almost spontaneously regard a process of analysis in the same light as a train of legitimate reasoning. However satisfactory may seem the origin of Derivative Functions, if we examine it closely, we shall probably find the demonstration to rest merely on the strength of analogy, which surely is not the most conclusive sort of argument. But though the method of Derivations should not possess that logical superiority over the Fluxionary or Differential Calcu-\n\n---\n\n4 Benjamin Robins, born of Quaker parents at Bath in 1707.

Mathematics were his favourite study, but he enriched his mind by a course of extensive reading and the pursuit of general information. He became a successful teacher of those sciences in London, and turned his attention to their practical application.

In 1762 he was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> to Earl Fitzwilliam, an employment which he held till within two years of his death. Besides his separate publications, he communicated to the Royal Society, at different times, valuable papers on the most difficult parts of mathematical and physical sciences, all of them distinguished by depth, ingenuity, and powerful invention. It is only to be regretted that, perhaps for want of the collision of society, he indulged a dogmatic and pugnacious temper. He died near his native spot on the 15th of January 1790.\n\n6 An example will show how Landen's operation might be simplified.

But it is evident that the closer \\( x \\) comes to \\( v \\), the nearer will each of these terms approximate to \\( x^{n-1} \\). Therefore, at the coincidence of \\( x \\) with \\( v \\), the differential of \\( x^n \\) divided by the differential of \\( x \\) is \\( x^{n-1} \\), and consequently \\( dx^n = x^{n-1} dx \\).\nlus which its author fondly supposed, yet is the invention entitled to the highest praise for its beautiful perspicuity and its ready and most extensive application. We have only to regret that it has required a new system of characters, when the ordinary notation has become so familiar, and attained so great perfection.

At the age of nineteen he took a part with others, some of whom became the most memorable men of their time, in the foundation of a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, under the name of \"the Academy of Physics.\"\n\nThe character of Dr Brown is very attractive, as an example of one in whom the utmost tenderness of affection, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> of a flowery fancy, were not repressed by the highest cultivation, and by a perhaps excessive refinement of intellect. His mind soared and roamed through every region of philosophy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>; but his untravelled heart clung to the hearth of his father, to the children who shared it with him, and after them, first to the other partners of his childish sports, and then almost solely to those companions of his youthful studies who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be the friends of his life. Speculation seemed to keep his kindness at home. It is observable, that though sparkling with fancy, he does not seem to have been deeply or durably touched by those affections which are lighted at its torch, or at least tinged with its colours. His heart sought little abroad, but contentedly dwelt in his family and in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>. He was one of those men of genius who repaid the tender care of a mother by rocking the cradle of her reposeful age. He ended a life spent in searching for truth, and exercising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, by desiring that he should be buried in his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>, with his \"dear father and mother.\" Some of these delightful qualities were perhaps hidden from the casual observer in general society, by the want of that perfect simplicity of manner which is doubtless their natural representative.

Moncreiff's Life of the Reverend Dr Erskine.\n2 Welsh's Life of Brown, p. 77, and App. p. 496.\n3 A part of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>'s minutes is here borrowed from Mr Welsh.\u2014\"7th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1757.\u2014Present, Mr Erskine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a>\u2014Mr Brougham, Mr Reddie, Mr Brown, Mr Birbeck, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>,\" &c. who were afterwards joined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Webb Seymour, Messrs Horner, Jeffrey, Smyth, &c. Mr Erskine, who thus appears at the head of so remarkable an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>, and whose diffidence and untoward circumstances have hitherto withheld from the full manifestation of his powers, continued to be the bosom friend of Brown to the last, and showed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> of his friendship for others by converting all his invaluable preparations for a translation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SULTAN\">Sultan</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BABER\">Baber</a>'s Commentaries (perhaps the best, certainly the most European work of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> eastern prose) into the means of completing the imperfect attempt of Leyden; with a regard equally generous to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of his early friend, and to the comfort of that friend's surviving relations. The review of Baber's Commentaries, by Mr Silvius, appeared in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> for May and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1828, and is one of the best specimens extant of the value of literary commendation when it is bestowed with conscientious calmness, and without a suspicion of bias, by one of the greatest orientalists, in a case where he pronounces every thing to have been done by Mr Erskine \"which could have been performed by the most learned and the most scrupulously conscientious of editors and translators.\"\nunfortunate attempts of some others, to take by violence the admiration of those with whom they do not associate with ease. The association with unlike or superior companions which least distorts manners, is that which takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> with those classes whose secure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> generally renders their own manners easy; with whom the art of pleasing or of not displeasing each other in society is a serious concern; who have leisure enough to discover the positive and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> parts of the smaller moralities; and who, being trained to a watchful eye on what is ludicrous, apply the lash of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> to affectation, the most ridiculous of faults. The busy in every department of life are too respectably occupied to form these manners or to bestow them. They are the frivolous work of polished idleness; and perhaps their most serious value consists in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol21.html#article-WAR\">war</a> which they wage against affectation; though even there they betray their nature in punishing it, not as a deviation from nature, but as a badge of vulgarity.\n\nThe prose of Dr Brown is brilliant to excess. It must not be denied that its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> is sometimes womanly; that it too often melts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> precision into elegance; that it buries the main idea under a load of illustration, of which every part is expanded and adorned with such visible labour, as to withdraw the mind from attention to the thoughts which it professes to introduce more easily into the understanding. It is darkened by excessive brightness; it loses ease and liveliness by over-dress; and, in the midst of its luscious sweetness, we wish for the striking and homely illustrations of Tucker, and for the pithy and sinewy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of Paley, either of whom, by a single short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-METAPHOR\">metaphor</a> from a familiar, perhaps a low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, could at one blow set the two worlds of reason and fancy in movement.\n\nIt would be unjust to censure severely the declamatory parts of his Lectures; they are excusable in the first warmth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>. They might even be justifiable allurements in attracting young hearers to abstruse speculations. Had he lived, he would probably have taken his thoughts out of the declamatory forms of spoken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, and given to them the appearance, as well as the reality, of deep and subtile discussion. The habits indeed of so successful a lecturer, and the natural luxuriancy of his mind, could not fail to have somewhat tinctured all his compositions; but though he might still have fallen short of simplicity, he certainly would have avoided much of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>, and even common-place, which hang heavily on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> and brilliant thoughts; for it must be owned, that though, as a thinker, he is unusually original, yet when he falls among the declaimers, he is infected by their common-places.\n\nIn like manner, he would assuredly have shortened or left out many of the poetical quotations which he loved to recite, and which hearers even beyond youth hear with delight. There are two very different sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of poetry to be found in works on philosophy, which are as far asunder from each other in value as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. A philosopher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> admit some of those wonderful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> or words which bring to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> the infinite varieties of character, the furious bursts or wily workings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, the winding approaches of temptation, the slippery path to depravity, the beauty of tenderness, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> of what is awful and holy in man. In every such quotation, the moral philosopher, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he be successful, uses the best materials of his science; for what are they but the results of experiment and observation on the human heart, performed by artists of far other skill and power than his? They are facts which could have only been ascertained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, by Dante, by Shakspeare, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CERVANTES\">Cervantes</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>. Every year of admiration since the unknown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> when the Iliad first gave delight, has extorted new proofs of the justness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of human nature, from the responding hearts of the admirers. Every strong feeling which these masters have excited is a successful repetition of their original experiment, and a continually growing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of the greatness of their discoveries. Quotations of this nature may be the most satisfactory, as well as the most delightful, proofs of philosophical positions. Others of inferior merit are not to be interdicted: a pointed maxim, especially when familiar, pleases, and is recollected. I cannot entirely conquer my passion for the Roman and Stoical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a> of some passages in Lucan and Akenside. But\nquotations from those who have written on philosophy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>, or, in other words, from those who generally are inferior philosophers, and voluntarily deliver their doctrines in the most disadvantageous form, seem to be unreasonable. It is agreeable, no doubt, to the philosopher, still more to the youthful student, to meet his abstruse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> clothed in the sonorous verse of Akenside. The surprise of the unexpected union of verse with science is a very lawful enjoyment. But such slight and momentary pleasures, though they may tempt the writer to display them, do not excuse a vain effort to obtrude them on the sympathy of the searcher after truth in after-times. It is peculiarly unlucky that Dr Brown should have sought supposed ornament from the moral common-places of Thomson, rather than from that illustration of philosophy which is really to be found in his picturesque strokes.\n\nMuch more need not be said of Dr Brown's own poetry, somewhat voluminous as it is, than that it indicates fancy and feeling, and rose at least to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of an elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a>. It may seem a paradox, but it appears to me that he is really most poetical in those poems and passages which have the most properly metaphysical character. For every various form of life and nature, when it is habitually contemplated, may inspire feeling; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> representation of these feelings may be poetical. Dr Brown observed man, and his wider world, with the eye of a metaphysician; and the dark results of such contemplations, when he reviewed them, often filled his soul with feelings which, being both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and melancholy, were truly poetical. Unfortunately, however, few readers can be touched with fellow-feeling. He sings to few, and must be content with sometimes moving a string in the soul of the lonely visionary, who, in the day-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> of youth, has felt as well as meditated on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of nature. His heart has produced charming passages in all his poems; but, generally speaking, they are only beautiful works of art and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>. The choice of Akenside as a favourite and a model may, without derogation from that writer, be considered as no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of a poetically formed mind. There is more poetry in many single lines of Cowper than in volumes of sonorous verses such as Akenside's. Philosophical poetry is very different from versified philosophy. The former is the highest exertion of genius, the latter cannot be ranked above the slighter amusements of ingenuity. Dr Brown's poetry was, it must be owned, composed either of imitations, which, with some exceptions, may be produced and read without feeling, or of effusions of such feelings only as meet a rare and faint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ECHO\">echo</a> in the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>.\n\nA few words only can here be bestowed on the intellectual part of his philosophy. It is an open revolt against the authority of Reid; and, by a curious concurrence, he began to lecture nearly at the moment when the doctrines of that philosopher came to be taught with applause in France. Mr Stewart had dissented from the language of Reid, and had widely departed from his opinions on several secondary theories. Dr Brown rejected them entirely. He very justly considered the claim of Reid to the merit of detecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> delusion which had betrayed philosophers into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that ideas which were the sole objects of knowledge had a separate existence, as a proof of his having mistaken their illustrative language for a metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>; but he does not do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> which Reid really rendered to mental science, by keeping the attention of all future speculators in a state of more constant watchfulness against the transient influence of such an illusion. His choice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> feeling to denote the operations which we usually refer to the understanding, is evidently too wide a departure from its ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, to have any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a>. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> can strip so familiar a word of the thoughts and emotions which have so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> accompanied it, so as to fit it for a technical term of the highest\n\n---\n\n1 His accomplished friend Mr Erskine confesses that Brown's poems \"are not written in the language of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a>. The string touched is too delicate for general sympathy. They are in an unknown tongue to one half\" (he might have said nineteen twentieths) \"of the reading part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>.\" (Welsin's Life of Brown, p. 431.)\n\n2 Brown's Lectures, vol. II. p. 1-49.\n\n3 Ibid. vol. I. p. 220, &c.\nabstraction. If we can be said to have a feeling \"of the equality of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of forty-five degrees to half the angle of ninety degrees,\" we may call <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">Arithmetic</a> sciences of feeling. He has very forcibly stated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of assuming \"the primary universal intuitions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> belief,\" which, in their nature, are incapable of all proof. They seem to be accurately described as notions which cannot be conceived separately, but without which nothing can be conceived. They are not only necessary to reasoning and to belief, but to thought itself. It is equally impossible to prove or to disprove them. He has very justly blamed the school of Reid for \"an extravagant and ridiculous\" multiplication of those principles which he truly represents as inconsistent with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> philosophy. To philosophize is indeed nothing more than to simplify securely.\n\nThe substitution of suggestion for the former phrase, association of ideas, would hardly deserve notice in so cursory a view, if it had not led him to a serious misconception of the doctrines and deserts of other philosophers. The fault of the latter phrase is rather in the narrowness of the last, than in the inadequacy of the first word. Association presents the fact in the light of a relation between two mental acts. Suggestion denotes rather the power of the one to call up the other. But whether we say that the sight of ashes suggests fire, or that the ideas of fire and ashes are associated, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to convey the same fact; and, in both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, an exact thinker means to accompany the fact with no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>. Dr Brown has supposed the word association as intended to affirm that there was some \"intermediate process\" between the original succession of the mental acts, and the power which they acquired therefrom of calling up each other. This is quite as much to raise up imaginary antagonists for the honour of conquering them, as he justly reprehends Dr Reid for doing in the treatment of preceding philosophers. He falls into another more important and unaccountable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, in representing his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Mr Hume's principles of association (resemblance, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">contrariety</a>, causation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUITY\">contiguity</a> in time or place) to the one principle of contiguity, as a discovery of his own, by which his theory is distinguished from \"the universal opinion of philosophers.\" Nothing but too exclusive a consideration of the doctrines of the Scottish school could have led him to speak thus of what was hinted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, distinctly laid down by Hobbes, and fully unfolded both by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a> and Condillac. He has, however, extremely enlarged the proof and the illustration of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of mind, by the exercise of \"a more subtile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>,\" and the disclosure of \"a finer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a>.\" As he has thus aided and confirmed, though he did not discover the general law, so he has rendered a new and very important service to mental science, by what he properly calls \"secondary laws of suggestion\" or association,\u2014circumstances which modify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the general law, and must be distinctly considered, in order to explain its connection with the phenomena. The enumeration and exposition are instructive, and the example is worthy of commendation. For it is in this lower region of science that most remains to be discovered; it is that which rests most on observation, and least tempts to controversy; it is by improvements in that part of knowledge that the foundations are secured, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> so repaired as to rest steadily on them. The distinction of common language between the head and the heart, which, as we have seen, is so often overlooked or misapplied by metaphysicians, is, in the system of Brown, signified by the terms \"mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a>\" and \"emotions.\" It is unlucky that no single word could be found for the former, and that the use of \"feeling,\" as the generic term, should disturb its easy\n\n---\n\n1 Brown's Lectures, vol. I. p. 222.\n2 Dr Brown always expresses himself best where he is short and familiar. \"An hypothesis is nothing more than a reason for making one experiment or observation rather than another.\" (Lectures, vol. I. p. 170.) In 1812, as the present writer observed to him that Reid and Hume differed more in words than in opinion, he answered, \"Yes, Reid bawled out, we must believe an outward world; but added in a whisper, we can give no reason for our belief. Hume cries out, we can give no reason for such a notion; and whispers, I own we cannot get rid of it.\"\n3 Lectures, vol. II. p. 333-347.\n4 Ibid. vol. II. p. 349.\n5 Ibid. vol. II. p. 218, &c.\n6 Ibid. vol. II. p. 270.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> when it is applied more naturally.\n\nIn our more proper province he has followed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>, who appears to have been chiefly known to him through Mr Stewart, in the theory of the social affections. Their disinterestedness is enforced by the arguments of both these philosophers, as well as of Hutcheson. It is observable, however, that he applies the principle of suggestion or association boldly to this part of human nature, and seems inclined to refer to it even sympathy itself. It is hard to understand how, with such a disposition on the subject of a principle so generally thought ultimate as Sympathy, he should, inconsistently with himself, follow Mr Stewart in representing the theory which derives the affections from association as \"a Modification of the Selfish System.\" He mistakes that theory by stating, that it derives the affections from our experience that our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> was connected with that of others; while in truth it considers our regard to our own interest as formed from the same original pleasures by association, which, by the like process, may and do directly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> affections towards others, without passing through the channel of regard to our general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. But, says he, this is only an hypothesis, since the formation of these affections is acknowledged to belong to a time of which there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a>;\u2014an objection fatal to every theory of any mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>, \u2014subversive, for example, of Berkeley's discovery of acquired visual perception, and most strangely inconsistent in the mouth of a philosopher whose numerous simplifications of mental theory are and must be founded on occurrences which precede experience. It is in all other cases, and it must be in this, sufficient that the principle of the theory is really existing, that it explains the appearances, that its supposed action resembles what we know to be its action in those similar cases of which we have direct experience. Lastly, he in express words admits that, according to the theory to which he objects, we have affections which are at present disinterested. Is it not a direct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> in terms to call such a theory \"a modification of the selfish system\"? His language in the sequel clearly indicates a distrust of his own statement, and a suspicion that he is not only inconsistent, but altogether mistaken.\n\nAs we enter more deeply into the territory of Ethics, we at length discover in Brown a distinction, the neglect of which by preceding speculators we have more than once lamented as productive of obscurity and confusion:\u2014\"The moral affections,\" says he, \"which I consider at present, I consider rather physiologically\" (or, as he elsewhere better expresses it, \"psychologically\") \"than ethically, as parts of our mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, not as involving the fulfilment or violation of duties.\" He immediately, however, loses sight of this distinction, and reasons inconsistently with it, instead of following it to its proper consequences in his explanation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>. Perhaps, indeed, (for the words are capable of more than one sense,) he meant to distinguish the virtuous affections from those sentiments which have morality exclusively in view, rather than to distinguish the theory of moral sentiment from the attempt to ascertain the characteristic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> action. Friendship is conformable in its dictates to morality; but it may, and does exist, without any view to it. He who feels the affections, and performs the duties of friendship, is the object of that distinct emotion which is called moral approbation.\n\nIt is on the subject of conscience that, in imitation of Mr Stewart, and with no other arguments than his, he makes his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> stand against the theory which considers the formation of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> itself as probably referable to the necessary and universal operation of those laws of human nature to which he himself ascribes almost every other state of mind. On both sides of this question the supremacy of conscience is alike held to be venerable and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a>. Once\n\n---\n\n1 Brown's Lectures, vol. III. p. 243.\n2 Ibid. vol. III. p. 262.\n3 Ibid. vol. IV. p. 82, et seq.\n4 Ibid. vol. IV. p. 87.\n5 Ibid. vol. IV. p. 97.\n6 Ibid. vol. III. p. 231.\nmore, be it remembered, that the question is purely philosophical, and is only whether, from the impossibility of explaining its formation by more general laws, we are reduced to the necessity of considering it as an original fact in human nature, of which no further account can be given. Let it, however, be also remembered, that we are not driven to this supposition by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> circumstance, that no satisfactory explanation has yet appeared; for there are many analogies in an unexplained state of mind to states already explained, which may justify us in believing that the explanation requires only more accurate observation, and more patient meditation, to be brought to that completeness which it probably will attain.","sp":418,"ep":424}]
