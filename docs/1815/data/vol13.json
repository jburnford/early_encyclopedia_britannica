[{"h":"AFTER THE PATIENT HAS BY THIS","t":"r the patient has by this means vomited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> eight times, or oftener, and discharged a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> and blackish bilious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, a grain or a grain and a half of thebaic extract is given, in order to procure some respite from the violent retching, vomiting, and anxiety. The person is desired to take nothing into his stomach for two hours after this, by which means it is seldom or never rejected; and thus all the symptoms are considerably abated, the retching and vomiting either totally cease or are very much lessened, so that medicines may now be exhibited which the stomach would not have retained before. These are cooling acid juleps, or other antiseptic remedies; but neither nitre nor any of its preparations <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> be found to stay on the stomach, nor, according to Dr Hilary, are the nitrous medicines, or even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> antiemetic draughts, proper to be given in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, even though they should agree with the stomach, on account of their attenuating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the patient has not a stool or two after drinking the warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> and vomiting, it is necessary to give a gentle purging clyster; and when six or eight hours rest have been obtained, a gentle antiphlogistic and antiseptic purge, in order to evacuate by stool as much of the bilious matter as we possibly can. Or, if the patient has a purging before, which sometimes though very rarely happens, a dose of toasted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a> is given, and an antiseptic anodyne after it has operated, to abate and check the too great purging, but not to stop it, as this evacuation has been always observed to be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, provided it be not very violent.\n\nAfter this indication is completely answered, the next is to exhibit such proper antiseptic medicines as may stop the putrescent disposition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>. Here the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a> would seem to be the most proper remedy; but unluckily the stomachs of the patients in this disease are so much irritated, and so apt to reject every thing, that it cannot be retained in any form whatever. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> Dr Percival recommends columbo root, the infusion of which is found to be a powerful antiemetic and antiputrescent medicine, and might perhaps so far alter the state of the stomach as to make it bear the bark. Dr Hilary, however, who was ignorant of the virtues of columbo, substituted the radix serpentin\u00e6 Virginian\u00e6 with success. A slight infusion of this root not only sat easily on the stomach of the patients, but moderately raised the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> and fever, both of which are now too low. The following receipt was found the most agreeable and efficacious:\n\nRs Rad. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a>. Virginian. 3ij.\nCroc. Ang. 3ss.

But if, after taking this a little while, we find that the pulse does not rise, but on the contrary that a coldness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> parts comes on, the medicines must be made more warming, by increasing the quantity of the snakeroot and saffron, or by adding *vinum croceum*, *confectio cardiana*, or the like, but not by the use of volatile spirits and salts, which hurt by their stimulating and dissolving qualities. Blisters Dr Hilary reprobrates in the strongest terms, and affirms that he has seen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where a blister was applied turned perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> and sphacelated; so that if the spine and end of the ribs had not hindered, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> passage would have been opened into the cavity of the thorax, had the patient lived a few hours after it.\n\nAt the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that the strength of the patient is kept up by the medicines above mentioned, or by others similar, he gave repeated gentle purgatives every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> or third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and sometimes, when the symptoms were very urgent, every day, for four or five days successively. But if proper methods be taken in the beginning of the disease, it is seldom that such a repetition of purging is necessary.\n\nDr Hilary's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of treating the yellow fever is, in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, as judicious as any that has yet been proposed. But, among the late writers, some have recommended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, particularly under the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALOMEL\">calomel</a>, as the most efficacious remedy which can be employed. In some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> it has certainly been given to an almost incredible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, in a very short time, without exciting either purging or salivation. And it cannot be denied, that patients have not unfrequently recovered under the use of it. But calomel can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more be reckoned an infallible remedy for this disease than blood-letting.\n\nSince the introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> affusion, in the cure of typhus fevers, by Dr Currie, it has been imagined by some, that this practice would afford a very efficacious remedy in the typhus icteroides, as well as in the typhus mitior. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> has not yet confirmed the utility of this practice.\n\nSome have suggested the internal use of the oxygenated muriatic acid, properly diluted, as an article from which great benefit may be expected in the yellow fever. This practice deserves, we think, a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>: but the utility of it still remains to be determined by experience.\n\nTo the genus of *typhus* also belong all those fevers attended with very profuse and debilitating sweats, and which have sometimes, not without good reason, been accounted plagues; such as the English sweating-sickness, *Miliaris sudatoria*, *Sauv.* sp. 5. *Ephemeris sudatoria*, *Sauv.* sp. 7. *Ephemeris Britannica*, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIUS\">Caius</a> de ephem.

According to him, the appearance of the hectic fever is not unlike that of the genuine intermittent; from which, however, the disease is very different in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, while at the same time it is much more dangerous. In the true intermittent, the three stages of cold, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and sweat, are far more distinctly marked, the whole fit is much longer, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> which it observes is more constant and regular, and the intermissions are more perfect, than in the hectic fever. For in the latter, even during the clearest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a>, there is usually a feverish quickness perceptible in the pulse, which seldom fails to exceed the utmost limit of a healthy one by at least 10 strokes in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>.\n\nThe chiliness of the hectic fever is sometimes succeeded by heat, and sometimes immediately by a sweat without any intermediate state of heat. The hicat will sometimes come on without any remarkable chiliness preceding; and the chiliness has been observed to go off without being followed either by heat or sweat. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of these stages is seldom the same for three fits together; and as it is not uncommon for one of them to be wanting, the length of the whole fit must vary much more than in the true intermittent; but in general it is much shorter.\n\nA patient subjected to hectic fever is little or nothing relieved by the occurrence of the sweat; but is often as anxious and restless under it as during the chiliness or heat. When the sweat is over, the fever will sometimes continue; and in the middle of the fever the chiliness will return; which is a most certain mark of this disease.\n\nThe hectic fever will return with great exactness, like an intermittent, for two or perhaps three fits; but Dr Heberden informs us, that he does not remember ever to have known it keep the same period for four fits successively. The paroxysm will now and then keep off for 10 or 12 days; and at other times, especially when the patient is very ill, it will return so frequently on the same day, that the chiliness of a new fit will follow immediately the sweat of the former. It is not unusual to have many threatenings of a shivering in the same day; and some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of drowsiness is apt to attend the cessation of a fit.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> in a true intermittent is clear during the fits and turbid during the intervals; but in the hectic fever it is liable to all kinds of irregularity. It will be equally clear or turbid in both stages; or turbid in the fits and clear in the intervals; and sometimes it will be, as in a true intermittent, clear during the fever, and thick at the going off.\n\nHectic patients often complain of pains like those of the rheumatism, which either affect by turns almost every\nevery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the body, or else return constantly to the same part; which is often at a great distance from the seat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> disorder, and, as far as is known, without any peculiar connection with it. Those pains are so violent in some patients, as to require a large quantity of opium. As far as Dr Heberden has observed, they are most common where the hectic arises from some ulcer open to the external <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, as in cancers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, &c. Joined with this fever, and arising probably from one common cause, he has been surprised to see swellings of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, neck, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of the body, rise up almost in an instant, as if the part was all at once grown fatter. These swellings are not painful, hard, or discoloured, and they continue for several hours.\n\nDr Heberden has seen this fever attack those who seemed in tolerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, in a sudden and violent manner, like a common inflammatory one; and like that, also, in a very short time bring them into imminent danger of their lives; after which it has begun to abate, and to afford hopes of a perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>. But though the danger might be over for the present, and but little of a fever remain; yet that little has soon demonstrated, that it was kept up by some great mischief within, and, proving unconquerable by any remedies, has gradually undermined the health of the patient, and never ceased except with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. This manner of its beginning, however, is a rare occurrence. It much oftener dissembles its strength at first; and creeps on so slowly, that the subjects of it, though they be not perfectly well, yet for some months hardly think themselves ill; complaining only of being sooner tired with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> than usual, of want of appetite, and of falling away. But gentle as the symptoms may seem, if the pulse be quicker than ordinary, so as to have the artery to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> 90 times and perhaps 120 times in a minute, there is the greatest reason to be apprehensive of the event. In no disorder, perhaps, is the pulse of more use to guide our judgment than in the hectic fever: yet even here we must be upon our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>, and not trust entirely to this criterion; for one in about twenty patients, with all the worst signs of decay from some incurable cause, which irresistibly goes on to destroy his life, will show not the smallest degree of quickness, nor any other irregularity of the pulse, to the day of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>.\n\nCauses, &c. This fever will supervene whenever there is a great collection of matter formed in any part of the body; but it more particularly attends upon the inflammation of a scirrhouss gland, and even upon one that is slight and only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> beginning; the fever growing worse in proportion as the gland becomes more inflamed, ulcerated, or gangrenous. And such is the lingering nature of those glandular disorders, that the first of those stages will continue for many months, and the second for some years.\n\nIf this scirrhouss inflammation be external, or in the lungs, or some of the abdominal viscera, where the disturbance of their functions plainly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out the seat of the disorder, no doubt can be entertained concerning the cause of the fever. But if the part affected be not obvious to the senses, and its precise functions be not known, the hectic, which is there only part of the train of another disease, may be mistaken for the primary or only affection.\n\nLying-in-women, on account of the violence sustained in delivery, generally die when affected with this fever. Women of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of near 50 and upwards are particularly liable to it. For, upon the cessation of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> discharge, the glands of the breasts, ovaries, or womb, too commonly begin to grow scirrhouss, and proceed to be cancerous. Not only these, but the glandular parts of all the abdominal viscera, are supposed to be affected at this particular time, and to become the seats of incurable disorders.\n\nThe injuries done to the stomach and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> by hard drinking are attended with similar symptoms, and terminate in the same manner.\n\nDr Heberden observes, that the slightest wound by a fine-pointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> is known upon some occasions to bring on the greatest disturbances, and the most alarming symptoms, nay even death itself. For not only the wounded part will swell and be painful, but by turns almost every part of the body; and very distant parts have been known to come even to suppuration. These symptoms are constantly accompanied with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> intermittent, which lasts as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as any of them remain.\n\nPrognosis. This anomalous fever is never less dangerous than when it originates from a kindly suppuration, into which all the diseased parts are melted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and for which there is a proper outlet.\n\nThe symptoms and danger from some small punctures, with their concomitant fever; most frequently give way in a few days; though in some persons they have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for two or three months, and in others have proved fatal.\n\nThe inflammation of internal scirrhouss glands, or of those in the breasts, sometimes goes off, and the fever, which depended upon it, ceases; but it much oftener happens, that it proceeds to cancerous and gangrenous ulcers, and terminates only in death. Death is also, almost universally, the consequence of hectic fever from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a> of the lungs, which have in general at least been considered as glandular bodies in a scirrhouss state.\n\nCure. It is not to be expected that the same remedies will in every case be adapted to a fever which, arising from very different causes, is attended with such a variety of symptoms. A mixture of asafoetida and opium has in some persons seemed singularly serviceable in this fever, when brought on by a small wound; but in most other cases the principal if not the sole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the physician must be employed in relieving the symptoms, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERING\">tempering</a> the heat, by preventing both costiveness and purging, by procuring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, and by checking the sweats. If, at the same time, continues Dr Heberden, he put the body into as good general health as may be, by air, exercise, and a proper course of mild diet, he can perhaps do nothing better than to leave all the rest to nature. In some few fortunate patients, nature appears to have such resources, as may afford reason for entertaining hopes of cure, even in very bad cases. For some have recovered from this fever attended with every symptom of an abdominal viscus incurably diseased, after all probable methods of relief from art had been tried in vain, and after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> and strength were so exhausted as to leave scarce any hopes from nature. In those deplorable\nPhlegmasiae circumstances, there has arisen a swelling not far from the probable seat of the disorder, and yet without any discoverable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with it. This swelling has come to an abscess; in consequence of which the pulse has soon returned to its natural state, as have also the appetite, flesh, and strength. What nature has performed in those rare cases, Dr Heberden acquaints us, he has often endeavoured to imitate, by making issues or applying blisters near the seat of the disease; but he cannot say with the same success.\n\nIt seems at present, Dr Heberden observes, to be the opinion of many practitioners, that gangrenes will be stopped, and suppuration become more kindly, by the use of Peruvian bark; and therefore this remedy is always either advised or permitted in the irregular fever joined with suppurations and gangrenes. But he affirms he does not remember ever to have seen any good effect from cinchona in this fever unattended with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> ulcer; and even in gangrenes it so often fails, that in successful cases, where it has been administered, there must be room for suspicion that the success was owing to another cause. Dr Heberden acknowledges, at the same time, that he never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> any harm from cinchona, in these, or indeed in any other cases, except a slight temporary purging or sickness, where it has happened to disagree with the stomach, or where the latter has been loaded by taking the medicine too fast, especially in dry boluses wrapped in wafer-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>.\n\nIn hectic illnesses, where all other means have proved ineffectual, a journey to Bath is usually proposed by the friends, and wished for by the sick; but Dr Heberden justly observes, that, besides the fatigue and many inconveniences of a journey to a dying person, the Bath waters are peculiarly hurtful in this fever, which they never fail to increase, and thereby aggravate the sufferings and hasten the death of the patient.\n\n**ORDER II.

Their great characteristics are, the general symptoms of fever, and a topical inflammation, attended with the lesion of some important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>. In most instances, when blood is drawn, it is found upon coagulation to be covered with a bulky coat.

To this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, therefore, belong the following diseases:\n\n- Furunculas, Sauv. gen. 18.

Vog. 348.\n- Paraphimosis, Vog. 349.\n\nFor the cure of inflammations, Dr Cullen lays down the following indications. 1. To remove the remote causes when they are evident and continue to operate. 2. To take off the phlogistic diathesis affecting the whole system, or the particular part. 3. To take off the spasm of the particular part, by remedies applied to the whole system, or to the part itself.\n\nThe means of removing the remote causes will readily occur, from considering the particular nature and circumstances of the different kinds. Acrid matters must be removed, or their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> must be prevented, by the application of demulecens. Compressing and overstretching powers must be taken away; and from their several circumstances, the means of doing so will be obvious.\n\nThe means of taking off the phlogistic diathesis of the system are the same with those already mentioned under the cure for synoeca. The means of taking off the spasm also from the particular part, are much the same with those already mentioned. Only it is to be remembered, that topical bleedings, such as cupping with searifications, applying leeches, &c. are in this case much more indicated; and that some of the other remedies are to be directed more particularly to the part affected, as shall be more fully considered when we treat of those diseases attended with particular inflammations.\n\nWhen a tendency to suppuration is perceived, the proper indication is to promote the production of perfect pus as much as possible. For this purpose various remedies, supposed to possess a specific power, have been proposed; but it does not appear that any of them are possessed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of this kind; and, in Dr Cullen's opinion, all that can be done is to favour the suppuration by such applications as may support a moderate heat in the part, by some tenacity confine the perspiration, and by an emollient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> may weaken the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> of the teguments, and favour their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EROSION\">erosion</a>. As all abscesses are occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of fluids, and as in the case of certain effusions a suppuration becomes\ncomes not only unavoidable but desirable, it may be supposed that most of the means of procuring a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, by diminishing the force of circulation, &c., ought to be avoided. But as we observe, on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, that a certain degree of increased impetus, or of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> symptoms of inflammation, is necessary to produce a proper suppuration; so it is then especially necessary to avoid those means of resolution which may diminish too much the force of circulation. And on the other hand, as the impetus of the blood, when violent, is found to prevent the proper suppuration; so, in such cases, though a tendency to suppuration may have begun, it may be proper to continue those means of resolution which moderate the force of the circulation. With respect to the opening of abscesses when completely formed, see the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SURGERY\">SURGERY</a>.\n\nWhen an inflammation has taken a tendency to gangrene, that event is to be prevented by every possible means; and these must be different according to the nature of the several causes: but after a gangrene has in some degree taken place, it can be cured only by the separation of the dead from the living parts. This in certain circumstances can be performed, and most properly, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>. In other cases it can be done by exciting a suppuratory inflammation on the verge of the living part, whereby its cohesion with the dead part may be everywhere broken off, so that the latter may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> off by itself. While this is doing, it is proper to prevent the further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> of the part, and its spreading wider. For this purpose various antiseptic applications have been proposed: but Dr Cullen is of opinion, that while the teguments are entire, these applications can hardly have any effect; and therefore that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> procedure must be to searify the part so as to reach the living substance, and, by the wounds made there, to excite the suppuration required. By the same incisions also we give access to antiseptics, which may both prevent the progress of the putrefaction in the dead, and excite the inflammation necessary on the verge of the living parts.\n\nWhen the gangrene proceeds from loss of tone, and when this, communicated to the neighbouring parts, prevents that inflammation which, as we have said, is requisite to the separation of the dead parts from the living, it will be necessary to obviate this loss of tone by tonic medicines given internally; and for this purpose cinchona has been found to be most effectual. But when the gangrene arises from the violence of inflammation, the bark may not only fail of proving a remedy, but may do harm: for its power as a tonic is especially suited to those cases of gangrene which proceed from an original loss of tone, as in the case of palsy and oedema; or in those cases where a loss of tone takes place after the original inflammatory symptoms are removed.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a> is of opinion, that incisions made with a view to admit the operation of antiseptic remedies in gangrenes, as well as the remedies themselves, must be pernicious from the irritation they occasion, and from the danger of wounding blood-vessels, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>, or tendons, and also by allowing a free passage for the putrescent fluids into the parts not yet affected. And unless they be carried so deep as to reach the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> parts, applications of the antiseptic kind can never have any effect in answering the purpose for which they were intended. The same author also remarks, that all the advantages commonly observed from the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of applications recommended for gangrene, are obtained with more ease, and generally too with more certainty, from the use of some gentle stimulating embrocation; which, by exciting a slight irritation upon the surface, especially when assisted by a free use of cinchona, produces for the most part such a degree of inflammation as is wished for. With this view he has frequently known a weak solution of sal ammoniac, a dram of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> to two ounces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a> and six of water, form a mixture of very proper strength for every purpose of this kind. But the degree of stimulus can easily be either increased or diminished according to circumstances, by using a larger or smaller proportion of the salt.\n\nWhenever, either by the means recommended, or by a natural exertion of the system, a slight inflammation appears between the diseased and sound parts, we may in general, with tolerable certainty, expect, that in due time the parts will be separated; and when a full suppuration is once fairly established, there can be little doubt that the mortified parts will be soon and easily removed.\n\nA complete separation being effected, the sore is to be treated in the manner described under the article SURGERY; with a proper attention, at the same time, to the support of the general system by the continuance of nourishing diet, and cinchona with such quantities of wine as may seem necessary.\n\nWith regard to the bark, however, it is proper to take notice of another case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> in which it is likewise unsuccessful, as well as in that attended with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of inflammation; and that is, in those mortifications of the toes and feet, common in old people, or which arise from any cause increasing the rigidity of the vessels to such a degree as to prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the fluids through them. In this case Mr Pott has discovered, that all kinds of warm applications are very unsuccessful; but by the free use of opium, together with sedatives and relaxants externally applied, he has frequently seen the tumefaction of the feet and ankles subside, the skin recover its natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and all the mortified parts separate in a very short time, leaving a clean sore. But as to scarifications, or any other attempt to separate artificially the mortified from the sound parts, he thinks them very prejudicial, by giving pain; which is generally of itself violent in this disease, and which seems to have a great share in producing the other evils.\n\nThe other terminations of inflammation either do not admit of any treatment except that of preventing them by resolution, or properly belong to the article SURGERY.\n\nSp.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the phlegmon or preceding species, and erythema, according to Dr Cullen, is, that, in the former, the inflammation seems particularly to affect the vessels on the internal surface of the skin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with the lax adjacent cellular texture; whence a more copious effusion, and that too of serum convertible into pus, takes place. In the erythema the affection is of the vessels on the external surface of the skin communicating with the rete mucosum. This affection does not admit of any effusion but what separates the cuticle, and gives occasion to the formation of a blister, while the smaller size of the vessels admits only of the effusion of a thin fluid very seldom convertible into pus.

Dr Cullen observes, that the inflammation of the eye may be considered as of two kinds; according as it is seated in the membranes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> of the eye, when it is named ophthalmia membranarum; or as it is seated in the sebaceous glands placed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TARSUS\">tarsus</a>, or edges of the eyelids, in which case it may be termed ophthalmia tarsi. These two kinds are very frequently connected together, as the one may excite the other; but they are still to be distinguished according as the one or the other may happen to be the primary affection.\n\n1. The inflammation of the membranes of the eye affects especially, and most frequently, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADNATA\">adnata</a>, and appears in a turgescence of its vessels; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> vessels which are naturally there, become not only increased in size, but many more appear than in a natural state. This turgescence of the vessels is attended with pain, especially upon the motion of the ball of the eye; and this irritation, like every other, applied to the surface of the eye, produces an effusion of tears from the lachrymal gland.\n\nThe inflammation commonly, and chiefly, affects the adnata spread on the anterior part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> of the eye; but usually spreads also along the continuation of the adnata on the inside of the palpebrae; and as that is extended on the tarsus palpebrarum, the excretories of the sebaceous glands opening there are also frequently affected. When the affection of the adnata is considerable, it may be communicated to the subjacent membranes of the eye, and even to the retina itself; which thereby acquires so great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of light becomes painful. The inflammation of the membranes of the eye is in different degrees, according as the adnata is more or less affected, or according as the inflammation is either of the adnata alone, or of the subjacent membranes also; and upon these differences, different species have been established; but they seem all to differ only in degree, and are to be cured by the same remedies more or less employed.\n\nThe proximate cause of ophthalmia is not different from that of inflammation in general; and the different circumstances of ophthalmia may be explained by\nby the difference of its remote causes, and by the different parts of the eye which it happens to affect; as may be understood from what has been already said. We shall therefore proceed to give an account of the method of cure.\n\nThe great objects to be aimed at in the treatment of ophthalmia, are, in the first place, the resolution of the inflammation which has already taken place; and, secondly, the removal of those consequences which frequently arise from the inflammation, especially if it have been of long standing. But besides these, while it has appeared from former observation, that there is a peculiar disposition to the disease, practices may often be successfully employed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> this disposition, and thus prevent the return of the affection.\n\nThe ophthalmia membranarum requires the remedies proper for inflammation in general; and when the deeper-seated membranes are affected, and especially when a pyrexia is present, large general bleedings may be necessary. But this last is seldom requisite, and, for the most part, the ophthalmia is an affection merely local, accompanied with little or no pyrexia. General bleedings therefore have little effect upon it, and the cure is chiefly to be obtained by topical bleedings, that is, blood drawn from the vessels near the inflamed part; and opening the jugular vein, or the temporal artery, may be considered as in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of this kind. It is commonly sufficient to apply a number of leeches round the eye; but it is perhaps still better to draw blood by cupping and scarifying from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>. In many cases, the most effectual remedy is to scarify the internal surface of the inferior eyelid, and to cut the turgid vessels upon the adnata itself.\n\nBesides blood-letting, purging, as a remedy suited to inflammation in general, has been considered as peculiarly adapted to inflammation in any part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and therefore to ophthalmia; and it is sometimes useful: but, for the reasons given before with respect to general bleeding, purging in the case of ophthalmia does not prove useful in any proportion to the evacuation excited.\u2014For relaxing the spasm in the part, and taking off the determination of the fluids to it, blistering near the part has commonly been found useful. When the inflammation does not yield to the application of blisters after topical bleeding, great benefit is often obtained by supporting a discharge from the blistered part, under the form of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, by which means a more permanent determination of blood from the part is obtained.\n\nIt is probably also on the same principle that the good effects obtained from the use of errhine medicines in obstinate cases of ophthalmia are to be accounted for. By these errhines, in particular, which occasion and support for some time a great discharge from the nose, great benefit has often been obtained. The powder of asarabacca, or the infusion of hippocastanum, snuffed up the nose at bedtime in proper doses, are often productive of the best effects, when many other remedies have been tried in vain.\n\nOphthalmia, as an external inflammation, admits of topical applications. All those, however, which increase the heat and relax the vessels of the part, prove hurtful; and the admission of cool air to the eye, and the application of cooling and astringent medicines, which at the same time do not produce irritation, prove useful. Of all these the solution of acetite of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, assiduously applied, is perhaps the best. In the cure of this distemper, indeed, all irritation must carefully be avoided, particularly that of light; and the only certain means of doing this is by keeping the patient in a very dark chamber.\n\n2. In the ophthalmia tarsi, the same medicines may be necessary, as have been already recommended for the ophthalmia membranarum. However, as the ophthalmia tarsi may often depend upon an acrimony deposited in the sebaceous glands of the part, so it may require various internal remedies according to the variety of the acrimony in fault; for which we must refer to the consideration of scrophula, syphilis, or other diseases with which this ophthalmia may be connected; and where these shall not be evident, certain remedies more generally adapted to the evacuation of acrimony, such as mercury, may be employed. In the ophthalmia tarsi, it almost constantly happens that some ulcerations are formed on the tarsus. These require the application of mercury and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, which alone may sometimes cure the whole affection; and they may be useful even when the disease depends upon a fault of the whole system.\n\nBoth in the ophthalmia membranarum, and in the ophthalmia tarsi, it is necessary to obviate that glueing together of the eyelids which commonly happens in sleep; and which may be done by insinuating a little of any mild unctuous medicine between the eyelids before the patient shall go to sleep.\n\nThe slighter kinds of inflammations from the dust or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, may be removed by fomenting with warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> and water, adding a small portion of brandy; and by anointing the borders of the eyelids with unguentum tutiae, or the like, at night, especially when those parts are excoriated and sore. But in bad cases, after the inflammation has yielded a little to evacuations, the cataplasm aluminis of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> Pharmacopoeia spread on lint, and applied at bedtime, has been found the best external remedy. Before the use of the latter, the solution of sulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a> is prescribed with advantage; and in violent pains it is of service to foment frequently with a decoction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> poppy-heads. One of the most common and most disagreeable consequences of ophthalmia, is an effusion of the cornea, so far obstructing the passage of light as to diminish or prevent vision. This is sometimes so considerable as to admit of removal by operation; but in slighter cases it may often be removed by the application of different gentle escharotics; and in this way, without the least danger of any inconvenience, goods effects are often obtained, from gently introducing into the eye at bedtime a powder consisting of equal parts of supertartrite of potass and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, reduced together to a fine powder.\n\nWhere there is a disposition to frequent returns of this affection, cinchona is often employed with success in combating it: But nothing in general answers better than frequent and regular cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a> of the eyes.\n\nBesides the various species of ophthalmia which were before known in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, another has lately been introduced, that contagious ophthalmia, viz. with which the British\nBritish troops were affected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, and which they have imported into this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> on their return from thence.\n\nOf this affection many interesting accounts have been published. Perhaps the best is an elaborate treatise by Mr Edmonston, who has had many opportunities of witnessing the affection, and extensive practice in the treatment of the disease, both in Egypt and in Britain. To his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> therefore we may refer those who wish for the most full information respecting it. We shall only observe, that now, no doubt can be entertained respecting the contagious nature of the disease; and that therefore the first great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> necessary in the treatment is the complete separation of the diseased from the sound.\n\nGENUS IX.

The signs of an impending phrenitis are, immoderate and continual watchings; or if any sleep be obtained, it is disturbed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a>, and gives no refreshment; acute and lasting pains, especially in the hind part of the head and neck; little thirst; a great and slow respiration, as if proceeding from the bottom of the breast; the pulse sometimes small and slow, sometimes quick and frequent; a suppression of urine; and forgetfulness. The distemper when present may be known by the following signs:\n\nThe veins of the head swell, and the temporal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a> throb much; the eyes are fixed, sparkle, and have a fierce aspect; the speech is incoherent, and the patient behaves very roughly to the bystanders, with furious attempts to get out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, not indeed continually, but returning as it were by paroxysms: the tongue is dry, rough, yellow, or black; there is a coldness of the external parts; a proneness to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>; chattering of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>; a trembling of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, with which the sick seem to be gathering something, and actually do gather the naps off the bed-clothes.\n\nCauses of, and persons subject to, this disorder. People of a hot and bilious habit of body, and such as are of a passionate disposition, are apt to be affected with phrenitis. In the same danger are those who make much use of spices, or are given to hot and spirituous liquors; who have been exposed more than usual to the sun, or obliged to undergo immoderate studies or watchings; who are subject to headaches, or in whom some customary hemorrhages have been stopped; or the disease may arise from some injury offered to the head externally. Sir John Pringle observes, that the phrenitis, when considered as an original disease, is apt to attack <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> season when they are exposed to the heat of the sun, and especially when asleep and in liquor. A symptomatic phrenitis is also more frequent in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> than elsewhere, on account of the violence done to all fevers when the sick are carried in waggons from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>, where the very noise or light alone would be sufficient, with more delicate natures, to raise a phrensy. From these and similar causes, a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> inflammation, affecting some parts within the cranium, is produced: and there can be no doubt, that from this all the symptoms of the disease arise, and particularly that peculiar delirium which characterizes it. But in what manner local diseases, even of the brain itself, produce affections of the mind, we are still totally in the dark.\n\nPrognosis. Every kind of phrenitis, whether idiopathic or symptomatic, is attended with a high degree of danger; and, unless removed before the fourth day, a gangrene or sphacelus of the meninges readily takes place, and the patient dies delirious. The following are the most fatal symptoms: A continual and furious delirium, with watching; thin watery urine, white faeces, the urine and stools running off involuntarily, or a total suppression of these excretions; a ready disposition to become stupid, or to faint; trembling, rigor, chattering of the teeth, convulsions, hiccup, coldness of the extremities, trembling of the tongue, shrill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, a sudden cessation of pain, with apparent tranquillity. The following are favourable: Sweats, apparently critical, breaking out; a seeming effort of nature to terminate the disease by a diarrhoea; a large hemorrhage from the nose; swellings of the glands behind the ears; hemorrhoids.\n\nCure. From what has been said of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of this disease, the cure must entirely depend on obtaining a resolution of the inflammation. The objects chiefly to be aimed at with this view are, 1. The removal of such exciting causes as continue to operate. 2. The diminution of the momentum of the blood in the circulating system in general. 3. The diminution of impetus at the brain in particular; and, 4. The avoiding\ning circumstances which tend either to accelerate the motion of the blood or to give determination to the head.\n\nDifferent practices may be used with these intentions; but the most powerful remedies are to be immediately employed. Large and repeated bleedings are especially necessary; and these too taken from vessels as near as possible to the part affected. The opening the temporal artery has been recommended, and with some reason: but as the practice is attended with inconveniences, perhaps the opening of the jugular veins may in general prove more effectual; with which, however, may be joined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> of blood from the temples by cupping and scarifying. It is also probable, that purging may be of more use in this than in some other inflammatory affections, as it may operate by revulsion. For the same purpose of revulsion, warm pediluvia are a remedy, but rather ambiguous. The taking off the force of the blood in the vessels of the head by an erect posture is generally useful. Blistering is also useful, but chiefly when applied near to the part affected. In short, every part of the antiphlogistic regimen is here necessary, and particularly the admission of cold air. Even cold substances applied to the head have been found useful; and the application of such refrigerants as vinegar is certainly proper. Opiates are thought to be hurtful in every inflammatory state of the brain. On the whole, however, it must be remarked, that practitioners are very uncertain with regard to the means proper to be used in this disease; and the more so, that the symptoms by which the disease is commonly judged to be present, appear sometimes without any internal inflammation; and on the other hand, dissections have shown that the brain has been inflamed, where few of the peculiar symptoms of inflammation had appeared before death.\n\nGENUS X. CYNANCHE.\n\nCynanche, Sauv. gen. 110. Lin. 33. Sag. gen. 300. Angina, Vog. 49. Hoffm. II. 125. Junck. 30. Angina inflammatoria, Boerh. 798.\n\nSp. I. CYNANCHE TONSILLARIS.\n\nThe Inflammatory Quinsy.\n\nCynanche tonsillaris, Sauv. sp. 1. Angina inflammatoria, sp. 5. Boerh. 805.\n\nDescription. This is an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the fauces, affecting principally that congeries of mucous follicles which forms the tonsils; and from thence spreading along the velum and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-UVULA\">uvula</a>, so as frequently to affect every part of the mucous membrane. The disease appears by some tumour and redness of the parts; is attended with a painful and difficult deglutition; a troublesome clamminess of the mouth and throat; a frequent but difficult excretion of mucus; and the whole is accompanied with pyrexia. The inflammation and tumour are commonly at first most considerable in one tonsil; and afterwards, abating in that, increase in the other. This disease is not contagious.\n\nCauses of, and persons subject to, this disorder. This disease is commonly occasioned by cold externally applied, particularly about the neck. It affects especially the young and sanguine; and a disposition to it is often acquired by habit. It occurs especially in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> Cynanche, and autumn, when vicissitudes of heat and cold frequently take place.\n\nPrognosis. This species of cynanche terminates frequently by resolution, sometimes by suppuration, but hardly ever by gangrene; though in some cases sloughy spots appear on the fauces: the prognosis therefore is generally favourable.\n\nCure. As the principal morbid affection in this disease, on which all its characterising symptoms immediately depend, is the active inflammation in the tonsils and neighbouring parts, the object first and principally to be aimed at in the cure is to obtain a resolution of this inflammation. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to have recourse to practices, with the view of obviating urgent symptoms before a resolution can be effected: and in other cases, where a resolution cannot be obtained, it must be the aim of the practitioner to promote a speedy and favourable suppuration. After suppuration has taken place, the proper means of promoting a discharge of the purulent matter will conclude the cure. Here some bleeding may be necessary; but large and general evacuations are seldom beneficial. The opening of the ramular veins is an insignificant remedy, according to Dr. Cullen, but is recommended as efficacious by Sir John Pringle: more benefit, however, may in general be derived from leeches to the external fauces. The inflammation may be often relieved by moderate astringents, and particularly by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> applied to the parts affected. In many cases, nothing has been found to give more relief than the vapour of warm water received into the fauces.\n\nBesides these, blistering, and still more frequently rubefacient medicines, are applied with success, as well as antiphlogistic purgatives; and every part of the antiphlogistic regimen is to be observed, except the application of cold. Sir John Pringle recommends a thick piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> moistened with two parts of common sweet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, and one of spirit of hartshorn (or in a larger proportion, if the skin will bear it), to be applied to the throat, and renewed once every four or five hours. By this means the neck, and sometimes the whole body, is put into a sweat, which after bleeding either carries off or lessens the inflammation. When the disease has a tendency to suppuration, nothing will be more useful than receiving into the fauces the steams of warm water. Benefit is also obtained from poultices applied to the external fauces. When the abscess is attended with much swelling, if it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> not spontaneously, it ought to be opened by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCET\">lancet</a>; and this does not require much caution, as even the inflammatory state may be relieved by some scarification of the tonsils. When this disease runs very rapidly to such a height as to threaten suffocation, it is sometimes necessary to have recourse to bronchotomy as the only means of saving the life of the patient. But there is reason to believe that this operation has sometimes been employed where it was not necessary: and we may safely venture to say, that it is but seldom requisite; insomuch that Dr. Cullen tells us, he has never in his practice seen any case requiring bronchotomy.\n\nSp.

This distemper is not particularly described by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> physicians; though perhaps the Syrian and Egyptian ulcers mentioned by Aretaeus Cappadox, and the pestilent ulcerated tonsils we read of in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIUS\">Actius</a> Amideus, were of this nature. Some of the scarlet fevers mentioned by Morton seem also to have approached near to it. In the beginning of the last century, a disease exactly similar to this is described by the physicians of that time, as raging with great violence and mortality in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> and some parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; but no account of it was published in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> till the year 1748, when a very accurate one was drawn up by Dr Fothergill, and in 1752 by Dr Huxham. The latter observes, that this disease was preceded by long, cold, and wet seasons; by which probably the bodies of people were debilitated, and more apt to receive contagion, which possibly also might be produced by the stagnant and putrid waters.\n\nThe attack of this disease was very different in different persons. Sometimes a rigor, with fulness and soreness of the throat; and painful stiffness of the neck, were the first symptoms complained of. Sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> chills and heats, with some degree of giddiness, drowsiness, or headache, ushered in the distemper. It seized others with more severe feverish symptoms; great pain of the head, back, and limbs; a vast oppression of the praecordia, and continual sighing. Some grown persons went about for days in a drooping state, with much uneasiness and anxiety, till at last they were obliged to take to their beds.\u2014Thus various was the disease, says Dr Huxham, at the onset. But it commonly began with chills and heats, load and pain of the head, soreness of throat, and hoarseness; some cough, sickness at stomach, frequent vomiting and purging, in children especially, which were sometimes very severe; though a contrary state was more common to the adult. There was in all a very great dejection of spirits, very sudden weakness, great heaviness on the breast, and faintness, from the very beginning. The pulse in general was quick, small, and fluttering, though sometimes heavy and undulating. The urine was commonly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a>, thin, and crude; however, in many grown persons, it was passed in small quantities and high coloured, or like turbid whey. The eyes were heavy, reddish, and as it were weeping; the countenance very often full, flushed, and bloated, cynanche though sometimes pale and sunk.\n\nHow slight soever the disorder might appear in the daytime, at night the symptoms became greatly aggravated, and the feverish habit very much increased, nay, sometimes a delirium occurred on the very first night; and this exacerbation constantly returned through the whole course of the disease. Indeed, when it was considerably on the decline, our author says he has been often pretty much surprised to find his patient had passed the whole night in a phrensy, whom he had left tolerably cool and sedate in the day.\n\nSome few hours after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZURE\">seizure</a>, and sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with it, a swelling and soreness of the throat was perceived, and the tonsils became very tumid and inflamed, and many times the parotid and maxillary glands swelled very much, and very suddenly, even at the very beginning; sometimes so much as even to threaten strangulation. The fauces also very soon appeared of a high florid red, or rather of a bright crimson, colour, very shining and glossy; and most commonly on the uvula, tonsils, velum palatinum, and back part of the pharynx, several whitish or ash-coloured spots appeared scattered up and down, which oftentimes increased very fast, and soon covered one or both the tonsils, uvula, &c.: those in the event proved sloughs of superficial ulcers (which sometimes, however, ate very deep into the parts). The tongue at this time, though only white and moist at the tip, was very foul at the root, and covered with a thick, yellowish or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> coat. The breath also now began to be very nauseous; which offensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> increased hourly, and in some became at length intolerable, and that too sometimes even to the patients themselves.\n\nThe second or third day every symptom became much more aggravated, and the fever much more considerable; and those that had struggled with it tolerably well for 30 or 40 hours, were forced to submit. The restlessness and anxiety greatly increased, as well as the difficulty in swallowing. The head was very giddy, pained, and loaded; there was generally more or less of a delirium; sometimes a pervigilium and perpetual phrensy, though others lay very stupid, but often starting and muttering to themselves. The skin was very hot, dry, and rough; there was very rarely any disposition to sweat. The urine was pale, thin, crude; often yellowish and turbid. Sometimes vomiting was urgent; and sometimes a very great looseness, in children particularly. The sloughs were now much enlarged, and of a darker colour, and the surrounding parts tended much more to a livid hue. The breathing became much more difficult; with a kind of a rattling stertor, as if the patient was actually strangling, the voice being exceeding hoarse and hollow, exactly resembling that from venereal ulcers in the fauces: this noise in speaking and breathing was so peculiar, that any person in the least conversant with the disease might easily know it by this odd noise; from whence indeed the Spanish physicians gave it the name of garrotilla, expressing the noise made by persons when they are strangled with a rope. Dr Fothergill never observed in one of them the shrill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARKING\">barking</a> noise that we frequently hear in inflammatory cynanche. The breath...\nPhilana. breath of all the diseased was very nauseous; of some insufferably fetid, especially in the advance of the distemper to a crisis; and many about the fourth or fifth day spit off a vast quantity of stinking purulent mucus tinged sometimes with blood: and sometimes the matter was quite livid, and of an abominable smell. The nostrils likewise in many were greatly inflamed and excoriated, continually dripping down a very sharp ichor or sanious matter, so excessively acrid, that it not only corroded the lips, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a>, and hands of the children that laboured under the disease, but even the fingers and arms of the very nurses that attended them: as this ulceration of the nostrils came on, it commonly caused an almost incessant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SNEEZING\">sneezing</a> in the children; but few adults were affected with it, at least to any considerable degree. It was surprising what quantities of matter some children discharged this way, which they would often rub on their face, hands, and arms, and blister them all over. A sudden stoppage of this rheum from the mouth and nostrils actually choked several children; and some swallowed such quantities of it, as occasioned excoriations of the intestines, violent gripings, dysentery, &c. nay, even excoriations of the anus and buttocks. Not only the nostrils, fauces, &c. were greatly affected by the extremely sharp matter, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>-pipe itself was sometimes much corroded by it, and pieces of its internal membrane were spit up, with much blood and corruption; and the patients lingered on for a considerable time, and at length died tabid; though there were more frequent instances of its falling suddenly and violently on the lungs, and killing in a peripneumonic manner.\n\nDr Huxham was astonished sometimes to see several swallow with tolerable ease, though the tumour of the tonsils and throat, the quantity of thick mucus, and the rattling noise in breathing, were very terrible; which he thinks pretty clearly shows, that this malignant angina was more from the acrimony and abundance of the humours than the violence of the inflammation.\n\nMost commonly the angina came on before the exanthemata; but many times the cuticular eruption appeared before the sore-throat, and was sometimes very considerable, though there was little or no pain in the fauces: on the contrary, a very severe angina seized some patients that had no manner of eruption; and yet, even in these cases, a very great itching and desquamation of the skin sometimes ensued; but this was chiefly in grown persons, very rarely in children. In general, however, a very considerable efflorescence broke out on the surface of the body, particularly in children; and it most commonly happened the second, third, or fourth day: sometimes it was partial, sometimes it covered almost the whole body, though very seldom the face: sometimes it was of an erysipela-tous kind; sometimes more pustular: the pustules frequently eminent, and of a deep fiery red colour, particularly on the breast and arms; but oftentimes they were very small, and might be better felt than seen, and gave a very odd kind of roughness to the skin. The colour of the efflorescence was commonly of a crimson hue, or as if the skin had been smeared over with juice of raspberries, and this even to the fingers ends; and the skin appeared inflamed and swollen, as it were; the arms, hands, and fingers, were often evidently so, and very stiff, and somewhat painful. This crimson colour of the skin seemed indeed Cynanche peculiar to this disease. Though the eruption seldom failed of giving some manifest relief to the patient, as to anxiety, sickness at stomach, vomiting, purging, &c. yet there was observed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> fiery eruption on some persons, without the least abatement of the symptoms, nay almost every symptom seemed more aggravated, particularly the fever, load at breast, anxiety, and delirium; Dr Huxham knew more than one or two patients die in the most raging phrensy, covered with the most universal fiery rash he ever saw: so that, as in the highly confluent smallpox, it seemed only to denote the quantity of the disease, as he terms it.\n\nHe had under his care a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, about 12 years of age, whose tongue, fauces, and tonsils, were as black as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a>, and he swallowed with extreme difficulty; he continually spit off immense quantities of a black, sanious, and very fetid matter, for at least eight or ten days:\u2014about the seventh day, his fever being somewhat abated, he fell into a bloody dysentery, though the bloody, sanious, fetid expectoration still continued, with a most violent cough. He at length indeed got over it, to the very great surprise of every one that saw him. Now, in this patient, a severe and universal rash broke out upon the second and third day; and the itching of his skin was so intolerable, that he tore it all over his body in a most shocking manner; yet this very great and timely eruption very little relieved his fever and phrensy, or prevented the other dreadful symptoms mentioned.\n\nAn early and kindly eruption, however, was most commonly a very good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMEN\">omen</a>; and, when succeeded by a very copious desquamation of the cuticle, one of the most favourable symptoms that occurred: but when the eruption turned of a dusky or livid colour, or prematurely or suddenly receded, every symptom grew worse, and the utmost danger impended, especially if purple or black spots appeared up and down, as sometimes happened; the urine grew limpid, and convulsions came on, or a fatal suffocation soon closed the tragedy.\n\nThe disease was generally at the height about the fifth or sixth day in young persons, in the elder not so soon; and the crisis many times was not till the 11th or 12th, and then very imperfect; some adults however, were carried off in two or three days; the distemper either falling on the lungs, and killing in a peripneumonic manner; or on the brain, in which case the patient either died raving or comatose. In some, the disease brought on a very troublesome cough, purulent expectoration, haemoptoe, and hectic fever; which they lingered on for several weeks, and then died tabid.\n\nIf a gentle easy sweat took place on the third or fourth day; if the pulse became more slow, firm, and equal; if the sloughs of the fauces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> off in a kindly manner, and appeared at the bottom tolerably clean and florid; if the breathing was more soft and free, and some degree of vigour and quickness returned in the eyes; all was well, and a salutary crisis followed soon by a continuance of the sweat, and a turbid, subsiding, farinaceous urine, a plentiful expectoration, and a very large desquamation of the cuticle. But if a rigor came on, and the exanthemata suddenly disappeared or turned livid;\nlivid; if the pulse grew very small and quick, and the skin remained hot and parched as it were, the breathing more difficult, the eyes dead and glassy, the urine pale and limpid, a phrensy or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMA\">coma</a> succeeded, with a coldish clammy sweat on the face or extremities; life was despaired of, especially if a singultus and choking or gulping in the throat attended, with sudden, liquid, involuntary, livid stools, intolerably fetid. In some few patients, Dr Huxham observed, some time before the fatal period, not only the face bloated, sallow, shining and greasy as it were, but the whole neck very much swollen, and of a cadaverous look; and even the whole body became in some degree oedematous; and the impression of a finger would remain fixed in a part, the skin not rising again as usual; an indication that the blood stagnated in the capillaries, and that the elasticity of the fibres was quite lost.\n\nMedical writers are still much divided in opinion, whether the cynanche maligna is to be considered as the same disease with the scarlatina anginosae, afterwards to be treated of, or not. This question will afterwards come to be more fully discussed. At present we may only observe, that although ulcerous sore throats of a malignant nature often appear sporadically, yet that the disease above described appears only as an epidemic, and is always the consequence of contagion.\n\nWe have, therefore, no doubt that the cynanche maligna of Huxham, Fothergill, and Cullen, is precisely the same disease with the scarlatina anginosae of Sauvage, Withering, and other late writers. This is abundantly demonstrated by the diversities which take place in the appearance of the disease among children of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> during the same epidemic.\n\nPrognosis. This may be easily gathered from the above description. The malignant and putrid tendency of the disease is evident, and an increase of the symptoms which arise from that putrescent disposition of the body must give an unfavourable prognostic. On the contrary, a decrease of these, and an apparent increase of the vis vitae, are favourable: in general, what is observed to be favourable in the nervous and putrid malignant fevers, is also favourable in this, and vice versa.\n\nCauses. Since the accurate accounts given by Dr Fothergill and Huxham of the epidemics which prevailed about 50 years ago, this disease has frequently been observed at times epidemic in almost every different part of Britain. Like smallpox, measles, and chincough, it seems in every case to be the effect of a peculiar and specific contagion. It has been observed to prevail, equally generally in every situation, and at every season; and on exposure to the contagion, no age, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, or condition, is exempted from it. But the having once had the disease, seems in this affection to afford the same security against future contagion as in the smallpox: at least instances, where it can be said that the same individual has been twice affected with it, are both very rare and very doubtful, as well as in smallpox.\n\nCure. Like other febrile contagions, the malignant ulcerous sore throat is terminated only by a natural course; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> business of the practitioner is to combat unfavourable occurrences. In this the septic tendency of the disease is chiefly to be kept in view. The debility with which it is attended renders all evacuations by bleeding and purging improper, except in a few instances where the debility is less, and the inflammatory symptoms more considerable. The fauces are to be preserved from the effects of the acrid matter poured out upon them, and are therefore to be frequently washed out by antiseptic gargles or injections; and the putrescent state of the whole system should be guarded against and corrected by internal antiseptics, especially by the Peruvian bark given in the beginning and continued through the course of the disease. Great benefit is also often derived from the liberal use of the mineral acids. Both the sulphuric and muriatic, in a state of proper dilution, have been highly extolled by different medical writers, and are productive of the best effects in actual practice, when they can be introduced to a sufficient extent. In particular, the oxygenated muriatic acid, as recommended by Mr Braithwaite, has been found productive of the greatest advantages. Emetics, both by vomiting and nauseating, prove useful. When any considerable tumor occurs, blisters applied externally will be of service, and in any case may be proper to moderate the inflammation.\n\nVery lately, the internal use of the capsicum annum, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAYENNE\">Cayenne</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, as it is commonly called, has been highly celebrated in this affection; and it is particularly said to have been employed with singular success in the West Indies.\n\nBut of all the remedies lately proposed, none has been more highly extolled than the external use of cold water. It has even been contended by some that by dashing cold water on the surface of the body, an immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> cure of this disease may be obtained. We are, however, fully persuaded, that cold water will no more destroy the contagion of this disease than of smallpox; and we cannot help thinking that the practice is seldom necessary, and sometimes hurtful.\n\nSp.

Argentorati 1778, et auctores ab eo allegati.\n\nThe best description of this disease we have in Dr Cullen's Practice of Physic. He informs us, that it consists in an inflammation of the glottis, larynx, or upper part of the trachea, whether it affect the membranes of these parts or the muscles adjoining. It may arise first in these parts, and continue to subsist in them alone; or it may come to affect these parts from the cynanche tonsillaris, or maligna, spreading into them.\n\nIn either way it has been a rare occurrence, and few instances of it have been marked and recorded by physicians. It is to be known by a peculiar croaking sound of the voice, by difficult respiration, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of straitening about the larynx, and by a pyrexia attending it.\n\nFrom the nature of these symptoms, and from the dissection of the bodies of persons who died of this disease, there is no doubt of its being of an inflammatory kind. It does not, however, always run the course of inflammatory affections; but frequently produces such an obstruction of the passage of the air, as suffocates, and thereby proves suddenly fatal.\n\nIt particularly proves fatal, in consequence of the trachea being obstructed by a membranous substance lining the inside of it, and very nearly approaching in appearance to the inflammatory exudation often discovered on the intestinal canal in those dying of enteritis.\n\nIf we judge rightly of the nature of this disease, it will be obvious, that the cure of it requires the most powerful remedies of inflammation to be employed upon the very first appearance of the symptoms. When a suffocation is threatened, whether any remedies can be employed to prevent it, is not yet determined by sufficient experience: but it is evident, that in certain cases the life of the patient can be preserved only by the removal of that matter which obstructs the passage of air through the trachea.\n\nThe accounts which books have hitherto given us of inflammations of the larynx, and the parts connected with it, amount to what we have now said; and many instances are recorded of the disease happening in adult persons: but there is a peculiar affection of this kind happening to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a>, which has been little taken notice of till lately. Dr Francis Home is the first who has given any distinct account of this disease; but, since he wrote, several other authors have taken notice of it, and have given different opinions concerning it.\n\nThis disease seldom attacks infants till after they have been weaned. After this period, the younger they are, the more liable they are to the disease. The frequency of it becomes less as children become more advanced; and there are few instances of children above 12 years of age being affected with it. It attacks children of the midland countries, as well as those who live near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>; but it occurs much more frequently at certain places than at others. It does not appear to be contagious; and its attacks are frequently repeated in the same child. It is often manifestly the effect of cold applied to the body; and cynanche therefore appears most frequently in the winter and spring seasons. It very commonly comes on with the ordinary symptoms of a catarrh; but sometimes the peculiar symptoms of the disease show themselves at the very first.\n\nThese peculiar symptoms are the following: A hoarseness, with some shrillness and ringing sound, both in speaking and coughing, as if the noise came from a brazen tube. At the same time, there is a sense of pain about the larynx, some difficulty of respiration, with a whizzing sound in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>, as if the passage of the air were straitened. The cough which attends it, is commonly dry; and if anything be spit up, it is matter of a purulent appearance, and sometimes films resembling portions of a membrane. With all these symptoms, there is a frequency of pulse, a restlessness, and an uneasy sense of heat. When the internal fauces are viewed, they are sometimes without any appearance of inflammation; but frequently a redness, and even swelling, appears; and sometimes there is an appearance of matter like to that rejected by coughing, together with the symptoms now described, and particularly with great difficulty of breathing, and a sense of strangling in the fauces, by which the patient is sometimes suddenly taken off.\n\nMany dissections have been made of infants who had died of this disease, and almost constantly there has appeared a preternatural substance, apparently membranous, lining the whole internal surface of the upper part of the trachea, and extending in the same manner downwards into some of its ramifications. This preternatural membrane may be easily separated, and sometimes has been found separated in part from the subjacent proper membrane of the trachea. This last is commonly found entire, that is, without any appearance of erosion or ulceration; but it frequently shows the vestiges of inflammation, and is covered by a matter resembling pus, like to that rejected by coughing; and very often a matter of the same kind is found in the bronchi\u00e6, sometimes in considerable quantity.\n\nFrom the remote causes of this disease; from the catarrhal symptoms commonly attending it; from the pyrexia constantly present with it; from the same kind of preternatural membrane being found in the trachea when the cynanche maligna is communicated to it; and from the vestiges of inflammation on the trachea discovered upon dissection; we must conclude, that this disease consists in an inflammatory affection of the mucous membrane of the larynx and trachea, producing an exudation analogous to that found on the surface of inflamed viscera, and appearing partly in a membranous crust, and partly in a fluid form resembling pus.\n\nThough this disease consists in an inflammatory affection, it does not commonly end either in suppuration or gangrene. The most troublesome circumstance of it seems to consist in a spasm of the muscles of the glottis, threatening suffocation.\n\nWhen this disease terminates in health, it is by resolution of the inflammation, by ceasing of the spasm of the glottis, by an expectoration of the matter exuding from the trachea, and of the crusts formed there,\nthere, and frequently it ends without any expectoration, or at least with such only as attends an ordinary catarrh. But in some instances, a salutary termination has very speedily taken place, in consequence of the discharge of the membranous substance from the trachea, even under its proper tubular form.\n\nWhen the disease ends fatally, it is by a suffocation seemingly depending upon a spasm affecting the glottis; but sometimes, probably, depending on a quantity of matter filling the bronchiae or obstructing the trachea.\n\nAs we suppose the disease to be an inflammatory affection, so we attempt the cure of it by the usual remedies of inflammation. Bleeding, both general and topical, has often given immediate relief, and, by being repeated, has entirely cured the disease. Blistering also, near the part affected, has been found useful. Upon the first attack of the disease, vomiting, immediately after bleeding, seems to be of considerable use, and sometimes suddenly removes the disease. But emetics are still more useful in advanced periods. By the employment of these, the matter obstructing the trachea, and inducing spasmodic affections, has often been successfully removed, when the situation of the patient seemed to be almost desperate. And as in the progress of the disease fresh effusions of this matter are very apt to take place, the frequent repetition of emetics becomes necessary. It is often necessary to have recourse to those operating the most expeditiously, such as sulphate of zinc even in large doses. In every stage of the disease, the antiphlogistic regimen is necessary, and particularly the frequent use of laxative glysters. Some practitioners consider mercury, particularly under the form of calomel, as an almost infallible remedy in this disease. It has particularly been extolled by Mr James Anderson, an eminent surgeon in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. But we are sorry to say that in some cases at least, after the fairest trial, it has been found to fail. Though we suppose that a spasm affecting the glottis is often fatal in this disease, antispasmodic medicines have not in general been found of great service. Some, however, have strongly recommended the use of asafoetida under the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJECTION\">injection</a>; others place great confidence in oil or oily mixtures, taken by the mouth; but more immediate benefit is derived from tepid bathing, and the employment of sulphuric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, both externally and internally.\n\nBy these, when the disease is spasmodic, it is often successfully removed. But by much the most dangerous form of the disease is the inflammatory state giving the exudation. And when this inflammatory exudation has even been removed from the upper part of the trachea, yet it has sometimes proved fatal from the inflammation and exudation extending to the branches of the aspera arteria.

It is often epidemic, and manifestly contagious. It comes on with the usual symptoms of pyrexia, which is soon after attended with a considerable tumour of the external fauces and neck. The swelling appears first as a glandular moveable tumor at the corner of the lower jaw; but it soon becomes uniformly diffused over a great part of the neck, sometimes on one side only, but more commonly on both. The swelling continues to increase till the fourth day; but from that period it declines, and in a few days more goes off entirely. As the swelling of the fauces recedes, it not unfrequently happens that some tumor affects the testicles in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MALE\">male</a> sex, or the breasts in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>. These tumors are sometimes large, hard, and somewhat painful; but are seldom either very painful or of long continuance. The pyrexia attending this disease is commonly slight, and goes off with the swelling of the fauces; but sometimes, when the swelling of the testicles does not succeed to that of the fauces, or when the one or the other has been suddenly repressed, the pyrexia becomes more considerable, is often attended with delirium, and has sometimes proved fatal.\n\nAs this disease commonly runs its course without either dangerous or troublesome symptoms, so it hardly requires any remedies. An antiphlogistic regimen, and avoiding cold, are all that will be commonly necessary. But when, upon the receding of the swellings, the pyrexia comes to be considerable, and threatens an affection of the brain, it will be proper, by warm fomentations, to bring back the swelling; and by vomiting, bleeding, or blistering, to obviate the consequences of its absence.\n\nGenus XI.

Pneumonic inflammation, however various in the seat, always discovers itself by pyrexia, difficult breathing, cough, and pain in some part of the thorax. It almost always comes on with a cold stage, and is accompanied with the other symptoms of pyrexia; though in some few instances the pulse may not be more frequent, nor the heat of the body increased beyond what is natural. Sometimes the pyrexia is from the beginning accompanied with the other symptoms; but frequently it is formed some hours before them, and particularly before the pain be felt. The pulse for the most part is frequent, full, strong, hard, and quick; but, in a few instances, especially in the advanced state of the disease, it is weak, soft, and at the same time irregular. The difficulty of breathing is most considerable in inspiration, both because the lungs do not easily admit of a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a>, and because the dilatation increases the pain attending the disease. The difficulty of breathing is also greater when the patient is in one posture of the body rather than another. It is generally greater when he lies on the side affected; though sometimes the contrary happens. Very often the patient cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> upon either side, and can find ease only when lying on the back; and sometimes he cannot breathe readily, except when in somewhat of an erect posture. The cough, in different cases, is more or less urgent or painful. It is sometimes dry, or without any expectoration, especially in the beginning of the disease; but more commonly it is, even from the beginning, moist, and the matter spit up various both in consistence and colour, and frequently it is streaked with blood. The pain is also different in different cases, and felt in different parts of the thorax, but most frequently in one side. It has been said to affect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> side more frequently than the left; but this is uncertain, and we are sure that the left side has been very often affected. Sometimes it is felt as if it was under the sternum; sometimes in the back between the shoulders; and when in the sides, its place has been higher or lower, more forward or backward; but the place of all most frequently affected is about the sixth or seventh rib, near the middle of its length, or a little more forward. The pain is often severe and pungent; but sometimes more dull and obtuse, with a sense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> rather than of pain. It is most especially severe and pungent when occupying the place last mentioned. For the most part it continues fixed in one part, but sometimes shoots from the side to the scapula on one hand, or to the sternum and clavicle on the other.\n\nDr Cullen supposes that the disease is always seated, or at least begins, in some part of the pleura, taking that membrane in its greatest extent, as now commonly understood; that is, as covering not only the internal surface of the cavity of the thorax, but also as forming the mediastinum, and as extended over the pericardium, and over the whole surface of the lungs. But as the symptoms never clearly indicate where the seat of the disease is, there is but little foundation for the different names by which it has been distinguished. The term pleurisy is improperly limited to that inflammation which begins in and chiefly affects the pleura costalis. This Dr Cullen thinks is a rare occurrence; and that the pneumonia much more frequently begins in the pleura investing the lungs, producing all the symptoms which belong to what hath been called the pleuritis vera. The word peripneumony has been applied to an inflammation beginning in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARENCHYMA\">parenchyma</a>, or cellular texture of the lungs, and having its seat chiefly there. But to Dr Cullen it seems very doubtful if any acute inflammation of the lungs, or any disease which has been called peripneumony, be of that kind. It seems probable,\nthat every acute inflammation begins in membranous parts; and in every dissection of persons who have died of peripneumony, the external membrane of the lungs, or some part of the pleura, has appeared to have been considerably affected. An inflammation of the pleura covering the upper surface of the diaphragm, has been distinguished by the appellation of paraphrenitis, as supposed to be attended with the peculiar symptoms of delirium, risus sardonicus, and other convulsive motions: but it is certain, that an inflammation of that portion of the pleura, and affecting also even the muscular substance of the diaphragm, has often taken place without any of the symptoms above mentioned; and neither the dissections which have fallen under Dr Cullen's observation, nor any accounts of dissections, support the opinion that an inflammation of the pleura covering the diaphragm is attended with delirium more commonly than any other pneumonic inflammation.\u2014It is to be observed, however, that though the inflammation may begin in one particular part of the pleura, the morbid affection is commonly communicated to the whole extent of the membrane.\n\nThe pneumonic inflammation, like others, may terminate by resolution, suppuration, or gangrene: but it has also a termination peculiar to itself; namely, when it is attended with an effusion of blood into the cellular texture of the lungs, which, soon interrupting the circulation of the blood through the viscera, produces a fatal suffocation. This indeed appears to be the most common termination of pneumonic inflammation when it ends fatally; for upon the dissection of almost every person who has died of this disease, it appears that such an effusion had happened. From the same dissections we learn, that pneumonic inflammation commonly produces an exudation from the internal surface of the pleura, which appears partly as a soft viscid crust, often of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> membranous form, covering everywhere the surface of the pleura, and particularly those parts where the lungs adhere to the pleura costalis, or mediastinum; and this crust seems always to be the cement of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a>. The same exudation shows itself also by a quantity of a serous fluid commonly found in the cavity of the thorax; and some exudation or effusion is usually found to have been made into the cavity of the pericardium. It seems likewise probable, that an effusion of this kind is sometimes made into the cavity of the bronchi\u00e6; for in some persons who have died after labouring under a pneumonic inflammation for a few days only, the bronchi\u00e6 have been found filled with a considerable quantity of serous and thickish fluid, which must be considered rather as the effusion above mentioned, having had its thinner parts taken off by respiration, than as a pus so suddenly formed in the inflamed part. It is, however, not improbable, that this effusion, as well as that made into the cavities of the thorax and pericardium, may be a matter of the same kind with that which in other inflammations is poured into the cellular texture of the parts inflamed, and there converted into pus; but in the thorax and pericardium it does not always put on this appearance, because the crust covering the surface prevents the absorption of the thinner part. This absorption, however, may be compensated in the bronchi\u00e6, by the drying power of the air; and therefore the effusion into them may assume a more purulent appearance. In many cases of pneumonic inflammation, when the expectoration is very copious, it is difficult to suppose that the whole proceeds from the mucous follicles of the bronchi\u00e6; and it seems probable that a great part of it may come from the effused scrofulous fluid just mentioned; and this too will account for the appearance of the expectoration being so often purulent. Perhaps the same thing will account for that purulent matter found in the bronchi\u00e6, which Mr de Haen says he had often observed when there was no ulceration in the lungs, and which he accounts for in a very strange manner, namely, by supposing a pus formed in the circulating blood.\n\nDr Cullen is of opinion, that the effusion into the bronchi\u00e6 above mentioned often concurs with the effusion of red blood into the cellular substance of the lungs to occasion the fatal suffocation which frequently terminates peripneumony: that the effusion of serum alone may have this effect: and that the serum poured out in a certain quantity, rather than any debility in the powers of expectoration, is the cause of that cessation of spitting which precedes the fatal event; for in many cases the expectoration has ceased, when no other symptoms of debility have appeared, and when, upon dissection, the bronchi\u00e6 have been full of liquid matter. Nay, it is even probable, that in some cases such an effusion may take place without any symptoms of violent inflammation; and in other cases the effusion taking place may seem to remove the symptoms of inflammation which had appeared before, and thus account for those unexpected fatal terminations which have sometimes happened.\n\nPneumonic inflammation seldom terminates by resolution, without being attended with some evident evacuation. An haemorrhagy from the nose happening on some of the first days of the disease has sometimes put an end to it; and it is said, that an evacuation from the hemorrhoidal veins, a bilious evacuation by stool, and an evacuation of urine with a copious sediment, have severally had the same effect; but such occurrences have been rare. The evacuation most frequently attending, and seeming to have the greatest effect in promoting resolution, is an expectoration of a thick, white, or yellowish matter, a little streaked with blood, copious, and brought up without much or violent coughing. Very frequently the resolution of this disease is attended with, and perhaps produced by, a sweat, if it be warm, fluid, copious, over the whole body, and attended with an abatement of the frequency of the pulse, heat of the body, and other febrile symptoms. Although, from the history now given, it appears that pleurisy and peripneumony cannot with propriety be considered as different diseases, yet it is certain that in different cases this affection occurs with an assemblage of symptoms separate and distinct. Thus even Dr Cullen himself, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSOLOGY\">Nosology</a>, has defined pleuritis to consist in pyrexia, attended with pungent pain of the side, painful respiration, difficulty of lying down, particularly on the affected side, and distressing cough, in the beginning dry, but afterwards humid, and often with bloody expectoration. While again he has defined peripneumony to consist in pyrexia, attended with a dull pain under the sternum and between the shoulders, anxiety, difficulty of breathing, hu-\nmid cough, expectoration generally bloody, a soft pulse, and a tumid livid appearance of the countenance. It is highly probable, that the first of these sets of symptoms chiefly arises from a state of active inflammation, and the second from effusion. Thus, in certain cases, the symptoms may appear perfectly separate and distinct; but more frequently both inflammation and effusion are united; and thus the symptoms in both definitions are in general combined in the same patient. But still pleuritis, strictly so called, may be considered as characterized by the acute pungent pain at a particular spot of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, and that pain much aggravated on a full inspiration; while proper peripneumonia is distinguished by the dull gravitative pain extended over the whole chest, and by the laborious respiration.\n\nCauses of, and persons subject to, this disorder. The remote cause of pneumonic inflammation is commonly cold applied to the body, obstructing perspiration, and determining to the lungs, while at the same time the lungs themselves are exposed to the action of cold. These circumstances operate chiefly when an inflammatory diathesis prevails in the system; and therefore those principally affected with this disease are persons of the greatest vigour, in cold climates, often in the winter season, but particularly in the spring, when vicissitudes of heat and cold are frequent. The disease, however, may arise in any season when such varieties take place. Other remote causes also may have a share in producing this distemper; such as every means of obstructing, straining, or otherwise injuring, the pulmonary organs. The pneumonic inflammation has sometimes been so much an epidemic, that it hath been suspected of depending on a specific contagion; but Dr Cullen never met with an instance of its being contagious.\n\nPrognosis. In pneumonic inflammations, a violent pyrexia is always dangerous. The danger, however, is chiefly denoted by the difficulty of breathing. When the patient can lie on one side only; when he can lie on neither side, but only on his back; when he cannot breathe with tolerable ease, except when the trunk of his body is erect; when even in this posture the breathing is very difficult, and attended with a turgescence and flushing of the face, with partial sweats about the head and neck, and an irregular pulse; these circumstances mark the difficulty of breathing in different degrees; and consequently, in proportion, the danger of the disease. A frequent violent cough, aggravating the pain, is always the symptom of an obstinate disease; and as the disease is seldom or never resolved without some expectoration, so a dry cough must always be an unfavourable symptom.\n\nThe proper characteristics of the expectoration have been already laid down; and though an expectoration which has not these marks must indicate a doubtful state of the disease, yet the colour alone can give no certain prognostic. An acute pain, very much interrupting inspiration, is always the mark of a violent disease; but not of a more dangerous disease than an obtuse pain, attended with very difficult respiration, demonstrating effusion into the cells.\n\nWhen the pains, which had at first affected one side only, shall afterwards spread into the other; or when, leaving the side first affected, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> entirely into the other; these are always marks of a dangerous disease.\n\nA delirium coming on during a pneumonic inflammation is always a symptom denoting much danger.\n\nWhen pneumonic disorders terminate fatally, it is on one or other of the days of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, from the third to the seventh. This is the most common case; but, in a few instances, death has happened at a later period. When the disease is violent, but admitting of resolution, this also happens frequently in the course of the first week; but in a more moderate disease the resolution is often put off to the second week. The disease generally suffers a remission on some of the days; from the third to the seventh; which, however, may be often fallacious, as it sometimes returns again with as much violence as before; and in such a case with great danger. Sometimes it disappears on the third day, while an erysipelas makes its appearance on some external part; and if this continue fixed, the pneumatic inflammation does not recur. If the disease continue beyond the 14th day, it will terminate in a suppuration, or Putrosis. The termination by gangrene is much more rare than has been imagined; and when it does occur, it is usually joined with the termination by effusion; the symptoms of the one being hardly distinguishable from those of the other.\n\nCure. This must proceed upon the general plan mentioned under Synocha; but, on account of the importance of the part affected, the remedies must be employed early, and as fully as possible: and these are chiefly directed with one of three views, viz. for obtaining a resolution of the inflammation in the thorax, for mitigating the urgent symptoms before a resolution can be effected, and for counteracting or obviating the consequences of the disease. Venection is the remedy chiefly to be depended on; and may be performed in either arm, as the surgeon finds most convenient; and the quantity taken away ought in general to be as large as the patient's strength will allow. The remission of pain, and the relief of respiration, during the flowing of the blood, may limit the quantity to be then drawn; but if these symptoms of relief do not appear, the bleeding should be continued to a considerable extent, unless symptoms of a beginning syncope come on. It is seldom that one bleeding, however large, will cure this disease; and though the pain and difficulty of breathing may be much relieved by the first bleeding, these symptoms commonly and after no long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> recur, often with as much violence as before. In this case the bleeding is to be repeated even on the same day, and perhaps to the same quantity as before. Sometimes the second bleeding may be larger than the first. There are persons, who, by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, are ready to faint even upon a small bleeding; and in such persons this may prevent the drawing so much blood at first as a pneumonic inflammation may require: but as the same persons are found to bear after-bleedings better than the first, this allows the second and subsequent bleedings to be larger, and to such a quantity as the symptoms of the disease may seem to require.\n\nBleedings are to be repeated according to the state of the symptoms, and they will be more effectual when practised in the course of the first three days than afterwards; but they are not to be omitted though four days of the disease may already have elapsed. If the physician has not been called in time, or the first bleed-\nings have not been sufficiently large, or even though they should have procured some remission, yet upon the return of the urgent symptoms, bleeding may be repeated at any time within the first fortnight, or even after that period, if a suppuration be not evident, or if after a seeming solution the disease shall have returned.\n\nWith respect to the quantity of blood which may be taken away with safety, no general rules can be given; as it must be very different according to the state of the disease, and the constitution of the patient. In an adult male of tolerable strength, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of blood is a full bleeding. Any quantity above 20 ounces is a large, and any quantity below 12 is a small, bleeding. An evacuation of four or five pounds, in the course of two or three days, is generally as much as most patients will bear; but if the intervals between the bleedings, and the whole of the time during which the bleedings have been employed, have been long, the quantity taken upon the whole may be greater.\n\nWhen a large quantity of blood has been taken from the arm, and it is doubtful if more can be taken in that manner with safety, some blood may still be taken by cupping and scarifying. This will especially be proper, when the recurrence of the pain, rather than the difficulty of breathing, becomes the urgent symptom; and then the cupping and scarification should be made as near as possible to the pained part.\n\nAn expectoration sometimes takes place very early in this disease; but if the symptoms continue urgent, the bleedings must be repeated notwithstanding the expectoration: but in a more advanced state, and when the symptoms have suffered a considerable remission, we may then trust the cure to the expectoration alone. It is not observed that bleeding, during the first days of the disease, stops expectoration; on the contrary, it has been often found to promote it; and it is only in a more advanced state of the disease, when the patient has been already exhausted by large evacuations and a continuance of his illness, that bleeding seems to put a stop to expectoration; and even then, this stoppage seems not to take place so much from the powers of expectoration being weakened by bleeding, as by its favouring the serous effusion in the bronchiae, already taken notice of.\n\nBesides bleeding, every part of the antiphlogistic regimen ought here to be carefully employed; the patient must keep out of bed as much as he can bear; must have plenty of warm diluting drinks, impregnated with vegetable acids, accompanied with nitre or some other cooling neutral salt; and the belly also ought to be kept open by emollient clysters or cooling laxative medicines. Vomiting in the beginning is dangerous; but in a somewhat advanced state of the disease emetics have been found the best means of promoting expectoration. Forcements and poultices to the pained part have been found useful; but blistering is found to be much more effectual. A blister, however, ought not to be applied till at least one bleeding has been promised, as venesection is less effectual when the irritation of a blister is present. If the disease be moderate, a blister may be applied immediately after the first bleeding; but in violent cases, where it may be presumed that a second bleeding may soon be necessary after the first, it will be proper to delay the blister till after the second bleeding, when it may be supposed that the irritation occasioned by the blister will be over before another bleeding becomes necessary.\n\nIt may frequently be of use in this disease to repeat the blistering; and in that case the plasters should always be applied somewhere on the thorax, for when applied to more distant parts they have less effect. The keeping the blistered parts open, and making what is called a perpetual blister, has much less effect than a repeated blistering.\n\nMany methods have been proposed for promoting expectoration, but none appear to be sufficiently effectual; and some of the expectorants, being acid stimulant substances, are not very safe. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a> usually employed seem to be too heating; the squills less so; but they are not very powerful, and sometimes inconvenient, by the constant nausea they occasion. The volatile alkali may be of service as an expectorant, but it ought to be reserved for an advanced state of the disease. Mucilaginous and oily demulcents appear to be useful, by allaying that acrimony of the mucus which occasions too frequent coughing; and which coughing prevents the stagnation and thickening of the mucus, and thereby its becoming mild. The receiving into the lungs the steams of warm water, impregnated with vinegar, has often proved useful in promoting expectoration; and, for this purpose, the machine called the Inhaler, lately invented by Dr Mudge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLYMOUTH\">Plymouth</a>, promises to be of great service. But of all others, the antimonial emetics, given in nauseating doses, are perhaps the most powerful for promoting expectoration. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KERMES\">kermes</a> mineral has been greatly recommended; but does not seem to be more efficacious than tartrite of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a> or antimonial wine; and the dose of the kermes is much more uncertain than that of the others.\n\nThough this disease often terminates by a spontaneous sweating, this evacuation ought not to be excited by art, unless with much caution. When, after some remission of the symptoms, spontaneous sweats arise, they may be encouraged; but it ought to be without much heat, and without stimulant medicines. If, however, the sweats be partial and clammy only, and a great difficulty of breathing still remain, it will be very dangerous to encourage them.\n\nPhysicians have differed much with regard to the use of opiates in pneumonic affections. It appears, however, that in the beginning of the disease, and before bleeding and blistering have produced some remission of the pain, and of the difficulty of breathing, opiates have had a bad tendency, by their increasing the difficulty of breathing and other inflammatory symptoms. But in a more advanced state of the disease, when the difficulty of breathing has abated, and when the urgent symptom is a cough, proving the chief cause of the continuance of pain and want of rest, opiates may be employed with great advantage and safety. The interruption of the expectoration which they seem to occasion, is for a short time only; and they seem often to promote it, as they occasion a stagnation of what was by frequent coughing dissipated insensibly: and therefore give the appearance of what physicians called concocted matter.\n\nOpium combined with calomel has of late been highly extolled in this and other inflammatory diseases by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> of Lynn Regis; who has given a full account\nLike the vomica, it is a rare distemper, but may attack Peritonitis, all those subject to pneumonia.\n\nPrognosis. Very few recover after an empyema has been once formed, especially if the operation of paracentesis be neglected. After this operation is performed, if a great quantity of bloody fetid pus be discharged, if the fever continue, and if the patient spit up a purulent, pale, frothy, livid, or green matter, with a decay of strength, there is no hope: But when a small quantity of pus, of a white colour, not very fetid, is discharged; when the fever and thirst presently cease, the appetite returns, and faces of a good consistence are discharged, the strength also returning in some degree; there is then hope of a perfect recovery. If the matter be not dried up in seven weeks time, the disease readily changes to a fistulous ulcer, which is very difficult to cure. An empyema affecting both sides of the thorax is more dangerous than that which affects only one.\n\nCure. This consists in evacuating the purulent matter contained in the cavity of the thorax, which is best done by the operation of paracentesis of the thorax. See Surgery. Afterwards the ulcer is to be treated with abistergent and consolidating medicines, and the same internal ones are to be given as in a Phthisis.\n\nGENUS XIII.

In the carditis the prognosis is more unfavourable than in the pneumonia; and indeed, unless the disease very quickly terminates, it must prove fatal, on account of the constant and violent motion of the heart, which exasperates the inflammation, and increases all the symptoms.\n\nCure. Here bleeding is necessary in as great a degree as the patient can possibly bear, together with blistering, and the antiphlogistic regimen likewise carried to a greater height than in the pneumonia; but the general method is the same as in other inflammatory diseases.\n\nGENUS XIV.

The inflammation of the stomach is attended with great heat and pain in the epigastric region, extreme anxiety, an almost continual and painful hiccup, with a most painful vomiting of everything taken into the stomach. Sometimes a temporary madness ensues; and there is an instance in the Edinburgh Medical Essays of the disorder being attended with an hydrophobia. The pulse is generally more sunk than in other inflammations, and the fever inclines to the nature of a typhus. The disorder is commonly of the remitting kind, and during the remissions the pulse frequently intermits. During the height of the disease, a mortal phrensy frequently supervenes. The disease terminates on the fourth, seventh, or ninth day, or from the eleventh to the fifteenth; and is more apt to end in a gangrene than in pneumonic inflammations, and more frequently in a scirrhus than in an abscess.\n\nCauses, &c. The inflammation of the stomach may arise from any acrid substance taken into it; from a vehement <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, too large draughts of cold liquor, especially when the person is very hot; from a surfeit; a stoppage of perspiration; repulsion of the gout; inflammations of the neighbouring viscera; or from external injuries, such as wounds, contusions, &c.\u2014It affects chiefly those of a plethoric habit and hot bilious constitution.\n\nPrognosis. This disease is always very dangerous, and the prognosis doubtful, which also must always be in proportion to the severity of the symptoms. A cessation of pain, coldness about the precordia, great debility, with a languid and intermitting pulse, with an abatement of the hiccup, denote a gangrene and speedy death. From the sensibility of the stomach also, and its great connexion with the rest of the system, it must be obvious, that an inflammation of it, by whatever causes produced, may be attended with fatal consequences; particularly, by the great debility it produces, it may prove suddenly fatal, without running through the usual course of inflammations.\u2014Its tendency to admit of resolution may be known by its having arisen from no violent cause, by the moderate state of the symptoms, and by a gradual remission of these symptoms in the course of the first or at most of the second week of the disease. The tendency to gangrene may be suspected from the symptoms continuing with unremitting violence, notwithstanding the use of proper remedies; and a gangrene already begun may be known by the symptoms above mentioned, particularly great debility and sudden cessation of pain. The tendency to suppuration may be known by the symptoms continuing but in a moderate degree for more than one or two weeks, and by a considerable remission of the pain, while a sense of weight and anxiety still remain. When an abscess has been formed, the frequency of the pulse is first abated: but soon after it increases, with frequent cold shivering, and an exacerbation in the afternoon and evening; followed by night sweats, and other symptoms of hectic fever. These at length prove fatal, unless the abscess open into the cavity of the stomach, the pus be evacuated by vomiting, and the ulcer soon healed.\n\nCure. It appears from dissections, that the stomach may very often be inflamed when the characteristic marks of it have not appeared; and therefore we are often exposed to much uncertainty in the cure. But when we have sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> that a state of active inflammation has taken place in the stomach, the principal object to be aimed at is to obtain a resolution. Before, however, this can be accomplished, it will often be necessary to employ <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> with the view of obviating urgent symptoms. When the symptoms appear in the manner above described, the cure is to be attempted by large and repeated bleedings employed early in the disease; and from these we are not to be deterred by the weakness of the pulse, for it will commonly become fuller and softer after the operation. A blister ought also to be applied to the region of the stomach; and the cure will be assisted by fomentations of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>, and by frequent emollient and laxative elysters. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> of the stomach in this disease will admit of no medicines being thrown into it; and if any can be supposed necessary, they must be exhibited in elysters. Diluting drinks may be tried; but they must be of the very mildest kind, and given in very small quantities at a time. Opiates, in whatever manner exhibited, cannot be retained in the stomach during the first days of the disease; but when the violence of the disease shall have abated, and when the pain and vomiting recur at intervals only, opiates given in elysters are frequently employed with advantage; and after bleeding and blisters no remedy is more effectual either in allaying the pain or vomiting. As soon as the stomach will retain any laxative, gentle refrigerant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a>, taken by the mouth, such as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SODA\">soda</a> phosphorata, soda tartarisata, or the like, are\nA tendency to gangrene in this disease is to be obviated only by the means just now mentioned; but when it does actually supervene, it admits of no remedy. A tendency to suppuration is to be obviated by the same means employed early in the disease. After a certain period it cannot be prevented by any means whatever; and, when actually begun, must be left to nature; the only thing that can be done by art being to avoid all irritation.\n\nB. Gastritis Erysipelatosa, or the Erysipelatous Gastritis.\n\nDescription. This species of inflammation takes place in the stomach much more frequently than the former. From dissections it appears that the stomach has been often affected with inflammation, when neither pain nor fever had given any notice of it; and such is justly looked upon to have been of the erysipelas kind. This kind of inflammation also is especially to be expected from acrimony of any kind applied to the stomach; and would certainly occur much more frequently, were not the interior surface of this organ commonly defended by mucus exuding in large quantity from the numerous follicles placed immediately under the villous coat. On many occasions, however, the exudation of mucus is prevented, or the liquid poured out is of a less viscid kind, so as to be less fitted to defend the subjacent nerves; and it is in such cases that acrid matters may readily produce an erysipelas-like affection of the stomach.\n\nIn many cases this kind of inflammation cannot be discovered, as it takes place without pain, pyrexia, or vomiting; but in some it may; namely, when it spreads into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OESOPHAGUS\">oesophagus</a>, and appears on the pharynx and on the whole internal surface of the mouth. When therefore an erysipelas-like inflammation affects the mouth and fauces, and there shall be at the same time in the stomach an unusual sensibility to all acids, and also a frequent vomiting, there can be little doubt of the stomach's being affected in the same manner. Even when no inflammation appears in the fauces, if some degree of pain be felt in the stomach, if there be a want of appetite, an anxiety and frequent vomiting, an unusual sensibility with regard to acids, some thirst, and frequency of pulse, there will then be reason to suspect an inflammation in the stomach; and such symptoms, after some time, have been known to discover their cause by the inflammation rising to the fauces or mouth. Inflammation of this kind is often disposed to pass from one place to another on the same surface, and, in doing so, to leave the place it had at first occupied. Such an inflammation has been known to spread successively along the whole tract of the alimentary canal; occasioning, when in the intestines, diarrhoea, and in the stomach vomitings; the diarrhoea ceasing when the vomitings came on, and the vomitings on the coming on of the diarrhoea.\n\nCauses, &c. An erysipelas-like inflammation may arise from acrid matters taken into the stomach; or from some internal causes not yet well known. It frequently occurs in putrid diseases, and in those recovering from fevers.\n\nCure. When the disease is occasioned by acrid matters taken internally, and these may be supposed still present in the stomach, they are to be washed out by drinking a large quantity of warm and mild medicines, and exciting gentle vomiting. At the same time, if the nature of the acrimony and its proper corrector be known, this should be thrown in; or if a specific corrector be not known, some general demulements should be employed.\n\nThese measures, however, are more suited to prevent than to cure inflammation after it has taken place. When this last may be supposed to have happened, if it be attended with a sense of heat, with pain and pyrexia, according to the degree of these symptoms, the measures proposed for the cure of the other kind are to be more or less employed. When an erysipelas-like inflammation of the stomach has arisen from internal causes, if pain and pyrexia occur, bleeding may be employed in persons not otherwise weakened; but in case of its occurring in putrid diseases, or where the patients are already debilitated, bleeding is inadmissible; all that can be done being to avoid irritation, and only throwing into the stomach what quantity of acids and acescent aliments it shall be found able to bear. In some conditions of the body in which this disease is apt to occur, cinchona and bitters may seem to be indicated; but an erysipelas-like state of the stomach will seldom allow them to be used.\n\nGenus XVI.

Enteritis Phlegmonodea, or the Acute Enteritis.\n\nEnteritis iliaca, Sauv. sp. i.\nEnteritis colica, Sauv. sp. 2. Boerh. 963.\n\nDescription. This disease shows itself by a fixed pain in the abdomen, attended with fever, vomiting, and costiveness. The pain is often felt in different parts of the abdomen, but more frequently spreads over the whole, and is particularly violent about the navel.\n\nCauses, &c. Inflammations of the intestines may arise from the same causes as those of the stomach; though commonly the former will more readily occur from cold applied to the lower extremities, or to the belly itself. It is also found supervening on the spasmodic colic, incarcerated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERNIA\">hernia</a>, and volvulus.\n\nPrognosis. Inflammations of the intestines have the same terminations with those of the stomach, and the prognosis in both cases is much the same.\n\nCure. The cure of enteritis is in general the same with that of gastritis; but in this disease there is commonly more opportunity for the introduction of liquids, of acid, acescent, and other cooling remedies, and even of laxatives; but as a vomiting frequently attends the enteritis, care must be taken not to excite that vomiting by the quantity or quality of anything thrown into the stomach. With regard to the suppuration\nration and gangrene of the intestines following the enteritis, the observations made respecting these terminations of gastritis are equally applicable in this disease.\n\nSp. II. ENTERITIS ERYSIPELATOSA, or Erysipelatous Enteritis.\n\nConcerning this nothing farther can be said, than what hath been already delivered concerning the gastritis.\n\nGENUS XVII. HEPATITIS.\n\nInflammation of the Liver.\n\nHepatitis, Sauv. gen. 113, Lin. 35, Vog. 58, Sag. gen. 312, Boch. 914, Hoffm. ii. 14, Junck. 66.\n\nDescription. The inflammation of the liver is thought to be of two kinds, acute and chronic; but the latter very often does not discover itself except by an abscess found in the liver after death, and which is supposed to have been occasioned by some degree of inflammation; for this reason the chronic inflammation often escapes observation, and we shall here only treat of the acute hepatitis.\n\nThe acute hepatitis is attended with considerable fever; a frequent, strong, and hard pulse; high coloured urine; an acute pain in the right hypochondrium, increased by pressing upon the part. The pain is very often in such a part of the side as to make it appear like a pleurisy; and frequently, like that, is increased on inspiration. The disease is also commonly attended with a cough, which is generally dry, though sometimes moist; and when the pain thus resembles a pleurisy, the patient cannot lie easily except upon the side affected. The pain is frequently extended to the clavicle, and to the top of the shoulder; and is attended sometimes with hiccup, and sometimes with vomiting. Some have added <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JAUNDICE\">jaundice</a>, or a yellowness of the eyes, to the symptoms of this distemper; but experience shows that it has often occurred without any such symptom.\n\nWhen hepatitis is of the chronic kind, depending more on an accumulation and effusion in the liver, than on an increased action of its small vessels, the patient complains rather of a sense of weight than of pain; and the fever is by no means either acute or constant: but it often returns in paroxysms somewhat resembling the attacks of an intermittent. This disease is very slow in its progress, frequently continuing for many months, and at last terminating in a very considerable suppuration. In most cases, however, it may be discovered by careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the region of the liver externally. By this means a considerable enlargement of that viscus may in general be detected.\n\nCauses, &c. The remote causes of hepatitis are not always to be discerned, and many have been assigned on a very uncertain foundation. It is principally a disease of warm climates. It has been supposed that the disease may be an affection either of the extremities of the hepatic artery, or those of the vena portarum; and the supposition is by no means improbable. The opinion, however, most commonly adopted is, that the acute hepatitis is an affection of the external membrane of the liver, and the chronic kind an affection of the parenchyma of that viscus. The acute Hepatitis may be seated either on the convex or concave surface of the liver; and in the former case a more pungent pain and hiccup may be produced, and the respiration is more considerably affected. In the latter there occurs less pain; and a vomiting is produced, commonly by some inflammation communicated to the stomach. The inflammation on the concave surface of the liver may be readily communicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALL\">gall</a>-bladder and biliary ducts: and this, perhaps, is the only case of idiopathic hepatitis attended with jaundice.\n\nPrognosis. The inflammation of the liver, like others, may end by resolution, suppuration, or gangrene; and the tendency to the one or to the other of those events may be known from what has been already mentioned concerning the prognosis in gastritis. The resolution of hepatitis is often the consequence of, or is attended with, evacuations of different kinds. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HAEMORRHAGE\">haemorrhage</a> sometimes from the nose, and sometimes from the hemorrhoidal vessels, gives a solution of the disease. Sometimes the same thing is accomplished by a bilious diarrhoea; and sometimes the resolution is attended with sweating, and an evacuation of urine depositing a copious sediment. Sometimes it may be cured by an erysipelas appearing in some external part. When the disease has ended in suppuration, the pus collected may be discharged by the biliary ducts; or, if the suppurated part does not adhere anywhere closely to the neighbouring parts, it may be discharged into the cavity of the abdomen; but if, during the first state of inflammation, the affected part of the liver shall have formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> adhesion to some of the neighbouring parts, the discharge after suppuration may be various, according to the different seat of the abscess. When seated on the convex part of the liver, if the adhesion be to the peritoneum lining the common teguments, the pus may make its way through these, and be discharged outwardly: or if the adhesion shall have been to the diaphragm, the pus may penetrate through this, and into the cells of the lungs; from whence it may be discharged by coughing. When the abscess is seated on the concave part of the liver, in consequence of adhesions, the pus may be discharged into the stomach or intestines; and into these last, either directly, or by the intervention of the biliary ducts. Upon a consideration of all these different circumstances, therefore, together with the general principles of inflammation, must the prognosis of this disease be established.\n\nCure. For the cure of hepatitis, we must have recourse to the general means of resolving other inflammatory disorders. Bleeding is to be used according to the degree of fever and pain. Blistering is to be applied; fomentations of the external parts, emollient ointments, gentle laxatives, diluents and refrigerants, are also useful. The cure, however, particularly in warm climates, where the disease is much more common than it is in Britain, is chiefly trusted to mercury. Not only in cases of the chronic kind, but in acute hepatitis also, after an attempt has been made to alleviate the urgent symptoms by bleeding and blistering, recourse is immediately had to this powerful mineral. It is employed by different practitioners, and\nin different cases, under various forms. Some are very fond of the use of calomel. But the preference is in general given, and perhaps with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, to friction with mercurial ointment over the region of the liver. But under whatever form it may be employed, it is necessary that it should be introduced to such an extent as to keep the patient on the verge of salivation for some length of time; the duration being regulated by the circumstances of the case.\n\nFrom the liberal use of mercury, there can be no doubt that a successful resolution has been obtained in many cases, which would otherwise have infallibly terminated in suppuration. But notwithstanding the most careful employment of it in some cases, suppuration will ensue; and then it is very doubtful whether any benefit will be derived from the continuance of it. But when a suppuration has been formed, and the abscess points outwardly, the part must be opened, the pus evacuated, and the ulcer healed according to the ordinary methods in use for healing abscesses and ulcers in other parts.\n\nChronic hepatitis often terminates in scirrhus. Against this, after mercury has failed, nitric acid taken internally has sometimes been employed with success.\n\n**GENUS XVIII. SPLENITIS.**\n\n**Inflammation of the Spleen.**\n\nSplenitis, Sauv. gen. 114. Lin. 36. Vog. 59. Junck. 67. Sag. gen. 313.\n\nLienis inflammatio, Boerh. 958. et Van Swieten, Comm.\n\nSplenitis phlegmonodea, Sauv. sp. 1. Forest, l. xx. obs. 5, 6. De Haen, apud Van Swieten, p. 958.\n\nPleuritis splenica, Sauv. sp. 3.\n\nSplenalgia suppuratoria, Sauv. sp. 3.\n\n**Description.** This disease, according to Juncker, comes on with a remarkable shivering, succeeded by a most intense heat and very great thirst; a pain and tumour are perceived in the left hypochondrium, and the paroxysms for the most part assume a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTAN\">quartan</a> form. When the patients expose themselves for a little to the free air, their extremities immediately grow very cold. If a haemorrhage happens, the blood flows out of the left nostril. The other symptoms are the same with those of the hepatitis. Like the liver, the spleen is also subject to a chronic inflammation, which often happens after agues; and the tumour which succeeds the inflammation is in many cases very considerable, and is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGUE\">ague</a> cake, though that name is also frequently given to a scirrhouss tumour of the liver succeeding intermittents.\n\n**Causes, &c.** The causes of this distemper are in general the same with those of other inflammatory disorders; but those which determine the inflammation to that particular part more than another, are very much unknown. It attacks persons of a very plethoric and sanguine habit of body rather than others.\n\n**Prognosis.** What has been said of the inflammation of the liver applies also to that of the spleen, though the latter is less dangerous than the former. Here also a vomiting of black matter, which in other acute diseases is such a fatal symptom, sometimes proves critical, according to the testimony of Juncker. Sometimes the hemorrhoids prove critical: but very often the inflammation terminates by scirrhus.\n\n**Cure.** This is not at all different from what has been already laid down concerning the hepatitis.\n\n**GENUS XIX. NEPHRITIS.**\n\n**Inflammation of the Kidneys.**\n\nNephritis, Sauv. gen. 115. Lin. 37. Vog. 65. Sag. gen. 314.\n\nNephritis vera, Sauv. sp. 1.\n\n**Description.** The nephritis has the same symptoms which take place in other inflammations; but its distinguishing mark is the pain in the region of the kidney, which is sometimes obtuse, but more frequently pungent. The pain is not increased by the motion of the trunk of the body so much as a pain of the rheumatic kind affecting the same region. It may also frequently be distinguished by the pain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> along the course of the ureter, and it is often attended with a drawing up of the testicle, and a numbness of the limb on the side affected; though indeed these symptoms most commonly attend the inflammation arising from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a> in the kidney or ureter. The disease is also attended with frequent vomiting, and often with costiveness and colic pains. The urine is most commonly of a deep red colour, and is voided frequently and in a small quantity at a time. In more violent cases the urine is commonly colourless.\n\n**Causes, &c.** The remote causes of this disease may be various; as external <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTUSION\">contusion</a>, violent or long-continued riding; strains of the muscles of the back incumbent on the kidneys; various acids in the course of circulation conveyed to the kidneys; and perhaps some other internal causes not yet well known: the most frequent is that of calculous matter obstructing the tubuli uriniferi, or calculi formed in the pelvis of the kidneys, and either sticking there or falling into the ureter.\n\n**Prognosis.** This is not different from that of other inflammatory diseases.\n\n**Cure.** When any of those causes operating as inducing the inflammation still continue to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, the first object in the cure must be the removal of these; but the principal intention to be had in view, is the resolution of the inflammation which has already taken place. But when, notwithstanding efforts for this purpose, the disease terminates in suppuration, it must be the endeavour of the practitioner to promote the discharge of the purulent matter, and the healing of the ulceration in the kidney.\n\nThese different objects are principally accomplished by bleeding, external fomentation, frequent emollient oysters, antiphlogistic purgatives, and by the free use of mild and demulcent liquids. The use of blisters is scarce admissible, or at least will require great care to avoid any considerable absorption of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTHARIDES\">cantharides</a>.\n\nThe other species of nephritis enumerated by authors are only symptomatic.\nGENUS XX. CYSTITIS.\n\nInflammation of the Bladder.\n\nCystitis, Sauv. gen. 108. Lin. 31. Vog. 66.

When the disease arises from the internal use of these flies, camphor is recommended, besides other cooling medicines, and particularly cooling and emollient oysters.\n\nGENUS XXI. HYSTERITIS.\n\nInflammation of the Uterus.\n\nHysteritis, Lin. 38. Vog. 63.\nMetritis, Sauv. gen. 107. Sag. gen. 315.\nInflammatio et febris uterina, Hoffm. II. 156.\n\nDescription. This disease is often confounded with that called the puerperal or child-bed fever; but is essentially distinct from it, as will be shown in its proper place. The inflammation of the uterus is often apt to terminate by gangrene: there is a pain in the head, with delirium; and the uterine region is so exceedingly tender, that it cannot bear the most gentle pressure without intolerable pain. When the fundus uteri is inflamed, there is a great heat, throbbing, and pain, above the pubes; if its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> part, the pain is more confined to the loins and rectum, with a tenesmus; if its anterior part, it shoots from thence towards the neck of the bladder, and is attended with a frequent irritation to make water, which is voided with difficulty; and if its sides or the ovaria are affected, the pains will then dart into the inside of the thighs.\n\nCauses, &c. Inflammations of the uterus, and indeed of the rest of the abdominal viscera, are very apt to take place in child-bed women; the reason of which seems to be the sudden change produced in the habit, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the course of the circulating blood by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the uterus after delivery. The pressure of the gravid uterus being suddenly taken off from the aorta descendens after delivery, the resistance to the impulse of the blood passing through all the vessels derived from it, and distributed to the contiguous viscera, will be considerably lessened: it will therefore rush into those vessels with a force superior to their resistance; and, by putting them violently on the stretch, may occasion pain, inflammation, and fever. This contraction of the uterus also renders its vessels impervious to the blood which had freely passed through them for the service of the child during pregnancy; and consequently a much larger quantity will be thrown upon the contiguous parts, which will still add to their distention, and increase their tendency to rheumatic inflammation.\n\nPrognosis. An inflammation of the uterus may in general be expected to produce an obstruction of the lochia; but the fever produced seldom proves fatal, unless the inflammation be violent, and end in a gangrene.\n\nCure. This is to be attempted by the same general means already recommended, and the management of this disorder entirely coincides with that of the puerperal fever.\n\nGENUS XXII.

The rheumatism is particularly distinguished by pains affecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, and for the most part the joints alone; but sometimes also the muscular parts. Very often they shoot along the course of the muscles from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> to another, and are always much increased by the action of the muscles belonging to the joint or joints affected. The larger joints are those most frequently affected, such as the hip-joint and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>, of the lower extremities, and the shoulders and elbows of the upper ones. The ankles and wrists are also frequently affected; but the smaller joints, such as those of the toes or fingers, seldom suffer. Sometimes the disease is confined to one part of the body, yet very frequently it affects many parts; and then it begins with a cold stage, which is immediately succeeded by the other symptoms of pyrexia, and particularly by a frequent, full, and hard pulse. Sometimes the pyrexia is formed before any pains are perceived; but more commonly pains are felt in particular parts before any symptoms of fever occur. When no pyrexia is present, the pain may be confined to one joint only; but when any considerable pyrexia takes place, though the pain may chiefly be felt in one joint, yet it seldom happens that it does not affect several joints, often at the very same time, but for the most part shifting their place, and having abated in one joint they become more violent in another. They do not commonly remain long in the same joint, but frequently shift from one to another, and sometimes return to joints formerly affected; and in this manner the disease often continues for a long time. The fever attending these pains has an exacerbation every evening, and is most considerable during the night, when the pains also become more violent; and it is at the same time that the pains shift their place from one joint to another. These seem to be also increased during the night by the body being covered more closely, and kept warmer.\n\nA joint, after having been for some time affected with pain, commonly becomes also affected with some swelling and redness, which is painful to the touch. It seldom happens that a swelling coming on does not take off the pain entirely, but it rarely secures the joint against a return of it. This disease is commonly attended with more or less sweating, which occurs early, but is seldom free or copious, and seldom proves critical, though it may give temporary relief of the pain. The urine is high-coloured, and in the beginning without sediment. This, however, does not prove entirely critical, for the disease often continues long after such a sediment has appeared in the urine. The blood is always sity. The acute rheumatism differs from all other inflammatory diseases, in not being liable to terminate in suppuration: this almost never happens; but the disease sometimes produces effusions of a transparent gelatinous fluid into the sheaths of the tendons: but if these effusions be frequent, it is certain that the liquor must often be absorbed; for it very seldom happens, that considerable or permanent tumours have been produced, or such as required to be opened and to have the contained fluid evacuated. Such tumours, however, have sometimes occurred, and the opening made in them has produced ulcers very difficult to heal.\n\nSometimes rheumatism will continue for several weeks; but it seldom proves fatal, and it is rare that the pyrexia continues to be considerable for more than two or three weeks. While the pyrexia abates in its violence, if the pains of the joints continue, they are less violent; more limited in their place, being confined commonly to one or a few joints only; and are less ready to change their place.\n\nIt is often a very difficult matter to distinguish rheumatism from gout: but in rheumatism there in general occurs much less affection of the stomach; it affects chiefly the larger joints, and several of these are often affected with severe pain at the same time: it occurs at an earlier period of life than gout; it is not observed to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>; and it can in general be traced to some obvious exciting cause, particularly to the action of cold.\n\nCauses, &c. This disease is frequent in cold, and more uncommon in warm climates. It appears most frequently in autumn and spring; less frequently in winter, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> is constant; and very seldom during the heat of summer. It may, however, occur at any season, if vicissitudes of heat and cold be for the time frequent. For the most part, the acute rheumatism arises from the application of cold to the body when unusually warm; or when the cold is applied to one part of the body, whilst the other parts are kept warm; or, lastly, when the application of the cold is long continued, as when moist or wet clothes are applied to any part of the body.\u2014These causes may affect persons of all ages; but the rheumatism seldom appears either in very young or in elderly persons, and most commonly occurs from the age of puberty to that of 35. These causes may also affect persons of any constitution, but they most commonly affect those of a sanguine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a>.\n\nWith respect to the proximate cause of rheumatism, there have been various opinions. It has been imputed to a peculiar acrimony; of which, however, there is no evidence; and the consideration of the remote causes, the symptoms, and cure, render it very improbable. A disease of a rheumatic nature, however, may be occasioned by an acrid matter applied to the nerves, as is evident from the toothache, a rheumatic affection generally arising from a carious tooth. Pains arising from deep-seated suppurations may also resemble the rheumatism; and many cases have occurred in which such suppurations occasioned pains resembling the lumbago and ischias; but from what has been already said, it seems improbable that ever any pure rheumatic case should end in suppuration.\n\nThe proximate cause of rheumatism has by many been supposed to be a lentor in the fluids obstructing the vessels of the part; but in the observations formerly made, sufficient reasons have been already laid down for rejecting the doctrine of lentor. While we cannot therefore find either evidence or reason for supposing that the rheumatism depends on any change in the state of the fluids, we must conclude that the proximate cause of it is the same with that of other inflammations not depending upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> stimulus.\nIn the case of rheumatism, it is supposed that the most common remote cause of it, that is, cold applied, operates especially on the vessels of the joints, these being less covered by a cellular texture than those of the intermediate parts of the limbs. It is farther supposed, that the application of cold produces a constriction of the extreme vessels, and at the same time an increase of tone or phlogistic diathesis in the course of them, from which arises an increased impetus of the blood, and at the same time a resistance to the free passage of it, and consequently inflammation and pain. It is also supposed, that the resistance formed excites the vis medicatrix to a further increase of the impetus of the blood; and to support this, a cold stage arises, a spasm is formed, and a pyrexia and phlogistic diathesis are produced in the whole system.\n\nHence the cause of rheumatism appears to be exactly analogous to that of inflammations depending on an increased influx of blood to a part while it is exposed to the action of cold. But there seems to be further in this disease some peculiar affection of the muscular fibres. These seem to be under some degree of rigidity: and therefore less easily admit of motion, and are pained upon the exertions of it. This also seems to be the affection which gives opportunity to the propagation of pains from one joint to another, and which are most severely felt in the extremities terminating in the joints, because beyond these the oscillations are not propagated. This affection of the muscular fibres explains the manner in which strains and spasms produce rheumatic affections; and, on the whole, shows, that with an inflammatory affection of the sanguiferous system, there is also in rheumatism a peculiar affection of the muscular fibres, which has a considerable share in producing the phenomena of the disease. And it would even appear, that in what has commonly been called acute rheumatism, in contradistinction to the chronic, of which we are next to treat, there exists not only a state of active inflammation in the affected parts, but also of peculiar irritability; and that this often remains after the inflammation is very much diminished or has even entirely ceased. Hence a renewal of the inflammation and recurrence of the pain take place from very slight causes; and in the treatment of the disease both the state of inflammation and irritability must be had in view.\n\nCure. For counteracting the state of active inflammation, the chief aim of the practitioner must be to diminish the general impetus of the circulation, and the impetus at the part particularly affected. For counteracting the state of irritability, he must endeavour to remove the disposition to increased action in the vessels; to prevent the action of causes exciting painful sensations; and to obviate their influence on the part. The cure therefore requires, in the first place, an antiphlogistic regimen, and particularly a total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> from animal food, and from all fermented or spirituous liquors; substituting a mild vegetable or milk diet, and the plentiful use of soft diluting liquors. On this principle also, blood-letting is the chief remedy of acute rheumatism. The blood is to be drawn in large quantity; and the bleeding is to be repeated in proportion to the frequency, fulness, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> of the pulse, and the violence of the pain. For the most part, large and repeated bleeding during the first days of the disease seem to be necessary, and accordingly, mus. have been very much employed; but to this some bounds are to be set; for very profuse bleedings occasion a slow recovery, and are ready to produce a chronic rheumatism.\n\nTo avoid that debility of the system which general bleedings are apt to occasion, the urgent symptom of pain may be often relieved by topical bleedings; and when any swelling or redness has come upon a joint, the pain may very certainly be relieved by this evacuation: but as the pain and continuance of the disease seem to depend more upon the phlogistic diathesis of the whole system than upon the affection of particular parts, so topical bleedings will not supply the place of the general bleedings proposed above in most instances.\n\nTo take off the phlogistic diathesis prevailing in this disease, purging may be useful, if procured by medicines which do not stimulate the whole system, as neutral salts, and other medicines which have a refrigerant power. Purging, however, is not so useful as bleeding in removing the phlogistic diathesis; and when the disease has become general and violent, frequent stools are inconvenient, and even hurtful, by the motion and pain which they occasion.\n\nNext to blood-letting, nothing is of so much service, both in alleviating the pains in this disease and in removing the phlogistic diathesis, as the use of sudorifics: and of all the medicines belonging to this class, what has commonly been known by the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a>'s powder, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of powder of ipecacuan and opium, is the most convenient and the most effectual. Copious sweating, excited by this medicine, and supported for 15 or 12 hours by tepid diluents, such as decoction of the woods, or the like, will in most instances produce a complete remission of the pain: and by this practice, combined with blood-letting and proper regimen, the disease may often be entirely removed.\n\nIf, however, after complete intermissions from pain for some length of time have been obtained by these means, it be found that there is a great tendency to a return of the pains without any obvious cause, recourse may be had with very great benefit to the use of the Peruvian bark. By the early use of this, where a complete intermission from pain is obtained, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of repeated blood-letting and sweating is often superseded; but where a complete remission cannot be obtained, it has been suspected by some to be hurtful: and in these cases, when blood-letting and sudorifics have been pushed as far as may be thought prudent, without being productive of the desired effect, very great benefit is often derived from the use of calomel combined with opium, as recommended in the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, by Dr Hamilton of Lynn Regis.\n\nIn this disease, external applications are of little service. Fomentations in the beginning of the disease rather aggravate than relieve the pains. The rubefacients and camphire are more effectual: but they commonly only move them from one part to another, and do not prove any cure of the general affection. Blistering may also be very effectual in removing the pain.","sp":333,"ep":358},{"h":"AMONG OTHER","t":"g other means of preventing scurvy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cook had also a liberal supply of portable soup; of which the men had generally an ounce, three days in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, boiled up with their pease; and sometimes it was served to them oftener; and when they could get fresh greens, it was boiled up with them, and made such an agreeable mess, that it was the means of making the people eat a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of greens than they would otherwise have done.

It seizes those who are subject to it when they are walking, and particularly when they walk soon after eating, with a most disagreeable and painful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, which seems to threaten immediate destruction; but the moment they stand still, all the uneasiness vanishes. In all other respects the patients at the beginning of this disorder are well, and have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> shortness of breath; from which the angina pectoris is totally different. After it has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> some months, the fits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not cease instantaneously on standing still; and it will come on not only when the patients are walking, but when they are lying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and oblige them to rise up out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> every night for many months together. In one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> two very inveterate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, it has been brought on by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> or carriage, and even by swallowing, coughing, going to stool, speaking, or by any disturbance of mind. The persons affected were all men, almost all of whom were above 50 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and most of them with a short neck and inclining to be fat. Something like it, however, was observed in one woman, who was paralytic; and one or two young men complained of it in a slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>. Other practitioners have observed it in very young persons.\n\nWhen a fit of this sort comes on by walking, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> is very short, as it goes off almost immediately upon stopping. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> it comes on in the night, it will last an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> or two. Dr Heberden met with one in whom it once continued for several days; during all which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the patient seemed to be in imminent danger of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Most of those attacked with the distemper died suddenly; though this rule was not without exceptions; and Dr Heberden observed one who sunk under a lingering illness of a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.\n\nThe os sterni is usually pointed to as the seat of this malady. It seems as if it was under the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of that bone, and at other times under the middle or upper part, but always inclining more to the left side; and in many cases there is joined with it a pain about the middle of the left arm, which appears to be seated in the biceps muscle.\n\nThe appearance of Dr Heberden's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> in the Medical Transactions very soon raised the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>, and produced other observations from physicians of eminence; particularly Dr Fothergill, Dr Wall of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTER\">Worcester</a>, Dr Haygarth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHESTER\">Chester</a>, and Dr Percival of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>. It also induced an unknown sufferer under the disease to write Dr Heberden a very sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, describing his feelings in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> manner; which, unfortunately, in three weeks after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of this anonymous epistle, terminated in a sudden death, as the writer himself had apprehended.\n\nThe youngest subject that Dr Fothergill ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> afflicted with this disorder was about 30 years of age; and this person was cured. The method that succeeded with him was a course of pills, composed of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> pill, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, and native cinnabar; with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> chalybeate bitter: this was continued for some months, after which he went to Bath several successive seasons, and acquired his usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>: he was ordered to be very sparing in his diet; to keep the bowels open; and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> on horseback, but not to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> or fatiguing walks.\n\nThe only symptom in this patient that is mentioned, was a stricture about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, which came on if he was walking up hill or a little faster than ordinary, or if he was riding at a very brisk trot; for moderate exercise of any kind did not affect him; and this uneasy sensation always obliged him to stop, as he felt himself threatened with immediate death if he had been obliged to go forward.\n\nIt is the sharp constrictive pain across the chest which (according to Dr Fothergill's observation) particularly marks this singular disease; and which is apt to supervene upon a certain degree of muscular motion, or whatever agitates the nervous system.\n\nIn such cases as fell under the inspection of Dr Fothergill, he very seldom met with one that was not attended with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and intermittent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>; not only during the exacerbations, but often when the patient was free from pain and at rest; but Dr Heberden observes, that the pulse is, at least sometimes, not disturbed; and mentions his having once had an opportunity of being convinced of this circumstance, by feeling the pulse during the paroxysm.\n\nBut no doubt these varieties, as well as many other little circumstances, will occur in this disease, as they do in every other, on account of the diversity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> frame; and if those which in general are found to predominate and give the distinguishing character be present, they will always authorise us in giving the name to the disease: thus, when we find the constrictory pain across the chest, accompanied with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of strangling or suffocation; and still more, if this pain should strike across the breast into one or both arms; we should not hesitate to pronounce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> an angina pectoris.\n\nAs to the nature of this disease, it appears to be purely spasmodic: and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> will readily present itself to any one who considers the sudden manner of its coming on and going off; the long intervals of perfect ease; the relief afforded by wine and spirituous cordials; the influence which passionate affections of the mind has over it; the case which comes from varying the posture of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> and shoulders, or from remaining quite motionless; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of years for which it will continue, without otherwise disordering health; its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> so well the motion of a horse or carriage, which circumstance often distinguishes spasmodic pains from those which arise from ulcers; and, lastly, its coming on for the most part after a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, and in certain patients at night, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> after the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, at which time the incubus, convulsive asthma, and other diseases, justly attributed to the disordered func-\ntions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>, are peculiarly apt to return or to be aggravated.\n\nFrom all these circumstances taken together, there can be little doubt that this affection is of a spasmodic nature: but though it should be admitted, that the whole distress in these cases arise from spasm, it may not be so easy to ascertain the particular muscles which are thus affected.\n\nThe violent sense of strangling or choking, which shows the circulation through the lungs to be interrupted during the height of the paroxysm; and the peculiar constrictive pain under the sternum, always inclining (according to Dr Heberden's observation) to the left side; together with that most distressing and alarming sensation, which, if it were to increase or continue, threatens an immediate extinction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; might authorise us to conclude that the heart itself is the muscle affected: the only objection to this idea is, that the pulse is not always interrupted during the paroxysm. The appearances in two of the dissections, favour the opinion that the spasm affects the heart; as in one subject the left ventricle was found as empty of blood as if it had been washed; and in another, the substance of the heart appeared whitish, not unlike a ligament; as it should seem, in both cases, from the force of the spasm squeezing the blood out from the vessels and cavities.\n\nIf this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> be allowed, we must conclude that the spasm can only take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in an inferior degree, as long as the patient continues to survive the paroxysm; since an affection of this sort, and in this part, of any considerable duration or violence, must inevitably prove fatal: and accordingly, as far as could be traced, the persons who have been known to labour under this disease have in general died suddenly.\n\nThe dissections also show, that whatever may be the true seat of the spasm, it is not necessary for the bringing of it on, that the heart, or its immediate appendages, should be in a morbid state; for in three out of the six that have as yet been made public, these parts were found in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> state.\n\nOn opening the body of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who wrote the letter to Dr Heberden, \"upon the most careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, no manifest cause of his death could be discovered; the heart, in particular, with its vessels and valves, were all found in a natural condition.\"\n\nIn the case communicated by Dr Percival to the publishers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Medical Commentaries, \"the heart and aorta descendens were found in a sound state.\" And in Dr Haygarth's patient, \"on opening the thorax, the lungs, pericardium, and heart, appeared perfectly sound.\" Not to mention Dr Fothergill's patient (R. M.), in whose body the only morbid appearance about the heart was a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> spot near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a>. Thus the cause, whatever its nature might have been, was at too great a distance, or of too subtle a nature, to come under the inspection of the anatomist. But there was a circumstance in two of the subjects that is worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a>; and which shows that the crisis of the blood, while they were living, must have been greatly injured, namely, its not coagulating, but remaining of a cream-like consistence, without any separation into serum and crassamentum.\n\nFrom all that we have seen hitherto published, it does not appear that any considerable advances have been made towards the actual cure of this anomalous spasm.\n\nThe very judicious and attentive Dr Heberden (to whom the public are highly indebted for first making the disorder known) confesses, that bleedings, vomits, and other evacuations, have not appeared to do any good: wine and cordials taken at bed-time, will sometimes prevent or weaken the fits; but nothing does this so effectually as opiates: in short, the medicines usually called nervous or cordial, such as relieve and quiet convulsive motions, and invigorate the languishing principle of life, are what he recommends.\n\nDr Wall mentions one patient, out of the 12 or 13 that he had seen, who applied to him early in the disease, and was relieved considerably by the use of antimonial medicines joined with the fetid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>: he was still living at the time the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> wrote his paper, (November 1772), and going about with tolerable ease. Two were carried off by other disorders; all the rest died suddenly.\n\nDr Fothergill's directions are chiefly calculated with the view to prevent the disorder from gaining ground, and to alleviate present distress. Accordingly he enjoins such a kind of diet as may be most likely to prevent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a>: in particular, not to eat voraciously: to be very abstemious in respect to every thing heating; spices, spirits, wines, and all fermented liquors: to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> most scrupulously against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, or any vehement emotions; and to make use of all the usual means of establishing and preserving general health: to mitigate excesses of irritability by anodynes; or pains, if they quicken the circulation: to dispense flatulencies when they distend the stomach, by moderate doses of carminatives; amongst which, perhaps, simple peppermint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> may be reckoned one of the safest. But since obesity is justly considered as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> predisposing cause, he insists strongly on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of preventing an increase of fat, by a vegetable diet, and using every other practicable method of augmenting the thinner secretions.","sp":502,"ep":504},{"h":"ARTHRODYNAIA","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Chronic Rheumatism.\n\nRheumatismus chronicus Auctorum.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a>. When the pyrexia attending the acute rheumatism has ceased; when the swelling and redness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> are entirely gone, but pains still continue to affect certain joints, which remain stiff, feel uneasy upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, changes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, or in the night <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> only, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> is then called the chronic rheumatism, as it often continues for a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time.\n\nThe limits between the acute and chronic rheumatisms are not always exactly marked. When the pains are still ready to shift their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; when they are especially severe in the night time; when, at the same time, they are attended with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of pyrexia, and with some swelling, and especially some redness of the joints; the disease is to be considered as partaking of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the acute rheumatism. But when there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer any degree of pyrexia remaining; when the pained joints are without redness; when they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and stiff; when they cannot easily be made to sweat; or when, while a free and warm sweat is brought out on the rest of the body, it is only clammy and cold on the pained joints; and when, further, the pains of these are increased by cold, and relieved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, applied to them; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is to be considered as that of a purely chronic rheumatism: or, perhaps more properly, the first of the conditions now described may be termed the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> the state of atony.\n\nThe chronic rheumatism, or rather the atonic, may affect different joints; but is especially apt to affect those which are surrounded with many muscles, and those of which the muscles are employed in the most constant and vigorous exertions. Such is the case of the vertebrae of the loins, the affection of which is named lumbago; or of the hip <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>, when the disease is named ischias or sciatica.\n\nViolent strains and spasms occurring on sudden and somewhat violent exertions, bring on rheumatic affections, which at first partake of the acute, but very soon change into the nature of the chronic, rheumatism.\u2014Such are frequently the lumbago, and other affections, which seem to be more seated in the muscles than in the joints. The distinction of the rheumatic pains from those resembling them which occur in the syphilis and scurvy must be obvious, either from the seat of the pains, or from the concomitant symptoms peculiar to those diseases. The distinction of the rheumatism from the gout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be more fully understood from what is laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> under the genus Podagra.\n\nCauses, &c. The phenomena of the purely chronic rheumatism <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to conclude, that its proximate cause is an atony both of the blood-vessels and of the muscular fibres of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> affected, together with such a degree of rigidity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> in the latter as frequently attend them in a state of atony: and indeed this atony, carried to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, gives rise to a state of paralysis, with an almost total loss of motion in the affected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>. The paralytic state of rheumatism therefore may be pointed out as a fourth condition of the disease, often claiming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of rheumatismus the practitioner.\n\nCure. From the view <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> now given of the proximate cause of chronic rheumatism, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> indication of cure must be, to restore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> and vigour of the part, which is principally to be done by increasing the tone of the moving fibres, but which may sometimes also be aided by giving condensation to the simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>. When, however, the disease has degenerated into the state of paralysis, the objects to be aimed at are, the restoration of a due condition to the nervous energy in the part affected; the obtaining free circulation of blood through the vessels of the part; and the removal of rigidity in membranes and ligaments.\n\nFor answering these purposes, a great variety of remedies, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> and internal, are had recourse to. The chief of the external are, the supporting the heat of the part, by keeping it constantly covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a>; the increasing the heat of the part by external heat, applied either in a dry or humid form; the diligent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>, or other means of friction; the application of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> in sparks or shocks; the application of cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> by affusion or immersion; the application of essential oils of the most warm and penetrating kind; the application of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRINE\">brine</a>; the employment of the warm bath or of the vapour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>, either to the body in general or to particular parts; and, lastly, the employment either of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of the part itself as far as it can easily bear, or by riding or other modes of gestation.\n\nThe internal remedies are, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> doses of essential oils drawn from resinous substances, such as turpentine; substances containing such oils, as guaiac; volatile alkaline salts, &c. These or other medicines are directed to procure sweat; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALOMEL\">calomel</a>, or some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, in small doses, may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for some time. But of all the remedies which have been found useful in atonic rheumatism; perhaps the best is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a>. It is particularly serviceable in the earlier periods of the disease. It has often been highly efficacious in preventing the degeneracy of the inflammatory into the atonic state of the disease; and by some practitioners, particularly Dr Haygarth of Bath, it has been highly extolled in acute rheumatism. Besides these, there are several other remedies recommended. The cicuta, aconitum, and hyoscyamus, have in particular been highly extolled; and an infusion of the rhododendron chrysanthum is said to be employed by the Siberians with very great success. An account of the Siberian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of practice is given by Dr Matthew Guthrie of Petersburgh, in the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Medical Commentaries, and has been followed with success at other places. Among other internal remedies for rheumatism, the use of arsenic has of late been recommended by Dr Bardsley of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>. It is advised to be given under the form of the mineral solution proposed by Dr Fowler as a remedy in intermittent fever and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIODIC\">periodic</a> headaches. Under this form, it is now ascertained by extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> that arsenic may be taken internally with as much safety as any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> medicine; and in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of rheumatism in which it has been employed at Edinburgh, there is reason to believe that it has been productive of benefit.\nGENUS XXIII.

This well-known disease makes its attack by a most violent pain in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, most frequently in the molares, more rarely in the incisores, reaching sometimes up to the eyes, and sometimes backward into the cavity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>. At the same time there is a manifest determination to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>; and a remarkable tension and inflation of the vessels takes place, not only in the parts next to that where the pain is seated, but over the whole head.\n\nCauses, &c. The toothach is sometimes merely a rheumatic affection, arising from cold, but more frequently from a carious tooth. It is also a symptom of pregnancy, and takes place in some nervous disorders; it may attack persons at any time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, though it is most frequent in the young and plethoric.\n\nCure. Many empirical remedies have been proposed for the cure of the toothach, but none have in any degree answered the purpose. When the affection is purely rheumatic, blistering behind the ear will almost always remove it; but when it proceeds from a carious tooth, the pain is much more obstinate. In this case it has been recommended to touch the pained part with a hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, or with sulphuric acid, in order to destroy the aching nerve; to hold strong spirits in the mouth; to put a drop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of cloves into the hollow of the tooth, or a pill of equal parts of opium and camphor: but one of the most useful applications of this kind is strong nitrous acid, diluted with three or four times its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of spirit of wine, and introduced into the hollow of a tooth from which great pain arises, either by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> or a little cotton. Cinchona has also been recommended, and perhaps with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, on account of its tonic and antiseptic powers; but very often all these remedies will fail, and the only infallible cure is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of the tooth.

The Retrocedent Gout.\n\nSp. IV. The Misplaced Gout.\n\nDescription. What we call a paroxysm of the gout is principally constituted by an inflammatory affection of some of the joints. This sometimes comes on suddenly, without any warning, but is generally preceded by several symptoms; such as the ceasing of a sweating which the feet had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> before affected with; an unusual coldness of the feet and legs; a frequent numbness, alternating with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of pricking along the whole of the lower extremities; frequent cramps of the muscles of the legs; and an unusual turgescence of the veins.\n\nWhile these symptoms take place in the lower extremities, the body is affected with some degree of torpor and languor, and the functions of the stomach in particular are more or less disturbed. The appetite is diminished; and flatulency, or other symptoms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGESTION\">indigestion</a>, are felt. These symptoms take place for several days, sometimes for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> or two, before a paroxysm comes on; but commonly, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> immediately preceding it, the appetite becomes keener than usual.\n\nThe circumstances of paroxysms are chiefly the following. They come on most commonly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, and sooner or later according as the vernal heat succeeds sooner or later to the winter's cold, and, perhaps, sooner or later also, according as the body may happen to be more or less exposed to vicissitudes of heat and cold.\n\nThe attacks are sometimes felt first in the evening, but more commonly about two or three o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. The paroxysm begins with a pain affecting one foot, most frequently in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> or first joint of the great toe, but sometimes in other parts of the foot. With the attack of this pain, there is commonly, more or less of a cold shivering; which, as the pain increases, gradually ceases; and is succeeded by a hot stage of pyrexia, which continues for the same time with the pain itself. From the first attack, the pain becomes, by degrees, more violent, and continues in this state with great restlessness of the whole body till next midnight, after which it gradually remits; and, after it has continued for twenty-four hours from the commencement of the first attack, it commonly ceases almost entirely; and, with the coming on of a gentle sweat, allows the patient to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> asleep. The patient, upon coming out of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> in the morning, finds the pained part affected with some redness and swelling, which, after having continued for some days, gradually abate.\n\nWhen a paroxysm has thus come on, although the violent pain after 24 hours be considerably abated, the patient is not entirely relieved from it. For some days\ndays he has every evening a return of more considerable pain and pyrexia, and these continue with more or less violence till morning. After going on, in this manner, for several days, the disease sometimes goes entirely off, not to return till after a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>.\n\nWhen the disease, after having thus remained for some time in a joint, ceases entirely, it generally leaves the person in very perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, enjoying greater ease and alacrity in the functions of both body and mind than he had for a long time before experienced.\n\nAt the beginning of the disease, the returns of it are sometimes only once in three or four years; but as it advances, the intervals become shorter, and at length the attacks are annual; afterwards they come twice each year; and at length recur several times during the course of autumn, winter, and spring; and as, when the fits are frequent, the paroxysms become also longer, so, in the advanced state of the disease, the patient is hardly ever tolerably free from it, except perhaps for two or three months in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>.\n\nThe progress of the disease is also marked by the parts which it affects. At first, it commonly affects one foot only; afterwards every paroxysm affects both feet, the one after the other; and as the disease proceeds, it not only affects both feet at once, but, after having ceased in the foot which was last attacked, returns again into the first, and perhaps a second time also into the other. Its changes of places are not only from one foot to another, but from the feet into other joints, especially those of the upper extremities; so that there is hardly a joint of the body which, on one occasion or another, is not affected. It sometimes affects two different joints at the very same time; but more commonly it is at any one time severe in a single joint only, and passes in succession from one joint to another; so that the patient's affliction is often protracted for a long time.\n\nWhen the disease has often returned, and the paroxysms have become very frequent, the pains are commonly less violent than they were at first; but the patient is more affected with sickness, and the other symptoms of the atonic gout, which shall be hereafter mentioned.\n\nAfter the first paroxysm of the disease, the joints which have been affected are entirely restored to their former suppleness and strength: but after the disease has recurred very often, the joints affected do neither so suddenly nor entirely recover their former state, but continue weak and stiff; and these effects at length proceed to such a degree, that the joints lose their motion entirely.\n\nIn many persons, but not in all, after the disease has frequently recurred, concretions of a chalky nature are formed upon the outside of the joints, and for the most part immediately under the skin. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> seems to be deposited at first in a fluid form, afterwards becoming dry and firm. In their firm state, these concretions are a hard earthy substance, very entirely soluble in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>. After they have been formed, they contribute, with other circumstances, to destroy the motion of the joints.\n\nIn most persons who have laboured under the gout for many years, a nephritic affection comes on, and discovers itself by all the symptoms which usually attend calculous concretions in the kidneys, and which Podagra, we shall have occasion to describe in another place.\n\nAll that is necessary to be observed here is, that the nephritic affection alternates with paroxysms of the gout; and that the two affections, the nephritic and the gouty, are hardly ever present at the same time. This also may be observed, that children of gouty or nephritic parents commonly inherit one or other of these diseases; but whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> disease of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> may have been either gout or nephritis alone, some of the children have the one and some the other. In some of them the nephritic affection occurs alone, without any gout supervening; and this happens to be frequently the case with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> children of gouty parents.\n\nIn the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> already given, we have described the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> form of the disease, and which therefore, however diversified in the progress of it, may be still called the regular state of the gout.\u2014Upon some occasions, however, the disease assumes different appearances: but as we suppose the disease to depend always upon a certain diathesis, or disposition of the system; so every appearance which we can perceive to depend upon that same disposition, we still consider as symptomatic, and view the disease to be a case of the gout. The principal circumstance, in what we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> the regular gout, is the inflammatory affection of the joints; and whatever symptoms we can perceive to be connected with, or to depend upon, the disposition which produces that inflammatory affection, but without its taking place or being present at the same time, we name the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> gout.\n\nOf such irregular gout there are three different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, which may be named the atonic, the retrocedent, and the misplaced gout.\n\nThe first is, when the gouty diathesis prevails in the system; but, from certain causes, does not produce the inflammatory affection of the joints. In this case, the morbid symptoms which appear, are chiefly affections of the stomach, such as loss of appetite, indigestion, and its various attendant symptoms of sickness, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, acid eructations, and pains in the region of the stomach. These symptoms are frequently accompanied with pains and cramps in several parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> and the upper extremities of the body, which are relieved by the discharge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> from the stomach. Together with these affections of the stomach, there commonly occurs a costiveness; but sometimes a looseness, with colic pains. These affections of the alimentary canal are often attended with all the symptoms of hypochondriasis, such as dejection of mind, a constant and anxious attention to the slightest feelings, an imaginary aggravation of these, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of danger from them.\n\nIn the same atonic gout, the viscera of the thorax also are sometimes affected, and palpitations, faintings, and asthma occur.\n\nIn the head also occur headaches, giddiness, apoplectic and paralytic affections.\n\nWhen the several symptoms now mentioned occur in habits having the marks of a gouty disposition, this may be suspected to have laid the foundation for them; and especially when either, in such habits, a manifest tendency to the inflammatory affection has formerly appeared, or when the symptoms mentioned are\nare intermixed with, and are relieved by some degree of the inflammatory gout. In such cases there can be no doubt of considering the whole as a state of the gout.\n\nAnother state of the disease we name the retrocedent gout. This occurs when an inflammatory state of the joints has, in the usual manner, come on, but without arising to the ordinary degree of pain and inflammation; or at least without these continuing for the usual time, or without their receding gradually in the usual manner; these affections of the joints suddenly and entirely cease, while some internal part becomes affected. The internal part most commonly attacked is the stomach; which then is affected with anxiety, sickness, vomiting, or violent pain; but sometimes the internal part is the heart, which gives occasion to a syncope; sometimes it is the lungs, which are affected with asthma; and sometimes it is the head, giving occasion to apoplexy or palsy. In all these cases there can be no doubt that the symptoms are all a part of the same disease, however different the affection may seem to be in the parts which it attacks.\n\nThe third state of irregular gout, which we name the misplaced, is when the gouty diathesis, instead of producing the inflammatory affection of the joints, produces an inflammatory affection of some internal part, and which appears from the same symptoms that attend the inflammations of those parts arising from other causes.\n\nWhether the gouty diathesis does ever produce such inflammation of the internal parts without having first produced it in the joints, or whether the inflammation of the internal part be always a translation from the joints previously affected, we dare not determine; but, even supposing the latter to be always the case, we think the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of the affection of the internal part must still distinguish the misplaced from what we have named the retrocedent gout.\n\nWith regard to the misplaced gout, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>, whom we here follow, tells us, that he never met with any cases of it in his practice, nor does he find any distinctly marked by practical writers, except that of a pneumonic inflammation.\n\nThere are two cases of a translated gout; the one of which is an affection of the neck of the bladder, producing pain, strangury, and a catarrhus vesice: the other is an affection of the rectum, sometimes indicated by pain alone in that part, and sometimes by hemorrhoidal symptoms. In gouty persons such affections have been known to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> with inflammatory affections of the joints; but whether these belong to the retrocedent or to the misplaced gout, Dr Cullen pretends not to determine.\n\nIt is commonly supposed, that there are some cases of rheumatism which are scarcely to be distinguished from the gout: but these, Dr Cullen thinks, are but few; and that the two diseases may be for the most part distinguished with great certainty, by observing the predisposition, the antecedent circumstances, the parts affected, the recurrences of the disease, and its connection with the system; which circumstances, for the most part, appear very differently in the two diseases.\n\nCauses, &c. The gout is generally an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> disease: but some persons, without any hereditary disposition, seem to acquire it; and in some an hereditary disposition may be counteracted from various causes. It attacks the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MALE\">male</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> especially; but it sometimes, though more rarely, attacks also the female. The females liable to it are those of the more robust and full habits; and it very often happens to those before the menstrual evacuation has ceased. Dr Cullen hath also found it occurring in several females whose menstrual evacuations were more abundant than usual.\n\nThe gout seldom attacks <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUNUCHS\">eunuchs</a>; and when it does, seems to fall upon those who happen to be of a robust <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, to lead an indolent life, and to live very full. It attacks especially men of robust and large bodies, who have large heads, are of full and corpulent habits, and whose skins are covered with a thick rete mucosum, which gives a coarse surface. To speak in the style of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> physicians, the gout will seldom be found to attack those of a sanguine, or such as are of a purely melancholic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a>; but very readily those of a choleric-sanguine temperament. It is, however, very difficult to treat this matter with precision. The gout seldom attacks persons employed in constant bodily labour, or those who live much upon vegetable aliment. It does not commonly attack men till after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 35; and generally not till a still later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>. There are indeed instances of the gout appearing more early, but these are few in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the others. When the disease does appear early in life, it seems to be in those who have the hereditary disposition very strong, and to whom the remote causes hereafter mentioned have been applied in a very considerable degree.\n\nAs the gout is an hereditary disease, and affects men particularly of a certain habit, its remote causes may be considered as predisponent and occasional. The predisponent cause, as far as expressed by external appearances, has been already marked; and physicians have been very confident in assigning the occasional causes: but in a disease depending so much upon a predisposition, the assigning occasional causes must be uncertain; as in the predisposed the occasional causes may not always appear, and in persons not predisposed they may appear without effect; and this uncertainty must particularly affect the case of the gout.\n\nThe occasional causes of the disease seem to be of two kinds. First, Those which induce a plethoric state of the body. Secondly, Those which in plethoric habits, induce a state of debility. Of the first kind are a sedentary, indolent manner of life, and a full diet of animal food. Of the second kind of occasional causes which induce debility are excess in venery; intemperance in the use of intoxicating liquors; indigestion, produced either by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the aliments; much application to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> or business, night watching, excessive evacuations; the ceasing of usual labour; a sudden change from a very full to a very spare diet; the large use of acids and acescents; and, lastly, cold applied to the lower extremities. The former seem to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a> by increasing the predisposition; the latter are commonly the exciting causes, both of the first attacks, and of the repetitions of the disease.\n\nWith respect to the proximate cause of the gout, it has generally been thought that it depends on a cer-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAIN\">tain</a> morbid matter always present in the body; and that this matter, by certain causes, thrown upon the joints or other parts, produces the several phenomena of the disease.\n\nThis doctrine, however ancient and generally received, appears to Dr Cullen to be very doubtful. For,\n\nFirst, There is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of any morbid matter being present in persons disposed to the gout. There are no experiments or observations which show that the blood or other humours of gouty persons are in any respect different from those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>. Previous to attacks of the gout, there appear no marks of any morbid state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>; for the disease generally attacks those persons who have enjoyed the most perfect health, and appear to be in that state when the disease comes on. At a certain period of the disease, a peculiar matter indeed appears in gouty persons; but this, which does not appear in every instance, and which appears only after the disease has subsisted for a long time, seems manifestly to be the effect, not the cause, of the disease. Further, Though there be certain acids which, taken into the body, seem to excite the gout, it is probable that these acids operate otherwise in exciting the disease, than by affording the material cause of it. In general, therefore, Dr Cullen thinks there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of any morbid matter being the cause of the gout.\n\nSecondly, The suppositions concerning the particular nature of the matter producing the gout, have been so various, and so contradictory, as to allow us to conclude, that there is truly no proof of the existence of any of them. With respect to many of these suppositions, they are so inconsistent with chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, and with the laws of the animal economy, that they must be entirely rejected.\n\nThirdly, The supposition of a morbid matter as the cause, is not consistent with the phenomena of the disease, particularly with its frequent and sudden translations from one part to another.\n\nFourthly, The supposition is further rendered improbable by this, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> a morbid matter did exist, its operation should be similar in the several parts which it attacks: whereas it seems to be very different, being stimulant and exciting inflammation, in the joints; but sedative and destroying tone in the stomach; which, upon the supposition of the same particular matter acting in both cases, is not to be explained by any difference in the part affected.\n\nFifthly, Some facts alleged in proof of a morbid matter, are not confirmed; such as those which would prove the disease to be contagious. There is, however, no proper evidence of this, the facts given being not only few, but exceptionable, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> observations innumerable.\n\nSixthly, Some arguments brought in favour of a morbid matter are founded upon a mistaken explanation. The disease has been supposed to depend upon a morbid matter, because it is hereditary. But the inference is not just: for most hereditary diseases do not depend upon any morbid matter, but upon a particular conformation of the structure of the body transmitted from the parent to the offspring; and this last appears to be particularly the case in the gout. It may be also observed, that hereditary diseases depending upon a morbid matter, appear always much more early in life than the gout commonly does.\n\nSeventhly, The supposition of a morbid matter being the cause of the gout, has been hitherto useless, as it has not suggested any successful method of cure. Particular theories of gout have often corrupted the practice, and have frequently led from those views which might have been useful, and from that practice which experience had approved. Further, Though the supposition of a morbid matter has been generally received, it has been as generally neglected in practice. When the gout has affected the stomach, nobody thinks of correcting the matter supposed to be present there, but merely of restoring the tone of the moving fibres.\n\nEightly, The supposition of a morbid matter is quite superfluous: for it explains nothing, without supposing that matter to produce a change in the state of the moving powers; and a change in the state of the moving powers, produced by other causes, explains every circumstance without the supposition of a morbid matter; and it may be observed, that many of the causes exciting the gout, do not operate upon the state of the fluids, but directly and solely upon that of the moving powers.\n\nLastly, Dr Cullen contends that the supposition of a morbid matter is superfluous; because, without that, the disease can be explained, he thinks, in a manner more consistent with its phenomena, with the laws of the animal economy, and with the method of cure which experience has approved. We now proceed to give this explanation; but, before entering upon it, we must premise some general observations which Dr Cullen states.\n\nThe first observation is, That the gout is a disease of the whole system, or depends upon a certain general conformation and state of the body, which manifestly appears from the facts above mentioned. But the general state of the system depends chiefly upon the state of its primary moving powers; and therefore the gout may be supposed to be an affection of these.\n\nThe second observation is, That the gout is manifestly an affection of the nervous system; in which the primary moving powers of the whole system are lodged. The occasional or exciting causes are almost all such as act directly upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> and nervous system; and the greater part of the symptoms of the atomic or retrocedent gout are manifestly affections of the same system. This leads us to seek for an explanation of the whole of the disease, in the laws of the nervous system, and particularly in the changes which may happen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> of its several parts.\n\nThe third observation is, That the stomach, which has so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> a consent with the rest of the system, is the internal part that is the most frequently, and often very considerably, affected by the gout. The paroxysms of the disease are commonly preceded by an affection of the stomach; many of the exciting causes act first upon the stomach; and the symptoms of the atomic and retrocedent gout are most commonly and chiefly affections of the same organ. This observation leads us to remark, that there is a balance subsisting between the state of the internal and that of the external parts; and, in particular, that the state of the stomach is connected with that of the external parts, so that the\nstate of tone in the one may be communicated to the other.\n\nThese observations being premised, Dr Cullen offers the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATHOLOGY\">pathology</a> of the gout.\n\nIn some persons there is a certain vigorous and plethoric state of the system, which at a certain period of life is liable to a loss of tone in the extremities. This is in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> communicated to the whole system, but appears more especially in the functions of the stomach. When this loss of tone occurs while the energy of the brain still retains its vigour, the vis medicatrix nature is excited to restore the tone of the parts; and accomplishes it, by exciting an inflammatory affection in some part of the extremities. When this has subsisted for some days, the tone of the extremities and of the whole system is restored, and the patient returns to his ordinary state of health.\n\nThis is the course of things in the ordinary form of the disease, which we name the regular gout; but there are circumstances of the body, in which this course is interrupted or varied. Thus, when the atony has taken place, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> do not succeed, the atony continues in the stomach, or perhaps in other internal parts; and produces that state which Dr Cullen, for reasons now obvious, named the atonic gout.\n\nA second case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in the course of the gout is, when to the atony the reaction and inflammation have to a certain degree succeeded, but from causes either internal or external the tone of the extremities and perhaps of the whole system is weakened; so that the inflammatory state, before it had either proceeded to the degree, or continued for the time, requisite for restoring the tone of the system, suddenly and entirely ceases: whence the stomach, and other internal parts, relapse into the state of atony; and perhaps have that increased by the atony communicated from the extremities: all which appears in what has been termed the retrocedent state of the gout.\n\nA third case of variation from the ordinary course of the gout, is, when to the atony, usually preceding, an inflammatory reaction fully succeeds, but has its usual determination to the joints prevented by some circumstances; and is therefore directed to some internal part, where it produces an inflammatory affection, and that state of things which we have named the misplaced gout.\n\nThough this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of Dr Cullen's be supported with much ingenuity, yet we may confidently venture to assert, that on this subject he has been less successful in establishing his own opinions, than in combating those of others; and this theory, as well as others formerly proposed, is liable to numerous and unsurmountable objections. According to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, a vigorous and plethoric habit should in every case exist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to the appearance of gout; which is by no means consistent with fact: nor is it true that a vigorous and plethoric habit is liable at a certain age to a loss of tone in the extremities; which is another necessary condition in the hypothesis. Loss of tone often occurs in the extremities without exerting any peculiar influence on the stomach; and why a loss of tone in the stomach should excite the vis medicatrix nature to restore it, by exciting an inflammatory affection in some part of the extremities, is very inconceivable. Were the hypothesis true, every dyspeptic patient should infallibly be affected with gout; which, however, is by no means the case. In short, every step in the theory is liable to unsurmountable objections; and it by no means, any more than former hypotheses, explains the phenomena of the disease, particularly what Dr Cullen has himself so accurately pointed out, the connection of gouty with calculous complaints.\n\nA very ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> has lately been published by an anonymous author, entitled \"A Treatise on Gravel and upon Gout,\" in which the sources of each are investigated, and effectual means of preventing or removing these diseases recommended. In this treatise an attempt is made to prove, that both diseases depend upon a peculiar concreting acid, the acid of calculi, or the lithic or uric acid, as it has been styled by some. He supposes this acid, constantly present to a certain degree in the circulating fluids, to be precipitated by the introduction of other acids; and in this manner he explains the influence of acid wines and other liquors, as claret, cider, &c., inducing gout; for he considers the circumstance chiefly constituting the disease as being an inflammation in parts of which the functions have been interrupted by the redundant acid precipitated. Although this theory be supported with much ingenuity, yet it is also liable to many objections. The sudden attack of the affection; its sudden transition from one part of the body to another; the instant relief of one part when another comes to be affected; and the various anomalous forms which the disease puts on, having an exact resemblance to different affections; are altogether irreconcileable to the idea of its depending on any fixed obstruction at a particular part arising from concreting acid. Nor does the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of prevention and cure which he proposes, and which consists chiefly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> from acid, and in the destruction of acid, by any means correspond in every particular to the best established facts respecting the treatment of gout; to which we next proceed.\n\nCure. In entering upon this, we must observe, in the first place, that a cure has been commonly thought impossible; and we acknowledge it to be very probable, that the gout, as a disease of the whole habit, and very often depending upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> conformation, cannot be cured by medicines, the effects of which are always very transitory, and seldom extend to the producing any considerable change of the whole habit.\n\nIt would perhaps have been happy for gouty persons if this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> had been implicitly received by them; as it would have prevented their having been so often the dupes of self-interested pretenders, who have either amused them with inert medicines, or have rashly employed those of the most pernicious tendency. Dr Cullen, who has treated of the cure of the disease with great judgment, as he has done the theory with much ingenuity, is much disposed to believe the impossibility of the cure of the gout by medicines; and more certainly still inclined to think, that, whatever may be the possible power of medicines, yet no medicine for curing the gout has hitherto been found. Although almost every age has presented a new remedy, all hitherto offered have, very soon after, been either neglected as useless, or condemned as pernicious.\n\nBut though unwilling to admit the power of medicines, yet he contends, that a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> can be done towards\ntowards the cure of the gout by a regimen: and he is firmly persuaded, that any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who, early in life, will enter upon the constant practice of bodily labour, and of abstinence from animal food, will be preserved entirely from the disease.","sp":358,"ep":365},{"h":"ATROPHIA","t":"Gen. 70. 333\n\nAbortus,\nAbscess of the lungs,\nAcute rheumatism,\nAcrimony of the blood,\nAdynamia,\nEgyptian physicians,\nEsculapius,\nEtius,\nAlexander,\n\nN\u00b0 247\n186\n205\n103\n271\n2\n4\n43\n44\nAmentia,","sp":527,"ep":527},{"h":"AXIOMS","t":"34. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIOM\">AXIOM</a> 1.

This axiom has been generally restricted to the particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> when the weights act perpendicularly to the arms of the lever; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> reason can be assigned for such limitation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> in the axiom is as self-evident when the angles formed by the arms of the lever and the direction of the forces are 80\u00b0, as when they are 90\u00b0; for in each case the two weights exert...\nexert their influence upon the lever in precisely the same circumstances.\n\n35. **Axiom 2.** <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> two equal weights are placed at the extremities of a lever supported by two fulcrums; and if these fulcrums are at equal distances from the weights, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the extremities of the lever; the pressure upon the fulcrum will be equal to the sum of the weights, and the pressure upon each fulcrum will be equal to one of the weights.\n\nThe lever being supposed devoid of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, it is obvious, that as each fulcrum is similarly situated with respect to both the weights, the pressure upon each must be equal; and as the fulcrum support both the equal weights, the pressure upon each must be equal to one of the weights.\n\n**Proposition I.**\n\n36. If two weights or forces acting at equal angles upon a straight lever, devoid of weight, are in equilibrium, they are reciprocally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to their distances from the fulcrum.\n\n37. **Case 1.** When the weights act on contrary sides of the fulcrum.\n\nLet \\( <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> \\) be a lever devoid of weight, and let it be supported on the two fulcrums, \\( fF \\), situated in such a manner that \\( A f = f F = FB \\). Then if two equal weights \\( C, D \\) of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> each are suspended at the extremities \\( A, B \\), so as to act in the directions \\( AC, BD \\), making the angles \\( CAB, DBA \\) equal, these weights will be in equilibrium, for since \\( A f = f F = FB \\) (Axiom 1.) the effort of the weight \\( D \\) to turn the lever round the fulcrum \\( f \\), will be equal to the effort of the weight \\( C \\) to turn it round the fulcrum \\( f \\). Now (Axiom 2.) the pressure upon the fulcrum \\( f \\) is equal to one pound, therefore if that fulcrum be removed, and a weight \\( E \\) of one pound be made to act upward at the point \\( F \\), the weights \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) will continue in equilibrium. Then it is obvious that since \\( FB = fF \\), the weight \\( E \\) of one pound acting upwards at the point \\( f \\), so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> \\( df = DBA \\), will have the same effect as an equal weight acting downwards at \\( B \\). By removing the weight \\( E \\), therefore, and suspending its equal \\( C \\) at the extremity \\( B \\), the equilibrium will still be preserved. But the weights \\( D, C \\), suspended at \\( B \\), are equal to two pounds, and the weight \\( C \\) is only one pound; and as \\( FA \\) is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> of \\( FB \\), it follows that a weight of two pounds, placed at the end of one arm of a lever, will be in equilibrium with a weight of one pound placed at twice the distance of the former from the fulcrum. But \\( 2 : 1 = 2FB \\) or \\( AF : FB \\), that is, when the distances are as 2 to 1, an equilibrium takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> if the weights are reciprocally proportional to these distances.\n\n38. **Case 2.** When weights act on the same side of the fulcrum.\n\nLet \\( AB \\) be a lever in equilibrium upon the fulcrum \\( F \\), and let \\( FA \\) be equal to \\( FB \\), consequently (Case 1.) we must have \\( C + D = 1 \\) pound. Now as the fulcrum \\( F \\) supports a weight equal to \\( C + D = 2 \\) pounds, the equilibrium will continue if a weight \\( E \\) of two pounds is made to act upwards at the point \\( F \\), for in this case it supplies the place of the fulcrum. It is obvious also that a fulcrum placed at \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) will supply the place of the weights at these parts without affecting the equilibrium. Let, therefore, the weight \\( D \\) be removed, and let the extremity \\( B \\) rest upon a fulcrum; then since the lever is in equilibrium, we have a weight \\( E = C + D = 2 \\) pounds acting at \\( F \\), and balancing a weight \\( C \\) of one pound acting at \\( A \\). But \\( 2 : 1 = AB : FB \\), consequently when there is an equilibrium between two weights \\( C, D \\) acting at the distances 2 and 1 from the fulcrum, and on the same side of the fulcrum, the weights are reciprocally proportional to these distances.\n\n39. Again, let \\( AB \\) be the same lever supported by Fig. 3, the fulcrums \\( f, F \\), and let \\( A f = f F = FB \\). Then if two weights \\( C, D \\) of one pound each be suspended at the extremities \\( A, B \\), they will be in equilibrium as before. But since the fulcrum \\( f \\) supports a pressure of one pound (Axiom 2.), the equilibrium will still continue when that fulcrum is removed and a weight of one pound made to act in a contrary direction \\( fP \\) at the point \\( f \\), so that the angle \\( P f F \\) may be equal to \\( DBA \\). Now, (Axiom 1.) a weight \\( E \\) of one pound acting upward at \\( f \\) will be in equilibrium with a weight \\( E' \\) of one pound acting downwards at \\( f' \\); \\( f'f \\) being equal to \\( fP \\), and therefore by removing \\( E \\) from the point \\( f \\) and substituting \\( E \\) at the point \\( f' \\), an equilibrium will still obtain. But since \\( fP = fF \\) a weight of one pound suspended from \\( f \\) will have the same influence in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the lever round \\( F \\) as a weight of two pounds suspended at \\( B \\) (Case 2.). Let us remove, therefore, the weight \\( E' \\) from \\( f' \\), and substitute a weight \\( G = 2E' \\), so as to act at \\( B \\). Then since the equilibrium is not destroyed, we have a weight \\( C \\) of one pound acting at the distance \\( FA \\), and the weights \\( D + G = 3 \\) pounds acting at the distance \\( FB \\). But \\( FA = 3FB \\) and \\( D + G = 3C \\), consequently \\( C : D + G = FB : FA \\). That is, when the distances from the fulcrum are as 3 to 1, and when an equilibrium exists, the weights are reciprocally proportional to these distances.\n\n40. By making \\( FA \\) in fig. 2. equal to \\( 2FB \\) it may be shewn, as in Case 2. that the weights are reciprocally proportional to their distances from the fulcrum, when they act on the same side of the fulcrum, and when the distances are as 3 to 1.\n\n41. In the same way the demonstration may be extended to any commensurable proportion of the arms, by making \\( EA \\) to \\( FB \\) in that proportion, and keeping \\( fA \\) always equal to \\( FB \\). Hence we may conclude in general, that when two weights acting at equal angles upon a straight lever devoid of weight, are in equilibrium, they are reciprocally proportional to their distances from the centre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. Q. E. D.\n\n42. **Corollary.** If two weights acting at equal angles upon the arms of a straight lever devoid of weight are reciprocally proportional to their distances from the fulcrum, they will be in equilibrium.\n\nFor if an equilibrium does not take place, the proportion of the weights must be altered to procure an equilibrium, and then, contrary to the proposition, the weights would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> each other when they are not reciprocally proportional to their distances from the fulcrum.\n\n43. **Corollary.** If a weight \\( W \\) be supported by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> lever resting on the fulcrum \\( A, B \\), the pressure upon \\( A \\) is to the pressure upon \\( B \\) in the inverse ratio of their distances from the point where the weight is suspended, that is, as \\( BF \\) to \\( FA \\).\n\nFor if we suppose \\( B \\) to be the fulcrum, and if removing the\nthe fulcrum A, we support the extremity A of the lever by a weight E <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to the weight sustained by the fulcrum A, and acting upwards over the pulley P; then the weight E or that sustained by A : W = BF : BA (Prop. 1); and if we conceive A to be the fulcrum, and support the extremity B by a weight F equal to that which was supported by the fulcrum B, we shall have the weight F or the weight sustained by B : W = FB : FA. Hence ex aequo the weight sustained by A is to the weight sustained by B as BF is to FA.\n\n44. Cor. 3. We may now call the two weights P and W, the power and the weight, as in fig. 5, and since P : W = FB : FA, we have (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. iv. Theor. 8.) \\( P \\times FA = W \\times FB \\), when an equilibrium takes place;\n\nconsequently \\( P = \\frac{W \\times FB}{FA} \\); \\( W = \\frac{P \\times FA}{FB} \\)\n\n\\( FA = \\frac{W \\times FB}{P} \\)\n\n\\( FB = \\frac{P \\times FA}{W} \\).\n\n45. Cor. 4. We have already seen (Axiom 2.) that when the power and the weight are on contrary sides of the fulcrum, the pressure upon the fulcrum is equal to P + W or the sum of the weights; but it is obvious that when they act on the same side of the fulcrum, the pressure which it supports will be P - W, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of their weights.\n\n46. Cor. 5. If a weight P be shifted along the arm of a lever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, the weight W, which it is capable of balancing at A, will be proportional to FA.\n\nWhen the weights are in equilibrium (Cor. 3.)\n\n\\( W : P = FA : FB \\), or by alternation \\( W : FA = P : FB \\),\n\nand if \\( w \\) be another value of W and \\( f \\) another value of FA, we shall also have \\( w : P = f : a : FB \\) or \\( w : f = P : FB \\), consequently (Euclid, Book v. Prop. xi. and xvi.) \\( W : w = FA : f \\), that is, W varies as FA.\n\nCor. 6. It is obvious that the truths in the preceding proposition and corollaries, also hold when the lever has the form represented in fig. 6, only the straight lines AF, FB are in that case the length of the arm.\n\n47. Cor. 7. Since by the last corollary \\( FA : f = w : w \\), it follows that in the Roman statera or steelyard, which is merely a lever with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and short arm, having a weight moveable upon the long one, the distances at which the constant weight must be hung are as the weights suspended from the shorter arm. The steelyard is represented in fig. 7, where AB is the lever with unequal arms AF, FB, and F the centre of motion. The body W, whose weight is to be found, is suspended at the extremity B of the lever, and the constant weight P is moved along the divided arm FB till an equilibrium takes place. As soon as this happens, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> placed at the point of suspension D, indicates the weight of the body. If the lever is devoid of weight, it is obvious that the scale EB will be a scale of equal parts of which EB is the unit, and that the weight of the body W will be always equal to the constant weight P multiplied by the number of divisions between P and F. Thus if the equilibrium takes place when P is pulled out to the 12 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, we shall have \\( W = 12 P \\), and if \\( P = 1 \\) pound, \\( W = 12 \\) pounds. But when the gravity of the lever is considered, which must be done in the real steelyard, its arms are generally of unequal weight, and therefore the divisions of the scale must be ascertained by experiment. In order to do this, remove the weight P, and find the point C, at which a weight \\( P' \\) equal to P being suspended, will keep the unequal arms in equilibrium, C will then be the point at which the equal divisions must commence. For when W and P are placed upon the steelyard and are in equilibrium, W balances P along with a weight which, placed at D, would support P placed at C: Therefore \\( W \\times BF = P \\times DF + P \\times CF \\); but \\( P \\times DF + P \\times CF = P \\times DC \\), consequently \\( W \\times BF = P \\times DC \\), and (Geometry, Sect. iv. Theor. 8.) \\( W : DC = P : BF \\). By taking different values of the variable quantities W and DC as \\( w \\) and \\( d c \\), we shall have \\( w : d c = P : BF \\), consequently (Euclid, B. V. Prop. xi. and xvi.) \\( W : w = DC : d c \\), that is, the weight of W varies as DC, and therefore the divisions must commence at C. If the arm BF had been heavier than FA, which, however, can scarcely happen in practice, the point C would have been on the other side of F. In constructing steelyards, it might be advisable to make the unequal arms balance each other by placing a weight M at the extremity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> arm, in which case the scale will begin at F. In the Danish and Swedish steelyard the body to be weighed and the constant weight are fixed at the extremities of the steelyard, but the point of suspension or centre of motion F moves along the lever till the equilibrium takes place. The point F then indicates the weight of the body required.\n\nThere are some steelyards in which the constant weight is fixed to the shorter arm, while the body to be weighed moves upon the longer arm. The method of dividing this and the preceding steelyard may be seen in De la Hire's Trait\u00e9 de M\u00e9canique, Prop. 36, 37, 38.\n\nProp. II.\n\n48. To find the condition of equilibrium on a straight lever when its gravity is taken into the account.\n\n49. Let us suppose the lever to be of uniform thickness and density, as AB, fig. 7, and let it be suspended by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> c, d to another lever a b, considered as without weight, so that \\( a c = c f = f d = d b \\). Then if \\( f \\) be the centre of motion or point of suspension, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> A B will be in equilibrium; for the weight AB may be regarded as composed of a number of pairs of equal weights, equally distant from the centre of motion. For the same reason, if we conceive the cylinder to be cut through at F the equilibrium will continue, \\( c, d \\) being now the points at which the weights AF, FB act, and their distances \\( c, f, d, f \\) from the centre of motion being equal. Consequently the arms AF, FB have the same energy in turning the lever round \\( f \\) as if weights equal to AF, FB were suspended at the distance of their middle points \\( c, d \\) from the fulcrum.\n\nLet P therefore, in fig. 5, be the power, W the weight, m the weight of the arm AF, and n the weight of FB. Then when there is an equilibrium we shall have (Prop. I. Cor. 3.) \\( P \\times AF + m \\times \\frac{1}{2} AF = W \\times FB + n \\times \\frac{1}{2} FB \\); and since the weight m, acting at half the distance AF is the same as half the weight m acting at\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a>. The whole distance AF, we may substitute \\( \\frac{1}{2} m \\times AF \\) instead of \\( m \\times \\frac{1}{2} AF \\), and the equation becomes\n\n\\[ P + \\frac{1}{2} m \\times AF = W + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times FB. \\]\n\nHence\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{W + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times FB}{AF - \\frac{1}{2} m}. \\]\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{P + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times AF}{FB - \\frac{1}{2} m}. \\]\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{W + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times 2FB}{AF - \\frac{1}{2} m} - 2P. \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{P + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times 2FB}{FB - \\frac{1}{2} m} - 2W. \\]\n\n\\[ AF = \\frac{W + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times FB}{P + \\frac{1}{2} m}. \\]\n\n\\[ FB = \\frac{P + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times AF}{W + \\frac{1}{2} m}. \\]\n\n50. Cor. If the arms of the lever are not of uniform density and thickness, instead of the distance of their middle points, we must take the distance of their centre of gravity from the fulcrum.\n\nProp. III.\n\n51. If two forces acting in any direction, and in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, upon a lever of any form, are in equilibrium, they will be reciprocally proportional to the perpendiculars let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> from the fulcrum upon the directions in which they act.\n\nPlate CCCXVII A, B the points to which the forces, or the power P and weight W, are applied, and AE, BK the directions in which these forces act. Make AE to PK as P is to W, and they will therefore represent the forces applied at A and B. Draw AC perpendicular to AF and EC <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to it, and complete the parallelogram ADEC. In the same way form the parallelogram BGKH. Produce FA and KB towards m and n if necessary, and let fall FM, FN perpendicular to AE, BK produced. Then P shall be to W as FN is to FM.\n\nBy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of forces (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNAMICS\">Dynamics</a>, \u00a7 142.) the force AE is equivalent to forces represented by AD and AC, and acting in these directions. But as AD acts in the direction of the arm AF, it can have no influence in turning the lever round F, and therefore AC represents the portion of the force AD which contributes to produce an angular motion round F. In the same way it may be shown that BG is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the force BK which tends to move the lever round F. Now suppose AF produced to B, FB being made equal to FB and B'G' = BG. Then by Prop. I. AC : B'G' = FB' : FA; but by Axiom 1. the effort of BG to turn the lever round F is equal to the effort of the equal force B'G' to turn the lever round F; therefore AC : BG = FB : FA and AC \u00d7 FA = BG \u00d7 FB. Now the triangles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACE\">ACE</a>, AEM are similar, because the angles at F and M are both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, and on account of the parallels DF, AC, MAC = ADF; therefore AC : AE = FM : FA, and AC \u00d7 FA = AE \u00d7 FM. For the same reason in the similar triangles BGK, BF n we have BG : BK = Fn : FB, and BK \u00d7 Fn = BG \u00d7 FB.\n\nHence AE \u00d7 FM = BK \u00d7 Fn, and AE : BK or P : W = Fn : FM. Q.E.D.\n\n53. Cor. 1. The forces P and W are reciprocally Corollaries proportional to the sines of the angles which their directions make with the arms of the lever, for FM is evidently the sine of the angle FA m, and Fn the sine of the angle FB n, FA, FB being made the radii; therefore P : W = Sin. FB n : Sin. FA m, or P : W = \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin. FA m} : \\frac{1}{\\sin. FB n}\\). Since FA : FM = Rad. : Sin. FA m, we have FM = \\(\\frac{FA \\times \\sin. FA m}{Rad.}\\); and since FB : Fn = Rad. : Sin. FB n, we have FM = \\(\\frac{FB \\times \\sin. FB n}{Rad.}\\).\n\nbut in the case of an equilibrium P : W = Fn : FM, consequently P : W = \\(\\frac{FB \\times \\sin. FB n}{Rad.} : \\frac{FA \\times \\sin. FA m}{Rad.}\\);\n\nand since magnitudes have the same ratio as their equimultiples, P : W = EB \u00d7 Sin. EB n : FA \u00d7 Sin. FA m.\n\n54. Cor. 2. The energies of the forces P, W to turn the lever round the fulcrum F is the same at whatever point in the directions mF, nK they are applied, for the perpendiculars to which these energies are proportional remain the same.\u2014The truth of this corollary has been assumed as an axiom by some writers on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, who have very readily deduced from it the preceding proposition. But it is very obvious that the truth assumed as self-evident is nearly equivalent to the truth which it is employed to prove. Those who have adopted this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of demonstration illustrate their axiom by the case of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> body that is either pushed in one direction with a straight rod, or drawn by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>; in both of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> it is manifest that the effect of the force employed is the same, at whatever part of the rod or string it is applied: But these cases are completely different from that of a body moving round a fixed centre.\n\n55. Cor. 3. If AE and BK the directions in which the forces P, W are exerted be produced till they meet at L; and if from the fulcrum E the line LS be drawn parallel to the direction AL of one force till it meets BL, the direction of the other; then LS, SF will represent the two forces. For as the sides of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> are as the sines of the opposite angles LS : SF = sin. LFS : sin. FLS; but on account of the parallels FS, AL the angle LFS = FLA, and FL being radius FM is the sine of FLA or LFS, and Fn the sine of FLS, therefore by substitution LS : SF = FM : Fn, that is as the force W : P.\n\n56. Cor. 4. If several forces act upon a lever, and keep it in equilibrium, the sum of the products of the forces and the perpendiculars from the fulcrum to the direction of the different forces on one side is equal to the sum of the products on the other. For since the energy of each force to turn the lever is equal to the product of the force and the perpendicular from the fulcrum on the line of its direction; and since in the case of an equilibrium, the energy of all the forces on one side of the fulcrum must be equal to the energy of all the forces on the other side, the products proportional to their energies must also be equal.\n\n57. Cor. 5. If two forces act in a parallel direction upon an angular lever whose fulcrum is its angular point,\npoint, these forces will be in equilibrium when a line drawn from the fulcrum upon the line which joins the two points where the forces are applied, and parallel to the direction of the forces, cuts it in such a manner that the two parts are reciprocally proportional to the forces applied.\n\nLet \\( \\Delta F B \\) be the angular lever, whose fulcrum is \\( F \\), and let the forces \\( P, W \\) be applied at \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) in the parallel directions \\( Pm, Wn \\); then if the line \\( FD \\), parallel to \\( Pm \\) or \\( Wn \\), cut \\( AB \\) in such a manner that \\( DB : DA = P : W \\), the forces will be in equilibrium. Draw \\( Fm \\) perpendicular to \\( Pm \\), and produce it to \\( n \\); then since \\( Am, Bn \\) are parallel, \\( mn \\) will also be perpendicular to \\( Bn \\), and by the proposition (Art. 51.), \\( Fm : Pm = P : W \\). Now, if through \\( F \\), there be drawn \\( m'n' \\) parallel to \\( AB \\), the triangles \\( Fmm', Fnn' \\) will be similar, and we shall have \\( Fn : Fm = Fn' : Fm' \\), but on account of the parallels \\( AB, m'n', Fn' : Fm' = DB : DA \\), therefore \\( DB : DA = P : W \\).\n\n58. Cor. 6. Let \\( CB \\) be a body moveable round its centre of gravity \\( F \\), and let two forces \\( P, W \\) act upon it at the points \\( A, B \\) in the plane \\( \\Delta FB \\), in the directions \\( AP, BW \\); then since this body may be regarded as a lever whose fulcrum is \\( F \\), the forces will be in equilibrium when \\( P : W = Fn : Fm \\), the perpendiculars on the directions in which the forces act.\n\n59. Cor. 7. If \\( AB \\) be an inflexible rod moveable round \\( F \\) as a fulcrum, and acted upon by two forces \\( P, W \\) in the directions \\( Am, An \\), these forces will be in equilibrium when they are to one another as the perpendiculars \\( Fn, Fm \\).\u2014For by cor. 2., the forces may be considered as applied at \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), and \\( mF \\) may be regarded as the lever; but by the proposition (Art. 51.), \\( P : W = Fn : Fm \\); \\( Fm, Fn \\) being perpendiculars upon \\( Am, An \\).\n\n60. Cor. 8. Let \\( DE \\) be a heavy wheel, and \\( FG \\) an obstacle over which it is to be moved, by a force \\( P \\), acting in the direction \\( AH \\). Join \\( AF \\), and draw \\( Fm, Fn \\) perpendicular to \\( CA \\) and \\( AH \\). The weight of the wheel is evidently the weight to be raised, and may be represented by \\( W \\) acting at the point \\( A \\) in the vertical direction \\( AC \\). We may now consider \\( AF \\) as a lever whose fulcrum is \\( F \\), and by cor. 7., there will be an equilibrium when \\( P : W = Fn : Fm \\). Since \\( Fm \\) represents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> energy of the power \\( P \\) to turn the wheel round \\( F \\), it is obvious that when \\( FG \\) is equal to the radius of the wheel, the weight \\( P \\), however great, has no power to move it over the obstacle; for when \\( FG = AC, Fm = 0 \\), and \\( Fm \\times P = 0 \\).\n\n61. Cor. 9. If a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> be placed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of scales hung at the extremities of a lever, and is in equilibrium with a weight in the opposite scale, then if he presses against any point in the lever, except that point from which the scale is suspended, the equilibrium will be destroyed. Let \\( CB \\) be the lever in equilibrium, \\( F \\) its fulcrum, and let the scales be suspended from \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), \\( AP \\) being the scale in which the man is placed. Then if he presses with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> or with a rod against \\( D \\), a point nearer the centre than \\( A \\), the scale will take the position \\( AP' \\), and the same effect will be produced as if \\( AD \\) were a solid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> acting upon the lever in the direction of gravity. Consequently if \\( Pp \\) be drawn perpendicular from the point \\( P' \\) to \\( FC, FP \\) will be the lever with which the man in the scale tends to turn the lever round the fulcrum; and as \\( FP \\) is greater than \\( FA \\), the man will preponderate. In the same way it may be shown, that if the man in the scale \\( AP \\) presses upwards against a point \\( C \\), more remote from the fulcrum than \\( A \\), he will diminish his relative weight, and the scale \\( W \\) will preponderate, for in this case the scale assumes the position \\( AP'' \\), and \\( FP' \\) becomes the lever by which it acts.\n\n62. Cor. 10. If a weight \\( W \\) be supported by an inclined lever resting on the fulcra \\( A, B \\), the pressure upon \\( A \\) is to that upon \\( B \\) inversely, as \\( Af \\) is to \\( fb \\), the sections of a horizontal line by the vertical direction of the weight \\( W \\).\n\nRemove the fulcrum \\( A \\), and support the extremity \\( A \\) by a weight \\( P \\), equal to the pressure upon \\( A \\); then \\( B \\) being the centre of motion, and \\( mn \\) being drawn through \\( F \\) perpendicular to the direction of the forces \\( Am, Ef \\), and consequently parallel to \\( Ab \\), we have (Art. 51.) \\( P : W = Fn : Fn' = fb : fA \\), that is, the pressure upon \\( A \\) is to the pressure upon \\( B \\) inversely as \\( Af \\) is to \\( fb \\).\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCHOLIUM\">Scholium</a>.\n\n63. Various attempts have been made by different writers on mechanics to give a complete and satisfactory demonstration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the lever. The first of these attempts was made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, who assumes as an axiom, that if two equal bodies be placed upon a lever, they will have the same influence in giving it a rotatory motion as if they were both placed in the middle part between them. This truth, however, is far from being self-evident, and on this account Mr Vince* has completed the demonstration by making this axiom a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> proposition. Trans. The demonstration of Galileo\u2020 is both simple and elegant, and does not seem to have attracted much notice, yet Demonstration Archimedes completed by Mr Vince. Galileo suspends a solid cylinder or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a> from a lever by several threads. When the lever is hung by its centre, the whole is in equilibrium. He then supposes the cylinder to be cut into two unequal parts, which from their mode of suspension still retain their position, and then imagines each part of the cylinder to be suspended by its centre from the lever. Here then we have two unequal weights hanging at unequal distances from the centre of suspension, and it follows from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, that these weights are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> ratio of their distances from that centre. Mr Vince, on the other hand, employs a cylinder balanced on a fulcrum. He supposes this cylinder divided into unequal parts, and thus concludes, from his preliminary proposition, that these unequal parts have the same effect in turning the lever as if the weight of these parts was placed in their centres; which is done by Galileo by suspending them from their centres. From this the fundamental property of the lever is easily deduced.\u2014The next demonstration was given by Huygens, who assumes as an axiom, that if any weight placed upon a lever is removed to a greater distance from the fulcrum, its effort to turn the lever will be increased. This axiom he might have demonstrated thus, and his demonstration would have been completely satisfactory, though it applies only to cases where the arms of the lever are commensurable. Let \\( AB \\) be a lever with equal weights \\( C, D \\), supported on the fulcra \\( f, F \\), so that\nTheory. \\( A = FB \\); then, as was shown in Prop. I, the weights will be in equilibrium, and each fulcrum will support a weight equal to \\( C \\) or \\( D \\). By removing the fulcrum \\( f \\), the weight \\( C \\) must descend, as the equilibrium is destroyed by a weight equal to \\( C \\) acting at \\( f \\); therefore the weight \\( C \\), at the distance \\( AF \\), has a greater effect in turning the lever than an equal weight \\( D \\) placed at a less distance \\( FB \\).\u2014In Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton's demonstration, it is supposed that if a given weight act in any direction, and if several radii be drawn from the fulcrum to the line of direction, the effort of that weight to turn the lever will be the same to whatever of these radii it is applied. It appears, however, from Art. 54, that this principle is far from being self-evident, and therefore the demonstration which is founded upon it cannot be admitted as satisfactory. The demonstration given by Maclaurin * is simple and convincing, and has been highly approved of by Dr T. Young and other writers on mechanics, though it extends only to any commensurable proportion of the arms. He supposes the lever \\( AB \\) with equal arms to be in equilibrium upon the fulcrum \\( F \\), by means of the equal forces \\( P, W \\), in which case the fulcrum \\( F \\) will evidently be pressed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with a weight equal to \\( 2P = P + W \\). He then substitutes, instead of the weight \\( P \\), a fixed obstacle \\( O \\), which will not destroy the equilibrium, and considers the fulcrum as still loaded with a weight equal to \\( P + W \\). The pressure on \\( F \\) being therefore equal to \\( 2P \\) or \\( P + W \\), a weight \\( E \\) equal to \\( 2P \\), and acting upwards, is substituted in the room of that pressure, so that the equilibrium will still continue. Here then we have a lever \\( AB \\) of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> kind, influenced by two forces \\( E \\) and \\( W \\) acting at different distances from the fulcrum \\( A \\); and since \\( E = 2P = 2W \\), and \\( AB = AF \\), we have \\( E : W = AB : AF \\), which expresses the fundamental property of the lever. Without objecting to the circumstance that this demonstration applies only to the lever of the second kind, we may be allowed to observe, that it involves an axiom which cannot be called self-evident. It is certainly manifest that when \\( P \\) and \\( W \\) are in equilibrium, the pressure upon the fulcrum is \\( 2P = P + W \\); but it by no means follows that this pressure remains the same when the fixed obstacle \\( O \\) is substituted in the room of \\( P \\). On the contrary, the axiom assumed is a result of the proposition which it is employed to prove, or rather it is the proposition itself.\n\nFor if, when the extremity \\( A \\) bears against the obstacle \\( O \\), the pressure upon \\( F \\) is equal to \\( 2W \\), the force \\( W \\) obviously produces a pressure \\( = 2W \\) at half the distance \\( AB \\), which is the property to be demonstrated. \u2014The demonstrations given by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANDEN\">Landen</a> and Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, the former in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a>, and the latter in his Essays \u2020, though in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> satisfactory, are long and tedious. In the demonstration of Dr Hamilton, he employs the following proposition: that when a body is at rest, and acted upon by three forces, they will be to one another as the three sides of a triangle parallel to the direction in which the forces act. When the three forces act on one point of a body, the proposition is true, but it is not applicable to the case of a lever where the forces are applied to three different points, and at all events the demonstration does not hold when any two of the forces act in parallel directions. The demonstration which we have given in Prop. I is new, and different from any that have been noticed. The truths on which it is founded are perfectly axiomatic; and the only objection to which it seems liable is, that the demonstration extends only to a commensurate proportion of the arms of the lever.\u2014An analytical demonstration of the fundamental property of the lever was given by Foncenix in the Miscellanea Jour. tom. ii. p. 321, which was afterwards improved by D'Alembert in the Mem. de l'Acad. 1769. p. 283.\n\n**Prop. IV.**\n\n64. When several levers \\( AB, ab, \\alpha \\beta \\), whose fulcra are \\( F, f, \\varphi \\), are so combined as to act perpendicularly upon each other, or at equal angles; and if the directions in which the power and weight are applied, be also perpendicular to the arms, or at the same angles with them as those at which the levers act upon each other, there is an equilibrium when \\( P : W = BF \\times b f \\times \\beta \\varphi : AF \\times a f \\times \\alpha \\varphi \\).\n\nLet \\( M \\) be the force which is exerted by the first lever \\( AB \\) upon the second \\( ab \\), and \\( N \\) the force which is exerted by the second lever \\( ab \\) upon the third \\( \\alpha \\beta \\), then by Prop.

To explain the new property of the lever discovered by M. \u00c9pinus, and extended by Van Swinden.\n\nLet \\( AFB \\) be any lever whose fulcrum is \\( F \\), and to Fig. 2, whose extremities \\( A, B \\) are applied the forces \\( P, W \\) in the directions \\( <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AY\">AY</a>, BO \\). Join \\( AB \\), and produce it on both sides towards \\( E \\) and \\( I \\). Produce also the lines \\( YA, VB \\) till they meet in \\( H \\), and from \\( H \\), through the fulcrum \\( F \\), draw \\( HF, f \\), dividing \\( AB \\) into two parts \\( Af, Bf \\). Let \\( UM \\) be a line given in position, and let \\( \\alpha, \\beta \\) represent the angles which the direction of the forces \\( YA, VB \\) make with that line. Let \\( YA \\) and \\( VB \\) likewise represent the intensity of the forces \\( P, W \\), and let \\( VA \\) be resolved into \\( AE \\) and \\( YF \\); and the force \\( VB \\) into \\( BI \\) and \\( VI \\).\u2014Then the lever cannot be in equilibrium till\n\nI. \\( EA \\times fA + IB \\times fB \\) is a maximum.\n\nII. Or putting \\( \\varphi \\) for the angles formed by the lines \\( AB, UT \\), which the lever, when in equilibrium, makes with the line \\( UM \\) given in position, there cannot be an equilibrium till\n\n\\[\nTang. \\varphi \\times P \\times Af \\times Cos. \\alpha + Tang. \\varphi \\times W \\times Bf \\times Cos. \\beta = W \\times Bf \\times Sin. \\beta - P \\times Af \\times Sin. \\alpha .\n\\]\nIII.

Comment. Petropol. tom. viii. p. 271.\n\nScholium.\n\n66. This property of the lever was only considered by \u00c6pinus in the case of a rectilineal lever with equal arms; but was extended by J. H. Van Swinden. When the lever is rectilineal and with equal arms, we have \\(AF = FB = AF = BF\\); and also \\(m = n = 0\\), so that, if the last formula is suited to these conditions, we shall have the formula of \u00c6pinus.\n\nProp. VI.\n\n67. If a power and weight acting upon the arms of any lever be in equilibrio, and if the whole be put in motion, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the weight is to the power.\n\nLet \\(AFB\\) be any lever whose fulcrum is \\(F\\), and let the power \\(P\\) and weight \\(W\\) be applied to its extremities \\(A, B\\), so as to be in equilibrio. Draw \\(Fm, Fn\\) perpendicular to \\(AD, BE\\) the direction of the forces \\(P, W\\). Then suppose an uniform angular motion to be given to the lever, so as to make it describe the small angle \\(\\angle FAB'\\), the position of the lever will now be \\(AFB'\\), and the directions of the forces, \\(P, W\\) will be \\(AD', BE'\\) parallel to \\(AD, BE\\) respectively, since the angle \\(AEF\\) is exceedingly small. Join \\(<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">AA</a>', BB'\\), and from \\(A'\\) and \\(B'\\) draw \\(A'x, B'z\\) perpendicular to \\(AD\\) and \\(BE\\). Now it is obvious, that though the point \\(A\\) has moved, through the space \\(AA'\\) in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that the point \\(B\\) has described the space \\(BB'\\), yet \\(Ax\\) is the space described by \\(A\\) in the direction \\(AD\\), and \\(Bz\\) the space described by \\(B\\) in the direction \\(BE\\).\n\nFor if we suppose a plane passing through \\(A\\) at right angles to \\(AD\\), and another through \\(P\\) parallel to the former plane, it is manifest that \\(Ax\\) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> the approach of the point \\(A\\) to the plane passing through \\(P\\); and for the same reason \\(Bz\\) measures the approach of the point \\(B\\) to a plane passing through \\(W\\) at right angles to \\(WB\\). Therefore \\(Ax, Bz\\) represent the spaces uniformly and simultaneously described by the points \\(A, B\\), and may therefore be taken to denote the velocities of these points (Dynamics, \u00a7 14); consequently the velocity of \\(A\\) : the velocity of \\(B = Ax : Bz\\).\n\nNow, in the triangles \\(Ax A', Fm A\\), the exterior angle \\(x \\angle AF = A'm F + m F'\\), \\(A\\) (Euclid, B. I. Prop. 32.) and \\(A'A'F = A'm F'\\), because \\(A'A'\\) is so exceedingly small that \\(A'A\\) is sensibly perpendicular to \\(AF\\); consequently \\(x \\angle AA' = AE m\\); and as the angles at \\(x\\) and \\(m\\) are right, the triangles \\(Ax A', Am F\\) are similar (Geometry, Theor. XX. Sect. IV.).\n\nTherefore, \\(Ax : AA' = Fm : FA\\), and in the similar triangles \\(AF A', BB' AA' : BB' = FA : FB\\), and in the similar triangles \\(BB'z, BF n, BB' : Bz = FB : Fn\\), therefore by composition we have \\(Ax : Bz = Fm : Fn\\).\n\nBut by Proposition II. \\(P : W = Fn : Fm\\), consequently \\(Ax : Bz = W : P\\), that is, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the weight is to the power. Q. E. D.\n\n68. Cor. Since \\(Ax : Bz = W : P\\) we have \\(Ax \\times P = Bz \\times W\\), that is, the momenta of the power and weight are equal.\n\nSect. II. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">Inclined Plane</a>.\n\n69. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">Definition</a>. An inclined plane is a plane surface \\(AB\\), supported at any angle \\(ABC\\) formed with the horizontal plane \\(BC\\). The inclination of the plane is the angle which one line in the plane \\(AB\\) forms with another in the horizontal plane \\(BC\\), both these lines being at right angles to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> intersection of the two planes.\u2014The line \\(BA\\) is called the length of the plane, \\(AC\\) its height, and \\(BC\\) the length of its base.\n\n70. In order to understand how the inclined plane acts as a mechanical power, let us suppose it necessary to elevate the weight \\(D\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(A\\). If this weight is lifted by the arms of a man to the point \\(A\\), he must support the whole of the load; but when it is rolled up the inclined plane, a considerable part of its weight is supported upon the plane, and therefore a much smaller force is capable of raising it to \\(A\\).\n\nProp. I.\n\n71. When any weight \\(W\\) is kept in equilibrio upon an inclined plane by a power \\(P\\), the power is to the weight as the sine of the plane's inclination is to the sine of the angle which the direction of the power makes with a line at right angles to the plane.\n\nLet \\(MN\\) be the inclined plane, \\(NO\\) a horizontal line, and \\(MNO\\) the inclination of the plane, and let the weight \\(W\\) be sustained upon \\(MN\\) by means of the power \\(P\\) acting in the direction \\(AE\\). From the point \\(A\\), the centre of gravity of the weight, draw \\(AB\\) perpendicular to the horizontal plane \\(ND\\), and \\(AF\\) perpendicular to \\(MN\\); produce \\(EA\\) till it meets the plane in \\(C\\), and from the point \\(F\\) where the body touches the plane draw \\(Fm\\) at right angles to \\(AC\\), and \\(Fn\\) at right angles to \\(AB\\). Then, since the whole body may be considered as collected in the centre of gravity \\(A\\), \\(AB\\) will be the direction in which it tends to fall, or the direction of the weight, and \\(EA\\) is the direction of the power; but \\(AF\\) is a lever whose fulcrum is \\(F\\), and since it is acted upon by two forces which are in equilibrio, we shall have (Art. 59.) \\(P : W = Fn : Fm\\), that is, as the perpendiculars drawn from the fulcrum to the direction in which the forces act. Now \\(FA\\) being radius, \\(Fn\\) is the sine of the angle \\(FAB\\), and \\(Fm\\) is the sine of the angle \\(FAC\\); but \\(FAB\\) is equal to \\(MNO\\) the angle of the plane's inclination, on account of the right angles at \\(F\\) and \\(B\\) and the vertical angles at \\(D\\); and \\(FAC\\) is the angle which the direction of the power makes with a line perpendicular to the plane; therefore \\(P : W\\)\nMechanics.\n\nTheory. As the sine of the plane's inclination, is to the sine of the angle formed by the direction of the power with a line at the right angles to the plane.\n\n72. Cor. 1. When the power acts parallel to the plane in the direction AE', P is to W as EA to En, that is, as radius is to the sine of the plane's inclination, or on account of the similar triangles FA, MNO, as the length of the plane is to its height. In this case the power acts to the greatest advantage.\n\n73. Cor. 2. When the power acts in a vertical line A, F becomes equal to or coincides with F n, and we have P : W = F n : F n, that is, the power in this case sustains the whole weight.\n\n74. Cor. 3. When the power acts parallel to the base of the plane in the direction Ae, P : W = F n : Ff = Fn : An.\n\n75. Cor. 4. When the power acts in the direction AF' perpendicular to the plane, it has no power to resist the gravity of the weight; for the perpendicular from the fulcrum F, to which its energy is proportional, vanishes.\n\n76. Cor. 5. Since the body W acts upon the plane in a direction AF perpendicular to the plane's surface, (for its force downwards may be resolved into two, one parallel to the plane, and the other perpendicular to it), and since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> of the plane must also be perpendicular to its surface (Dynamics, \u00a7 149.), that is, in the direction FA, then, when the direction of the power is Ae parallel to the horizon, the power, the weight, and the pressure upon the plane, will be respectively as the height, the base, and the length of the plane. The weight W is acted upon by three forces; by its own gravity in the direction An, by the reaction of the plane in the direction AF, and by the power P in the direction AF'. Therefore, since these forces are in equilibrio, and since AF is parallel to nF, and Ff to An, the three sides AF, Af, Ff, will represent the three forces (Dynamics, \u00a7 144.). But the triangle AFf is similar to AnF, that is, to MNO, for it was already shewn that the angle nAF is equal to MNO, therefore, since in the triangle AFf, AF represents the pressure on the plane, Af the weight of the body, and Ff the energy of the power, these magnitudes will also be represented in the similar triangle MNO by the sides MN, MO, NO.\n\n77. Cor. 6. If a power P and weight W are in equilibrio upon two inclined planes, AB, AC; P : W = AB : AC. Let p be the power, which acting on the weight W in a direction parallel to the plane would keep it in equilibrio, then we have p : W = AD : AC; but since the string is equally stretched at every point, the same power p will also sustain the power P, consequently P : p = AB : AD, and by composition P : W = AB : AC.\n\nProp. II.\n\n78. If a spherical body is supported upon two inclined planes, the pressures upon these planes will be inversely as the sines of their inclination, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> weight of the body is represented by the sine of the angle formed by the two planes.\n\nLet AC, BC be the two inclined planes, and F the spherical body which they support. The whole of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> being supposed to be collected in its centre of gravity F, its tendency downwards will be in the vertical line FO. The reaction of the planes upon F is evidently in the direction MF, NF perpendicular to the surface of these planes, and therefore we may consider the body F as influenced by three forces acting in the directions FC, FM, FN; but these forces are represented by the sides of the triangle ABC perpendicular to their directions, (Dynamics, \u00a7 144.), consequently the absolute weight of the body F, the pressure upon the plane AC, and the pressure upon the plane BC, are respectively as AB, AC, and BC, that is, as the sines of the angles ACD, ABC, BAC, for in every triangle the sides are as the sines of the opposite angles, or to express it in symbols, W being the absolute weight of the body, w the pressure on AC, and w' the pressure on BC,\n\n\\[ W : w : w' = AB : AC : BC, \\text{ or} \\]\n\n\\[ W : w : w' = \\sin \\angle ACB : \\sin \\angle ABC : \\sin \\angle BCA. \\]\n\nBut on account of the parallels AB, DF, the angle ABC = BCF, and BAC = ACD, therefore the pressures upon the planes are inversely as the sines of their inclination, the absolute weight of the body being represented by the sine of the angle formed by the surfaces of the two planes.\n\n79. Cor. 1. Since the two sides of a triangle are greater than the third, the sum of the relative weights supported by the two planes is greater than the absolute weight of the body.\n\n80. Cor. 2. If the inclination of each plane is 60\u00b0, then ACB must also be 60\u00b0, and the triangle ABC equilateral, consequently the pressure upon each plane is equal to the absolute weight of the body.\n\n81. Cor. 3. When the inclination of each plane increases, the pressure which each sustains is also increased; and when their inclination diminishes till it almost vanishes, the pressure upon each plane is one half of the absolute weight of the body F.\n\nProp. III.\n\n82. If a body is raised with an uniform motion along an inclined plane, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the weight is to the power.\n\nLet the weight W be drawn uniformly up the inclined plane AB, from B to D, by a power whose direction is parallel to DH. Upon DB describe the circle BFEDN, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> BC in E, and having produced HD to F, join FP, FB, FE, and draw DC perpendicular to BD. Now the angles BFD, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">BED</a> are right (Geometry, Sect. II. Theor. 17.), and therefore, though the power moves through a space equal to BD, yet its velocity in the direction DH is measured by the space FD uniformly described; and for the same reason, though the weight W describes the space BD, yet its velocity in the direction in which it acts, that is, in a vertical direction, is evidently measured by the space DE uniformly described. Then because the triangle DBE is equal to DFE, (Geometry, Sect. II. Theor. 15.) and DBE = DCH, (Geometry, Sect. IV. Theor. 23.) and FDE = DHC, (Geometry, Sect. I. Theor. 21.)\n21.) the triangles DFE, DHC are similar, and (Geometry, Sect. IV. Theor. 20.) DF : DE = DH : HC. But DH : HC = sin. DCH : sin. HDC, that is, (art. 71.) DF : DE, or the velocity of the power to the velocity of the weight, as W : P. Q. E. D.\n\nScholium.\n\n83. The inclined plane, when combined with other machinery, is often of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in the elevation of weights. It has been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of some writers, that the huge masses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> which are found at great altitudes in the splendid remains of Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, were raised upon inclined planes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, with the aid of other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL_POWERS\">mechanical powers</a>. This supposition, however, is not probable, as the immense blocks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a> which compose the pyramids of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> could not possibly have been raised into their present situation by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the mechanical powers with which we are acquainted.\u2014The inclined plane has been very advantageously employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Bridgewater\u2019s canal. After this canal has extended 40 miles on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, it is joined to a subterraneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> about 12 miles long by means of an inclined plane, and this subterraneous portion is again connected by an inclined plane with another subterraneous portion about 106 feet above it. This inclined plane is a stratum of stone which slopes one foot in four, and is about 453 feet long. The boats are conveyed from one portion of the canal to another by means of a windlass, so that a loaded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> descending along the plane turns the axis of the windlass, and raises an empty boat.\u2014A pair of stairs, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> that is not level, may be regarded as inclined planes; and hence it is a matter of great importance, in carrying a road to the top of a hill, to choose such a line that the declivity may be the least possible. The additional length, which, in order to effect this purpose, must sometimes be given to the line of road, is a trifling inconvenience, when compared with the advantages of a gentle declivity.\n\nSect. III. On the Rope Machine.\n\n84. Definition. When a body suspended by two more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, is sustained by powers which act by the assistance of these ropes, this assemblage of ropes is called a rope machine.\n\nProp. I.\n\n85. If a weight is an equilibrium with two powers acting on a rope machine, these powers are inversely as the sines of the angles which the ropes form with the direction of the weight.\n\nLet the weight W be suspended by the point B, where the ropes AB, BC are joined, and let the powers P, p acting at the other extremities of the ropes which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> over the pulleys A, C, keep this weight in equilibrium, we shall have P : p = sin. CBD : sin. ABD. Produce WB to F, and let BD represent the force exerted by W; then by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> DE parallel to AB, the sides of the triangle BDE will represent the three forces by which the point B is solicited (Dynamics, \u00a7 144.), for AB, CB are the directions of the forces P and p. We have therefore P : p = DE : BE; but\n\nDE : BE = sin. DBE : sin. BDE, and on account of the parallels DE, AB, the angle BDE = ABD, consequently P : p = sin. DBE : sin. BDE.\n\n86. Cor. 1. When the line joining the pulleys is horizontal, as AC, then P : p = FC : FA, for FC and FA are evidently the sines of the angles DBE, BDE.\n\n87. Cor. 2. Any of the powers is to the weight, as the sine of the angle which the other makes with the direction of the weight, is to the sine of the angles which the powers make with one another. For since DB represents the weight, and BE the power P, we have BE : BD = sin. BDE : sin. BED; but on account of the parallels DE, AB, the angle DEB = ABC, the angle made by the direction of the powers, consequently BE : BD, that is, p : W = sin. ABF : sin. ABC. In the same way it may be shown that P : W = sin. CBF : sin. ABC. Hence we have P + p : W = sin. CBF + sin. ABF : sin. ABC, that is the sum of the powers is to the weight, as the sum of the sines of the angles which the powers make with the direction of the weight is to the sine of the angle which the powers make with one another.\n\n88. Cor. 3. The two powers P, p, are also directly proportional to the cosecants of the angles formed by the direction of the powers with the direction of the weight. For since P : p = sin. DBE : sin. BDF, and by the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a>, sin. DBF : sin. DBE = cosec. DBE : cosec. DBE, we have P : p = cosec. ABF : cosec. CBF. It is also obvious that P : p as the secants of the angles which these powers form with the horizon, since the angles which they make with the horizon are the complements of the angles which they form with the direction of the weight, and the cosecant of any angle is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECANT\">secant</a> of its complement, therefore P : p = sec. BAF : sec. BCF.\n\nChap. II. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOUND\">Compound</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">Machines</a>.\n\n89. Definition. Compound machines are those which are composed of two or more simple machines, either of the same or of different kinds. The number of compound machines is unlimited, but those which properly belong to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>, are, 1. The wheel and axle; 2. The pulley; 3. The wedge; 4. The screw; and, 5. The balance.\n\nSect. I. On the Wheel and Axle.\n\n90. The wheel and axle, or the axis in peritrochio, Fig. 10, is represented in fig. 9, and consists of a wheel AB, and cylinder CD, having the same axis, and moving upon pivots E, F placed at the extremity of the cylinder. The power P is most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> applied to the circumference of the wheel, and acts in the direction of the tangent, while the weight W is elevated by a rope which coils round the cylinder CD in a plane perpendicular to its axis.\u2014In this machine a winch or handle EH is sometimes substituted instead of the wheel, and sometimes the power is applied to the levers S, S fixed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> of the wheel; but in all these forms the principle of the machine remains unaltered.\u2014That the wheel and axle is an assemblage of levers will be obvious, by considering that the very same effect would be produced if a number of levers were to ra-\nTheory. diate from the centre C, and if a rope carrying the power P were to pass over their extremities, and extricate itself from the descending levers when they come into a horizontal position.\n\n91. Axiom. The effect of the power to turn the cylinder round its axis, is the same at whatever point in the axle it is fixed.\n\nProp. I.\n\n92. In the wheel and axle the power and weight will be in equilibrium, when they are to one another reciprocally as the radii of the circles to which they are applied, or when the power is to the weight as the radius of the axle is to the radius of the wheel.\n\nLet AD be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the wheel, and BE a section of the axle or cylinder, and let the power P and weight W act in the directions AP, WP, tangents to the circumferences of the axle and wheel in the points A, B, by means of ropes winding round these circumferences. As the effect is the same according to the axiom, let the power and weight act in the same plane as they appear to do in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, then it is obvious that the effort of the power P and weight W will be the same as if they were suspended at the points A, B; consequently the machine may be regarded as a lever AFB, whose centre of motion is F. But since the directions of the power and weight make equal angles with the arms of the lever, we have (Art. 36.) \\( P : W = FB : FA \\), that is, the power is to the weight as the radius of the axle is to the radius of the wheel.\n\nCorollaries.\n\n93. Cor. 1. If the power and weight act obliquely to the arms of the lever in the directions A p, B w, draw F m Fn perpendicular to A p and B w, and as in the case of the lever (Art. 51.) there will be an equilibrium when \\( P : W = F n : F m \\). Hence the tangential direction is the most advantageous one in which the power can be applied, for FA is always greater than F m, and the least advantageous direction in which the weight can be applied, for it then opposes the greatest resistance to the power.\n\n94. Cor. 2. If the plane of the wheel is inclined to the axle at any angle \\( x \\), there will be an equilibrium when \\( P : W = \\text{semidiameter of the axle} : \\sin x \\).\n\n95. Cor. 3. When the thickness of the rope is of a sensible magnitude, there will be an equilibrium when the power is to the weight as the sum of the radius of the axle, and half the thickness of its rope, is to the sum of the radius of the wheel and half the thickness of its rope; that is, if T be the thickness of the rope of the wheel, and t the thickness of the rope of the axle, there will be an equilibrium when \\( P : W = FB + \\frac{t}{2} : FA + \\frac{T}{2} \\).\n\n96. Cor. 4. If a number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> and axles are so combined that the periphery of the first axle may act on the periphery of the second wheel, either by means of a string or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> fixed in the peripheries of each, and the periphery of the second axle on the periphery of the third wheel, there will be an equilibrium when the power is to the weight as the product of the radii of all the axles is to the product of the radii of all the wheels. This corollary may be demonstrated by the some reasoning which is used in Art. 63. for the combination of Levers.\n\n97. Cor. 5. In a combination of wheels, where the motion is communicated by means of teeth, the axle is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a>. Since the teeth therefore must be nearly of the same size, both in the wheel and pinion, the number of teeth in each will be as their circumferences, or as their radii; and consequently in the combination mentioned in the preceding corollary, the power will be to the weight, in the case of an equilibrium, as to the product of the number of teeth in all the pinions is to the product of the number of teeth in all the wheels.\n\nProp. II.\n\n98. In the wheel and axle the velocity of the weight is to the velocity of the power as the power is to the weight.\n\nIf the power is made to rise through a space equal to the circumference of the wheel, the weight will evidently describe a space equal to the circumference of the axle. Hence, calling V the velocity of the power, v that of the weight, C the circumference of the wheel, and c that of the axle, we have \\( V : v = C : c \\). But by the proposition \\( P : W = c : C \\) therefore \\( P : W = v : V \\).\n\nScholium.\n\n99. The construction of the main-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> box of the fusee of a watch round which the chain is coiled, is a beautiful illustration of the principle of the wheel and axle. The spring-box may be considered as the wheel, and the fusee the axle or pinion to which the chain communicates the motion of the box. The power resides in the spring wound round an axis in the centre of the box, and the weight is applied to the lower circumference of the fusee. As the force of the spring is greatest when it is newly wound up, and gradually decreases as it unwinds itself, it is necessary that the fusee should have different radii, so that the chain may act upon the smallest part of the fusee when its force is greatest, and upon the largest part of the fusee when its force is least, for the equable motion of the watch requires that the inequality in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the spring should be counteracted so as to produce an uniform effect. In order to accomplish this, the general outline of the surface of the fusee must be an Apollonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPERBOLA\">hyperbola</a>, in which the ordinates are inversely as their respective abscissae. For further information on this subject, see Recherches des Mathemat. par M. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARENT\">Parent</a>, tom. ii. p. 678.; Trait\u00e9 d'Horlogerie, par M. Berthoud, tom. i. chap. 26.; and Trait\u00e9 de M\u00e9canique, par M. de la Hire, prop. 72.\n\nSect. II. On the Pulley.\n\n100. Definition.\u2014The pulley is a machine composed of a wheel with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> in its circumference, pulley, and a rope which passes round this groove. The wheel moves on an axis whose extremities are supported on a kind of frame called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a>, to which is generally suspended the weight to be raised. A system of pulleys is called a muffle, which is either fixed or moveable according as the block which contains the pulley is fixed or moveable.\n101. In a single pulley, or system of pulleys where the different portions of the rope are parallel to each other, and where one extremity of it is fixed, there is an equilibrium when the power is to the weight as unity is to the number of the portions of the rope which support the weight.\n\n102. Case 1. In the single fixed pulley AA let the power P and weight W be equal, and act against each other by means of the rope PBAW, passing over the pulley AA; then it is obvious that whatever force is exerted by P in the direction PBA, the same force must be exerted in the opposite direction WBA, consequently these equal and opposite forces must be in equilibrium; and as the weight is supported only by one rope, the proposition is demonstrated, for \\( P : W = 1 : 1 \\).\n\n103. Case 2. In the single moveable pulley, where the rope, fastened at H, goes beneath the moveable pulley D and over the fixed pulley C, the weight to be raised is suspended from the centre of the pulley D by the block p, and the power is applied at P in the direction PE. Now it is evident that the portions CFp, HGD of the rope sustain the weight W, and as they are equally stretched in every point, each must sustain one half of W; but (Case 1,) in the single pulley C the rope CEP sustains a weight equal to what the rope CFp sustains; that is, it sustains one-half of W. Consequently \\( P = \\frac{1}{2} W \\), or \\( W = 2P \\), when there is an equilibrium; and since the weight W is supported by two strings, we have \\( P : W = 1 : 2 \\).\n\n104. Case 3. When the same rope passes round a number of pulleys, the ropes which support the weight W are evidently equally stretched in every part, and therefore each of them sustains the same weight. Consequently if there be ten ropes supporting the weight, each sustains \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th part of the weight, and therefore \\( P = \\frac{1}{10} W \\), or \\( W = 10P \\), which gives us \\( P : W = 1 : 10 \\). \u2014The pulley in fig. 15. is the patent pulley invented by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">White</a>, in which the lateral friction and shaking motion is considerably removed.\n\nProposition II.\n\n105. In a system of n moveable pulleys suspended by separate and parallel ropes, there is an equilibrium when \\( P : W = 1 : 2^n \\); that is, if there are 4 pulleys \\( n = 4 \\), and \\( P : W = 1 : 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\), or \\( P : W = 1 : 16 \\).\n\nThis system is represented in fig. 17. where the rope which carries the power P passes over the fixed pulley M, and beneath the moveable pulley A, to the hook F, where it is fixed. Another rope fixed at A passes over B and is fixed at F, and so on with the rest. Then by Art. 103.\n\n\\[\nP : \\text{the weight at } A = 1 : 2 \\\\\n\\text{The weight at } A : \\text{the weight at } B = 1 : 2 \\\\\n\\text{The weight at } B : \\text{the weight at } C = 1 : 2 \\\\\n\\text{The weight at } C : \\text{the weight at } D \\text{ or } W = 1 : 2 ; \\text{ and therefore by composition} \\\\\nP : W = 1 : 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\text{ or } P : W = 1 : 16. Q. E. D.\n\\]\n\nProposition III.\n\n106. In a system of moveable pulleys whose number is n, suspended by separate and parallel ropes, whose extremities are fixed to the weight W, there is an equilibrium when \\( P : W = 1 : 2^n - 1 \\).\n\nIn this system of pulleys, the rope which sustains the power P passes over the pulley C, and is fixed to the weight at D. Another rope attached to the pulley C passes over the pulley B and is fixed to the weight at E, and a third rope fastened to B passes over A and is fixed at F. Then it is manifest that the rope CD sustains a weight equal to P; and since the pulley C is pulled downward with a weight equal to \\( 2P \\), the rope BC must support a weight equal to \\( 2P \\), and the rope B the same weight; consequently the rope AB sustains \\( 4P \\). The whole weight therefore is \\( P + 2P + 4P \\), and hence \\( P : W = P + 2P + 4P \\), or \\( P : W = 1 : 1 + 2 + 4 \\&c. \\text{ to } n \\text{ terms, so that } P : W = 1 : 2^n - 1 \\).\n\nProposition IV.\n\n107. In the system of pulleys represented in fig. 19. fig. 19. and called a Spanish barton, in which two pulleys are supported by one rope, there is an equilibrium when \\( P : W = 1 : 4 \\).\n\nIn this combination of pulleys, the rope AB which supports the power P passes over the moveable pulley A, and beneath C towards H, where it is fixed. Another rope, attached to the pulley A, passes over the fixed pulley B, and is fastened at E to the pulley C, which supports the weight W. Then, since the rope AP supports 1 pound, the rope AC also supports 1 pound, and therefore the pulley A, or the rope BA, is pulled down with a force of 2 pounds. But the rope BDE is equally stretched with BA, consequently the pulley C, to which DE is attached, is pulled upwards with a force of 2 pounds. Now the rope AC supporting 1 pound, the rope GH must likewise support 1 pound, consequently, since DE sustains 2 pounds, AC 1 pound, and HG 1 pound, they will together sustain W = 4 pounds, and therefore \\( P : W = 1 : 4 \\).\n\nProposition V.\n\n108. In the system of pulleys represented in fig. Fig. 20. 20. called a Spanish barton, where two pulleys are supported by one rope, there is an equilibrium when \\( P : W = 1 : 5 \\).\n\nIn this system the rope PB passes over B round C, and is fixed at E. Another rope attached to B passes round AF and is fixed at I to the pulley CD, which carries the weight W. Now the rope BP being stretched with a force of 1 pound, the ropes BGC, CDE are also stretched with a force of 1 pound each, and the pulley CD is pulled upwards with a force of 2 pounds. But since the three ropes BP, ED, and GC, are each stretched with a force of 1 pound, the pulley B and the rope BA, upon which they all act in one direction, must be pulled down with a force of 3 pounds. Now the rope FI is equally stretched with BA, consequently it will draw the pulley CD upwards with a force of 3 pounds,\npounds, and since it is drawn upwards by the ropes \\( CG, DF \\), with a force of two pounds, the whole force will sustain \\( W = 5 \\) pounds; but this force of 5 pounds is by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> in equilibrium with \\( P \\) or 1 pound, consequently \\( P : W = 1 : 5 \\).\n\n**Prop. VI.**\n\n109. When the ropes are not parallel, and when two powers are in equilibrium with a weight by means of a pulley, and have their directions at equal angles to the direction of the weight, each of these powers is to the weight as the radius of the pulley is to the chord of that portion of the pulley's circumference with which the rope is in contact.\n\nLet the weight \\( W \\) suspended from \\( C \\) be sustained in equilibrium by two powers, \\( P, p \\), which act by a rope \\( PCFE_p \\) passing over the pulley \\( CHEF \\), and touching the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> \\( CFE \\) of its circumference. Then since the angles \\( PWD, pWD \\) are equal, and the powers \\( P, p \\) in equilibrium, \\( P \\) must be equal to \\( p \\); and making \\( WA = WB \\), and drawing \\( AI \\) parallel to \\( PW \\), and \\( BI \\) parallel to \\( pW \\); \\( WB, BI, WI \\) will respectively represent the forces \\( P, p, W \\) or \\( P : W = WB : BI : WI \\). Dynamics, Art. 144. Now the triangles \\( WBBI, BDE \\) having their respective sides at right angles to each other, are similar; consequently \\( WB : BI : WI = CD : DE : EC \\), that is, \\( P : p : W = CD : DE : EC \\); but \\( CD, DE \\) are equal to radius, and \\( EC \\) is obviously the chord of the arch \\( CFE \\), therefore \\( P : W = p : W \\) as radius is to the chord of the arch with which the rope is in contact.\n\n110. Cor. 1. Any of the powers is also to the weight as radius is to twice the cosine of the angle which either rope makes with the direction of the weight. For since \\( CG \\) is the cosine of \\( DCG \\), and since \\( CE \\) is double of \\( CG \\), \\( CE \\) is equal to \\( 2 \\cosine DCG = 2 \\cosine PWD \\); but \\( P : W = CD : CE \\), hence we have by substituting the preceding value of \\( CE \\), \\( P : W = CD \\) or radius \\( : 2 \\cosine PWD \\).\n\n**Scholium.**\n\n111. By means of this proposition and corollary, the proportion between the powers and the weight in the various systems of pulleys, represented in figs. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, when the ropes are not parallel, may be easily found.\n\n**Prop. VII.**\n\n112. In a system of moveable pulleys, where each has a separate rope, and where the ropes are not parallel, there is an equilibrium when the power is to the weight as radius is to the cosines of half the angles made by the rope of each pulley, multiplied into that power of 2 whose exponent is the number of pulleys.\n\nLet the power \\( P \\) sustain the weight \\( W \\) by means of the pulleys \\( A, B, C \\); let \\( P, p, \\pi \\) be the different powers which support the pulleys, \\( A, B, C \\), and let \\( MAP, NBA, RCB \\) be the angles formed by the ropes. Then, by the last proposition,\n\n\\[\nP : p = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\cosine MAP \\\\\np : \\pi = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\cosine NBA \\\\\n\\pi : W = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\cosine RCB, \\quad \\text{consequently}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP : W = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\cosine MAP \\times 2 \\cosine NBA \\times 2 \\cosine RCB,\n\\]\n\nor, which is the same thing,\n\n\\[\nP : W = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times \\cosine MAP \\times \\cosine NBA \\times \\cosine RCB.\n\\]\n\n**Prop. VIII.**\n\n113. In a single pulley, or in a combination of pulleys, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the weight is to the power.\n\n114. Case 1. In the single fixed pulley, it is obvious, that if the weight \\( W \\) is raised uniformly one inch, the power \\( D \\) will also describe one inch, consequently velocity of \\( P : \\) velocity of \\( W = W : P \\).\n\n115. Case 2. In the single moveable pulley, when the weight \\( W \\) is raised one inch, the ropes become one inch shorter; and since the rope has always the same weight, the power must describe two inches, therefore velocity \\( P : \\) velocity \\( W = W : P \\).\n\n116. Case 3. In the combination of pulleys, in Figs. 14, 15, 16, when the weight rises one inch, each of the four strings becomes an inch shorter, so that \\( P \\) must describe four inches, as the length of the rope is invariably; consequently velocity \\( P : \\) velocity \\( W = W : P \\).\n\n117. Case 4. In the system exhibited in fig. 17, it is evident, that when the weight \\( W \\) rises one inch, the rope \\( DC \\) is lengthened two inches, the rope \\( CB \\) four inches, the rope \\( BA \\) eight inches, and the rope \\( AFP \\), to which the power is suspended, 16 inches; so that since the power of this pulley is as 16 to 1, we have velocity \\( P : \\) velocity \\( W = W : P \\).\n\n118. Case 5. In the combination of pulleys, represented in fig. 18, when the weight \\( W \\) rises one inch, all the three ropes \\( CD, BE, AF \\) are each shortened one inch. But while \\( CD \\) shortens one inch, \\( CP \\) becomes one inch longer; while \\( BE \\) shortens one inch, \\( BC \\) becomes one inch longer, and \\( CP \\) two inches longer (art. 110.); and while \\( AF \\) shortens one inch, \\( AB \\) becomes one inch longer, \\( BC \\) two inches longer, and \\( CP \\) four inches longer; therefore \\( CP \\) is lengthened altogether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> inches, and as the power of the pulley is as 7 to 1, we have, as before, velocity \\( P : \\) velocity \\( W = W : P \\).\n\n119. Case 6. In the system of pulleys called the Spanish barton, fig. 19, when the weight \\( W \\) rises one inch, the three ropes \\( AC, DE, HG \\) are each shortened one inch. By the shortening \\( HG, CA \\) one inch each, the rope \\( AP \\) is lengthened two inches; and by the shortening of \\( DE \\) one inch, \\( BA \\) is lengthened one inch, and \\( AP \\) two inches (art. 115.); consequently since \\( AP \\) is lengthened in all four inches, and since the power of the pulleys is four, we have velocity \\( P : \\) velocity \\( W = W : P \\).\n\n120. Case 7. In the other Spanish barton, in fig. 20, when the weight is elevated one inch, the three ropes \\( DE, IF, CG \\) are each one inch shorter. While \\( ED, \\) and \\( CG \\) shorten one inch each, \\( BP \\) is lengthened two inches,\nMechanics.\n\nTheory. inches, and while IF becomes one inch shorter; AB becomes one inch longer; but when AB is lengthened one inch, BP becomes one inch longer, and ED, CG one inch shorter each, and by this shortening of ED, CG, the rope B is lengthened two inches, therefore, since the rope BP is lengthened altogether five inches, and since the pulleys have a power of five, we have, as formerly, velocity P : velocity W = W : P.\n\nSect. III. On the Wedge.\n\n121. Definition. A wedge is a machine composed of two inclined planes with their bases in contact; or, more properly, it is a triangular prism, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the motion of a triangle, parallel to itself, along a straight line passing through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> of one of its angles. The wedge is called isosceles, rectangular, or scalene, according as the triangle ABC by which the wedge is generated, is an isosceles, a rectangular or a scalene triangle. The part AB is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> or back of the wedge, DC its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a>, and AC, BC its faces.\u2014The wedge is generally employed for cleaving wood, or for quarrying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>; but all cutting instruments, such as knives, swords, chisels, teeth, &c., properly belong to this mechanical power, when they act in a direction at right angles to the cutting surface; for when they act obliquely, in which case their power is increased, their operation resembles more the action of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>.\n\nProp. I.\n\n122. If each of the faces of an isosceles wedge, which are perfectly smooth, meet with an equal resistance from forces acting at equal angles of inclination to their faces, and if a power act perpendicularly upon the back, these forces will be in equilibrio, when the power upon the back is to the sum of the resistances upon the sides, as the sine of half the angle of the wedge, multiplied by the sine of the angle at which the resisting forces act upon its faces, is to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of radius.\n\nLet ABC be the wedge, AC, BC its acting faces, and MD, ND the directions in which the resisting forces act upon these faces, forming with them the equal angles DMA, DNB. Draw CD, DF, DE at right angles to three sides of the wedge, and join F, E meeting CD in G. On account of the equal triangles CAD, CDB (Euclid, Book i. Prop. 26.) AD = DB; and in the equal triangles ADM, BDN, MD = ND. In the same way DF = DE and AF = BE, therefore CF = CE. But in the triangles CFG, CEG there are two sides FC, CG equal to EC, CG, and the angle FCG = ECG, consequently FG = GE, and FGC, ABC are both right angles, therefore FE is parallel to AB.\u2014Now the force MD is resolvable into DF, FM, of which FM has no effect upon the wedge. But, as the effective force FD is not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> opposition to the perpendicular force exerted on the back of the wedge, we may resolve it into the two forces FG, GD, of which GD acts in direct opposition to the power, while FG acts in a direction parallel to the back of the wedge. In the same way it may be shewn that EG, GD are the only effective forces which result from the force ND. But the forces FG, EG being equal and opposite, destroy each other; consequently 2GD is the force which opposes that which is exerted upon the back of the wedge, and the wedge will be kept at rest if the force upon the back is equal to 2GD, that is, when the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances upon the faces as 2GD is to MD + ND, or as 2GD : 2DM, or as GD is to DM. Now\n\n\\[ DG : DF = \\sin DFG : \\text{radius}, \\text{or as } (\\text{Euclid, vi. 8.}) \\]\n\\[ \\sin DCF : \\text{radius, and} \\]\n\\[ DF : MD = \\sin DMF : \\text{radius}; \\text{therefore by composition,} \\]\n\\[ DG : MD = \\sin DCF \\times \\sin DMF : \\text{rad.} \\times \\text{rad.} \\text{or rad.}^2. \\text{But, } DG : MD \\text{ as the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances, therefore the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances, as } \\sin DCF \\times \\sin DMF \\text{ is to the square of the radius.} \\]\n\n123. Cor. 1. If the direction of the resisting forces is perpendicular to the faces of the wedge, DMF becomes a right angle, and therefore its sine is equal to radius. Consequently we have, in this case, the force upon the back to the sum of the resistances, as sin DCF \u00d7 rad. is to radius\u00b2, that is, as sin DCF is to radius, or as AD half the back of the wedge is to AC the length of the wedge.\n\n124. Cor. 2. In the particular case in the proposition, it is obvious that the forces MF, NE are not opposed by any other forces, and therefore the force upon the back will not sustain the resisting forces; but in the case in cor. 2. the forces MF, NE vanish, and therefore the other forces will sustain each other.\n\n125. Cor. 3. If the resisting forces act in a direction perpendicular to AB, the angle DMF becomes equal to ACD, and therefore the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances as sin ACD\u00b2 is to radius\u00b2, that is, as the square of AD half the back of the wedge is to the square of AC the length of the wedge.\n\n126. Cor. 4. When the direction of the resistances is parallel to the back of the wedge, the angle of inclination DMC becomes the complement of the semi-angle of the wedge, and therefore the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances as sin ACD \u00d7 cos ACD is to the square of the radius, that is, as DA \u00d7 DC is to AC\u00b2. But in the similar triangles DAF, DAC, we have DF : DA = DC : AC, and DF \u00d7 AC = DA \u00d7 DC, consequently the force upon the back of the wedge is to the sum of the resistances as DF \u00d7 AC is to AC\u00b2, that is, as DF : AC.\n\nProp. II.\n\n127. If, on account of the friction of the wedge, or any other cause, the resistances are wholly effective, that is, if the resisting surfaces adhere to the places to which they are applied without sliding, there will be an equilibrium, when the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances, as the sine of the acute angle which the direction of the resisting forces makes with the back of the wedge is to radius.\n\nJoin MN, which will cut DC perpendicularly at the point\npoint H. Then, since the forces MD, ND are resolvable into MH, HD and into NH, HD, and since MII, HN destroy each other, the force upon the back is sustained by 2 HD. Consequently, the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances as 2 HD is to 2 MD, or as HD is to MD. But the angle ADM, which the direction of the forces makes with the back of the wedge, is equal to DMN, and HD is the sine of that angle, MD being radius, therefore the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances as sin. ADM : radius.\n\nQ. E. D.\n\nCorollaries.\n\n128. Cor. 1. Since the angle AMD = MDC + MCD, the angle MDC is the difference between MCD the semiangle of the wedge, and AMD the angle which the direction of the resisting forces makes with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the wedge, and since HD is the cosine of that angle, MD being radius, we have the force upon the back to the sum of the resistances, as the cosine of the difference between the semiangle of the wedge and the angle which the direction of the resisting forces makes with the face of the wedge, is to radius.\n\nProp. III.\n\n129. When there is an equilibrium between three forces acting perpendicularly upon the sides of a wedge of any form, the forces are to one another as the sides of the wedge.\n\nThis is obvious from Dynamics, \u00a7 144. Cor. 2, where it is shown that when three forces are in equilibrium, they are proportional to the sides of a triangle, which are respectively perpendicular to their directions.\n\nProp. IV.\n\n130. When the power acting upon the back of a wedge is in equilibrium with the resistances opposed to it, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the resistance as the resistance is to the power.\n\nProduce DM to K, and draw CK perpendicular to DK. Then, by Art. 122, the power is to the resistance as MD : DH. Let the wedge be moved uniformly from D to C, and DK is the space uniformly described by the resisting force in the direction in which it acts; therefore, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the resistance as DC : DK; that is, on account of the equiangular triangles DHM, DKC, as MD : DH; that is, as the resistance is to the power.\n\nSect. IV. On the Screw.\n\n131. Definition. A screw is a cylinder with an inclined plane wrapped round it, in such a manner, that the surface of the plane is oblique to the axis of the cylinder, and forms the same angle with it in every part of the cylindrical surface. When the inclined plane winds round the exterior surface of a solid cylinder, it is called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MALE\">male</a> screw; but when it is fixed on the interior circumference of a cylindrical tube, it is called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> screw. In the female screw, the spiral grooves formed by the inclined plane on the surface of the cylindrical tube, must be equal in breadth to the inclined plane in the male screw, in order that the one may move freely in the other. By attending to the mode in which the spiral threads are formed by the circumvolution of the inclined plane, it will appear, that if one complete revolution of the inclined plane is developed, its altitude will be to its base as the distance between the threads is to the circumference of the screw.\n\nThus, let a b c (fig. 4.) be the inclined plane, whose Fig. 4 base is ac and altitude bc, and let it be wrapped round the cylinder MN (fig. 5.) of such a size that the points a, c may coincide. The surface ab of the plane (fig. 4.) will evidently form the spiral thread <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADEB\">adeb</a> (fig. 5.), and ab the distance between the threads will be equal to bc (fig. 4.) the altitude of the plane, and the circumference of the screw MN will be equal to ac the base of the plane. If any body, therefore, is made to rise along the plane adeb in fig. 5. or along the spiral thread of the screw, by a force acting in a direction parallel to adeb, there will be the same proportion between the power and the resistance as if the body ascended the plane abc (fig. 4.).\n\n132. A male screw with triangular threads is represented by AB (fig. 6.), and its corresponding female screw by AB (fig. 7.). A male screw with quadrangular threads is exhibited in fig. 8. and the female screw in which it works in fig. 9. The friction is considerably less in quadrangular than in triangular threads, though, when the screw is made of wood, the triangular threads should be preferred. When the screws are metallic and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, the threads should be quadrangular; but the triangular form is preferable in small screws. When the screw is employed in practice, the power is always applied to the extremity of a lever fixed in its head. This is shown in fig. 10. where AB is the lever acting upon the screw BC, which works in a female screw in the block F, and exerts its force in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> the spring CD.\n\nProp. I.\n\n133. If the screw is employed to overcome any resistance, there will be an equilibrium when the power is to the resistance as the distance between two adjacent threads is to the circumference described by the power.\n\nLet FAK be a section of the screw represented in fig. Fig. 11. 8, perpendicular to its axis; CD a portion of the inclined plane which forms the spiral thread, and P the power, which, when applied at C in the plane ACF, will be in equilibrium with a weight upon the inclined plane CD. Then, in the inclined plane, when the direction of the power is parallel to the base, we have (Art. 72.) P : W, as the altitude of the plane is to the base, or (Art. 131.) as the distance between two threads is to the whole circumference FKCF. If we suppose another power P' to act at the end of the lever AB, and describe the arch HBG, and that this power produces the same effect at B as the power P did at C, then (Art. 36.), we have P' : CA = BA, that is, as FKCF is to the circumference HBG; but it was shown before, that P : W = as the distance between two contiguous threads is to FKCF; therefore, by composition, P' : W as the distance between two threads is to HBG or the circumference of a circle whose radius is AB. Q. E. D.\n\n134. Cor. 1. It is evident from the proposition that\nthe power does not in the least depend upon the size of the cylinder FCK, but that it increases with the distance of that point from the centre A, to which the power is applied, and also with the shortness of the distance between the threads. Therefore, if \\( P \\) be the powers applied to two different screws, \\( D \\), \\( d \\) the distances of these powers from the axis, and \\( T \\), \\( t \\) the distances between the threads; their energy in overcoming a given resistance will be directly as their distances from the axis, and inversely as the distances of their threads, that is, \\( P : p = \\frac{D}{T} : \\frac{d}{t} \\), or \\( P \\) varies as \\( \\frac{D}{T} \\).\n\n**Prop. II.**\n\n135. In the endless screw, there will be an equilibrium when the power is to the weight, as the distance of the threads multiplied by the radius of the axle, is to the distance of the power from the axis of the screw multiplied by the radius of the wheel.\n\nThe endless screw, which is represented in fig. 12, consists of a screw EF, so combined with the wheel and axle ABC, that the threads of the screw may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> in teeth fixed in the periphery of the wheel, and thus communicate the power exerted at the handles or winches \\( P \\), \\( p \\). Let \\( W' \\) represent the power produced by the screw at the circumference of the wheel; then, by the last proposition, \\( P : W' \\) as the distance between the threads is to the distance of \\( P \\) from the axis of the screw; but (Art. 92.) in the wheel and axle \\( W : W \\) as the radius of the axle is to the radius of the wheel; therefore, by composition, \\( P : W \\) as the distances of the threads multiplied by the radius of the axle \\( C \\), is to the distance of the power \\( P \\) from the axis multiplied by the radius of the wheel \\( AB \\).\n\n**Prop. III.**\n\n136. When there is an equilibrium in the screw, the velocity of the weight is to the velocity of the power, as the power is to the weight.\n\nIt is obvious from fig. 11, that while the power describes the circumference of the circle HBG uniformly, the weight uniformly rises through a space equal to the distance between two adjacent threads; therefore, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the distance between the threads is to the arch described by the power, that is, (by Art. 133.), as the weight is to the power.\n\n**Prop. IV.**\n\n137. To explain the construction and advantages of Mr Hunter's double screw*.\n\nLet the screw CD work in the plate of metal BA, and have \\( n \\) threads in an inch: the cylinder CD, of which this screw is formed, is a hollow tube, which is also formed into a screw, having \\( n+1 \\) threads in an inch, and into this female screw is introduced a male screw DE, having, of course, \\( n+1 \\) threads in an inch. The screw DE is prevented from moving round with CD by the frame ABGF and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> \\( ab \\), but is permitted to ascend and descend without a motion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a>. Then, by a revolution of the screw CD, the other screw DE will rise through a space equal to \\( \\frac{1}{n+1} \\times n \\), and if the circumference described by the lever CK be \\( m \\) inches, we shall have \\( P : W = \\frac{1}{n+1} : \\frac{m}{n+1} \\times n \\); or \\( P : W = 1 : m \\times n + 1 \\).\n\n138. This reasoning will be more perspicuous by supposing \\( n \\), or the number of threads in CD, to be 12, and \\( n+1 \\), or the number of threads in DE, will consequently be 13. Let us suppose that the handle CK is turned round 12 times, the screw CD will evidently ascend through the space of an inch, and if the screw DE is permitted to have a motion of rotation along with CD, it will also advance an inch. Let the screw DE be now moved backwards by 12 revolutions, it will evidently describe a space of \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) of an inch, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of both these motions will be that the point E is advanced \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) of an inch. But, since DE is prevented from moving round with CD, the same effect will be produced as if it had moved 12 times round with CD, and had been turned 12 times backwards; that is, it will in both cases have advanced \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) of an inch. Since, therefore, it has advanced \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) of an inch in 12 turns, it will describe only \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\), or \\( \\frac{1}{144} \\) of an inch uniformly at one turn; but if the length of the lever CK is 8 inches, its extremity K will describe, in the same time, a space equal to \\( 16 \\times 3.1416 = 50.2656 \\) inches, the circumference of the circle described by K; therefore the velocity of the weight is to the velocity of the power, as \\( \\frac{1}{144} \\) of an inch is to 50.2656 inches, or as 1 is to 7841.4336, that is, (Art. 136.) \\( P : W = 1 : 7841.4336 \\). Hence the force of this double screw is much greater than that of the common screw, for a common one with a lever 8 inches long must have 156 threads in an inch to give the same power, which would render it too weak to overcome any considerable resistance.\n\n139. Mr Hunter proposes * to connect with his * Phil. Trans. vol. xi. p. 53. double screws, a wheel and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANTERN\">lantern</a>, which are put in motion by a winch or handle. The power of this compound machine is so great, that a man, by exerting a force of 32 pounds at the winch, will produce an effect of 172100 pounds; and if we suppose \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of this effect to be destroyed by friction, there will remain an effect of 57600 pounds.\u2014In some screws it would be advantageous, instead of perforating the male screw CD, to have two cylindrical screws of different kinds at different points of the same axis.\n\n**Scholium.**\n\n140. The screw is of extensive use as a mechanical power, when a very great pressure is required, and is very successfully employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> press. In the press which is used for coining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, the power of the screw is advantageously combined with an impulsive force, which is conveyed to the screw by the intervention of a lever. The screw is also employed for raising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, in which form it is called the screw of Archimedes (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRODYNAMICS\">Hydrodynamics</a>, \u00a7 328); and it has been lately employed in the flour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> for pushing the flour which comes from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLSTONES\">millstones</a>, to the end of a long trough, from which it is conveyed to other parts.\nMechanics.\n\nTheory of the machinery, in order to undergo the remaining processes. In this case, the spiral threads are very large in proportion to the cylinder on which they are fixed.\n\n141. As the lever attached to the extremity of the screw moves through a very great space when compared with the velocity of its other extremity, or of any body which it puts in motion; the screw is of immense use in subdividing any space into a great number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> parts. Hence it is employed in the engines for dividing mathematical instruments, and in those which have been recently used in the art of engraving. It is likewise of great use in the common wire micrometer, and in the divided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>-glass micrometer, instruments to which the science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> has been under great obligations. See Micrometer.\n\nSect. V. On the Balance.\n\nPlate CCCXX. Fig. 1.\n\n142. Definition. The balance, in a mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, is a lever of equal arms, for determining the weights of bodies.\u2014The physical balance is represented in fig. 1, where FA, FB are the equal arms of the balance, F its centre of motion situated a little above the centre of gravity of the arms, FD the handle which always retains a vertical position, P, W the scales suspended from the points A, B, and CF the tongue or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> of the balance, which is exactly perpendicular to the beam AB, and is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> below the centre of motion, so that the momentum of the part below F is equal and opposite to the momentum of that part which is above it. Since the handle FD, suspended by the hook H, must hang in a vertical line, the tongue CF will also be vertical when its position coincides with that of FD, and consequently the beam AB, which is perpendicular to CF, must be horizontal. When this happens, the weights in the scale are evidently equal.\n\nProp. I.\n\n143. To determine the conditions of equilibrium in a physical balance.\n\nLet AOB be the beam, whose weight is S, and let Fig. 2. P, Q be equal weights expressed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> p, and placed in the scales, whose weights are L and l. Let O be the centre of motion, and g the centre of gravity of the whole beam, when unloaded; we shall have in the case of an equilibrium,\n\nI. \\( p + L \\times AC = p + l \\times BC + S \\times Cc \\); for since S is the weight of the beam and g its centre of gravity, its mechanical energy in acting against the weights \\( p + L \\) is \\( S \\times Cc \\), the distance of its centre of gravity from the vertical line passing through the centre of motion O.\n\nII. But since \\( AC = BC \\); \\( p \\times AC - p \\times BC = 0 \\). Then, after transposition, take this from the equation in No. I. and we shall have,\n\nIII. \\( l \\times BC - L \\times AC + S \\times Cc \\); or \\( L - l = \\frac{S \\times Cc}{AC} \\).\n\nLet us now suppose that a small weight w is placed in the scale L, the line AB which joins the points of suspension will be no longer horizontal, but will assume an inclined position. Let \\( BA = \\phi \\) be the angle which the beam makes with the direction of gravity. Then by resolving the weight of the beam which acts in the direction O x, the parts \\( \\frac{OG}{Og} \\) and \\( \\frac{Gg}{Og} \\) will be in equilibrio, and we shall have,\n\nIV. \\( p + L \\times AO \\times \\sin.\\lambda AO + S \\times OG \\times \\sin.\\phi = p + l + w \\times BO \\times \\sin.<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABO\">ABO</a> + S \\times Cc \\times \\cos.\\phi \\).\n\nBut since the sines and cosines of any angles, are the same as the sines and cosines of their supplement, we have,\n\nV. \\( p + L \\times AC \\times \\cos.\\phi = OC \\times \\sin.\\phi + S \\times OG \\times \\sin.\\phi = p + l + w \\times AC \\times \\cos.\\phi + OC \\times \\sin.\\phi + S \\times Cc \\times \\cos.\\phi \\).\n\nHence by No. III. we have,\n\nVI. Tang. \\( \\phi = \\frac{w \\times AC}{2p + L + l + w \\times OC + S \\times OG} \\).\n\nBut the force v, with which the balance attempts to recover its horizontal situation, is the excess of momenta with which one arm is moved, above the momenta with which the other arm is moved, therefore\n\n\\[ v = 2p + L + l \\times OC \\times \\sin.\\phi + S \\times OG \\times \\sin.\\phi. \\]\n\n144. A more extended illustration of these conditions of equilibrium will be found in an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> by Euler, published in the Comment. Petropol. tom. x. p. i., and in another memoir upon the same subject by Kuhne in the Versuche der naturforchende gesellschaft in Dantzig, tom. i. p. i.\u2014See also Hennert's Cursus Matheseos applicatae, tom. i. \u00a7 123. From the preceding formulae, following practical corollaries may be deduced.\n\n145. Cor. 1. The arms of the balance must be exactly equal in length, which is known by changing the weights in the scales; for if the equilibrium continues, the arms must be equal.\n\n146. Cor. 2. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of the balance increases with the length of the arms.\n\n147. Cor. 3. If the centre of motion coincides with the point C and the centre of gravity, the balance will be in equilibrio in any position, and the smallest weight added to one of the scales will bring the beam into a horizontal position. The centre of motion, therefore, should not coincide with the centre of gravity.\n\n148. Cor. 4. If the centre of motion is in the line which joins the points of suspension, the accuracy of the balance will be increased. The excess of the weights may be easily determined by the inclination of the beam, pointed out by the tongue or index upon a circular arch fixed to the handle, or more accurately by means of two divided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> fixed near the points of suspension, on a stand independent of the balance. When the value of one of these divisions is determined experimentally, the rest are easily found, being proportional to the tangents of the inclination of the beam.\n149. Cor. 5. The sensibility of the balance will increase, the nearer that the centre of gravity approaches to the centre of motion.\n\n150. Cor. 6. If the centre of gravity is above the centre of motion, the balance is useless.\n\nScholium.\n\n151. A balance with all the properties mentioned in the preceding corollaries, has been invented by M. Kuhne, and described in the work already quoted (Art. 144.). It is so contrived that the points of suspension may be placed either above the centre of motion or below it, or in the line of its axis: the beam is furnished with an index, which points out the proportion of the weights upon a divided scale, and the friction of the axis is diminished by the application of friction wheels.\n\n152. In order to get rid of the difficulties which attend the construction of the tongue, the handle, and the arms of the balance, M. Magellan invented a very accurate and moveable one, in which there is no handle, and where one of the arms acts as a tongue. The body to be weighed and the counterpoise are placed in the same scale, so that it is of little consequence whether the arms of the balance are equal or not. In this balance the centre of motion can be moved to the smallest distance from the centre of gravity. See Journal de Physique, Jan. 1781. tom. xvii. p. 43.\n\n153. The balance invented by Ludlam, and described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1763, No. 55, depends upon Archimedes's property of the lever; which we have explained in Art 65. The angular lever AFB, in which AF = FB, is moveable round f, which is equidistant from A and B. The weight P is suspended by a thread from A, and the body W, which is to be weighed, is suspended by a thread from B. Hence it is obvious, that with different bodies the lever AFB will have different degrees of inclination, and the index or tongue LFf, which is perpendicular to AB, will form different angles ZFL, bFf with the line of direction ZFB. Now, by Art. 57, and by substituting for bB, bA the sines of the angles FbB, FbA, to which they are proportional, and also by taking instead of FbB the difference of the angles fFb, fFb, and instead of AFb, the sum of these angles, we shall have\n\n\\[ \\text{Tang.} fFb = \\frac{P - W}{P + W} \\times \\text{Tang.} \\frac{AFB}{2}, \\]\n\nwhence, by transposition, and by Geometry, Theor. VIII. Sect. IV.\n\n\\[ P + W : P - W = \\text{Tang.} \\frac{AFB}{2} : \\text{Tang.} fFb. \\]\n\nHence, when the angle formed by the arms of the balance, and the angle of aberration fFb or ZFL, are known, the weights may be found, and vice versa.\n\nChap. IV. On the centre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INERTIA\">Inertia</a>, or Gravity.\n\n154. Definition.\u2014The centre of inertia, or the centre of gravity, of any body or system of bodies, is that point upon which the body or system of bodies, when influenced only by the force of gravity, will be in equilibrium in every position. The centre of inertia of plane surfaces bounded by right lines, and also of some solids may be easily determined by the common geometry. The application of the method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUXIONS\">fluxions</a>, however, to this branch of mechanics is so simple and beautiful, that we shall also avail ourselves of its assistance. The centre of gravity has been called, by some writers, the centre of position, and by others, the centre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> distances.\n\nProp. I.\n\n155. To find the centre of inertia of any number of bodies, whatever be their position.\n\nLet ABCD be any number of bodies influenced by the force of gravity. Suppose the bodies A, B connected by the inflexible line AB considered as devoid of weight, then find a point F, so that the weight of A : the weight of B = BF : FA. The bodies A, B will therefore be in equilibrium about the point F in every position (Art. 36.), and the pressure upon F will be equal to A + B. Join FC, and find the point f, so that A + B : C = Cf : fF; the bodies A, B, C, will consequently be in equilibrium upon the point f, which will sustain a pressure equal to A + B + C. Join Df, and take the point \u03c6, so that A + B + C : D = \u03c6 : D : \u03c6f; the bodies A, B, C, D will therefore be in equilibrium about the point \u03c6, which will be their common centre of inertia, and which supports a weight equal to A + B + C + D. In the same manner we may find the centre of inertia of any system of bodies, by merely connecting the last fulcrum with the next body by an inflexible right line, and finding a new fulcrum from the magnitude of the opposite weights which it is to sustain.\n\n156. Cor. 1. If the weights of the bodies A, B, C, D be increased or diminished in a given ratio, the centre of inertia of the system will not be changed, for the positions of the points F, f, \u03c6 are determined by the relative and not by the absolute weights of the bodies.\n\n157. Cor. 2. A motion of rotation cannot be communicated to a body by means of a force acting upon its centre of inertia; for the resistances which the inertia of each particle opposes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of motion act in parallel directions, and as they are proportional to the weights of the particles, they will be in equilibrium about the centre of gravity.\n\nProp. II.\n\n158. To find the centre of inertia of any number of bodies placed in a straight line.\n\nLet A, B, C, D, E be any number of bodies whose common centre of gravity is \u03c6. In the straight line AE, take any point X. Then since all the bodies are in equilibrium about their common centre of gravity \u03c6, we have by the property of the lever (Art. 36.) A \u00d7 A\u03c6 + B \u00d7 B\u03c6 = C \u00d7 C\u03c6 + D \u00d7 D\u03c6 + E \u00d7 E\u03c6; but since X\u03c6 = XA \u00d7 A\u03c6, and X\u03c6 = XB \u00d7 B\u03c6, and so on with the rest, we have by substitution A \u00d7 X\u03c6 = XA \u00d7 B \u00d7 X\u03c6 = XB \u00d7 C \u00d7 X\u03c6 = XC \u00d7 D \u00d7 X\u03c6 = XD \u00d7 E \u00d7 X\u03c6 = XE. Hence, by multiplying and transposing, we obtain A \u00d7 X\u03c6 + B \u00d7 X\u03c6 + C \u00d7 X\u03c6 + D \u00d7 X\u03c6 + E \u00d7 X\u03c6 = A \u00d7 XA + B \u00d7 XB + C \u00d7 XC + D \u00d7 XD + E \u00d7 XE, then dividing by A + B + C + D + E, we have","sp":63,"ep":79},{"h":"DIFFICULTY OF DISCHARGING URINE","t":"Dysuria, Sauv. gen. 265.

In many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> it arises from a compression of some of the neighbouring parts; of the uterus, for instance, in a state of pregnancy. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">Or</a> it may arise from a spasmodic affection of the bladder, or rather its sphincter; or from an inflammation of these parts, or others near them.

It is not easy to say what the particular causes are which occasion the apparently earthly particles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> to run together, and form those calculous concretions which are found in different parts of the body, and especially in the organs for secreting and discharging the urine.\n\nThe gout and stone are generally supposed to have some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a>, because gouty people are for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> afflicted with the gravel. But perhaps this is in part owing to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> confinement, and to lying on the back, which people who labour under the gout are often obliged to submit to; since the want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, and this posture, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> naturally favour the stagnation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> matters in the kidneys; besides, there are many instances of people severely afflicted with the stone for the greatest part of a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, who have never had the least attack of the gout.\n\nThere is, however, good reason for believing, that some farther connection takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> between the two diseases; and when treating of the gout we have already given some account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of an ingenious anonymous author, who has endeavoured to prove, that both the one and the other depend on a peculiar acid, the concreting, lithic, or uric acid, which is always present in blood; and which may be precipitated from thence by various causes, such as the introduction of other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, or the like. When thus precipitated, he supposes it to produce the whole phenomena of both diseases. The objections we formerly stated to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of gout, do not equally militate against that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a>; and it is at least certain, from the best chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, that what are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called urinary calculi, and have been considered as entirely an earthy matter, consist principally of acid in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> state united only with a small proportion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> or mucus. We may, therefore, whether this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> be altogether well founded or not, justly view lithiasis as depending, in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, on the separation of an acid from the blood.\n\nWhatever may be the particular cause of the disposition to lithiasis, the kidneys appear to be the most likely places for particles to concrete or run together, because of the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of blood which passes through the renal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a>, and which comes immediately from the heart, fraught with various newly received matters, that have not undergone much of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the vessels, and therefore cannot as yet be supposed to be thoroughly assimilated.\n\nAnatomists who have carefully examined the kidneys in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> subject, particularly M. Bertin, inform us, that there are two sets of tubuli uriniferi; the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> directly from the extremities of the renal artery, and the other springing from that vesicular texture which is conspicuous in the kidneys.\n\nIt is in this vesicular part of the kidney that we presume the particles of the concreting matter first stagnate and coalesce: for it is hardly to be supposed, that such solid matters could be allowed to stop in the extremities of the renal arteries, since the blood, and the urine separated from it, must flow through these vessels with great degrees of force and velocity; but in the intermediate vesicle the particles may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a>, and there attracting each other, soon come to acquire sensible degrees of magnitude, and thus become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> or gravel. As long as this sand or gravel formed in the vesicular part of the kidney lies quiet, there will be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> pain or uneasiness, until the concretions become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> enough to press either on the adjoining tubuli, or on the blood-vessels; then a sense of weight, and a kind of obtuse pain in the loins, will be felt. But when the small pieces of concreting matter shall be dislodged and washed off by the force of the circulating fluids, or loosened by some spasmodic action of the moving fibres in these parts, they will in their passage create pain, raise different degrees of inflammation, or perhaps lacerate some blood-vessels, and cause bloody urine. When these little concretions happen to be detained in the pelvis of the kidney, or any other place where a flow of urine continually passes, they soon increase in size, and become calculi, from the constant accession of particles, which are attracted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> bit of sand, which thus becomes the nucleus of a stone.\n\nIt is an opinion which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a> first advanced, and which has been almost universally adopted by his followers, and has remained till lately uncontroverted, that the stone and gravel are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of hard water. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, which the waters of certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> possess, of depositing a large earthy sediment, either in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AQUEDUCTS\">aqueducts</a> through which they are conveyed, or in the vessels in which they are boiled or preserved, it was conjectured, that in passing through the kidneys, and especially whilst retained in the bladder, they would let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> their grosser particles, which by the continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPOSITION\">apposition</a> of fresh matter, connected by the animal gluten, and compacted by the muscular action of that organ, would in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> form a calculus sufficiently large to produce a train of the most excruciating symptoms. And this reasoning a priori has been supposed to be confirmed by facts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>; for not to mention the authority of Hippocrates, Dr Lister has observed, that the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> are peculiarly subject to the stone in the bladder. Nicholas de Blegny has related the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of one who was dissected at Paris, in whom the pylorus, a great part of the duodenum, and the stomach itself, were found incrusted with a stony matter, to the thickness of a finger's breadth. And it is well known, that the water of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEINE\">Seine</a>, with which that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> is supplied, is so impregnated with calcareous matter, as to incrustate, and in a short time to choke up, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> through which it runs. But on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> it is objected, that the human calculus is of animal origin, and by chemical analysis appears to bear very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to the stony concretions of water: and though it be allowed, that more persons are cut for the stone in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a> at Paris than in most other places; yet upon inquiry it is found, that many of those patients come from different provinces, and from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and villages far distant from the Seine.\n\nDr Percival conjectures, that though this disease may chiefly depend upon a peculiar disposition to concrete in\nEpisthesis in the animal fluids, which in many instances is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>, and in no instance can with certainty be imputed to any particular cause; yet hard water is at least negatively favourable to this diathesis, by having no tendency to diminish it. The urine of the most healthy person is generally loaded with an apparently terreous matter, capable in favourable circumstances of forming a calculus; as is evident from the thick crust which it deposits on the sides of the vessels in which it is contained. And it seems as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> intended by this excretion to discharge all the superfluous salts of the blood, together with those earthy particles, which are either derived from our aliment, and fine enough to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LACTEALS\">lacteals</a>, though insuperable by the powers of circulation, or which arise from the abrasion of the solids, or from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> globular part of our fluids. Now water, whether used as nature presents us with it, or mixed with wine, or taken under the form of beer or ale, is the great diluter, vehicle, and menstruum, both of our food, and of the saline, earthy, and excrementitious parts of the animal juices. And it is more or less adapted to the performance of these offices, in proportion to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of purity. For it must appear evident to the most ordinary understanding, that a menstruum already loaded, and perhaps saturated with different contents, cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a> so powerfully as one which is free from all sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">impregnation</a>. Nor is this reasoning founded upon theory alone; for it is observed, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALVERN\">Malvern</a> water, which issues from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTERSHIRE\">Worcestershire</a>, remarkable for its uncommon purity, has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of dissolving the little sabulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> which are often voided in nephritic complaints. And the solution too, which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of its being complete, is perfectly colourless. Hence this water is drunk with great advantage in disorders of the urinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>. And during the use of it, the patient's urine is generally limpid, and seldom deposits any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> sediment. Yet notwithstanding this appearance of transparency, it is certainly at such times loaded with impurities, which are so diluted and dissolved as not to be visible. For it is attended with a strong and fetid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, exactly resembling that of asparagus. Hoffman mentions a pure, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, simple water in the principality of Hennecberg, in Germany, which is remarkable for its efficacy in the stone and gravel; and a water of similar virtues was discovered not many years ago in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-BLACK_FOREST\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> forest, near Osterod, which upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> did not afford a single grain of mineral matter. Indeed it is worthy of observation, that most of the springs which were formerly held in great esteem, and were called holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a>, are very pure, and yield little or no sediment.\n\nDr Percival informs us that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>, who had been long subject to nephritic complaints, and often voided small stones, was advised to refrain from his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>-water, which is uncommonly hard, and to drink constantly the soft water of a neighbouring spring; and that this change alone, without the use of any medicine, has rendered the returns of his disorder much less frequent and painful. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> also, much affected with the gravel, was induced by the perusal of the first edition of Dr Percival's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a>, to try the effect of soft water; and by the constant use of it remained two years entirely free from her disorder.\n\nIn nephritic cases, distilled water would be an excellent substitute for Malvern water, as the following experiment evinces.\n\nTwo fragments of the same calculus nearly of equal weight, were immersed, the one in three ounces of distilled water, the other in three ounces of hard pump-water. The phials were hung up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> together in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a>-chimney, at a convenient distance from the fire. After 14 days maceration, the calculi were taken out, and carefully dried by a very gentle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>. The former, viz. that which had been immersed in distilled water, was diminished in its weight a grain and a half; the latter had lost only half a grain.\n\nIt is the passage of these calculi from the kidneys <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into the bladder, which occasions the pain, vomiting, and other symptoms, that constitute what is usually termed a fit of the gravel or stone.\n\nWhen an inflammation is actually raised, the disease is known by the name of nephritis, and has been already treated of.\n\nAs soon as the stone passes through the ureter, and falls into the bladder, the pain and other nephritic symptoms cease; and every thing will remain quiet, either till the stone be carried into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-URETHRA\">urethra</a>, or until it has remained long enough in the bladder to acquire weight sufficient to create new distress.\n\nIf a stone happen to be smooth and of a roundish form, it may lie in the bladder and acquire considerable bulk before it can be perceived by the patient; but when it is angular, or has a rugged surface, even though it may be small in size, yet it seldom fails to raise pain, and occasion bloody urine, or the discharge of a slimy fluid, with tenesmus, and difficulty in making water.\n\nThere have been various attempts made to dissolve the stone; and there are certainly some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> which have this effect when applied to them out of the body; but the almost total impossibility of getting these conveyed to the kidneys, renders it extremely doubtful whether a solvent ever will be discovered. Of all the articles employed for this purpose, no one perhaps has had greater reputation than fixed alkaline <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> in its caustic state, particularly under the form of the lixivium caustum, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AQUA\">aqua</a> potassae, as it is now called; but this being of a very acrid nature, it requires to be well sheathed by means of some gelatinous or mucilaginous vehicle. Veal-broth is as convenient as any for this purpose; and accordingly it is used by those who make a secret of the caustic alkali as a solvent of calculus.\n\nMr Blackrie, who has taken much pains in this inquiry, has proved very satisfactorily, that Chitrick's nostrum is no other than soup-leses given in veal-broth, which the patients send every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>, who returns it mixed up with the medicine, in a close vessel secured by a lock.\n\nIt is not every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, however, that either requires or will bear a course of the caustic alkali. Some calculi are of that soft and friable nature, that they will dissolve even in common water; and there are cases wherein it appears that the constant use of some very simple decoction or infusion of an insignificant vegetable, has brought away large quantities of earthy matter, in flakes which apparently have been united together in layers to form a stone. Dr Macbride assu\nThese sure us, that a decoction of raw coffee, only 30 berries in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">quart</a> of water, boiled till it acquired a deep greenish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> and evening to the quantity of eight or ten ounces, with ten drops of sweet spirit of nitre, had the powerful effect of bringing away, in the course of about two months, as much earthy matter in flakes as filled a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>-cup. The patient was far advanced in years; and, before he began this decoction, had been reduced to great extremities by the continuance of pain and other distressing symptoms: he was purged occasionally with oleum vicini.\n\nVery lately the alkali in a mild state, and in a different form, has been much used by many calculous patients, and with great advantage, under the form of what is called alkaline aerated water, the aqua supercarbonatis potassae of the present edition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Pharmacopoeia. For the introduction of this medicine, or at least for its extensive use, we are chiefly indebted to the ingenious physician Dr William Falconer of Bath. He has lately published an account of the Aqua Mephitica Alkalina, or solution of fixed alkaline salt, saturated with fixable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, in calculous disorders; which contains a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of cases strongly supporting the benefit to be derived from it. But whether the good effects obtained in these instances are to be explained from its operating as a solvent of calculus, seems to be extremely doubtful. There are indeed cases in Dr Falconer's treatise, of patients in whom, after using it for a considerable time, no stone could be detected by sounding, although it had been discovered in that way before they began the employment of it. But in many instances, the relief has been so sudden, that it may be concluded, that notwithstanding the case obtained, the calculus still remained. In such cases, it probably removed from the urine that quality by which it gives to the calculus fresh accretions, producing that roughness of its surface by which it is chiefly capable of acting as a stimulus. For the distressing symptoms resulting from stone are chiefly to be attributed to the inflammatory and spasmodic affections which it induces; and when its surface is least capable of operating as a stimulus, these of course will be least considerable. It is therefore not improbable, that this remedy produces relief, by preventing fresh additions being made to the calculus.\n\nAn infusion of the seeds of daucus sylvestris sweetened with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, is another simple and much celebrated remedy; it has been found to give considerable ease in cases where the stomach could not bear any thing of an acrid nature. The leaves of the uva ursi were strongly recommended by the late celebrated De Haen; and this, whatever its way of operating may be, seems to have been productive of good effects in some instances. There is no reason to believe that it has any influence in dissolving calculus; and indeed it seems to be chiefly useful in these instances where ulcerations take place in the urinary passages.\n\nIn the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, vol. iii., we have an account of a method used by the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a> Petraea for curing the stone, to which they are very much subject, and which the author (an English gentleman of experience and candour) affirms he has seen frequently performed with success. By means of a catheter, they inject into the bladder a weak ley of alkali with the purified fat of a sheep's tail, and Dysuria. a proper quantity of opium, all put together. Their catheters are made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>; and in performing the operation they introduce them quite into the bladder; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> is safely conveyed to the stone without hurting any other part. But when a stone is situated in the kidney, they have no method of cure.\n\nIf this method of curing by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJECTION\">injection</a> could be safely practised, it would no doubt have the advantage over that of taking alkalis by the mouth, where the medicine is not only much weakened, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the patient runs the risk of being greatly injured. But from some experiments mentioned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Medical Transactions, and still more from the chemical analysis of urinary concretions, lately published by Fourcroy and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> chemists, it appears that the human calculi are very different from one another in their natures. Some, for instance, will easily yield to an alkaline menstruum, and very little to an acid; while others are found to resist the alkali, and yield to the acid; and some are of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> nature, that they yield neither to acids nor alkalis. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, however, to the fragments, scales, or films, which the stone may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> off, and also to the contents and sediment of the urine, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the discovery of what solvent is proper, or whether the stone can be dissolved by any. To use either alkalis or acids improperly may be hurtful; though there may be such kinds of calculi as demand the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> use of acids and alkalis; nay, there may be found calculi of opposite kinds in the same subject.\n\nIn such cases as will not allow us to think of dissolving the stony concretions, and where the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is to palliate and procure ease from time to time, little more can be done than to keep the bowels open occasionally by some gentle cathartic, and wash off as much of the loose gravelly matter and slime as can be removed by such mild diuretic infusions and decoctions as shall be found to pass freely and sit well on the stomach. Persons afflicted with the stone should be careful in respect of their diet, and studiously avoid all heavy and flatulent food, as well as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> sauces that are apt to turn rancid. For the same reason, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> and acids are to be shunned; for these often create heartburning, and every thing that offends the stomach raises the nephritic pain; such is the sympathy that obtains between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGESTIVE\">digestive</a> and the uropoietic organs.\n\nThere have been surgeons bold enough to entertain an idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> even into the kidney, in order to extract a stone: this, however, except in cases where an abscess has been formed, and nature <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out the way, is both very uncertain and very hazardous. But cutting into the bladder for the same purpose, is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and well known operation, and often crowned with success. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, however, of this operation belongs to the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SURGERY\">Surgery</a>, to which we refer; and here shall only make this remark, that a surgeon should never begin his operation, until he and his assistants are perfectly satisfied, from actually feeling the stone, that there is one in the bladder; because it has sometimes happened, that when the incision has been made, no stone could be found: and the patient having died in consequence of the operation, and the body\nEpiscches body being opened, it has appeared that the symptoms which occasioned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of a stone in the bladder arose from some other cause.\n\nWhen a dysuria proceeds from any acrimonious matter thrown into the blood, it may be readily cured by bleeding, emollient oysters, cooling and diluting drinks with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> arabic or gum tragacanth, linseed tea, or the warm bath. When it arises from inflammations of the bladder or parts adjoining to it, we are to regard it only as a symptomatic affection; and the remedies used to remove the primary disease will also remove the dysuria. Sometimes it may arise from an ulcer of the bladder; in which case it is generally incurable; a mild nutritious diet will, however, protract the patient's life; and even render that life tolerable, by alleviating symptoms.\n\nGenus CXXV. Dyspermatismus.\n\nDifficult Emission of Semen.\n\nDyspermatismus, Sauv. gen. 260.\nSterilitas, Lin. 171. Sag. 211.\nAgenesis, Vog. 283.\n\nThis impediment proceeds generally from obstructions in the urethra, either by tumors in itself, or in the cavernous bodies of the penis; in which case the treatment is the same as in the ischuria urethralis; sometimes it is owing to a kind of epileptic fit which seizes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in the venereal act; and sometimes the semen, when ejected from the proper receptacles, is again absorbed, or flows into the bladder, and is expelled along with the urine. The last case it is very difficult, or even impossible, to cure; as proceeding from scirrhi, or other indissoluble tumors of the verumontanum, or the neighbouring parts. It is also, in general, incurable. In some it proceeds merely from too violent an erection; in which case emollient and relaxing medicines will be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; and we have an example of a cure performed by means of these in the first volume of the Edinburgh Medical Essays.\n\nGenus CXXVI. Amenorrhoea.\n\nSuppression of the Menses.\n\nAmenorrhoea, Vog. 130.\nDysmenorrhoea, Lin. 168. Sag. 218.\n\nThis obstruction, with many other symptoms, as dyspepsia, yellowish or greenish colour of the skin, unusual appetites, &c., constitutes the chlorosis already treated of, a disease which seldom or never appears without a suppression of the menses. In Dr Home's Clinical Experiments we find the virtues of several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMENAGOGUES\">emenagogues</a> set forth in the following manner. Chalybeates seldom or never succeeded: they were always found more useful in diminishing the evacuation when too violent, than in restoring it when deficient. The Amantinure of black hellebore proved successful only in one of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> or ten cases, though given to the length of four tea-spoonfuls a-day, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the quantity recommended by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAD\">Mead</a>. Compression of the crural artery, recommended by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> in the Physical and Literary Essays, vol. ii. proved successful only in one of six cases. From the effects produced by this compression, it has the strongest appearance of loading the uterus with blood; from the sensations of the patient it produces the same effects as the approach of the menses, and has every appearance in its favour; yet does not succeed. Dr Home supposes that the uterus is most frequently in too plethoric and inflammatory a state; in which case, this remedy will do more hurt than in a state of inanition; however, he owns, that in the case in which it did succeed, the patient was plethoric and inflammatory. Venesection is recommended as an excellent remedy; the doctor gives three instances of its success, and says he could give many more. It acts by removing the plethoric state of the uterus, relaxing the fibres, and giving the vessels full play; so that their action overcomes all resistance, and the evacuation takes place. It is of no great moment from whence the blood is taken: the saphenic vein has been supposed to empty the uterus most; but it is difficult to get the proper quantity from it, and the quantity of the discharge cannot be so well measured. The powder of savine is a most powerful remedy; and proved successful in three cases out of four in which it was tried. It was given to the quantity of half a dram twice a-day. It is a strong topical stimulus, and seems improper in plethoric habits. Madder-root, according to Dr Home, is a very powerful medicine in this disease; and proved successful in 14 out of 19 cases in which it was tried, being sometimes exhibited in the quantity of two scruples, or a dram, four times a-day. It has scarcely any sensible effects; never quickens the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>, or excites inflammatory symptoms; on the contrary, the heat, thirst, and other complaints abate; and sometimes these symptoms are removed, though the disease be not cured; but when it succeeds, the menses appear from the third to the 12th day.\n\nWe have now considered all those diseases enumerated in Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSOLOGY\">Nosology</a>, the cure of which is to be attempted chiefly by internal medicines. The other genera either require particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> operations, or a very considerable use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> applications; and therefore more properly fall under the article Surgery. To this, therefore, we shall refer the genera which fall under the three last orders of the class of locales, viz. the tumores, ectopie, and dialyseis; and we shall add, by way of Appendix, a few observations on some important affections to which Dr Cullen has not given a place in his system, or which practitioners in general are not agreed in referring to any one particular genus which he has mentioned.","sp":498,"ep":502},{"h":"END OF THE THIRTEENTH VOLUME","t":"DIRECTIONS FOR PLACING THE PLATES OF VOL.

But many circumstances prevent the steadiness necessary in pursuing these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>; and therefore in such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, unless great care be taken to avoid the exciting causes, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> may frequently return, and, in many cases, the preventing of paroxysms is chiefly to be obtained by avoiding those exciting causes already enumerated.\n\nA due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> in avoiding these different causes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> certainly prevent fits of the gout; and the taking care that the exciting causes be never applied in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, will certainly render fits more moderate when they do come on. But, upon the whole, it will appear, that a very strict attention to the general conduct of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> is in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> necessary; and therefore, when the predisposition has taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, it will be extremely difficult to avoid the disease.\n\nDr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a> is firmly persuaded, that by obviating the predisposition, and by avoiding the exciting causes, the gout may be entirely prevented: but, as the measures necessary for this purpose will, in most cases, be pursued with difficulty, and even with reluctance, men have been very desirous to find a medicine which might answer the purpose without any restraint on their manner of living. To gratify this desire, physicians have proposed, and, to take advantage of it, empirics have feigned, many remedies. Of what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> several of these remedies have been, it is difficult to say: but of those which are unknown, we conclude, from their having been only of temporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, and from their having soon fallen into neglect, that they have been either inert or pernicious. We shall therefore make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> inquiry after them; and shall now remark only upon one or two known remedies for the gout which have been lately fashionable.\n\nOne of these is what has been named in England the Portland powder. This is not a new medicine, but is mentioned by Galen, and, with some little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, has been mentioned by the writers of almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> since that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. It appears to have been at times in fashion, and to have again fallen into neglect; and Dr Cullen thinks that this last has been owing to its having been found to be, in many instances, pernicious. In every instance which he has known of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> for the length of time prescribed, the persons who had taken it were indeed afterwards free from any inflammatory affection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>; but they were affected with many symptoms of the atomic gout; and many, soon after finishing their course of the medicine, have been attacked with apoplexy, asthma, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DROPSY\">dropsy</a>, which proved fatal.\n\nAnother remedy which has had the appearance of preventing the gout, is alkali in various forms; such as Podagro, the fixed alkali, both mild and caustic, lime <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> earths; and of late the alkaline aerated water has been more fashionable than any other. Since it became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to exhibit these medicines in nephritic and calculous cases, it has often happened that they were given to those who were at the same time subject to the gout; and it has been observed, that under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of these medicines, gouty persons have been longer free from the fits of their disease. That, however, the use of these medicines has entirely prevented the returns of gout, Dr Cullen does not know; because he never pushed the use of them for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time, being apprehensive that the long-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> use of them might produce a hurtful change in the state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>.\n\nAs the prevention of gout depends very much on supporting the tone of the stomach, and avoiding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGESTION\">indigestion</a>; so costiveness, by occasioning this, is very hurtful to gouty persons. It is therefore necessary for such persons to prevent or remove costiveness, by a laxative medicine, when needful; but it is at the same time proper, that the medicine employed should be such as may keep the belly regular, without much purging. Aloeticks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBA\">alba</a>, oleum ricini, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> of sulphur, may be employed, as the one or the other may happen to be best suited to particular persons.\n\nThese are the several measures to be pursued in the intervals of the paroxysms; and we are next to mention the measures proper during the time of them.\n\nAs during the time of paroxysms the body is in a feverish state, no irritation should then be added to it; every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, therefore, of the antiphlogistic regimen, except the application of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, ought to be strictly observed.\n\nAn exception to the general rule, however, may occur when the tone of the stomach is weak, and when the patient has been much more accustomed to the use of strong drink; for then it may be allowable, and even necessary, to give some animal food and a little wine.\n\nThat no irritation is to be added to the system during the paroxysms of gout, except in the cases mentioned, is agreed upon among physicians: but it is a more difficult matter to determine, whether, during the time of paroxysms any measures may be pursued to moderate the violence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> and of inflammation. Dr Sydenham has given it as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the more violent the inflammation and pain, the paroxysm will be the shorter, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between the present and the next paroxysm longer; and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> this opinion be admitted as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, it will forbid the use of any remedies which might moderate the inflammation; which is, to a certain degree, undoubtedly necessary for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> of the body. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, acute pain presses for relief; and although a certain degree of inflammation may seem absolutely necessary, there is reason to believe, a moderate degree of it may answer the purpose; and it is even probable, that in many cases the violence of inflammation may weaken the tone of the parts, and thereby invite a return of paroxysms. It seems to be in this way, that, as the disease advances, the paroxysms become more frequent.\nFrom these last considerations, it seems probable, that, during the time of paroxysm some measures may be taken to moderate the violence of the inflammation and pain, and particularly, that in first paroxysms, and in the young and vigorous, blood-letting at the arm may be practised with advantage; but this practice cannot be repeated often with safety; because blood-letting not only weakens the tone of the system, but also contributes to produce plethora. However, bleeding by leeches on the foot, and upon the inflamed part, may be practised and repeated with greater safety; and instances have been known of its having been employed with safety to moderate and shorten paroxysms; but how far it may be carried, we have not had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> enough to determine.\n\nBesides blood-letting and the antiphlogistic regimen, it has been proposed to employ remedies for moderating the inflammatory spasm of the part affected, such as warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a> and emollient poultices. These have sometimes been employed with advantage and safety; but, at other times, have been found to give occasion to a retrocession of the gout.\n\nBlistering is a very effectual means of relieving and discussing a paroxysm of the gout; but has also frequently had the effect of rendering it retrocedent. The stinging with nettles is analogous to blistering; and probably would be attended with the same danger. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> with moxa, or other substances, is a remedy of the same kind; but though not found hurtful, there is no sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of its proving a radical cure.\n\nCamphor, and some aromatic oils, have the power of allaying the pain, and of removing the inflammation from the part affected; but these remedies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> make the inflammation only shift from one part to another, and therefore with the hazard of its falling upon a part where it may be more dangerous; and they have sometimes rendered the gout retrocedent.\n\nAmong other remedies which have of late been highly extolled during a paroxysm of gout, some have recommended the use of strong purgatives frequently repeated; others have highly extolled the assiduous application of cold water to the affected foot. But we may safely venture to assert that both practices are very doubtful, if not very dangerous.\n\nFrom these reflections it will appear, that some danger must attend every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> application to the parts affected during a paroxysm; and that therefore the common practice of committing the person to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> alone, is established upon the best foundation. Opiates give the most certain relief from pain; but, when given in the beginning of gouty paroxysms, it has by some been thought that they occasion these to return with greater violence. When, however, the paroxysms shall have abated in their violence, but still continue to return, so as to occasion painful and restless nights, opiates may be given with safety and advantage; especially in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of persons advanced in life, and who have been often affected with the disease. When, after paroxysms have ceased, some swelling and stiffness still remain in the joints, these symptoms are to be discussed by the diligent use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>. Purging immediately after a paroxysm will be always employed with the hazard of bringing it on again; but keeping the belly gently open even during the continuance of the paroxysm is highly proper.\n\nThus far of the regular gout. We now proceed to consider the management of the disease when it has become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>.\n\nIn the atonic gout, the cure is to be accomplished by carefully avoiding all debilitating causes; and by employing, at the same time, the means of strengthening the system in general, and the stomach in particular.\n\nFor strengthening the system in general, Dr Cullen recommends frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> on horseback, and moderate walking. Cold bathing also may answer the purpose; and may be safely employed, if it appear to be powerful in stimulating the system, and be not applied when the extremities are threatened with any pain.\n\nFor supporting the tone of the system in general, when threatened with atonic gout, some animal food ought to be employed, and the more acescent vegetables ought to be avoided. In the same case, some wine also may be necessary; but it should be in moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, and of the least acescent kinds, and if every kind of wine shall be found to increase the acidity of the stomach, ardent spirits and water must be employed.\n\nFor strengthening the stomach, bitters and the Peruvian bark may be used; but care must be taken that they be not constantly employed for any great length of time.\n\nThe most effectual medicine for strengthening the stomach is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, which may be employed under various preparations; but the best appears to be the rust in fine powder, which may be given in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> doses.\n\nFor supporting the tone of the stomach, aromatics may be exhibited; but should be used with caution, as the frequent and copious use of them has an opposite effect; and they should therefore be given only in compliance with former habits, or for palliating present symptoms.\n\nWhen the stomach happens to be liable to indigestion, gentle vomits may be frequently given, and proper laxatives should be always employed to obviate or to remove costiveness.\n\nIn the atonic gout, or in persons liable to it, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against cold is especially necessary; and the most certain means of doing this, is by repairing to a warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> during the winter season. In the more violent cases, blistering the lower extremities may be useful; but that remedy should be avoided when any pain threatens the extremities. In persons liable to the atonic gout, issues may be established in the extremities as in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> a supplement to the disease.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> case of the irregular gout, is the retrocedent.\n\nWhen this affects the stomach and intestines, relief is to be instantly attempted by the free use of strong wines, joined with aromatics, and given warm; or, if these shall not prove powerful enough, ardent spirits must be employed, and are to be given in a large dose. In moderate attacks, ardent spirits, impregnated with garlic or with asafoetida, may be used; or, even without the ardent spirits, a solution of asafoetida with the volatile alkali, may answer the purpose. Opiates are often an effectual remedy; and may be\njoined with aromatics, as in the electuarium opiatum; or they may be usefully joined with volatile alkali and camphor. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSK\">Musk</a> has likewise proved useful in this disease.\n\nWhen the affection of the stomach is accompanied with vomiting, this may be encouraged, by taking draughts of warm water, at first with wine, and afterwards without it; having at length recourse, if necessary, to some of the remedies above mentioned, and particularly the opiates.\n\nIn like manner, if the intestines be affected with diarrhoea, this is to be at first encouraged by taking plentifully of weak broth; and when this shall have been done sufficiently, the tumult is to be quieted by opiates.\n\nWhen the retrocedent gout shall affect the lungs, and produce asthma, this is to be cured by opiates, by antispasmodics, and perhaps by blistering on the back or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>.\n\nWhen the gout, leaving the extremities, shall affect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and produce pain, vertigo, apoplexy, or palsy, our resources are very precarious. The most probable means of relief is, blistering the head; and, if the gout shall have receded very entirely from the extremities, blisters may be applied to these also. Together with these blisterings, aromatics, and the volatile alkali, may be thrown into the stomach.\n\nThe third case of the irregular gout is the misplaced; that is when the inflammatory affection of the gout, instead of falling upon the extremities, falls upon some internal part. In this case, the disease is to be treated by blood-letting, and by such other remedies as would be proper in an idiopathic inflammation of the same parts.\n\nWhether the translation so frequently made from the extremities to the kidneys, is to be considered as an instance of the misplaced gout, seems uncertain: but Dr Cullen is disposed to think it something different; and therefore is of opinion, that, in the nephralgia calclosa produced upon this occasion, the remedies of inflammation are to be employed no farther than they may be sometimes necessary in that disease, arising from other causes than the gout.\n\nBesides what have been mentioned, a variety of other practices may be necessary and proper against the various anomalous symptoms, which are at times produced by irregular gout. But of these we cannot propose to treat. And we may conclude with observing, that in every form of gout, the cure principally depends on avoiding occasional causes, particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> and laziness.\n\n**Genus XXV.

The hot stage of this is frequently attended with a confusion of the head, and some degree of delirium; and almost always with drowsiness, and perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMA\">coma</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> is always frequent, and commonly full and hard.\u2014When these symptoms have continued for one, two, or at most three days, an erythema appears on some part of the face. This at first is of no great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, but gradually spreads from the part it first occupied to the other parts of the face, till it has affected the whole; and frequently from the face it spreads over the hairy scalp, or descends on some part of the cheek. As the redness spreads, it commonly leaves, or at least is abated in the parts it had before occupied. All the parts which the redness affects are also affected with some swelling, which continues for some time after the redness has abated. The whole face becomes considerably turgid; and the eyelids are often so much swelled as entirely to shut up the eyes. When the redness and swelling have continued for some time, there commonly arise, sooner or later, blisters of a larger or smaller size on several parts of the face. These contain a thin colourless liquor, which sooner or later runs out. The surface of the skin, in the blistered places, sometimes becomes livid and blackish; but this seldom goes deeper, or discovers any degree of gangrene affecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CUTIS\">cutis</a> vera. On the parts of the face not affected with blisters, the cuticle suffers, towards the end of the disease, a considerable desquamation. Sometimes the tumour of the eyelids ends in a suppuration.\n\nThe inflammation coming upon the face does not produce any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a> of the fever which had before prevailed; and sometimes the fever increases with the spreading and increasing inflammation. The inflamma-\ntion commonly continues for eight or ten days; and for the same time, the fever and symptoms attending it also continue. In the progress of the disease, the delirium and coma attending it sometimes go on increasing, and the patient dies apoplectic on the seventh, ninth, or eleventh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of the disease. In such cases it has been commonly supposed, that the disease is translated from the external to the internal parts. But Dr Cullen thinks that the affection of the brain is merely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> from the external affection, as this continues increasing at the same time with the internal. When a fatal event does not take place, the inflammation, after having affected the whole face, and perhaps the other external parts of the head, ceases, and with that the fever also; and, without any other crisis, the patient returns to his ordinary health. This disease is not commonly contagious; but as it may arise from an acrid matter externally applied, so it is possible that the disease may sometimes be communicated from one person to another; and certainly there are several well authenticated instances of its prevailing in such a manner, even in particular wards of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, as to leave no doubt respecting its contagious nature. Persons who have once laboured under this disease are liable to returns of it.\n\nPrognosis. The event of this disease may be foreseen from the state of the symptoms which denote more or less the affection of the brain. If neither delirium nor coma come on, the disease is seldom attended with any danger; but when these symptoms appear early in the disease, and are in a considerable degree, the utmost danger is to be apprehended.\n\nCure. The erysipelas of the face is to be cured, according to the opinion of most practitioners, much in the same manner as phlegmonic inflammations; by blood-letting, cooling purgatives, and by employing every part of the antiphlogistic regimen. Many observations, however, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to conclude, that in not a few cases the concomitant fever has here a tendency to the typhoid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a>; and therefore evacuations, apparently serviceable in the first instance, have afterwards a bad effect. The evacuations of blood-letting and purging are to be employed more or less according to the urgency of symptoms; particularly those which mark an affection of the brain. As the pyrexia continues, and often increases with the inflammation of the face, so the evacuations above mentioned are to be employed at any time of the disease. When, however, the fever, in place of marks of the phlogistic diathesis, particularly a full, hard, and strong pulse, is attended with symptoms of great debility, and with a small pulse easily compressible; evacuations, particularly under the form of blood-letting, must be used with very great caution. Even in such cases, however, the use of refrigerant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a> may still be persisted in with more safety and greater advantage. But whether evacuants have been employed or not, when symptoms of debility run to a great height, and marks of a putrescent tendency appear, recourse must be had to wine and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a>. In cases which at the commencement require evacuation, these are often in the after periods employed with very great benefit.\n\nIn this, as in other diseases of the head, when that part happens to be the seat of erysipelas, it is proper to put the patient, as often as he can easily bear it, into somewhat of an erect posture; and as there is always an external affection, so various external applications have been proposed to be made to the part affected; but almost all of them are of doubtful effect.\n\nAn erysipelas frequently appears on other parts of the body besides the face, and such other erysipelatous inflammations frequently end in suppuration; but these cases are seldom dangerous. At coming on they are sometimes attended with drowsiness, and even with some delirium; but this seldom happens, and these symptoms do not continue after the inflammation is formed; and Dr Cullen does not remember to have seen an instance of the translation of an inflammation from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> to an internal part; and though these inflammations of the limbs be attended with pyrexia, they seldom require the same evacuations as the erysipelas of the face.\n\nSp.

Of this distemper Dr Cullen declines giving any particular history, because he never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it; from the accounts of other authors, however, he is of opinion, that the circumstances peculiarly characteristic of it, especially of its more violent and dangerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, are, 1. The great loss of strength in the animal functions, which often appears early in the disease. 2. The stupor, giddiness, and consequent staggering, which resembles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">drunkenness</a>, or the headache and various delirium, all of them denoting a great disorder in the functions of the brain. 3. Anxiety, palpitation, syncope, and especially the weakness and irregularity of the pulse, denoting a considerable disturbance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the heart. 4. Nausea and vomiting, particularly the vomiting of bile, which shows\nan accumulation of vitiated bile in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALL\">gall</a>-bladder and biliary ducts, and from thence derived into the intestines and stomach; and which denote a considerable spasm, and loss of tone in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> vessels on the surface of the body.\n\n5. The buboes and carbuncles, which denote an acrimony prevailing in the fluids; and, lastly, The petechiae, hemorrhages, and colliquative diarrhoea, which denote a putrescent tendency prevailing in a great degree in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of blood.\n\nTo these characteristics of the plague enumerated by Dr Cullen, we shall add one mentioned by Sir John Pringle, which, though perhaps less frequent than the others, yet seems worthy of notice. It is this, That in the plague there is an extraordinary enlargement of the heart and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> dissections of bodies dead of the plague at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARSEILLES\">Marseilles</a>, this extraordinary enlargement of the heart is taken notice of in all of them, and of the liver in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> of them. The account was sent to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> by M. Didier, one of the physicians to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of France, and has been published in the Philosophical Transactions. In the first case, the author takes notice, that \"the heart was of an extraordinary bigness; and the liver was of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> size.\"\u2014Case 2. The heart was of a prodigious bigness, and the liver much enlarged.\u2014Case 3. The heart double the natural bigness.\u2014Case 4. The heart was very large, and the liver was bigger and harder than ordinary.\u2014Case 5. The heart was of a prodigious bigness. Case 6. The heart was larger than in its natural state; the liver also was very large.\u2014Case 7. The heart was of a prodigious size, and the liver was very large.\u2014Case 8. The heart was much larger than natural, and the liver of a prodigious size.\u2014Case 9. The heart was double the natural bigness, and the liver was larger than ordinary.\"\n\nThis preternatural enlargement, Sir J. Pringle thinks, is owing to the relaxation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> parts, by which means they become unable to resist the impetus of blood, and therefore are easily extended; as in the case of infancy, where the growth is remarkably quick. And a similar enlargement he takes notice of in the scurvy, and other putrid diseases.\n\nA very elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> has lately been published on the subject of the plague by Dr Patrick Russel, formerly physician to the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTORY\">factory</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEPPO\">Aleppo</a>. In this work, a very full history is given of the various forms and varieties of the disease. He makes particular observations on the following symptoms, which, in addition to the pestilential eruptions, he considers as the most important concomitants of plague, viz. fever, delirium, coma, impediment or loss of speech, deafness, muddiness of the eyes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> tongue, state of the pulse, respiration, anxiety, pain at the heart, inquietude, debility, fainting, convulsion, appearances of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, perspiration, vomiting, looseness, and hemorrhage; and he concludes these remarks with some observations on the occurrence of the plague with pregnant women.\n\nTo point out more distinctly the stable varieties of the disease, he arranges the pestilential cases which fell under his observation at Aleppo under six classes: and he concludes his description with a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> and particular account of the pestilential eruptions, appearing under the form either of buboes, carbuncles, or other exanthemata. The presence of the two first, he observes, either separately or conjunctly, leaves the nature of the distemper unequivocal. But fatal has been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of rashly pronouncing a distemper not to be a plague from their absence. Buboes affected the inguinal, axillary, parotid, maxillary, and cervical glands. But the first were the most commonly affected, and the two latter seldom observed to swell, without either the parotid swelling at the time, or soon after. Of the carbuncles, Dr Russel describes five different varieties. The other exanthemata, which he observed sometimes, though less frequently, attending the plague, were petechiae, a marbled appearance of the skin, an erysipelasous redness, streaks of a reddish purple or livid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, vibices or weals, and large blue or purple spots, the maculae magnae of authors. In some cases, an extraordinary concurrence of eruptions took place, which was chiefly observed among children under 10 years of age.\n\nCauses, &c. From a consideration of the symptoms above mentioned, Dr Cullen concludes, that the plague is owing to a specific contagion, often suddenly producing the most considerable debility in the nervous system, or moving powers, and a general putrescence in the fluids. Dr Russel also considers the disease as being universally the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of what may be called pestilential contagion; and has judiciously repelled the objections which have been brought against this doctrine.\n\nPrevention. Here we must refer to all those methods of preventing and removing the incipient contagion of putrid fevers, which have been so fully enumerated. Dr Cullen is persuaded that the disease never arises in the northern parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, but in consequence of being imported from some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>'s first care, therefore, ought to be, to prevent the importation; and this may generally be done by a due attention to bills of health, and to the proper performance of quarantines.\u2014With respect to the latter, he is of opinion, that the quarantines of persons may with safety be much less than 40 days; and if this were allowed, the execution of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARANTINE\">quarantine</a> would be more exact and certain, as the temptation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> it would be in a great measure avoided. With respect to the quarantine of goods, it cannot be perfect unless the suspected goods be unpacked, duly ventilated, and other means be employed for correcting the infection they may carry; and if all this be properly done, it is probable that the time commonly prescribed for quarantine may also be shortened.\n\nA second measure in the way of prevention is required, when an infection has reached and prevailed in any place, to prevent that infection from spreading to others. This can only be done by preventing the inhabitants or the goods of any infected place from going out of it till they have undergone a proper quarantine.\n\nThe third measure, and which ought to be employed with great care, is, to prevent the infection from spreading among the inhabitants of a place in which it has arisen. And in this case, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> may be done by the magistrate: 1. By allowing as many of the inhabitants as are free from infection, and are not necessary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the place, to go out of it. 2. By discharging all assemblies, or unnecessary intercourse of the people. 3. By ordering some necessary communications to be performed without contact.\nPractice.\n\nExposure. 4. By making such arrangements and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> as may render it easy for the families remaining to shut themselves up in their own houses. 5. By allowing persons to quit houses where an infection appears, upon condition that they go into lazarettos. 6. By ventilating and purifying, or destroying, at the public expense, all infected goods. 7. By avoiding hospitals, and providing separate apartments for infected persons.\n\nThe fourth and last part of the business of prevention respects the conduct of persons necessarily remaining in infected places, especially those obliged to have some communication with persons infected. Those obliged to remain in places infected, but not to have any near communication with the sick, must avoid all near communication with other persons or their goods; and it is probable, that a small distance will serve, if, at the same time, there be no stream of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a> to carry the effluvia of persons or goods to some distance. Those who are obliged to have a near communication with the sick ought to avoid any of the debilitating causes which render the body susceptible of infection, as a spare diet, intemperance in drinking, excess in venery, cold, fear, or other depressing passions of the mind. A full diet of animal food is also to be avoided, because it increases the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> of the body, and favours the operation of contagion; and indigestion, whether from the quantity or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the food, contributes very much to the same end.\n\nBesides these, it is probable that the moderate use of wine and spirituous liquors, moderate exercise, and the cold bath, may be of use; tonic medicines also, of which cinchona is deservedly accounted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>, may be used with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of success. If anything is to be expected from antiseptics, Dr Cullen thinks camphor preferable to every other. In general, however, every one is to be indulged in the medicine of which he has the best opinion, provided it is not evidently hurtful. Whether issues be useful in preserving from the effects of contagion, is a matter of doubt. Dr Russel in his treatise enters very fully into the consideration of the means of prevention, both with respect to quarantines, lazarettos, and bills of health. He is of opinion, that the present laws on these subjects are in many respects defective; and he thinks, that a set of new regulations would have the best chance of a deliberate and impartial discussion in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, if the inquiry were taken at a time free from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of immediate danger.\n\nCure. According to Dr Cullen, the indications are the same as in fever in general, but are not all equally important. The measures for moderating the violence of reaction, which operate by diminishing the action of the heart and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a>, have seldom, he thinks, any place here, excepting that the antiphlogistic regimen is generally proper. Some physicians have recommended bleeding, and Sydenham even seems to think it an effectual cure; but Dr Cullen supposes, that for the most part it is unnecessary, and in many cases might do much hurt. Dr Russel, however, who on this subject speaks from experience and actual observation, is of a different opinion. With most of his patients, a single bleeding was employed with advantage; and even where the sick under his inspection were bled oftener than once, he did not find that the low state was thereby hurried on. Purging has also been recommended; and in some degree it may be useful in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> off the putrescent matter frequently present in the intestines; but a large evacuation in this way may certainly be hurtful.\n\nThe moderating the violence of reaction, as far as it can be done, by taking off the spasm of the extreme vessels, is a measure, in Dr Cullen's opinion, of the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> in the cure of the plague; and the whole of the means formerly mentioned, as suited to this indication, are extremely proper. The giving an emetic, at the first approach of the disease, would probably be of great service; and it is probable, that, at some other periods of the disease, emetics might be useful, both by evacuating bile abounding in the alimentary canal, and by taking off the spasm of the extreme vessels. Indeed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Ash, and some other of the Russian practitioners, represent the early and repeated used of emetics as the only effectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of cure.\n\nAccording to the observations of Dr de Mertens, who wrote a very interesting treatise on the fatal plague which raged at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a> in 1771, and which carried off upwards of 20,000 inhabitants in the space of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, emetics were often of the greatest service.\n\nFrom some principles with respect to fever in general, and with respect to the plague in particular, Dr Cullen is of opinion, that after the exhibition of the first vomit, the body should be disposed to sweat: but this sweat should be raised only to a moderate degree, though it must be continued for 24 hours or more if the patient bears it easily. The sweating is to be excited and conducted according to the rules laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> under Synochia; and must be promoted by the plentiful use of diluents rendered more grateful by vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, or more powerful by being impregnated with some portion of neutral salts. To support the patient under the continuance of the sweat, a little weak broth, acidulated with the juice of lemons, may be given frequently, and sometimes a little wine if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the body be not considerable. If sudorific medicines be judged necessary, opiates will be found more effectual and safe; but they should not be combined with aromatics, and probably may be more effectual if joined with a portion of emetics and of neutral salts. But if, notwithstanding the use of emetics and sudorifics in the beginning, the disease should still continue, the cure must turn upon the use of means for obviating debility and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>; and for this purpose tonic medicines, especially cinchona and cold drink, are the most proper.\n\nGenus XXVIII.

In the distinct smallpox, the disease begins with a synocha or inflammatory fever. This fever generally comes on about mid-day, with some symptoms of a cold stage, and commonly with a considerable languor and drowsiness. A hot stage is soon formed, and becomes more considerable on the second and third day. During this course children are liable to frequent startings from their slumber; and adults, if they are kept in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, are disposed to much sweating. On the third day, children are sometimes affected with one or two epileptic fits. Towards the end of the third day the eruption commonly appears, and gradually increases during the fourth; appearing first on the face, and successively on the inferior parts, so as to be completed over the whole body on the fifth day. From the third day the fever abates, and by the fifth it entirely ceases. The eruption appears first in small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> spots hardly eminent, but by degrees rising into pimples. There are generally but few on the face; but, even when more numerous, they are separate and distinct from one another. On the fifth or sixth day, a small vesicle, containing an almost colourless fluid, appears on the top of each pimple. For two days these vesicles increase in breadth only, and there is a small hollow pit in their middle, so that they are not raised into spheroidal pustules till the eighth day. These pustules from their first formation continue to be surrounded with an exactly circular inflamed margin, which, when they are numerous, diffuses some inflammation over the neighboring skin, so as to give somewhat of a damask-rose colour to the spaces between the pustules. As the pustules increase in size, the face swells considerably if they are numerous on it; and the eyelids particularly are so much swelled, that the eyes are entirely shut. As the disease proceeds, the matter in the pustules becomes by degrees more opaque and white, and at length assumes a yellowish colour. On the 11th day the swelling of the face is abated, and the pustules seem quite full. On the top of each a darker spot appears; and at this place the pustule, on the 11th day, or soon after, is spontaneously broken, and a portion of the matter oozes out; in consequence of which the pustule is shrivelled, and subsides; while the matter oozing out dries, and forms a crust upon its surface. Sometimes only a little of the matter oozes out, and what remains in the pustule becomes thick and even hard. After some days, both the crusts and the hardened pustules <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> off, leaving the skin which they covered of a brownish red colour; nor doth it resume its natural colour till many days after. In some cases, where the matter of the pustules has been more liquid, the crusts formed from it are later in falling off, and the part they covered suffers some desquamation, which occasions a small hollow or pit.\n\nOn the legs, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> the matter is frequently absorbed; so that at the height of the disease, these pustules appear as empty as vesicles. On the 10th and 11th days, as the swelling of the face subsides, a swelling arises in the hands and feet; but which again subsides as the pustules come to maturity.\u2014When the pustules on the face are numerous, some degree of pyrexia appears on the 10th and 11th days; but disappears again after the pustules are fully ripened, or perhaps remains in a very slight degree till the pustules on the feet have finished their course; and it is seldom that any fever continues longer in the distinct smallpox. When the pustules are numerous on the face, upon the sixth or seventh day some uneasiness of the throat, with a hoarseness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, comes on, and a thin liquid is poured out from the mouth. These symptoms increase with the swelling of the face; and the liquids of the mouth and throat becoming thicker, are with difficulty thrown out; and there is at the same time some difficulty in swallowing, so that liquids taken in to be swallowed are frequently rejected or thrown out by the nose. But all these affections of the fauces are abated as the swelling of the face subsides.\n\nIn the confluent smallpox all the symptoms above mentioned are much more severe. The eruptive fever particularly is more violent; the pulse is more frequent and more contracted, approaching to that state of pulse which is observed in typhus. The coma is more considerable, and there is frequently a delirium. Vomiting also frequently attends, especially at the beginning of the disease. In very young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> epileptic fits are sometimes frequent on the first days of the disease, and sometimes prove fatal before any eruption appears, or they usher in a very confluent and putrid smallpox. But at the same time, it has been justly remarked by Dr Sydenham, and other accurate observers, that epileptic attacks more frequently precede distinct and mild than malignant and confluent smallpox. The eruption appears in the confluent more early on the third day, and it is frequently preceded or accompanied with an erysipelasous efflorescence. Sometimes\nWhen the eruption is completed, the pimples are always more numerous upon the face, and at the same time smaller and less eminent. Upon the eruption the fever suffers some remission, but never goes off entirely; and after the fifth or sixth day it increases again, and continues to be considerable throughout the remaining part of the disease. The vesicles formed on the top of the pimples appear sooner; and while they increase in breadth, they do not retain a circular, but are every way of an irregular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. Many of them run into one another, insomuch that very often the face is covered with one vesicle rather than with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of pustules. The vesicles, as far as they are any way separated, do not arise to a spheroidal form, but remain flat, and sometimes the whole of the face appears an even surface. When the pustules are in any measure separated, they are not bounded by an inflamed margin, but the part of the skin that is free from pustules is commonly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> and flaccid. The liquor that is in the pustules changes from a clear to an opaque appearance, and becomes whitish or brownish, but never acquires the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> colour and thick consistence that appears in the distinct smallpox. The swelling of the face, which only sometimes attends the distinct smallpox, always attends the confluent kind; it also comes on more early, and arises to a greater height, but abates considerably on the tenth or eleventh day. At this time the pustules or vesicles break and shrivel; pouring out at the same time a liquor, which is formed into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> crusts, which do not fall off for a long time after. Those of the face, in falling off, leave the skin subject to a desquamation, which pretty certainly produces pit-tings. On the other parts of the body the pustules of the confluent smallpox are more distinct than on the face; but never acquire the same maturity and consistence of pus as in the properly distinct kind.\n\nThe salivation, which sometimes only attends the distinct smallpox, very constantly attends the confluent; and both the salivation and the affection of the fauces above mentioned occur, especially in adults, in a higher degree. In infants a diarrhoea comes frequently in place of a salivation.\n\nIn this kind of smallpox there is often a very considerable putrescence of the fluids, as appears from petechiae, from serous vesicles, under which the skin shows a disposition to gangrene, and from bloody urine or other hemorrhages; all of which symptoms frequently attend this disease. In the confluent smallpox also, the fever, which had only suffered a remission from the eruption to the maturation, at or immediately after this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> is frequently renewed again with considerable violence. This is what has been called the secondary fever, and is of various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> and event.\n\nCauses, &c. It is evident that the smallpox is originally produced by a contagion; and that this contagion is a ferment with respect to the fluids of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body, which assimilates a considerable portion of them to its own nature: or, at least, we have every reason to believe that a small quantity of contagious matter introduced, is sometimes multiplied and increased in the circulating fluids of the animal body. This quantity passes again out of the body, partly by insensible perspiration, and partly by being deposited in pustules: Variola. The causes which determine more of the variolous matter to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> by perspiration, or to form pustules, are probably certain circumstances of the skin, which determine more or less of the variolous matter to stick in it, or to pass freely through it. The circumstance of the skin, which seems to determine the variolous matter to stick in it, is a certain state of inflammation depending much on the heat of it: thus we have many instances of parts of the body, from being more heated, having a greater number of pustules than other parts. Thus parts covered with plasters, especially those of the stimulant kind, have more pustules than others.\n\nCertain circumstances also, such as adult age, and full living, determining to a phlogistic diathesis, seem to produce a greater number of pustules, and vice versa. It is therefore probable, that an inflammatory state of the whole system, and more particularly of the skin, gives occasion to a greater number of pustules; and the causes of this may produce most of the other circumstances of the confluent smallpox, such as the time of eruption, the continuance of the fever, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of a more putrescent matter, and less fit to be converted into pus, together with the form and other circumstances of the pustules.\n\nPrognosis. The more exactly the disease retains the form of the distinct kind, it is the safer; and the more completely the disease takes the form of the confluent kind, it is the more dangerous. It is only when the distinct kind shows a great number of pustules on the face, or otherwise by fever or putrescence, approaching to the circumstances of the confluent, that the distinct kind is attended with any danger.\n\nIn the confluent kind the danger is always very considerable; and the more violent and permanent the fever is, the greater the danger; and especially in proportion to the increase of the symptoms of putrefaction. When the putrid disposition is very great, the disease sometimes proves fatal before the eighth day; but in most cases <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> happens on the eleventh, and sometimes not till the fourteenth or seventeenth day.\n\nThough the smallpox may not prove immediately fatal, the more violent kinds are often followed by a morbid state of the body, sometimes of very dangerous event. These consequences, according to Dr Cullen, may be imputed sometimes to an acrid matter produced by the preceding disease, and deposited in different parts; and sometimes to an inflammatory diathesis produced and determined to particular parts of the body.\n\nSince the introduction of smallpox into Europe, there is perhaps no disease which has produced a greater number of deaths. But, fortunately, a discovery is now made, by which there is reason to hope that this loathsome disease may be altogether exterminated; its prevention, viz. by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INOCULATION\">inoculation</a> of the vaccine or cowpox.\n\nThis most important discovery we owe to the successful exertions of Dr Edward Jenner; to whom, for these exertions, repeated rewards have been voted by the British legislature, but who unquestionably enjoys a much higher reward in the satisfaction of having conferred an inestimable blessing on the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>.\nFor an account of the progress of this discovery, we must refer our readers to Dr Jenner's publication. Here we shall only observe, that it had long been remarked in some parts of England, particularly in the neighbourhood of Berkley, where Dr Jenner resided, that cows were liable to a pustular disease on their udders, somewhat resembling smallpox; that this disease was communicated by contact to the fingers of those employed in milking the cows; and, finally, that those thus infected with cowpox, were completely protected against the contagion of smallpox.\n\nFounding on these observations, Dr Jenner ascertained by experiment, that the inoculation of vaccine matter was an infallible preventive of smallpox; and that this vaccine matter had equal power in preventing variola when transferred from one human subject to another, as when obtained immediately from the cow. It is not therefore wonderful that this practice of vaccine inoculation should soon have become general, both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> and in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the world. Nor is it perhaps surprising, that it should have been violently opposed by ignorant and obstinate men. Hence numerous publications have of late appeared both for and against this practice. Many mistakes have undoubtedly been committed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and inattention; and thus the preventive has been supposed to fail. For the best account both of the method of performing the operation, of conveying the vaccine matter from one place to another, and of the tests of constitutional affection in those cases in which the inflammation is slight, and in which no fever is perceptible, we may refer our readers to a treatise published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> in 1802, by Mr James Bryce, entitled Practical Observations on the Inoculation of Cowpox.\n\nOf the efficacy of vaccine inoculation as a preventive of smallpox, few candid men will entertain any doubt, after the following report on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VACCINATION\">vaccination</a>, from the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> of Physicians in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, ordered to be printed on the 8th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1807, by the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>.","sp":366,"ep":374},{"h":"FALLING-SICKNESS","t":"Epilepsia, Sauv. gen. 134.

The epilepsy often attacks suddenly, and without giving any warning; but more frequently is preceded by a pain in the head, lassitude, some disturbance of the senses, unquiet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, unusual dread, dimness of sight, a noise in the ears, palpitation of the heart, coldness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>; and in some there is a sensation of formication, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, &c., ascending from the lower extremities towards the head. In the fit, the persons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> suddenly to the ground (whence the name of the falling-sickness), frequently with a violent cry. The thumbs are shut up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> in the palms of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and are with difficulty taken out; the eyes are distorted, so that nothing but the whites are to be seen; all sensation is suspended, insomuch, that by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, noise, or otherwise, nor even by pinching the body, can they be brought to themselves; they foam at the mouth, with a hissing kind of noise; the tongue is frequently lacerated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, and there is a violent convulsive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the arms and legs. Sometimes, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, instead of being agitated by convulsive motions, are all stiff, and the patients are as immovable as a statue. In children, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENIS\">penis</a> is erected; and in young men there is an emission of the semen, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> is often thrown out to a considerable distance. At length there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a> of the symptoms, and the patients recover after a longer or shorter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>; when they complain of a pain, torpor, or heaviness of the head, with a lassitude of all the joints.\n\nCauses, &c. The dissection of epileptic subjects has shown a variety of morbid appearances, which may be supposed to have contributed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>; such as, indurations in the brain or meninges; caries of the internal surface of the cranium; projections of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BONY\">bony</a> substance of the same, pressing upon the brain; collections of serum or purulent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, and cartily concretions within the skull; besides many others which are recorded by Bonetus, Morgagni, and Liecutaud. But often the causes are impossible to be discovered; for even in those who have died of the disease, the brain and all other parts of the nervous system have been apparently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>. The disease <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> attack strong as well as weak people; and in those who are subject to it, any considerable excess in drinking, a surfeit, violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, or venery, &c. will certainly bring on a fit. Some have epileptic paroxysms returning periodically after considerable intervals; and the disease has been thought to have some dependence on the phases of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>.\n\nPrognosis. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the epilepsy comes on before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of puberty, there are some hopes of its going off at that time. But it is a bad sign when it attacks about the 21st year, and still worse if the fits grow more frequent; for then the animal functions are often destroyed, as well as those of the mind, and the patient becomes stupid and foolish. Sometimes it will terminate in melancholy or madness, and sometimes in a mortal apoplexy or palsy. It has sometimes, however, been observed, that epilepsies have been removed by the appearance of cutaneous diseases, as the itch, smallpox, measles, &c. While the disease is recent, therefore, we are not to despair of a cure; but if it be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> standing, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>, there is very little reason to expect that it can be removed.\n\nCure. From the symptoms occurring in epilepsy, which consists of involuntary convulsive motions, and an affection of the mental powers, there is reason to conclude that the fit immediately depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> of some peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the brain; but that convulsions may ensue from this cause, it would seem necessary that there should also occur a peculiar disposition to action in the moving fibres. On this ground, then, we may suppose the cure to be chiefly expected on one of two principles; either by our being able to prevent the peculiar action of the brain, or to remove the disposition to action in the moving fibres. The first is chiefly to be accomplished by the removal of irritating causes, by preventing their influence from being propagated to the brain, when they are applied to remote parts; or by counteracting their influence, from inducing in the brain a state of action different from that to which they give rise. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> end is chiefly to be obtained by diminishing the mobility of the nervous energy, and by strengthening...\nSpasms ening the tone of the moving fibres. It must, however, be allowed, that in all convulsive disorders, excepting those which are cured by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> about the time of puberty, the cure by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> means is very difficult. Numberless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SPECIFICS\">specifics</a> have been recommended, but all of them have failed of answering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>. When the cause can be discovered, that must be removed. In other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the cold bath, valerian root, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASTOR\">castor</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSK\">musk</a>, opium, the fetid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a>, with the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of nervous and antispasmodic medicines, have been recommended: but none of those, or indeed any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of them, have been found generally useful; though the slighter, or symptomatic cases, may often be removed by them.\n\nOf late the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALX\">calx</a> or oxide, improperly called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>, have obtained such reputation in convulsive disorders as to be received into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Pharmacopoeia under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of oxidum zinci. They were proposed by Dr Gaubius as an antispasmodic, in his Adversaria; and their efficacy has since been confirmed by various observations. In an inaugural dissertation published by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HART\">Hart</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>, the medical virtues of the flowers of zinc are considered. He observes, that they have long been used externally, chiefly for inflammations of the eyes from acrid lymph. Glauber first proposed the internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of them; and Gaubius discovered them to be the remedy of a celebrated empiric Luddemannus, which he styled his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNA\">luna</a> fixata. After this he exhibited them with success in convulsive and spasmodic diseases. Dr Hart supposes, that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a> either as absorbents, or as possessing a specific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>: but is a strong advocate for their efficacy, on whatever principles they may operate; and, in favour of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, relates <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> cases in which they proved successful. A girl of 17 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> was seized with a slight chorea from a fright; and when the disease had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> six days, she began to take the flowers of zinc, by which her disorder was removed in less than three weeks. Her cure required only 16 grains of the zinc. In a few months the complaints returned, from the same cause; and were removed by four grains of the medicine divided into 10 doses. A boy of about four years old, labouring under a real epilepsy, suspected to be hereditary, was cured by a grain of the flowers of zinc taken every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> for some time.\u2014A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> 50 years old, thrown into convulsions from a violent passion, was cured by a grain of the calx taken every two hours. The disease had gone off upon venesection and the use of some other remedies; but returned again in two weeks, when it was finally removed by the zinc. The two last cases are related from Dr Gaubius, who affirms that he has used the flowers of zinc in cases of the chincough, hysteric hiccough, and spasmus cynicus; that they frequently did more than other medicines, but were by no means successful in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. The other cures mentioned by Dr Hart are similar to those above mentioned. But it does not appear that he ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a confirmed epilepsy cured by this medicine.\n\nIn the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, we have an account by Mr Benjamin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a>, of a man afflicted with a confirmed epilepsy, who was considerably relieved by the flowers of zinc.\n\nIn a young man labouring under the epilepsy, in whom the fits were preceded by an aura epileptica, or sensation like air arising from the inside of the knee-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>, the disease was also relieved, but not cured.\n\nDr Pereval relates some cases of epilepsy which seem to have been cured by the flowers of zinc; and in other cases, where the disease was not entirely removed by it, the spasms were nevertheless much mitigated. He did not observe that it promoted any evacuation; excepting that in some, upon being first taken, it occasioned a little sickness, which went off with a stool. He adds, that those apothecaries who do not prepare this medicine themselves, are in great danger of being imposed upon, as it is sometimes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> corrosion of the zinc by an acid, and even imperfectly washed.\n\nThe good effects of the oxide of zinc as an antispasmodic are also attested by Dr Haygarth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHESTER\">Chester</a> and Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">White</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>. The former gives a test of their goodness which may be of use to those who do not prepare them, namely, that the true flowers of zinc, when strongly heated, become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, but re-assume their white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> on being allowed to cool. The latter gives a case of hieranosos, or strange convulsions of almost all the muscles of the body, cured by zinc, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of other remedies had failed. But, although from these and other respectable authorities, there can be no doubt that zinc has often been successful in epilepsy; yet it is equally certain, that in many others it has had a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, without producing any benefit.\n\nIn Dr Home's clinical experiments and histories, also, oxide of zinc is mentioned as having been found serviceable upon trial in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Infirmary of Edinburgh. Of the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> remedies which have been recommended for the epilepsy and other convulsive disorders allied to it, we have the following account by the same author.\n\n1. The cold-bath was tried in one who had a convulsive disorder of one side, but the symptoms were rendered much worse by it.\n\n2. Venesection. Not to be depended on in convulsions.\n\n3. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">Electricity</a>. In two convulsive cases was of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>.\n\n4. Epispastics. Do not seem to be powerful antispasmodics.\n\n5. Valerian. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> convulsive cases, for which this remedy has been reckoned almost a specific, it not only made no cure, but could scarcely be reckoned to do any good. Dr Home supposes that it acts as a bitter tonic, something like the serpentinaria Virginiana. Though much used at present, he tells us it has always appeared to him a weak, often a hurtful, medicine.\n\n6. Musk. Six convulsive patients treated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> doses of this remedy, were neither cured nor in the least relieved.\n\n7. Castor seems to be unworthy of the confidence formerly put in it. It is indeed possessed of a sedative power, and therefore may be useful in spasmodic feverish cases.\n\n8. Asafoetida has considerable antispasmodic powers, but is not always successful. It heats and quickens the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>; and is therefore improper in cases attended with inflammation. It disagrees with some from a peculiarity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>; exciting pain in the stomach,\nand vomiting; but this can be known only after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of the medicine.\n\n9. Cinchona. Of seven spasmodic cases, six were either cured or mitigated. An epilepsy of eight years standing was very much relieved by taking the bark for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, and one of two years standing by taking it for ten days. But the medicine is of a heating nature, and therefore is not to be employed in cases attended with inflammatory symptoms.\n\n10. Pongy root was given to two epileptic patients without the least success.\n\n11. Viscus quercinus, or mistletoe, was given in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of two scruples five times a day to an epileptic patient, without success.\n\n12. Extractum hyoscyami was given to an epileptic patient, to one afflicted with the hemitotonos, and to one who laboured under the hysteric affection, without the least good effect.\n\n13. Folia aurantiacum were exhibited with the like bad success. Five drams of the powdered leaves were taken at once without any sensible effect.\n\n14. Cardamine pratensis, in three epileptic cases, was not attended with any success.\n\n15. Opium did no good.\n\n16. Ammoniaretum cupri made no cure in four cases of epilepsy in which it was tried.\n\nThat in many cases all these remedies have been employed without success, is not to be denied; and indeed it may with confidence be asserted, that a great majority of cases of epilepsy are incurable by any remedy that has yet been discovered. At the same time, as there is incontrovertible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> that some of them have succeeded at least in certain cases, the more powerful may always be considered as deserving a fair trial. The ammoniaretum eupri, in particular, seems well entitled to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of practitioners; for though it be a medicine of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, yet under prudent administration it may be employed even with very young subjects without any hazard; and in several inveterate cases, which had obstinately resisted other medicines, it has brought about a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>.\n\nGenus LIV. PALPITATIO.\n\nPalpitatio, Sauv. gen. 130. Lin. 132. Vog. 213. Sag. 237. Hoffm. III. 83. Junck. 33.\n\nThe palpitation of the heart is sometimes so violent, that it may be heard at a considerable distance. It may proceed from a bad conformation of the heart itself, or some of the large vessels. It may also be occasioned by wounds or abscesses in the heart; or it may proceed from polypous concretions or ossifications of that viscus, or from plethora, fear, or spasmodic affections of the nervous system. When it proceeds from diseases of the heart or large vessels, it is absolutely incurable. In spasmodic cases, the remedies above related may be used. If the patient be plethoric, bleeding will probably remove the disorder, at least for the present.\n\nGenus LV. ASTHMA.\n\nAsthma, Sauv. gen. 145. Lin. 161. Vog. 268.

The Plethoric Asthma.\n\nAsthma plethorium, Sauv. sp. 15.\n\nThe asthma is a chronic disease, which may continue to give very great distress, at intervals, for a considerable number of years. Sir John Floyer, when he wrote his celebrated treatise, had laboured under repeated paroxysms for thirty years.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> distinction is into humid and dry; the former is accompanied with an expectoration of mucus or purulent matter, but the latter is not. In the genuine humoral asthma, the patients are obliged to lean forward; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a> is short and spasmodic; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> very slow.\n\nAsthmatic persons have generally some warning of the attack, from a languor, loss of appetite, oppression, and swelling of the stomach from flatulence, which precede the fit; but it is usually in the middle of the night that the violent difficulty of breathing comes on.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the paroxysm is uncertain, as it will sometimes terminate in three or four hours, while at other times it will continue for as many days; nay, it has been known to last three weeks without intermission. While it subsists, the patient is in very great distress, not being able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, nor scarcely to speak or expectorate, so great is the difficulty of breathing; and yet, notwithstanding all this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> interruption to the free passage of the blood through the lungs, an inflammation here seldom or never supervenes a fit of the asthma. As the paroxysm wears off, and the breathing becomes free, there is more or less of an expectoration of mucus; and the urine, from being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> and limpid, becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> coloured, and lets fall a copious sediment.\n\nIn order to obtain relief in the fit, we must sometimes bleed, unless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> weakness or old age should forbid, and repeat it according to the degrees of strength and fulness: a purging clyster, with a solution of asafoetida, must be immediately injected; and if the violence of the symptoms should not speedily abate, it will be proper to apply a blistering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a> to the neck or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>.\n\nIn the height of the paroxysm, an emetic might be followed.\nSpasms followed by dangerous symptoms, as it would increase the accumulation of blood in the vessels of the head; but vomiting will often prevent a fit of the asthma, especially if the stomach should chance to be loaded with any sort of saburra. A very strong infusion of roasted coffee has been found to give ease in an asthmatic paroxysm.\n\nSir John Pringle says it is the best abater of the paroxysms of the periodic asthma that he has seen. The coffee ought to be of the best Mocca, newly burnt, and made very strong immediately after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> it. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> ordered an ounce for one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISH\">dish</a>; which is to be repeated fresh after the interval of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> or half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>; and which is to be taken without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>. The medicine in general is mentioned by Musgrave in his treatise de Arthritide anomala; but he first heard of it from a physician in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITCHFIELD\">Litchfield</a>, who had been informed by the old people of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, that Sir John Floyer, during the latter part of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, kept free from, or at least lived easy under, his asthma, from the use of very strong coffee. This discovery, it seems, he made after the publication of his book upon that disease. Dr Percival says he has frequently directed coffee in the asthma with great success.\n\nIn the intervals of the fit, persons subject to the asthma, especially the humid species, should take emetics from time to time. An infusion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> is an emetic that has been said to be very serviceable in some asthmatic cases; but its operation is both so distressing and so dangerous, that it will never probably be introduced into common use as an emetic. Smoking or chewing the same has been known to prevent the frequency and severity of the paroxysms. Asthmatic patients may also use the lac ammoniaci, with a due proportion of oxymel scillitum and vinum antimoniale, with a view to promote expectoration; or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> ammoniac, and others of similar virtues, may be formed into pills, and combined with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, as mentioned for the dyspnea pituitosa; or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> may be composed of asafoetida and balsam of Tolu, with syrup of garlic; and these pills may be washed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by a medicated wine, impregnated with squills, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-radish root, and mustard seed; or a strong bitter infusion, with a little antimonial wine.\n\nIn some cases crude <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> will be found serviceable; in others flowers of sulphur, made into an elixir with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> or syrup of garlic; and if, notwithstanding the use of these things, a costive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> should prevail, it will be necessary, from time to time, to give a few grains of pills of aloes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYRRH\">myrrh</a>, soap and aloes, or a mass of equal parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a>, scammony, and soap.\n\nThe dry or spasmodic asthma, during the extreme violence of the fit, is best relieved by opiates; and sometimes very large doses are required. But in order to obtain permanent relief, nothing is found to answer better than ipecacuanha in small doses. Three, five, eight, or ten grains, according to the strength and constitution of the patient, given every other day, have been productive of the happiest effects; acting sometimes as an evacuant, pumping up the viscid phlegm; at others, as an antispasmodic or sedative. Issues are generally recommended in both species, and will often be found useful.\n\nChanges of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> are usually felt very sensibly by asthmatic people, who in general cannot live with tolerable ease in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> of large cities; though we shall sometimes meet with patients who agree better with this air, which is so replete with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> effluvia of various kinds, than with the purest that can be found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> situations. And some are found who breathe with the most ease in a crowded room, with a fire and candles.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> diet of meats that are easy of digestion, and not flatulent, is requisite for asthmatic people; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of riding is often highly serviceable.\n\nWhen the asthma is found to depend on some other disease, whether it be the gout or an intermittent fever, or when it proceeds from the striking in of some cutaneous eruption, regard must always be had to the primary disease: thus, in the asthma arthriticum, simpisms to the feet, or blistering, will be absolutely necessary, in order, if possible, to bring on a fit of the gout. And when the dregs of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGUE\">ague</a> give rise to an asthma, which is termed febriculoseum, and invades at regular intervals, we must have recourse to the Peruvian bark. The asthma exanthematicum will require blisters or issues, to give vent to the acrid matters which were repelled from the surface of the body; and courses of sulphureous waters, goats whey, and sweetening diet drinks, or perhaps mercurial alternatives, in order to correct the sharpness of the juices.\n\n**Genus LVI. DYSPNOEA:**\n\n*Habitual Difficulty of Breathing.*\n\nDyspnea, Sauv. gen. 144. Lin. 160. Vog. 267, Sag. 251. Junck. 32.\n\nSp. I. The Catarrhal Dyspnoea.\n\nAsthma catarrhale, Sauv. sp. 16.\n\nAsthma pneumonicum, Willis Pharm. rat. P. II. sect. i. cap. 12.\n\nAsthma pituitosum, Hoffm. III. sect. ii. cap. 2: \u00a7 3.\n\nAsthma pneumodes, Sauv. sp. 17.\n\nThis is readily known by the symptoms of pneumonia and catarrh attending it; and to the removal of these symptoms the care of the physician must be principally directed.\n\nSp. II. The Dry Dyspnoea.\n\nDyspnea \u00e0 tuberculis, \u00e0 hydatibus, &c. Sauv. sp. 2, 4, 5, 20.\n\nOrthopnea \u00e0 lipomate, Sauv. sp. 18.\n\nThis is generally accompanied with a phthisis pulmonalis; but Sauvages mentions one species of phthisis to which the dry dyspnea seems more particularly to belong. The patients fall away by degrees, and have a great difficulty of breathing, continual thirst, and little or no spitting. When opened after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, their lungs are found not to be ulcerated, but shrivelled and contracted as if they had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>-dried. Goldsmiths and chemists are said to be subject to this disease, by reason of the vapours they draw in with their breath. Sauvages doth not mention any particular remedy. Shortness of breath arising from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a>, as they are termed, or a seirrhus enlargement of the lymphatic glands which are dispersed through the lungs, is com-\nSp. III. Dyspnoea from Changes in the Weather.\n\n(Sauv. sp. 12.)\n\nThis seems to be a disease entirely spasmodic, and the antispasmodics already related are accordingly indicated.\n\nSp. IV. The Dyspnoea from Earthy Substances formed in the Lungs.\n\nSauvages mentions this disease as much more common in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a> than in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>; but Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a> mentions his having seen some instances of it; and we have several accounts by different authors of calculous matters being coughed up by people labouring under a dyspnoea, and threatened with consumption. In three cases of this kind which fell under Dr Cullen's inspection, there was no appearance of earthy or stony concretions in any other part of the body. The calcareous matter was coughed up frequently with a little blood, sometimes with mucus only, and sometimes with pus. In one of these cases, an exquisite phthisis came on, and proved mortal; in the other two the symptoms of phthisis were never fully formed; and after some time, merely by a milk diet and avoiding irritation, the patients entirely recovered.\n\nSauvages also greatly recommends milk in these cases, and soap for dissolving the concretions. The reason why brutes are more subject to these pulmonary calculi than mankind, is, that they very seldom cough, and thus the stagnating mucus or lymph concretes into a kind of gypseous matter.\n\nSp. V. The Watery Dyspnoea.\n\nDyspnoea pituitosa, Sauv. sp. 1.\nOrthopnoea ab hydropneumonia, Sauv. sp. 12.\n\nThis may arise from too great a defluxion of mucus on the lungs, or from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of serum, as is mentioned under the pneumonia. The treatment of the disease may be gathered from what has been already said under the heads of Pneumonia, Catarrh, Empyema, &c.\n\nSp. VI. The Dyspnoea from Corpulency.\n\nOrthopnoea \u00e0 pinguedine, Sauv. sp. 6.\n\nThere have been many instances of suffocation and death occasioned by too great corpulency. These fatal effects, however, may be almost always avoided, if the persons have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to persist in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and very temperate course of life; avoiding animal food, much sleep, and using a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of exercise. In the third volume of the Medical Observations, however, there is an extraordinary instance of internal obesity which neither showed itself externally, nor could be removed by any medicines.\n\nOther species of dyspnoea have been considered under Phthisis. It is frequently symptomatic of diseases of the heart and large vessels, or swellings of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>, &c.\n\nGenus LVII. Pertussis.\n\nChincough.\n\nPertussis, Sydenham, Ed.

This disease comes on at first like a common cold; but is from the beginning attended with a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of dyspnoea than is common in catarrh; and there is a remarkable affection of the eyes, as if they were swelled, and a little pushed out of their sockets. By degrees the fits of coughing become longer and more violent, till at last they are plainly convulsive, so that for a considerable time the patient cannot respire, and when at last he recovers his breath, inspiration is performed with a shrill kind of noise like the crowing of a cock. This kind of inspiration serves only as an introduction to another convulsive fit of coughing, which is in like manner followed by another inspiration of the same kind; and thus it continues for some time, very often till the patient vomit, which puts an end to the paroxysm at that time. These paroxysms are attended with a violent determination of the blood towards the head, so that the vessels become extremely turgid, and blood not unfrequently flows from the mouth and nose. The disease is tedious, and often continues for many months. It is not commonly attended with fever, unless at the commencement.\n\nCauses, &c. The chincough is an infectious disorder, and very often epidemic; but the nature of the contagion is not understood; at least it is no farther understood than that of smallpox, measles, or similar epidemics. We well know that it is from a peculiar and specific contagion alone that this disease, as well as the others above mentioned, can arise. But with regard to the nature of any of them, we are totally in the dark. It generally attacks children, or adults of a lax habit, making its attack frequently in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> or autumn; at the same time, when this contagion is introduced into any town, village, or neighbourhood, it will rage epidemically at any season. Those alone are affected with this disease who had never before been subjected to it. For in this affection, as well as in smallpox, having had the disease once, gives <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> against future contagion. Every individual, however, does not seem to be equally readily affected with this contagion; like other contagious diseases occurring only once in a lifetime, it may naturally be expected to be more frequent among children than at any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of life. But many, though frequently exposed to contagion, are yet not affected with the disease: and those children who live upon unwholesome watery food, or breathe unwholesome air, are most liable to its attack, or at least suffer\nSpasmi. most from them. In general it has been concluded, that whatever weakens the solids, or tends to bring on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, predisposes to this disease, and increases its severity.\n\nPrognosis. The chincough is not very often fatal. During one epidemic, however, it is often observed to be much more dangerous and more severe than during another. This is also remarked with regard even to particular periods of the same epidemic; and it is also observed, that on certain families this disease is much more severe than on others. Its danger, however, is still more connected with the period of life at which it occurs. In children under two years of age it is most dangerous; and kills them by producing convulsions, suffocation, inflammation, and suppuration of the brain or in the lungs, ruptures, and neurulation of the spine. In pregnant women it will produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABORTION\">abortion</a>; and in adults inflammations of the lungs, and all the consequences of pneumonia, more frequently than in children. From a long continuance of the disease patients will become asthmatic, ricketty, and scrofulous. It is generally reckoned a good sign when a fit terminates by vomiting; for in this disease there seems to be a great increase of the secretion of mucus, and the vomiting affords great relief.\n\nCure. Pertussis is one of those diseases which, after the contagion has exerted its influence, can be terminated only by running a certain course: but it is much less limited in its course than smallpox and measles, and often it runs on to a very great length, or at least it is very difficult to distinguish certain sequelae of this disease from the disease itself. And when it exists in the former of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, it admits of an artificial termination. In the treatment of this affection, therefore, the objects at which a practitioner chiefly aims, are in the first place, the obviating urgent symptoms, and forwarding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> termination of the disease; and secondly, the inducing an artificial termination. With these intentions various practices are employed on different occasions. The most approved remedies are vomits, purges, bleeding, and the attenuating pectorals; for the other kinds generally do hurt: but large evacuations of any kind are pernicious. In the Medical Observations, vol. iii. Dr Morris recommends castor and cinchona: but in cases attended with any degree of inflammation, the latter must certainly do hurt, and the former will generally be insignificant. Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">Butter</a>, in a dissertation expressly on the subject, relates 20 cases of it cured by the extract of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HEMLOCK\">hemlock</a>. He directs half a grain daily for a child under six months old; one grain for a child from six months to two years; afterwards allowing half a grain for every year of the patient's age till he be 20: beyond that period, he directs ten grains to be given for the first day's consumption, gradually increasing the dose according to the effect. If the patient have not two stools daily, he advises <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a>, or the sulphur potassae cum sulphure, to be added to the hemlock mixture. By this method he says the peculiar symptoms of the disease are removed in the space of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>; nothing but a slight cough remaining. The use of hemlock, however, has by no means become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this publication, nor indeed has this remedy been found equally successful with others who have given it a fair trial.\n\nThe remedy most to be depended upon in this disease is change of air. The patient, as soon as the disease is fully formed, ought to be removed to some other part of the country: but there is no occasion for going to a distant place; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> or two, or frequently a smaller distance, will be sufficient; and in this new habitation, the frequency of the cough is almost instantly diminished to a most surprising degree. After remaining there for some time, however, the cough will often be observed to become again more frequent, and the other symptoms increased. In this case, another change of air, or even a return to the former habitation, becomes necessary. Manifest benefit has even been derived by changing a patient from one room of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> to another. But although change of air has thus been advantageous, it must also be remarked, that when it has been had recourse to at very early periods it has often done mischief, particularly by aggravating the febrile and inflammatory symptoms. If the disease be attended with fever, bleeding and other antiphlogistic remedies are proper. Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCHAN\">Buchan</a> recommends an ointment made of equal parts of garlic and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HOG\">hog</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-LARD\">lard</a> applied to the soles of the feet; but if it have any effect, it is probably merely as an emplastrum calidum. It ought to be put on a rag and applied like a plaster. Opiates may sometimes be useful, but in general are to be avoided. They are chiefly serviceable where the cough is very frequent, with little expectoration. In these cases benefit has sometimes also been derived from sulphuric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, and sometimes from the tincture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTHARIDES\">cantharides</a>. An almost instantaneous termination has on some occasions been put to this disease by exciting a high degree of fear, or by inducing another febrile contagion: But the effects of both are too uncertain and too dangerous to be employed in practice.\n\nGenus LVIII.

The Spasmodic Colic.\n\nColica flatulenta, pituitosa, Sauv. sp. 1. 2. 5. 6. 7.\nDescription. The colic is chiefly known by a violent pain in the abdomen, commonly about the umbilical region. The pain resembles various kinds of sensations, as of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>, twisting, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BORING\">boring</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIGATURE\">ligature</a> drawn very tight, &c. The belly is generally costive, though sometimes there is a violent evacuation of bilious matters upwards and downwards. In these cases the disease is sometimes accompanied from the beginning with a weak and intermittent pulse, cold sweats, and fainting. In some the disease comes on gradually, beginning with an habitual costiveness; and if purgatives be taken, they do not operate. The pain comes on generally after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, and soon occasions nausea and vomiting. Sometimes the disease is attended with pyrexia, violent thirst, and a full pulse; the vomiting becomes more violent, and excrementitious matters are thrown up with the most exquisite pain and tension of the abdomen; and hiccup comes on, which continues obstinately; till at last a cessation of pain and fetid breath indicate a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> of the intestines and approaching death. Sometimes the peristaltic motion of the intestines is so totally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>, that all their contents are evacuated by the mouth, and even clsters will be vomited; which constitutes that disease commonly called the iliac passion.\n\nCauses, &c. Colics may arise from any sudden check given to perspiration, as by violent cold applied to any part of the body, especially to the lower extremities and abdomen. Very frequently they are occasioned by austere, acid, or indigestible aliments taken into the stomach. By any of these, a violent colic, or indeed an iliac passion, may be occasioned; for Dr Cullen justly observes, that this last, though commonly accounted a different species of disease, differs from colic in no other way than in being in every respect in a much higher degree. In those who have died of this disease and been dissected, the intestines have sometimes been found twisted; but more commonly there hath been an intrasusception of the intestine, that is, one part of the gut seems to have entered within the other. In the Edinburgh Medeal Essays, vol. iii. we have a dissertation on the use of the warm bath in the bilious colic, in which the author derives the disorder from a spasmodic constriction of the intestine occasioned by the acrimony of the bile. By this, he says, the intestine is not only contracted into an unusual narrowness, but the sides of it have been found, upon dissection, so closely joined, that no passage could be made downwards more than if they had been strongly tied by a ligature. The formation of the intrasusception he explains by quoting a passage from Peyerus, who made the following experiment on a frog. Having irritated the intestine of the animal in several different places, he observed it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> at those places most violently, and to protrude its contents upwards and downwards wherever the relaxed state of the part would permit; by which means the contents were heaped together in different parts. Hence some parts of the intestine being dilated much more than enough, by reason of the great quantity of matter thrown into them, formed a kind of sack which readily received the constricted part into it. If this happen in the human body, there is the greatest danger of a mortification; because the part which is constricted, and at any rate disposed to inflammation, has that disposition very much increased by its confinement within the other, and by the pressure of the contents of the alimentary canal from the stomach downwards upon it. An iliae passion may also arise from the strangulation of part of the intestine in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERNIA\">hernia</a>; and even a very small portion of it thus strangulated may occasion a fatal disease. In the Medeal Observations, vol. iv. however, we have an account of an iliac passion arising from a very different cause, which could neither have been suspected nor cured by any other way than the operation of gastrotony, or opening the abdomen of the patient, in order to remove the cause of the disorder. The patient, a woman of about 28 years of age, died after suffering extreme torture for six days. The body being opened, some quantity of a dirty coloured fluid was found in the cavity of the abdomen. The jejunum and ileum were greatly distended with air. A portion of the omentum adhered to the mesentery, near that part where the ileum terminates in the cecum. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a>, which was close to the spine, there ran a ligamentous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> about two inches and a half long, unequally thick, in some places not thicker than a packthread; which by its other extremity adhered to the coats of the ileum, about two inches above the cecum. This cord formed a circle with the mesentery, large enough to admit a hen's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through it. The cord had formed a noose (in a manner difficult to be explained), which included a doubling of about two inches of the lower end of the ileum, and was drawn so tight, that it not only put a stop to the passage of every thing through the bowels, and brought on a gangrene of the strangulated part, but it had even cut through all the coats of the intestine on the opposite side to the mesentery, and made an aperture about an inch long. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the Academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SURGERY\">Surgery</a> are mentioned several similar cases.\n\nPrognosis. The colic is never to be reckoned void of danger, as it may unexpectedly terminate in an inflammation and gangrene of the intestines. Those species of it which are attended with purging must be considered as much less dangerous than those in which the vomiting is very violent. The iliac passion, or that attended with the vomiting of feces, is always to be accounted highly dangerous; but if the passage through the intestines be free, even though their peristaltic motion should be inverted, and clsters evacuated by the mouth, there is much more hope of a cure, than when the belly is obstinately costive, and there is some fixed obstruction which seems to bid defiance to all remedies.\n\nCure. In the cure of the spasmodic colic, the recovery must ultimately depend on producing a resolution of the spasmodic affection. In order to accomplish this, it is in general necessary to evacuate the contents of the intestines, and to remove morbid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> existing in that part of the system. But in order to preserve the life of the patient from the most imminent hazard, it is still more necessary to prevent and remove those inflammatory affections which often occur in this disease. As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> danger in colics arises from an inflammation and consequent mortification of\nthe intestines, it is essentially necessary, in the first place, to diminish the tendency to a pyrexia, if there should happen to be any. This is accomplished by bleeding, emollient injections, warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>, and cooling medicines taken inwardly. Dr Porter strongly recommends the warm bath in those colics attended with violent evacuations of bile. He supposes it to do service by relaxing the constriction of the intestines, and thus preventing or removing the intussusception. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time opiates may be given to ease the pain, while every method is tried, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a> and glysters of various kinds to procure a stool. In obstinate cases, where stimulating cathartics have proved ineffectual, the milder kinds, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">manna</a>, senna, oleum ricini, &c. will sometimes succeed; but when every thing of this kind fails, recourse must be had to some of the more extraordinary methods. Some have recommended the swallowing of leaden bullets, on a supposition that by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> they would force through the obstruction; but these seem much more likely to create than to remove an obstruction. It is impossible they can act by their gravity, because the intestines do not lie in a straight line from the pylorus to the anus; and though this were actually the case, we cannot suppose that the weight of a leaden bullet could prove very efficacious in removing either a spasmodic constriction or an obstruction from any other cause. But when we consider not only that the intestines consist of a great multitude of folds, but that their peristaltic motion (by which only the contents are forced through them) is inverted, the futility of this remedy must be evident. It might rather be supposed to aggravate the disease; as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, by its pressure, would tend to fix the intussusception more firmly, or perhaps push it still farther on. The same thing may be said of quicksilver: not to mention the pernicious consequences to be apprehended from swallowing large quantities of this mineral, even if it should prove efficacious in relieving the patient for the present. There are, however, some late cases on record, particularly one by Mr William Perry, published in the sixteenth volume of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, in which the hydrargyrus, swallowed in great quantities, was attended with the happiest effects, after every other remedy had been tried in vain.\n\nAnother method has been proposed, in the Medical Essays, for relieving the miserable patients in this disorder, which in many cases has been known to do service. The patient is to be taken out of bed, and made to walk about on the cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> of a damp apartment. At the same time, basins of cold water are to be dashed on his feet, legs, and thighs; and this must be continued for an hour or longer, if a stool be not procured before that time, though this will generally be the case much sooner. The exercise does not at all impair the patient's strength, but rather adds to it; and some very remarkable instances are adduced in the 6th volume of the Medical Essays, where this proved effectual after all other medicines had failed. In one person the disease had come on with a habitual costiveness; and he had been for a week tormented with the most violent pain and vomiting, which could be stopped neither by anodynes nor any other medicines, the sharpest glysters being returned unaltered, and all kinds of purgatives thrown up soon after they were swallowed; but by the above-mentioned method, a stool was procured in 35 minutes, and the patient recovered. In some others the costiveness had continued for a much longer time.\n\nOther remedies are, the blowing air into the intestines by means of a bellows, and the injecting glysters of the smoke of tobacco. But neither of these seem very capable of removing the disease. They can affect only the parts below the obstruction; while, to cure the disease, it is necessary that the obstructed parts themselves should be reached by the medicine, and therefore we have not many well-attested instances of their success. In some obstinate cases, however, benefit has certainly been derived from tobacco-smoke injections, and likewise from injections of tepid water to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of several pounds. For putting in practice these modes of cure, a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> has been contrived; and in cases even apparently desperate, neither should be neglected. The cold water gives a general and very considerable shock to the system, checks the perspiration, and thus drives the humours inward upon the intestines, by which they receive a much more effectual stimulus than can be supposed to arise from any kind of glyster. But when all methods have failed, the only chance the patient can have for life is by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> operation.\n\nIn those colics which are attended with faintings, &c. from the beginning, and which generally attack hysterical women and other debilitated persons, all kinds of evacuations are pernicious; and the cure is to be attempted by anodynes and cordials, which will seldom fail of success. Even there also, however, it is necessary that the belly should be moved; and for this purpose injections, containing a solution of asafoetida, which operate powerfully as antispasmodics, are preferable to most other modes of cure.\n\nSp. II. Colica Pictonum. The Colic of Poictou.\n\nRachialgia Pictonum, Sauv. sp. 1.\nRachialgia metallica, Sauv. sp. 3.\nColica Pictonum Citesii.\n\nAnother cause to which violent colics are frequently to be ascribed, and which often gives occasion to them where it is very little suspected, is lead, or some solution or fume of it, received into the body. To this cause is evidently owing the colics to which plumbers, lead-miners, and smelters of lead are subject. To the same cause, though not so apparent at first sight, are we to ascribe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a> colic, where lead is received into the body dissolved in cider, the common drink of the inhabitants of that country. This has been proved by experiment; for lead has been extracted from cider in quantity sufficient to produce pernicious effects on the human body. The colic of Poictou, and what is called the dry belly-ach in the West Indies, are of the same nature: for which reason we give the following general description of the symptoms of all these diseases.\n\nThe patient is generally first seized with an acute pain at the pit of the stomach, which extends itself down with gripping pains to the bowels. Soon after there is a distention, as with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>; and frequent retchings to vomit, without bringing up any thing but small quantities of bile and phlegm. An obstinate costiveness follows, yet sometimes attended with a tenesmus, and\nand the bowels seem to the patient as if they were drawn up towards the back; at other times they are drawn into hard lumps, or hard rolls, which are plainly perceptible to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> on the belly. Sometimes the coats of the intestines seem to be drawn up from the anus and down from the pylorus towards the navel. When a stool is procured by artificial means, as clysters, &c., the feces appear in little hard knots like sheep's dung, called seybada, and are in small quantity. There is, however, usually an obstinate costiveness; the urine is discharged in small quantity, frequently with pain and much difficulty. The pulse is generally low, though sometimes a little quickened by the violence of the pain; but inflammatory symptoms very seldom occur. The extremities are often cold, and sometimes the violence of the pain causes cold clammy sweats and fainting. The mind is generally much affected, and the spirits are sunk. The disease is often tedious, especially if improperly treated, insomuch that the patients will continue in this miserable state for twenty or thirty days successively; nay, instances have been known of its continuing for six months. In this case the pains at last become almost intolerable: the patient's breath acquires a strong fetid smell like excrements, from a retention of the feces, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of the putrid effluvia from them by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LACTEALS\">lacteals</a>. At last, when the pain in the bowels begins to abate, a pain comes on in the shoulder-joints and adjoining muscles, with an unusual sensation and tingling along the spinal marrow. This soon extends itself from thence to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> of the arms and legs, which become weak; and that weakness increases till the extreme parts become paralytic, with a total loss of motion, though a benumbed sensation often remains. Sometimes, by a sudden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METASTASIS\">metastasis</a>, the brain becomes affected, a stupor and delirium come on, and the nervous system is irritated to such a degree as to produce general convulsions, which are frequently followed by death. At other times, the peristaltic motion of the intestines is inverted, and a true iliac passion is produced, which also proves fatal in a short time. Sometimes the paralytic affection of the extremities goes off, and the pain of the bowels returns with its former violence; and on the cessation of the pain in the intestines, the extremities again become paralytic; and thus the pain and palsy will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> for a very long time.\n\nCure. Various methods have been attempted for removing this terrible disease. The obstinate costiveness which attends it, made physicians at first exhibit very strong purgatives and stimulating clysters. But these medicines, by increasing the convulsive spasms of the intestines, were found to be pernicious. Balsam of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>, by its warm aromatic power, was found to succeed much better; and Dr Sydenham accordingly prescribed it in the quantity of 40 drops twice or thrice a-day taken on sugar. This, with gentle purgatives, opiates, and some drops of the hotter essential oils, continued to be the medicine commonly employed in this disease, till a specific was published by Dr Lionel Chalmers of South Carolina. This receipt was purchased by Dr Chalmers from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> where it had long been kept a secret. The only unusual medicine in this receipt, and on which the efficacy of it chiefly if not wholly depends, is sulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>. This must be dissolved in water, in the quantity of one grain to an ounce, and the dose of the solution is a wine-glassful given fasting for nine successive mornings. For the first four or five days this medicine discharges much aeruginous bile both ways; but the exertions of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> lessen by degrees; and before the course be ended, it has little other effect than to cause some degree of squeamishness, or promote a few bilious stools, or perhaps may not move the patient at all. At the time of using this medicine the patients should live upon broth made of lean meat, gruel, or panada: but about the seventh or eighth day, they may be allowed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and boiled chicken. Here the copper seems to do service by its tonic power; and for the same reason <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, recommended by Dr Percival, most probably cures the disease. He says he has found this very efficacious in obstinate affections of the bowels, and that it generally proves a cure in the slighter cases of the colica pectorum. It was given to the quantity of fifteen grains every fourth, fifth, or sixth hour; and the third dose never failed to mitigate the pain, and sometimes entirely removed it. Among purgative medicines the oleum recini is found to be the most efficacious. Mercury also, particularly under the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALOMEL\">calomel</a>, has often been employed with success. And much benefit has been derived from combining the calomel with opium. From this combination there is often obtained, in the first instance, an alleviation of the pain, and afterwards a free discharge by the belly.\n\nSp. III. The Colic from Costiveness.\n\nColica stercorea, Sauv. sp. 3.\nIleus \u00e0 fecibus induratis, Sauv. sp. 2.\n\nFor the treatment of this species, see above.\n\nSp. IV.

The most common and dangerous substances of this kind are corrosive mercury and arsenic. The former is easily decomposed by alkaline salts; and therefore a solution of lixivial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, if swallowed before the poison has time to induce a mortification of the bowels, will prove a certain cure. Much more uncertain, however, is the case when arsenic is swallowed, because there is no certain and speedy solvent of that substance yet known. Milk has been recommended as efficacious; and lately a solution of hepar sulphuris. The latter may possibly do service; as arsenic unites readily with sulphur, and has its pernicious qualities more obfuscated by that than by any other known substance: but indeed, even the solvent powers of this medicine are so weak, that its effects as well as those of others must be very uncertain.\n\nSome kinds of fungi, when swallowed, are apt to produce colics attended with stupor, delirium, and convulsions; and the same sometimes happens from eating a large\nlarge quantity of the shell-fish known by the name of muscles (the *Mytilus*). Some of the fungi, doubtless, may have an inherent poisonous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>; but generally they as well as the muscles act on a different principle. Their pernicious effects happen most commonly when they are taken on an empty stomach; and are then supposed to be occasioned by their adhering so close to its coats, that it cannot exert its powers, and the whole system is thrown into the utmost disorder. The malady may therefore be very easily prevented; but when once it has taken place, it cannot be removed till either vomiting be excited, or the stomach has recovered itself in such a manner as to throw off the adhering matter.\n\n**Sp. V. Colic of New-born <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">Infants</a>, from a Retention of the Meconium. (*Sauv.* sp. 19.)**\n\nThis disorder would be prevented were children allowed immediately to suck their mothers, whose milk at first is purgative. But as this is not commonly done, the child is frequently troubled with colics. These, however, may be removed by a few grains of ippecacuanha, or a drop or two of antimonial wine. By these means the stomach is cleansed by vomiting, and the belly is generally loosened; but if this last effect does not happen, some gentle purge will be necessary.\n\n**Sp. IV. Colic from a Callosity of the Colon.**\n\nIt is often impossible to discover this distemper before the patient's death; and though it should, it does not admit of a cure.\n\n**Sp. VII. The Colic from Intestinal Calculi. (*Sauv.* sp. 10. 15.)**\n\nWhen certain indigestible bodies, such as cherry-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, plum-stones, small pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, &c., are swallowed, they frequently prove the basis of calculi, formed by an accretion of some kind of earthly matter; and being detained in some of the flexures of the intestines, often occasion very violent colics. These calculi do not discover themselves by any peculiar symptoms, nor do they admit of any particular method of cure. In the Medical Essays we have an instance of colics for six years, occasioned by calculi of this kind. The concretions were at last passed by stool; and their passage was procured by causing the patient drink a large quantity of warm water, with a view to promote the evacuation of bile, a redundancy of which was supposed to be the cause of her disorder.\n\n**Genus LX. CHOLERA, the Cholera Morbus.**\n\nCholera, *Sauv.* 253. *Lin.* 186. *Vog.* 110. *Sag.* 183. *Hoffm.* II. 165. *Diarrhoea chol\u00e9rica,* *Junck.* 112.\n\n**Sp. I.

The Accidental Cholera, from acrid matter taken inwardly.**\n\nCholera erapulosa, *Sauv.* sp. 11. Cholera \u00e0 venenis, *Sauv.* sp. 4, 5.\n\nThe cholera shows itself by excessive vomiting and purging of bilious matters, with violent pain, inflation and distention of the belly. Sometimes the patients fall into universal convulsions; and sometimes they are affected with violent spasms in particular parts of the body. There is a great thirst, a small and unequal pulse, cold sweats, fainting, coldness of the extremities, and hiccup; and death frequently ensues in twenty-four hours.\n\nIn this disease, as a great quantity of bile is deposited in the alimentary canal, particularly in the stomach, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is to counteract its influence, and to promote an easy discharge of it. It is next necessary to restrain that increased secretion of bile, by which a fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> in the alimentary canal would otherwise be soon produced. And, in the last place, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> must often be employed to restore a sound condition to the alimentary canal, which is frequently much weakened by the violence of the disease.\n\nOn these grounds, the cure of this distemper is effected by giving the patient a large quantity of warm water, or very weak broth, in order to cleanse the stomach of the irritating matter which occasions the disease, and injecting the same by way of clyster, till the pains begin to abate a little. After this, a large dose of laudanum is to be given in some convenient vehicle, and repeated as there is occasion. But if the vomiting and purging have continued for a long time before the physician be called, immediate recourse must be had to the laudanum, because the patient will be too much exhausted to bear any further evacuations. Sometimes the propensity to vomit is so strong, that nothing will be retained, and the laudanum itself thrown up as soon as swallowed. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> the stomach in these cases, Dr Douglas, in the Medical Essays, recommends a decoction of oat-bread toasted as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> as coffee; and the decoction itself ought to be of the colour of weak coffee. He says he does not remember that this decoction was ever vomited by any of his patients. An infusion of mint leaves, or good simple mint-water is also said to be very efficacious in the same case.\n\nThe tincture of opium is sometimes retained when given in conjunction with a portion of the sulphuric acid properly diluted. But when it cannot be retained in a fluid form by the aid of any addition, it will sometimes sit upon the stomach when taken in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> state.\n\nAfter the violence of the disease is overcome, the alimentary canal, and the stomach in particular, requires to be braced and strengthened. With this view recourse is often had with advantage to different vegetable bitters, particularly to the use of the colombo root; which, while it strengthens the stomach, is also observed to have a remarkable tendency in allaying a disposition to vomiting, which often remains for a considerable time after the cholera may be said to be overcome.\n\n**Genus**\nGENUS LXI.

The Feculent Diarrhoea.\n\nDiarrhoea stercorosa et vulgaris, Sauv. sp. 1. 2.\n\nThis is occasioned by too great a quantity of matter thrown into the alimentary canal; and what is discharged has not the appearance of excrements, but is much whiter, and of a thinner consistence. Voracious people who do not sufficiently chew their food, gormandizers, and even those who stammer in their speech, are said to be liable to this disease. In slighter cases it is removed without any medicine, or by a dose of rhubarb; but where the matters have acquired a putrid taint, the disorder may be much protracted and become dangerous. In this case lenient and antiseptic purgatives are to be made use of, after which the cure is to be completed by astringents.\n\nSp. II. Bilious Diarrhoea.\n\n(Sauv. sp. 8).\n\nThis distemper shows itself by copious stools of a very yellow colour, attended with gripes and locat of the bowels, thirst, bitterness and dryness of the mouth, yellowness of the tongue, and frequently follows an intermitting or bilious fever. When the fever is gone, the diarrhoea is to be removed by acidulated and cooling drinks, with small doses of nitre.\n\nSp. III. The Mucous Diarrhoea.\n\nDiarrhoea lactentium, Sauv. sp. 19.\nDysenteria Parisiaca, Sauv. sp. 3.\nDiarrhoea ab hypercatarsi, Sauv. sp. 16.\nDysenteria a catharticis, Sauv. sp. 12.\nPituitaria, Vog. 111.\nLeucorrhoeis, Vog. 112.\nDiarrhoea pituitosa, Sauv. sp. 4.\nCoeliaca mucosa, Sauv. sp. 3.\nDiarrhoea serosa, Sauv. sp. 10.\na. Diarrhoea urinosa.\n\nThis kind of diarrhoea, besides the matters usually excreted, is attended with a copious dejection of the mucus of the intestines with great pain; while the patient daily pines away, but without any fever.\u2014Persons of all ages are liable to it, and it comes on usually in the winter-time; but is so obstinate, that it will sometimes continue for years. In obstinate loosenesses of this kind, vomits frequently repeated are of the greatest service. It is also very beneficial to keep the body warm, and rub the belly with stimulating ointments; at the same time that astringent clysters, rhubarb, and stomachic medicines, are to be exhibited. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STARCH\">Starch</a> clysters are very often efficacious.\u2014Some kinds of looseness are contagious; and Sir John Pringle mentions a soldier who laboured under an obstinate diarrhoea, who infected all those that used the same privy with himself. In the looseness which frequently followed a dysentery, the same author tells us that he began the cure with giving a vomit of ipecacuanha, after which he put the patients on a course of astringents. He used a mixture of three drachms of extract of logwood, dissolved in an ounce and a half of spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CINNAMON\">cinnamon</a>, to which was added seven ounces of common water, and two drachms of tincture of catechu. Of this the patient took two spoonfuls once in four or five hours, and sometimes also an opiate at bedtime. He recommends the same medicine in obstinate diarrhoeas of all kinds. A decoction of simarauba bark was also found effectual, when the dysenteric symptoms had gone off. Dr Huck, who used this article in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, also recommends it in diarrhoeas. Two or three ounces of the simarauba are to be boiled in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> and a half of water to a pound, and the whole quantity taken throughout the day. He began with the weakest decoction; and, when the stomach of the patient could easily bear it, he then ordered the strongest; but at the same time he acknowledges, that, unless the sick found themselves sensibly better within three days from the time they began the medicine, they seldom afterwards received any benefit from it. But when all astringents have failed, Sir John Pringle informs us, he hath known a cure effected by a milk and farinaceous diet; and he thinks in all cases the disorder would be much more easily removed, if the patients could be prevailed on to abstain entirely from spirituous liquors and animal food. If the milk by itself should turn sour on the stomach, a third part of lime-water may be added. In one case he found a patient receive more benefit from good butter-milk than from sweet-milk. The chief drinks are decoctions of barley, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, calcined hartshorn, toast and water, or milk and water.\n\nSp. IV. The Coeliac Passion.\n\nCoeliaca chylosa, Sauv. sp. 1.\nCoeliaca lactea, Sauv. sp. 4.\n\nThere are very great differences among physicians concerning the nature of this disease. Sauvages says, from Arctetus, it is a chronic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a>, in which the aliment is discharged half digested. It is attended with great pains of the stomach, resembling the prickling of pins; rumbling and flatus in the intestines; white stools, because deprived of bile, while the patient becomes weak and lean. The disease is tedious, periodical, and difficult to be cured. Sauvages adds, that none of the moderns seem to have observed the disease properly; that the excrements indeed are white, on account of a deficiency of the bile, but the belly is bound as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JAUNDICE\">jaundice</a>. Dr Cullen says there is a dejection of a milky liquid of the nature of chyle; but this is treated by Vogel as a vulgar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. He accuses the moderns of copying from Arctetus, who mentions white faeces as a symptom of the distemper; from whence authors have readily fallen into the notion that they never appeared of any other colour in persons.\npersons labouring under the celiac passion. This error quickly produced another, which has been very generally received; namely, that the chyle was thrown out of the lacteals by reason of some obstruction there, and thus passed along with the excrements; of which he says there is not the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, and agrees with Areteus that the whiteness is only occasioned by the want of bile. He endeavours to prove at length, that the celiac passion can neither be occasioned by an obstruction of the lacteals, nor of the mesenteric glands; though he owns that such as have died of this disease and were dissected, had obstructions in the mesenteric glands; but he denies that all those in whom such obstructions occur, are subject to the celiac passion. He considers the distemper as arising from a cachexy of the stomachic and intestinal juices; and directs the cure to be attempted by emetics, purgatives, antiscptics, and tonics, as in other species of diarrhoea.\n\nSp. V. The Lientery.\n\nLienteria spontanea, Sauv. sp. 2.\n\nThe lientery, according to Sauvages, differs from the celiac passion only in being a slighter species of the disease. The aliment passes very quickly through the intestines, with scarce any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>. The patients do not complain of pain, but are sometimes affected with an intolerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>. The cure is to be attempted by stomachics and tonics, especially the Peruvian bark. This disease is most common at the earlier periods of life; and then rhubarb in small quantities, particularly when combined with magnesia, is often productive of the best effects.\n\nSp. VI. The Hepatic Flux.\n\nHepatirrhoea intestinalis, Sauv. sp. 2.\n\nThe hepatic diarrhoea is by Sauvages described as a flux of bloody serous matter like the washings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, which percolates through the coats of the intestines by means of the anastomosing vessels. It is the celiac passion of Trillianus; and which, according to Sauvages, rarely, if ever, occurs as a primary disease. It has, however, been observed to follow an inflammation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a>, and then almost always proves fatal.\n\nGENUS LXII.

Observ. 122.\n\nDescription. The diabetes first shows itself by a dryness of the mouth and thirst, white frothy spittle, and the urine in somewhat larger quantity than usual. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> begins to be perceived in the bowels, which at first is a little pungent, and gradually increases. The thirst continues to augment by degrees, and the patient gradually loses the power of retaining his urine for any length of time. It is remarkable, that though the patients drink much, the quantity of urine always exceeds what is drank. In Dr Home's Clinical Experiments we have an account of two patients labouring under this disease: one of them drank between 10 and 12 English pints a-day without being satisfied. The quantity was greater in the forenoon than in the afternoon. In the other case was reversed. He drank about four pints a-day, and more in the afternoon than the forenoon. The former discharged from 12 to 15 pints of urine in the day: the latter, 11 or 12; so that his urine always exceeded his drink by eight or at least seven pints. When the urine is retained a little while, there is a swelling of the loins, feet, and scrotum; in this disease the strength gradually decays; the skin is dry and shrivelled; oedematous swellings arise in various parts of the body, but afterwards subside without relieving the disease in the least; and the patient is frequently carried off by convulsions.\n\nThe most singular phenomenon in this disease is, that the urine seems to be entirely or very much divested of an animal nature, and to be largely impregnated with a saccharine matter scarce distinguishable from that obtained from the sugar-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>. This discovery was first made by Dr Dobson of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>, who made some experiments on the urine of a person labouring under a diabetes, who discharged 28 pints of urine every day, taking during the same time from 12 to 14 pounds of solid and liquid food. Some of this urine being set aside, fell into a spontaneous effervescence, changed first into a vinous liquor, and afterwards into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACETOUS\">acetous</a> one, before it became putrid and offensive. Eight ounces of blood taken from the same patient, separated into crassamentum and serum; the latter being sweet to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, but less so than the urine. Two quarts of the urine, evaporated to dryness, left a white cake weighing four ounces two drams and two scruples. This cake was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a>, and broke easily between the fingers: it smelled sweet like brown sugar; neither could it by the taste be distinguished from sugar, except that it left a slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of coolness on the tongue. The experiment was repeated after the patient was recovered to such a degree as to pass only 14 pints of urine a-day. There was now a strong urinous smell during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>; and the residuum could not be procured in a solid form; but was blackish, and much resembled very thick treacle. In Dr Home's patients, the serum of the blood had no supernatural sweetness; in one of them the crassamentum was\nwas covered with a thick inflammatory crust. In one of these patients the urine yielded an ounce and a half, and in the other an ounce, of saccharine matter from each pound. It had, however, an urinous smell, and a saline taste mixed with the sweet one; and the urine of one fermented with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YEAST\">yeast</a>, we are told, into \"tolerable small-beer.\" Both these patients had a voracious appetite, and perpetual gnawing sense of hunger; as had also Dr Dobson's patient. The insipid urine of those affected with diabetes has not been examined by physicians with sufficient accuracy to enable us to speak with confidence of its contents.\n\nCauses. These are exceedingly obscure and uncertain; spasms of the nervous system, debility, and everything inducing it, but especially strong diuretics and immoderate venery, have been accused of bringing on the diabetes. It has, however, occurred in persons where none of these causes could be suspected; nor have the best physicians been able to determine it.\u2014Dissections have only shown that the kidneys were in an enlarged and lax state. In one of Dr Home's patients who died, they smelled sour; which showed that the urine peculiar to diabetes came from the kidneys, and was not sent directly from the intestines by a retrograde motion of the lymphatics, as some imagine.\n\nPrognosis. The diabetes is rarely cured, unless when taken at the very beginning, which is seldom done; and in a confirmed diabetes the prognosis must therefore be unfavourable.\n\nCure. As there is reason to believe that in this affection the morbid secretion of urine, which is both preternatural in point of quantity and of quality, arises from a morbid diminution of tone in the kidney, the great object in the cure must be the restoration of due tone to the secreting vessels of the kidney. But as even this diminished tone would not give rise to the peculiar vitiated secretion without a morbid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of that organ, it is necessarily a second object to remove this morbid sensibility. But besides this, the morbid secretion of urine may also be counteracted both by a diminution of the determination of fluids to the kidney, and by preventing the occurrence of superfluous water in the general mass of blood.\n\nOn these grounds the principal hopes of a cure in this distemper are from astringent and strengthening medicines. Dr Dobson's patient was relieved by the following remedies; which, however, were frequently varied, as none of them produced their good effects for any length of time: Cinchona in substance, with small doses of rhubarb; decoction of the bark, with the acid elixir of vitriol; the cold infusion of the bark, of which he drank from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">quart</a> to two quarts daily; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a>'s powder; alum-whey; lime-water; antimonials combined with tinctura thebaica. The warm bath was used occasionally when the skin was remarkably hot and dry, and the patient complained of restlessness and anxiety. The tincture of cantharides was likewise tried; but he could never take more than 25 drops for a dose, without exciting great uneasiness in his bowels. The body was kept constantly open, either with rhubarb or the infusion of senna joined with rhubarb. His common drinks were rice-water, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-BARLEY_WATER\">barley-water</a>, lime-water, and milk; lime-water alone; sage, balm, or mint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>; small beer, simple water, and water acidulated with the sulphuric acid. In seven months, these remedies, Diabetes, in whatever manner varied, made no further progress in removing the disease. In Dr Home's patients, all these medicines, and many others, were tried without the least good effect; insomuch that he uses this remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>: \"Thus, these two patients have exhausted all that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> had ever recommended, and almost all that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> could suggest; yet in both cases, the disease has resisted all the means of cure used.\" It is remarkable, that though septic were given to both, in such quantity as evidently to produce a putrescency in the prime via, the urine remained unaltered both in quantity and quality.\n\nBut although this disease be frequently in its nature so obstinate as to resist every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of cure, yet there can be no doubt that particular remedies have succeeded in different cases. Dr Brisbane relates several cases cured by the use of tincture of cantharides; and Dr M'Cormick has related some in the 9th volume of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, which yielded to Dover's powder after a variety of other remedies had been tried in vain.\n\nBut of all the modes of cure lately proposed, that which has been most celebrated, is the treatment recommended by Dr Rollo of the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">Artillery</a>. In a valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> lately published, entitled Cases of the Diabetes Mellitus, he has recorded two remarkable examples of the good effects of a peculiar regimen in this disease. He considers diabetes as being a disease not of the kidney but of the alimentary canal, and as arising from the formation of an uncommon quantity of sugar. He therefore strictly forbids the use of every article of diet which can furnish sugar, even of bread; and by a diet consisting entirely of animal and alkalescent food his patients were much benefited. The experience of some other practitioners has to a certain degree confirmed the observations of Dr Rollo. But we are sorry to add, that we have met with many other instances of diabetes mellitus, in which a diet consisting solely of animal food, had a fair trial, without producing any material benefit. And we may conclude with observing, that the cure of diabetes still remains to be discovered. As allaying the excessive thirst, and producing a temporary restoration of urinous smell, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-UREA\">urea</a> which it ought naturally to contain, we have found nothing equal in efficacy to a large proportion of fat meat, such as pork steaks or butter.\n\nGENUS LXIII. HYSTERIA.\n\nHysterics.\n\nHysteria, Sauv. gen. 135. Lin. 126. Vog. 219. Sag. gen. 242.\nMalum hystericum, Hoffm. III. 50. Junck. 36.\nAffectio hysterica, Willis de Morb. Convulsiv. cap. 5. 10. 11. Sydenham Diss. Epist. ad G. Cole, Whytt on Nervous Disorders.\n\nDescription. The hysteria is a convulsive disease, which comes on at uncertain intervals, sometimes longer and sometimes shorter, but at no stated time. The paroxysms commonly begin with a languor and debility of the whole body; yawning, stretching, and restlessness. A sense of coldness also in the extremities, almost always precedes, and for the most part remains during the whole time of the paroxysm. To this sometimes\ntimes succeeds a sense of heat; and the two sensations alternate with each other in different parts of the body. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> is sometimes flushed and sometimes pale: and sometimes the paleness and flushing come alternately. There is a violent pain in the head; the eyes become dim, and pour out tears; there is a rumbling and inflation of the intestines; a sensation is felt like that of a globe ascending from the lower part of the abdomen or hypogastrium, which sometimes seems to roll along the whole alimentary canal. It ascends to the stomach, sometimes suddenly, sometimes slowly; and there produces a sense of inflation and weight, together with anxiety, nausea, and vomiting. At last it comes up to the throat, where it produces a sense of suffocation, and difficulty of breathing or swallowing. During this time there are the most violent pains both in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> and internal parts of the abdomen; the muscles are convulsed; the umbilicus is drawn inwards; and there are frequently such spasms of the intestines, that neither clysters can be injected, nor even flatus pass downwards. Sometimes the paroxysm remits after these symptoms have continued for a certain time, but more frequently the patients fall into fainting fits; sometimes they lie without motion, as if they were in a deep sleep; sometimes they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> their breasts violently and continually with their hands, and sometimes they are seized with general convulsions, and the disease puts on the appearance of an epilepsy. In some patients the extremities become cold and stiff, and the body has the appearance of one in a catalepsy. Sometimes a most violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> pain takes place in some part of the head, as if a nail was driven into it, and all visible objects seem to turn round; grievous pains attacks the loins, back, and bladder, and the patients discharge a surprising quantity of urine as limpid as water; which last is one of the surest signs of the disease. The mind is very much affected as well as the body. Sometimes the patients are tormented with vain fears: sometimes they will laugh, at other times cry immoderately; and sometimes their temper becomes so peevish and fretful, that they cannot enjoy a moment's quiet. The appearances which take place in this affection are indeed so much varied, that they can hardly be enumerated: they may, however, with propriety, be divided into hysteric fits, which very much resemble those of epilepsy, excepting that they are not attended with an abolition of the internal senses; and hysteric symptoms, such as the globus hystericus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLAVUS\">clavus</a> hystericus, and the like, which are chiefly known to constitute a part of this disease from being observed to alternate with fits.\n\nCauses, &c. The general cause of hysteria is thought by the best physicians to consist in a too great mobility and irritability of the nervous system, and of consequence the disease may be brought on by whatever debilitates and renders the body irritable. Hence it most frequently attacks females of a weak and lax habit of body, though there are some instances of men also attacked by it. It generally comes on between the time of puberty and the age of 35, and makes its attacks during the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MENSTRUATION\">menstruation</a> more frequently than at any other. It also more frequently seizes barren women and young widows, than such as are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> children.\n\nPrognosis. Though the appearance of this disease be so very terrible, it seldom proves mortal unless by wrong treatment: but notwithstanding this, it is extremely difficult of cure, and rarely admits of anything else than being palliated; for though it should seem to be conquered by medicine for a time, it very quickly returns, and that from the slightest causes.\n\nCure. The ends principally to be aimed at in the cure of this disease are, in the first place, the removal of particular convulsive or spasmodic affections immediately producing various appearances in the disease, whether under the form of proper hysteric fits, or merely of what may be called hysteric symptoms; and in the second place, the prevention of the return of symptoms after they have been removed, by the employment of proper remedies during those intervals from complaints which patients often have when labouring under this affection.\n\nThe most powerful remedy hitherto discovered in hysteric cases is opium, or the tincture of it. By this commonly the most violent paroxysms are stopped, though it be insufficient to accomplish a radical cure. In Dr Home's Clinical Experiments we find an instance of a cure performed by venesecesis, though this remedy has been generally condemned in hysterical cases. Asafoetida seems to stand next in virtue to opium; though with some it disagrees, and occasions pains in the stomach and vomiting. Sulphuric ether will also frequently remove an hysteric fit; but its effects are of short duration; and if it do not effect a cure soon after its exhibition, no service is to be expected either by perseverance in the use of it or by increasing the dose; and with some constitutions it disagrees to such a degree as to occasion convulsions. If the patient be seized with a violent fit, so that she can swallow nothing, which is frequently the case, it will be proper to apply some strong volatile alkali to her nose; or if that be not at hand, the vapors of burning feathers is sometimes very efficacious. In some instances benefit is derived from the sudden application of cold water to the face or hands; but still more frequently the application of water in a tepid state, particularly the warm pediluvium, is found to be of very great service in bringing about a favourable termination of different violent hysteric symptoms. A plaster of galbanum and asafoetida will also prove serviceable: but it must be remembered, that none of these things will prevent the return of the disease; and therefore a radical cure is to be attempted by exercise, cinchona, chalybeates, mineral waters, and other tonics; but particularly, where the state of the patient is such as to be able to bear it, by the use of the cold bath, which, where it does not disagree with the constitution, is often of the greatest service in preventing returns of this affection.\n\nIn hysteria as well as in chorea Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> has found, that in some instances very great benefit has been obtained from copious evacuations of the alimentary canal, by cathartics frequently repeated.\n\nGENUS LXIV. HYDROPHOBIA.\n\nThe Dread of Water\n\nHydrophobia, Sauv. gen. 231. Lin. 86. Veg. 30. Sag. gen. 343. Boerh. 1138. Junck. 124. Mead on Poisons. Dessault sur la rage. Sauv. diss. sur\nSp. I. Hydrophobia Rabiosa, or Hydrophobia consequent on the Bite of a Mad Animal.\n\nHydrophobia vulgaris, Sauv. sp. i.\n\nIt is the opinion of some, that Dr Cullen has done wrong in employing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> hydrophobia as a generic name, under which canine madness is included: and it must be allowed, that the dread of water, while it is not universal, is also a symptom occurring only late in the disease, at least in the greater part of cases. Perhaps his arrangement would have been less exceptionable, if, following Linn\u00e6us, he had adopted rabies as a generic term, and had distinguished this particular species by the epithet of canina, contagiosa, or the like. Disputes, however, about names, are in general not very important; and it is sufficient to observe, that the affection now to be treated of is canine madness, or that disease which arises from the bite of a mad animal.\n\nDescription. This disease commonly does not make its attack till a considerable time after the bite. In some few instances it has commenced in seven or eight days from the accident; but generally the patient continues in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> for 20, 30, or 40 days, or even much longer. The bite, if not prevented, will in general be healed long before that time, frequently with the greatest ease; though sometimes it resists all kinds of healing applications, and forms a running ulcer which discharges a quantity of matter for many days. It has been said, that the nearer the wounded place is to the salivary glands, the sooner the symptoms of hydrophobia appear. The approach of the disease is known by the cicatrix of the wound becoming high, hard, and elevated, and by a peculiar sense of prickling at the part; pains shoot from it towards the throat; sometimes it is surrounded with livid or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> streaks, and seems to be in a state of inflammation; though frequently there is nothing remarkable to be observed about it. The patient becomes melancholy, loves solitude, and has sickness at stomach. Sometimes the peculiar symptom of the disease, the dread of water, comes on all at once. We have an instance of one who, having taken a vomit of ipecacuanha for the sickness he felt at his stomach, was seized with the hydrophobia in the time he was drinking the warm water. Sometimes the disease begins like a common sore throat; and the soreness daily increasing, the hydrophobic symptoms show themselves like a convulsive spasm of the muscles of the fauces. In others, the mind seems to be primarily affected, and they are subject to despondency and melancholy for some time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to any dread of water. And when that dread commences, it is with an evident mental affection. Dr James, in his Treatise on Canine Madness, mentions a boy sent out to fill two bottles with water, who was so terrified by the noise of the liquid running into them, that he fled into the house crying out that he was bewitched. He mentions also the case of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a>, who, going to draw some ale from a cask, was terrified to such a degree at its running into the vessel, that he ran out in a great haste with the spigot in his hand. But in whatever manner this symptom comes on, it is certain that the most painful sensations accompany every attempt to swallow liquids. Nay, the bare sight of water, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a>-glass, of any thing clear or pellucid, will give the utmost uneasiness, or even throws the patient into convulsions.\n\nWith regard to the affection of the mind itself in this disease, it does not appear that the patients are deprived of reason. Some have, merely by the dint of resolution, conquered the dread of water, though they never could conquer the convulsive motions which the contact of liquids occasioned: while this resolution has been of no avail; for the convulsions and other symptoms increasing, have almost always destroyed the unhappy patients.\n\nIn this disease there seems to be an extreme sensibility and irritability of the nervous system. The eyes cannot bear the light, or the sight of any thing white; the least touch or motion offends them, and they want to be kept as quiet and in as dark a place as possible. Some complain of the coldness of the air, frequently when it is really warm. Others complain of violent heat; and have a great desire for cold air, which yet never fails to increase the symptoms. In all there is a great flow of viscid saliva into the mouth; which is exceedingly troublesome to the patients, as it has the same effect upon their fauces that other liquids have. This therefore they perpetually blow off with violence, which in a patient of Dr Fothergill's occasioned a noise not unlike the hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARKING\">barking</a> of a dog, and which he conjectures might have given rise to the common notion that hydrophobous patients bark like dogs. They have an insatiable thirst; but are unable to get down any drink, except with the utmost difficulty; though sometimes they can swallow bread soaked in liquids, slices of oranges, or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>. There is a pain under the serobiculus cordis, as in the tetanus; and the patients mournfully point to that place as the seat of the disease. Dr Vaughan is of opinion that it is this pain, rather than any difficulty in swallowing, which distresses the patient on every attempt to drink. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> is commonly plaintive and mournful; but Dr Vaughan tells us there is a mixture of fierceness and timidity in the countenance which he cannot describe, but by which he could know a hydrophobous person without asking any questions.\n\nIn this distemper, indeed, the symptoms are so various, that they cannot be enumerated; for we will seldom read two cases of hydrophobia which do not differ very remarkably in this respect. Some seem to have at times a furious delirium, and an inclination to spit at or bite the bystanders; while others show no such inclination, but will even suffer people to wipe the inside of their mouths with the corner of a handkerchief in order to clear away the viscid saliva which...\nSpasm. is ready to suffocate them. In some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MALE\">male</a> patients there is an involuntary erection of the penis, and emission of the semen; and the urine is forced away by the frequent returns of the spasms. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">Wolf</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARSAW\">Warsaw</a> to Henry Baker, F. R. S., dated Warsaw Sept. 26th, 1767, we have the following melancholy account of the cases of five persons who died of the hydrophobia: \"None of them quite lost their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> senses; but they were all talking without intermission, praying, lamenting, despairing, cursing, sighing, spitting a frothy saliva, screeching, sometimes belching, retching, but rarely vomiting. Every member is convulsed by fits, but most violently from the navel up to the breast and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OESOPHAGUS\">oesophagus</a>. The fit comes on every quarter of an hour; the fauces are not red, nor the tongue dry. The pulse is not at all feverish; and when the fit is over nearly like a sound pulse. The face grows pale, then brown, and during the fit almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>; the lips livid; the head is drowsy, and the ears tingling; the urine limpid. At last they grow weary; the fits are less violent, and cease towards the end; the pulse becomes weak, intermittent, and not very quick; they sweat, and at last the whole body becomes cold. They compose themselves quietly as if to get sleep, and so they expire. The blood drawn a few hours before death appears good in every respect. A general observation was, that the lint and dressings of the wounds, even when dry, were always black, and that when the pus was very good in colour and appearance.\" In one of Dr Wolf's patients who recovered, the blood stunk intolerably as it was drawn from a vein; and one of Mr Vaughan's patients complained of an intolerable fetid smell proceeding from the wounded part, though nobody but himself could perceive it. In general, the violent convulsions cease a short time before death; and even the hydrophobia goes off, so that the patients can drink freely. But this does not always happen; for Mr Vaughan mentions the case of a patient, in whom, \"when he had in appearance ceased to breathe, the spasms cynicus was observable, with an odd convulsive motion in the muscles of the face; and the strange <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">contrariety</a> which took place in the action of these produced the most horrid assemblage of features that can well be conceived. Of this patient also it was remarkable, that in the last hours of his life he ceased to cry for drink, which had been his constant request; but was perpetually asking for something to eat.\"\n\nThe hydrophobia seems to be a symptom peculiar to the human race; for the mad animals which communicate the infection, do not seem to have any dread of water. Dr Wolf, in the letter above quoted, says in general, that cattle bit at the same time and by the same animal (a mad wolf) which bit the persons whose cases he related, died nearly with the same frightful raging as the men; but says nothing of their having any hydrophobia: nay, Dr James and some others assert, that the hydrophobia is not always an attendant on rabies canina in the human race; and indeed it is certain that the disease has proved mortal after this terrible symptom has been removed. With regard to the symptoms of madness in dogs, they are very equivocal; and those particularly enumerated by some authors, are only such as might be expected in dogs much heated or agitated by being violently pursued and struck. One symptom indeed, if it could be Hydro depended upon, would determine the matter; namely, that all other dogs avoid and run away from one that is mad; and even large dogs will not attack one of the smallest size who is infected with this disease. Upon this supposition they point out a method of discovering whether a dog who has been killed was really mad or not; namely, by rubbing a piece of meat along the inside of his mouth, and then offering it to a sound dog. If the latter eats it, it is a sign the dog was not mad; but if the other rejects it with a kind of howling noise, it is certain that he was. Dr James tells us, that among dogs the disease is infectious by staying in the same place; and that after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENNEL\">kennel</a> has been once infected, the dogs put into it will be for a considerable time afterwards in danger of going mad also. A remedy for this, he says, is, to keep geese for some time in the kennel. He rejects as false the opinion that dogs when going mad will not bark; though he owns that there is a very considerable change in their bark, which becomes hoarse and hollow.\n\nOf all the accounts that have been published on the characteristics of rabies in dogs, the best is to be found in Dr Arnold's late treatise: the characteristics there mentioned are given on the authority of Mr Meynell, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who has paid particular attention to this subject. From Mr Meynell's observations it appears, that most of the characteristics which have been commonly mentioned, are mere vulgar errors; and, according to him, the best marks are from their peculiar dull look, and the peculiar sound which they utter. \"Mad dogs (says Mr Meynell) never bark, but occasionally utter a most dismal and plaintive howl, expressive of extreme distress, and which, they who have once heard it, can never forget; so that dogs may be known to be going mad without being seen, when only this dismal howl is heard.\n\nCauses, &c. In no disease whatever are we more at a loss to discover the causes than in the hydrophobia. In dogs, foxes, and wolves, it seems to come on spontaneously; though this is contested by some authors. It is said, that the causes commonly assigned, viz. heat, feeding upon putrid flesh, want of water, &c. are not sufficient for producing the distemper. It does not appear that madness is more frequent among dogs in the warm than in the cold climates; nay, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Antigua, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> is very hot, and the water very scarce, this distemper has never, it is said, been observed. As to putrid aliment, it seems natural for dogs to prefer this to any other, and they have been known to subsist upon it for a long time without any detriment. For these reasons, they think the disease arises from a specific contagion, like the smallpox and measles among the human race, which, being once produced by causes unknown, continues to be propagated by the intercourse which dogs have with each other, as the diseases <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned continue to be propagated among the human race.\n\nWith regard to the immediate cause among mankind, there is not the least doubt that the hydrophobia is occasioned by the saliva of the mad animal being mixed with the blood. It does not appear that this can operate through the cuticle; but, when that is rubbed off, the smallest quantity is sufficient to communicate\ncommunicate the disease, and a slight scratch with the teeth of a mad animal has been found as pernicious as a large wound. It is certain also, that the infection has been communicated by the bites of dogs, cats, wolves, foxes, weasels, swine, and even cocks and hens, when in a state of madness. But it does not appear that the distemper is communicable from one hydrophobic person to another, by means of the bite, or any other way. Dr Vaughan inoculated a dog with the saliva of a hydrophobic child, but the animal continued free from disease for two months: though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> promised to inform the public if it should happen to occur afterwards, nothing has hitherto appeared on that subject. A nurse also frequently kissed this child during the time of his disorder, but no bad consequence ensued.\n\nWhen we attempt to investigate the nature of the cause of the hydrophobia by dissections, our inquiries are commonly disappointed. In two bodies opened by Dr Vaughan, there was not the least morbid appearance; in the very fauces, where we might have expected that the disease would have shown itself most evidently, there was not the least appearance even of inflammation. The stomach, intestines, diaphragm, esophagus, &c. were all in a natural state: neither do we find in authors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> any certain accounts of morbid appearances in the bodies of hydrophobous persons after death. Dr Vaughan therefore concludes, that the poison acts upon the nervous system; and is so wholly confined to it, that it may be doubted whether the qualities of the blood are altered by it or not; and that it acts upon the nerves by impairing and disturbing their functions to such a degree as speedily to end in a total extinction of the vital principle. As to the difficulty in swallowing generally believed to accompany the dread of water, he treats it as a misrepresentation, as well as that the esophagus with the muscles subservient to deglutition are especially concerned in this disease. The principal foundation of the evil, he thinks, rests on a morbid sensibility both of the external and internal fauces. For the sight of a liquid, or the application of any substance to the internal fauces, but more especially of a fluid, instantly excites the most painful feelings. Nay, the same symptoms are produced by touching the external fauces, with a fluid, or by the contact of cold air with these parts; and nearly in as great a degree. But a solid or fluid substance being conveyed into the esophagus, the transit into the stomach is accomplished with little or no impediment; so that in fact the difficulty is surmounted before the patient is engaged in the action of swallowing. Nor is the excruciating pain, which never fails to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> of every attempt to drink, felt in the fauces and throat: it is, he says, at the scrobiculus cordis; to which the sufferer applies his hand. From this last circumstance, therefore, from the presence of the risus sardonicus, from the muscles of the abdomen being forcibly contracted, and from the sense of suffocation which seems to threaten the patient with immediate death, Dr Vaughan has been led to think that in the hydrophobia a new sympathy was established between the fauces, the diaphragm, and the abdominal muscles.\n\nPrognosis. When a person is bit, the prognosis with regard to the ensuing hydrophobia is very uncertain. All those who are bit do not fall into the disease; Hydrophobia, Dr Vaughan relates, that out of 30 bit by a mad dog, only one was seized with the hydrophobia. During the interval between the bite and the time the disease comes on, there are no symptoms by which we can judge whether it will appear or not. When once it has made its appearance, the prognosis is exceedingly fatal, though there are certainly some well authenticated cases of complete recovery, particularly one recorded by Dr Arnold.\n\nPrevention and Cure. It has been generally allowed by practitioners, that though the hydrophobia may be prevented, yet it can seldom if ever be cured after it has made its appearance. The most essential part of the treatment therefore depends on the proper use of means of prevention. The great objects to be aimed at in prevention, are, in the first place, the complete removal of the contagious matter as soon as possible; or, secondly, means of destroying it at the part, where there is even the slightest reason to believe that it has not been completely removed. Of all the means of removal, the complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> out the part to which the tooth had been applied, is unquestionably the most to be depended upon. This practice, therefore, should be had recourse to as soon as possible. The sooner it can be accomplished the better. But it has been observed, that as a peculiar sensation at the part affected always precedes the accession of the disease, even when it takes place at a late period after the bite, there is good ground for believing that the removal of the part may be of advantage even after a considerable interval. But besides removal of the contagious matter, by cutting away the part to which it is attached, this should also be attempted by careful and long-continued washing. This may be done, in most instances, before a proper opportunity can be had of having recourse to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>. Cold water should particularly be poured upon the wound from a considerable height, that the matter may be washed away with some force. Even after removal by the knife, careful washing is still a necessary and proper precaution. And after both these, to prevent as far as can be the possibility of any contagious matter lurking about the wounded part, it should not be allowed to heal, but a discharge of matter should be supported for the space of several weeks, by ointment with cantharides, or similar applications. By these means there is at least the best chance of removing the matter at a sufficiently early period. And this mode of prevention seems to be of more consequence than all others put together which have hitherto been discovered. But besides removal, prevention may also be obtained by the destruction of the contagious matter at the part; and where there is the least reason to think that a complete removal has not been obtained, this should always be had recourse to. With this intention the actual cautery and burning with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-powder have been employed. And the action of fire is probably one of the most powerful agents that can be used for this purpose. But recourse has also been had to washing, both with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> and with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a>. Of the former kind, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a> has been chiefly used, but more may probably be expected from the latter; and particularly from the caustic alkali, so far diluted that it can be applied with safety: for from its influence as a solvent of animal mucus, it gives\nthe best chance of a complete removal of the matter, independent of any influence in changing its nature. It has been thought also, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> applied to the part may be of service. But if recourse be had to it, more active measures should at least be previously employed; and even then, some are of opinion that it is of advantage to increase the activity of the unctuous matter by combining it with mercury.\n\nOn these grounds, and by these means, we are inclined to think that the action of this contagion on the system, after it has been applied by the bite of a rabid animal, may be most effectually prevented. But after this action has once taken place, no remedy has yet been discovered on which much dependence can be put. A very great variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> indeed have at different periods been held forth as infallible, both in the prevention and cure of this affection; but their reputation has, perhaps, universally been founded on their being given to people, who, though really bit by a mad dog, were yet not infected with the contagion. And this happily, either from the tooth being cleaned in making the bite, or not being covered with contagious matter, is by no means an unfrequent occurrence. Mankind, however, even from the earliest ages, have never been without some boasted specific, which has been held forth as an infallible remedy for this affection till fatal experience demonstrated the contrary. Dr Boerhaave has given a pretty full catalogue of those specifics from the days of Galen to his own time; and concludes, that no dependence is to be put in any of them. It is now, therefore, altogether unnecessary to take notice of burnt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRABS\">crabs</a>, the hyena's skin, mithridate with tin, liver of the rabid animal, or a variety of other pretended remedies for this disease, proved by experience to be totally inefficacious. But although no greater confidence is perhaps to be put in specifics of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, it will be proper that these should be mentioned.\n\nBathing in cold water, especially in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and drinking sea-water for a certain time, have been prescribed, and by some accounted a certain preventive. When this was known to fail, a long course of antiphlogistic regimen, violent submersion in water, even to danger of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DROWNING\">drowning</a>, and keeping the wounded place open with cauteries, were recommended.\u2014To this extreme severity Dr Mead objected; and in his treatise on this subject endeavours to show, that in all ages the greatest success has been reaped from diuretics, for which reason he proposes the following powder: \"Take ash-coloured ground-liverwort, half an ounce; black-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, two drams: reduce them separately to powder, then mix them together.\" This powder was first published in the Philosophical Transactions, by Mr Dampier, in whose family it had been kept as a secret for many years. But this medicine which was inserted in former editions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> and Edinburgh pharmacopoeias under the name of Pulvis Antilyssus, has long lost its credit.\n\nThere is a famous East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> medicine, composed of 24 grains of native and as much factitious cinnabar, made into a powder with 16 grains of musk. This is called the Tonguin medicine, and must be taken in a tea cupful of arrac or brandy; and it is said to secure the patient for 30 days, at the expiration of which it is to be repeated; but if he has any symptoms of the disease, it must be repeated in three hours, which is said to be sufficient for a cure. The first dose is to be taken as soon after the bite as possible.\n\nAnother celebrated remedy is Palmarius's powder, composed of the leaves of rue, vervain, sage, polypody, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WORMWOOD\">wormwood</a>, mint, mugwort, balm, betony, St John's wort, and lesser centaury. These herbs must be gathered in their prime, dried separately in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>, and then powdered. The dose is a dram, or a dram and a half, taken every day.\n\nA remedy which might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> to be more efficacious than any of those hitherto mentioned is mercury. This has been recommended in frictions, and to be taken inwardly in the form of calomel and turbitb mineral, in order if possible to raise a slight salivation, on which the efficacy was thought to depend. Besides this, venesection, opium, cinchona, and camphor, have been tried in very large quantities; the warm bath; and, in short, every thing which human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> could suggest; but with how little success, can be judged from many well authenticated cases.\n\nDr Wolf, after detailing a number of interesting cases, makes the following observation.\u2014\"Thus we see, that the mercury, the acids, the musk, the feeding on the most famous herbs, the sweating, the cura antiphlogistica, &c. are no specifics.\"\n\nThe following case by Dr Raymond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARSEILLES\">Marseilles</a> shows the inefficacy of mercury even as a preventive.\u2014On the 19th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1765, Mr Boyer, aged 25, of a bloated cachectic habit, was bit by a mad dog in the inferior part of the leg: the wound extended half way round, bled freely, and was like a great scratch. The patient's legs had been swelled for a considerable time before the accident; and there were also two ulcers in the other leg. Some hours after the accident, the actual cautery was applied to the wound. The doctor was not present at this operation; but the part around the bite was rubbed with mercurial ointment immediately after, and the eschar was dressed with the same ointment. The eschar was separated on the first day, but the dressing was continued till the wound was cicatrised. The second day a bolus of four grains of turbitb and eight grains of camphor was exhibited. This procured a considerable evacuation both by vomit and stool, and a spitting also came on. The third day the bitten leg was rubbed with mercurial ointment: in the space of a month the frictions were repeated five times on both legs, three drams of mercurial ointment being used in each friction. During the same time the bolus was five times repeated; and this treatment kept up a slight salivation to the 40th day. The evening of the third day he took the Tonguin medicine, called also Sir George Cobb's powder, in a bolus; which vomited him briskly. This powder was repeated seven or eight times in the month, generally with the same effect. During the first seven or eight days he got four times, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, a dram of the anguallis flore puniceo, fresh gathered and powdered. The 41st day, the turbitb bolus was prescribed for the seventh time: he was bathed in the sea, and continued the bathing for two days more. On the 74th he was seized with the distemper; and died on the 76th, seemingly suffocated or strangled, his mouth covered with slaver, and his\nhis face bloated. He lost his senses not above half a quarter of an hour before his death. The pulse was quiet the whole time.\n\nAnother instance is mentioned by the same author, of a pregnant woman bit by the same dog and on the same day with Mr Boyer, who was never seized with the distemper. She was treated in much the same manner with him, and salivated a little more. But she was bit through a shamoy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOE\">shoe</a>, which must necessarily have cleaned the animal's teeth of the poisonous saliva before they reached her skin, and to this we are naturally led to ascribe her safety. One of Dr Wolf's patients also was a pregnant woman, and was not seized with the distemper. Perhaps women in a state of pregnancy may be less liable to this distemper than others; but it is more probable that the contagion was not communicated.\n\nThe same author tells us, \"there are many examples of the inefficacy of mercurial frictions. A surgeon of Marseilles treated a girl about 12 years of age bit by a mad dog, with mercurial frictions; applying them as in the lues venerea: yet she died of the hydrophobia on the 55th day. Her wound was not cauterized.\"\n\nIn the following case all the most powerful remedies were tried.\u2014In the afternoon of the 29th of Aug. 1777, Dr Vaughan was called to a boy of eight years of age labouring under a hydrophobia. He had been bit on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WRIST\">wrist</a> by a cat about a month before; of which the marks remained, but without any ulcer, or even the smallest appearance of inflammation. About the middle of the day before Dr Vaughan saw him, he began to complain of a pain in the part bitten, which ascended up the arm, and affected the temple on that side; soon after which he swallowed liquids with reluctance and difficulty. He was put into the warm bath for three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an hour, during which time he was easier: he had a clyster of five ounces of fresh broth, and 30 drops of laudanum, injected immediately after his coming out of it: a liniment consisting of three drams of strong mercurial ointment with the same quantity of oil of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>, was rubbed upon the shoulders and hack; two pills of a grain of flowers of zinc, and half a grain of cuprum ammoniacum, were taken every three or four hours; and a medicated atmosphere was prepared for him, by burning gum ammoniac in his room. As these remedies were not attended with any good effect, each dose of pills was ordered to contain two grains of cuprum ammoniacum, the same quantity of opium, three grains of flowers of zinc, and ten grains of asafoetida; whilst a solution of that fetid gum, with a dram of laudanum, was administered as a clyster. These pills, though repeated every four hours, afforded not the smallest relief, nor did they show the least action on the frame. At last the doctor resolved to put in practice the desperate remedy mentioned by Van Helmont, of throwing the patient into cold water, and keeping him there till he is almost drowned. With this view a large tub of cold water, well saturated with common salt, was prepared, into which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> boy was plunged over head and ears, and there held until he ceased to struggle. He was then taken out again, and the same operation repeated until he became so quiet that the doctor was under apprehensions that a total extinction of life would take place. He was then wrapped up in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLANKET\">blanket</a> and put to bed, and he remained more quiet than he had formerly been; but all his former restlessness soon returned; his pulse sunk, and he died about two o'clock in the morning.\n\nAnother celebrated antidote against the poison of a mad dog has been known for some years by the name of the Ormskirk medicine. The true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of this is kept a secret by the proprietors: however, it has been analysed, and the following composition published by Dr Heysham as perfectly similar to it in all respects.\n\n\"Take half an ounce of chalk, three drams of Armenian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLE\">bole</a>, 10 grains of alum, one dram of elecampane in powder; mix them all together, and add six drops of oil of anise.\"\n\nThey must certainly be very credulous who can put confidence in such an insignificant medicine as a preservative against the hydrophobia: however, there is a possibility that there may be some unknown ingredient in the genuine powder: for it is difficult to analyse powders after the ingredients are thoroughly mixed together. The efficacy of the medicine therefore must depend on the virtues of that unknown ingredient, if any such there be. The following cases, however, too well determine that it is not infallible, as was at first pretended. In all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, as well as many others, its reputation also is solely rested on its being exhibited in many cases where no contagion was communicated to the person bit, and while of course no disease could take place.\n\nOn the 14th of February 1774, Mr Bellamy of Holborn, aged 40, was bit by a cat affected with rabies, which was killed the same morning. The following day he took the celebrated Ormskirk medicine, sold by Hill and Berry in Hill-Street, Berkeley-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">Square</a>, and conformed in every respect to the directions given by the vender. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> maid, who was bitten in the leg before her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> was bitten, likewise took the same remedy. About the middle of April Mr Bellamy complained of a pain in his right knee, which he supposed to be rheumatic, and which continued and increased till the 7th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, when he got some pills of calomel, ipsecacuanha, and pil sapon, from an apothecary, with Huxham's tincture of the bark in small doses. In six days more he had a titillation in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-URETHRA\">urethra</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the scrotum and penis to a degree of pain, and an emission of semen after making water, to which he had frequent calls. The medicines were discontinued; and on the 16th of that month the hydrophobia came on, and Dr Fothergill was called. Six ounces of blood were taken from his arm, and a bolus of a scruple of native cinnamon and half a scruple of musk was given every four hours. The distemper manifestly increased through the day. In the evening a clyster was injected, and several times repeated during the night; he had been put into the warm bath, and two drams of strong mercurial ointment rubbed into his legs and thighs by himself. He was greatly relieved by the warm bath while he continued in it, but the symptoms returned with increased violence in the night. The next day being greatly worse, he was bled to as great a quantity as he could bear, had the warm bath and clysters repeated, and half an ounce of mercurial ointment rubbed into his thighs and legs. Pills of opium were prescribed, but he did not take them. He died...\nSpasm, the same night, at half an hour after 12. This patient was a man of great resolution, and could in part conquer his aversion at water. He seemed to have totally forgot the accident of the bite; and casually said, that he thought this disorder resembled the hydrophobia, without supposing that he was afflicted with that distemper at the time.\u2014The bite on the girl\u2019s leg refused to heal, baffled the art of a young surgeon who attempted to cure it, and continued a running ulcer for a long time. She did not fall into the hydrophobia. Hence Dr Fothergill thinks it probable, that keeping the wounds made by the teeth of mad animals open for a long time, would probably be of service as a preventive; but in some of Dr Wolf\u2019s patients these artificial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DRAINS\">drains</a> appear not to have been attended with success.\n\nOn the 16th of November 1773, Thomas Nourse, a strong healthy boy of 14, was admitted into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a> infirmary; having been that day month bitten by a mad fox-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HOUND\">hound</a>. The wound was a large lacerated one on the cheek, and bled very freely on being inflicted. The day after he was bit he went to the sea, where he was dipped with all the severity usually practised under so disagreeable an operation. The Ormskirk medicine was also administered with all due care. It was bought of the person in Leicester who is deputed by the proprietor to sell it for him. A common adhesive plaster was applied to the part after sea-bathing; and in the course of a month, without any further trouble, the wound was healed; excepting a small portion, somewhat more than an inch in length, and in breadth about one-tenth. This yielded no discharge, and was quite in a cicatrizing state. Five days before his admission into the infirmary, he began to complain of a tightness over his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, and a pain in his head: in two days the hydrophobia began to appear; and at its commencement he complained of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> heat in his stomach, which was continually ascending to the fauces. The disease was pretty strong when he came to the infirmary. He got a bolus of a scruple of musk with two grains of opium; then a composition of 15 grains of musk, one of turpith mineral, and five grains of opium, was directed to be taken every third hour; an ounce of the stronger mercurial ointment was to be rubbed on the cervical vertebrae and shoulders, and an embrocation of two ounces of laudanum, and half an ounce of acetum saturninum, was directed to be applied to the throat. But by this last he was thrown into convulsions, and the same effect followed though his eyes were first covered with a napkin. The embrocation was therefore changed for a plaster of three drams of powdered camphor, half an ounce of opium, and six drams confectio Damocitis. By these medicines the disease seemed to be somewhat suspended, but the symptoms returned with violence in the evening. His medicine was repeated at seven; and at eight five grains of opium were exhibited without musk or turpith. At nine, another ounce of mercurial ointment was rubbed upon the shoulders, and half an ounce of laudanum with six ounces of mutton-broth was injected into the intestines, but to no purpose. A larger dose of opium was then given, but with as little effect as the former, and he died the same night.\n\nIn the month of September 1774, a farmer, aged 25, was bit by a mad dog, whose teeth made a slight wound in the fore finger of the left hand. He was dipped, as usual, in the sea; and drank the sea-water for some time on the spot, which operated briskly as a purge. He continued well till the 6th of June following, when he first felt a pain in that hand and arm; for which he bathed in a river that evening, supposing that it had been a rheumatic complaint. The next day he was sick; and in the evening was seized with a violent vomiting, which continued all that night and till the middle of the next day, when it was succeeded by the hydrophobia. He was treated with the warm bath; had a purgative elyser injected; and as soon as it had operated, a second was given, consisting of four ounces of oil, and half an ounce of laudanum; half an ounce of strong mercurial ointment was rubbed on the fauces, and the part was afterwards covered with the cataplasmata cyniwo, to which was added an ounce of opium. An embrocation was applied to the region of the stomach with continued friction, consisting of half an ounce of spirit of sal ammoniac, ten drams of olive oil, six drams of oil of amber, and ten drams of laudanum. Two ounces of strong mercurial ointment were rubbed upon the shoulders and back; and as a further means of inducing a ptyalism speedily, he received the smoke of cinnabar into the mouth by throwing a dram of that substance now and then upon a hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>: he was also directed to take every four hours a bolus of 15 grains of musk, three grains of turpith mineral, and four grains of opium. He was easier while in the warm bath, and during the application of the ointment; but died the same night about two o\u2019clock.\n\nMany other instances might be adduced of the inefficacy of this pretended specific: which will, it is hoped, create a due degree of caution in those to whom they who are so unfortunate as to be bit by a mad animal may commit themselves. Another remedy may also be mentioned as having had the reputation of being sometimes successful in this disease; which is chiefly employed in different parts of India, particularly in the territory of Tanjore. The medicine to which we now allude contains indeed several articles which are altogether unknown in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MATERIA_MEDICA\">materia medica</a>: but it contains at least one very powerful substance well known to us, viz. arsenic. This medicine, known by the name of the Snake Pills, as being principally employed against the bite of the most venomous snakes, is directed to be prepared in the following manner:\n\nTake white arsenic, of the roots of nelli navi, of nevi visham, of the kernels of the ner valum, of pepper, of quicksilver, each an equal quantity. The quicksilver is to be rubbed with the juice of the wild cotton till the globules are perfectly extinguished. The arsenic being first levigated, the other ingredients, reduced to a powder, are then to be added, and the whole beat together with the juice of the wild cotton to a consistence fit to be divided into pills.\n\nThough these pills are principally used against the bite of the cobra de capello, yet they are said also to be successful in the cure of other venomous bites; and, for the prevention of rabies canina, one is taken every morning for some length of time. Of this remedy European practitioners have, we believe, as yet no experience; and if, in the accounts transmitted\nby East India practitioners, it cannot be said that we have authentic evidence of its want of success, it can as little be pretended that there is indubitable evidence of its efficacy in any instance; and it is by no means improbable, that it will be found equally inefficacious with others at one time considered as infallible.\n\nOf the great variety of remedies which have had their day of reputation, there is not one which has not possessed the credit, some time or other, of preventing the noxious effects arising from the bite of a mad dog. A more adequate experience has with all of them discovered the deception. It was above observed, that rabies is by no means the infallible consequence of being bit by a mad animal; and that of between 22 and 30 persons who were bit by the dog which gave the fatal wound to one of Dr Vaughan's patients, not one felt the least ill effect but himself. \"In the above number (says the doctor) were some who took the Ormskirk medicine; others went to the salt water; and part of them used no remedy, who yet fared equally well with the most attentive to their injury. The same thing has often happened before; and much merit, I doubt not, has been attributed to the medicine taken, from that celebrated one of Sir George Cobb down to the infallible one which my good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> Bountiful's receipt-book furnishes.\"\n\nFrom all that has been said, the reader will judge how far the hydrophobia is capable of being subdued by any of the medicinal powers which have yet been tried. Some eminent physicians assert that it is totally incurable; and allege that the instances recorded by different authors of its cure have not been the genuine kind, but that which comes on spontaneously, and which is by no means so dangerous. Indeed two of Dr Wolf's patients recovered, where the disease seems to have been perfectly genuine: but in these the poison seemed to vent itself partly on some other place besides the nervous system. In one the blood was evidently infected, as it had an abominable odor; and the other had a violent pain and swelling in the belly. In all the others, it seemed to have attacked only the nervous system; which perhaps has not the same ability to throw off any offending matter as the vascular system.\n\nThere is, however, a possibility that the prodigious affections of the nerves may arise only from a vitiated state of the gastric juices; for it is well known, that the most terrible convulsions, nay the hydrophobia itself, will arise from an affection of the stomach, without any bite of a mad animal. This seems to be somewhat confirmed from one of Dr Wolf's patients, who, though he vomited more than 50 times, yet still threw up a frothy matter, which was therefore evidently secreted into the stomach, just as a continual vomiting of a bilious matter shows a continual and extraordinary secretion of bile. Dr Wolf himself adopts this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> so far as to say, that perhaps the serum may become frothy; but in blood drawn from a vein not the least fault appears either in the serum or crassamentum. He affirms, however, that the duodenum appears to be one of the parts first and principally affected; and as it is not inflamed, it would seem that the affection it sustains must arise from the vitiated state of its juices.\n\nBe this as it will, however, in the hydrophobia, the stomach seems totally, or in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, to lose the power which at other times it possesses. Two grains of cuprum ammoniacum were repeatedly given to a child of eight years of age without effect; but this dose would occasion violent vomiting in a strong healthy man. Something or other therefore must have prevented this substance from acting on the nervous coat of the stomach; and this we can only suppose to have been the exceedingly disordered state of the gastric juice, which occasioned such violent irritation through the whole body, that the weaker stimulus of the medicine was entirely lost. It would seem proper therefore to consider the stomach in hydrophobic cases as really containing a poisonous matter, which could not be expelled by vomiting, because it is renewed as fast as evacuated. The indication therefore must be, to change its nature by such medicines as are certainly more powerful than the poison; and this indication will naturally lead us to think of large doses of alkaline salts. These, it is certain, will destroy any animal substance with which they come in contact, and render even the poison of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a> inactive. By exhibiting a few doses of them, larger no doubt than what can be safely done on other occasions, we would be certain to change the state of the stomachic juices; and this might free the patient from those intolerable spasms which always occasion death in such a short time. Dr Wolf seems inclined to think that volatile alkalies were of service; but the above hypothesis would incline us to use rather the fixed kind. At any rate, it seems vain for physicians to trust much to the power of opium, mercury, musk, or cinnabar, either singly or combined in any possible way. Cinchona has also failed, and the most celebrated specifics have been found ineffectual. Alkalies are the next most powerful remedies which the materia medica affords, and they cannot be more unsuccessful than the others have generally been.\n\nAnother remedy which seems adapted to change the nature of the gastric juices is ardent spirits. In one of Dr Wolf's patients two bottles of brandy seem to have effected a cure. The oil mixed with it was of no efficacy in other cases, and the opium and turbithe seem not to have been exhibited till the worst was past. In this case the disease seems to have attacked the vascular as well as the nervous system.\n\nIn all the patients the warm bath seems to have been a palliative, and a very powerful one, and as such it ought never to be omitted, though we can by no means trust to it as a radical cure; and the above histories, abundantly show, that though the warm bath and opium may palliate for a short time, the cause on which the spasms depend is still going on and increasing, till at last the symptoms become too strong to be palliated even for a moment by any medicine however powerful. At any rate, the above-mentioned hypothesis suggests a new indication, which, if attended to, may perhaps lead to useful discoveries. In cases where putrescent bile is abundantly secreted, columbo root and vegetable acids are recommended to change the nature of the poison which the body is perpetually producing in itself. Where corrosive mercury has been swallowed, alkaline salt is recommended to destroy the poison which nature cannot expel by vomiting; and why\nwhy should not something be attempted to destroy the poison which the stomach seems to secrete in the hydrophobia, and which nature attempts to expel, though in vain, by violent efforts to vomit?\n\nBut whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> may be pursued in the hopes of curing this dreadful malady after any of the symptoms have made their appearance, we ought, in every instance, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> our immediate care to prevention, as being perhaps the only real ground of hope: And the most certain and efficacious way of preventing the ill consequences, is instantly (if it can be done) to cut out the piece that happens to be bitten. Dr James, indeed, says, that he would have little opinion of cutting or cauterizing, if ten minutes were suffered to elapse from the receiving of the bite before the operation was performed. But in an inaugural dissertation lately published at Edinburgh by Dr Parry, the author is of opinion that excision will be of use a considerable time after the bite is received. He adopts this opinion from what happens in the smallpox, where the blood does not seem to receive the infection till some days after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INOCULATION\">inoculation</a> has been performed. A second inflammation, he tells us, then takes place, and the infection is conveyed into the blood. In like manner, when the hydrophobic infection is about to be conveyed into the blood, according to him, the wound, or its cicatrix, begins again to be inflamed; and it is this second inflammation which does all the mischief. Excision, or the cautery, will therefore be effectual any time between the bite and the second inflammation of the wound. Without implicitly trusting to this doctrine, however, or considering it as in any degree ascertained in what manner the poison diffuses itself, by what marks its progress may be known, or how soon the system may be irremediably tainted with its malignity, it is undoubtedly safest not to lose unnecessarily a moment's time in applying the knife. This, or a dilation of the wound if it be small, Dr Vaughan considers as the only prophylactics that can be depended upon. In the latter case, he directs to fill the wound with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, and set fire to it; which would produce a laceration of the part, and possibly the action of ignited powder upon the poison may have its use. In all cases, likewise, after these practices have been employed, the wound should be prevented from healing for some length of time.\n\nSp. II. The Spontaneous Hydrophobia.\n\nHydrophobia spontanea, Sauv. sp. 2.\n\nThis disease very much resembles the former, so that it has undoubtedly been often mistaken for it. It has been known to come on from an inflammation of the stomach, where it was cured by repeated and large bloodletting; in hysteria, where it was cured by opium, musk, or other antispasmodics; and in putrid fevers, where it was cured by evacuating the intestinal canal of the putrid matters by repeated elysters. A very good method of distinguishing the two is, that in the spontaneous hydrophobia the patient is much more delirious than in the genuine species. In the instance mentioned in the Medical Essays of this symptom attending the inflammation of the stomach, the patient raved in the most extraordinary manner. Dr Raymond says he remembers a spontaneous hydrophobia attended with madness; and in almost all the cases of hydrophobia which are said to have been cured, the patient was very delirious.\n\nDr Nugent's patient was very frequently delirious, and dreaded dogs as well as water. In the Medical Transactions a case is communicated by W. Wrightson surgeon in Sedgefield, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>, of canine madness successfully treated. This madness indeed came on after the bite of a dog said to be mad: but it appeared only four days after the accident happened, and was attended with symptoms very unlike any of those above-mentioned; for he suddenly started up in a fit of delirium, and ran out of the house, and after being brought in, caught hold of the hot bars of the grate which held the fire: Whereas, in the true hydrophobia, the patients dread the fire, light, or any thing which makes a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the senses. It is probable, therefore, that this was only a spontaneous hydrophobia, especially as it readily yielded to venesection, 30 drops of laudanum, and pills of a grain and a half of opium given every three hours, some boluses of musk and cinnabar, &c. while in some of the former cases as much opium was given to a boy as would have deprived of life the strongest healthy man had he swallowed it; and yet this amazing quantity produced scarcely any effect. This patient also dreaded the sight of a dog.\n\nORDER IV. VESANIAE.\n\nParanoiae, Vog. Class IX.\nDeliria, Sauv. Class VIII. Ord. III. Sag. Class XI.\nOrd. III.\nIdeales, Lin. Class V. Ord.

Battie on Madness.\nParaphrosyne, Lin. 66.\nAmentia,\nAlthough these distempers may be considered as distinct genera, yet they are so nearly allied, and so readily change into each other, that it sufficiently justifies the treating all of them together.\n\nThe distinguishing characteristic of madness, according to Dr Battie, is a false perception; and under this general character may be comprehended all kinds of what is called madness, from the most silly stupidity and idiotism to the most furious lunacy. Frequently the different kinds of madness are changed into each other by the casual excitement of some passion: thus, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDIOT\">idiot</a> may become furiously mad, by being put in a violent passion; though this does not so often happen as the change of melancholy into the raving madness, and vice versa.\n\nIt is a very surprising circumstance, that mad people are not only less liable to be seized with infectious disorders than those who are in perfect health; but even when labouring under other diseases, if the patients chance to be seized with madness, they are sometimes freed from their former complaints. Of this kind Dr Mead relates two very remarkable instances.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been known, that an intermittent fever, supervening upon madness of long standing, has proved a cure for the madness; the senses having returned when the fever terminated. Dr Monro saw two instances of this himself; and mentions it as an observation made also by his predecessor in the care of Bethlehem <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>.\n\nAnother remarkable circumstance is, that immoderate joy, long continued, as effectually disorders the mind as anxiety and grief. For it was observable in the famous South Sea year, when so many immense fortunes were suddenly gained, and as suddenly lost, that more people had their heads turned, from the prodigious flow of unexpected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, than from the entire loss of their whole substance.\n\nMad people, especially of the melancholic kind, sometimes obstinately persevere in doing things which must excite great pain; whence it should seem as if their minds were troubled with some distracting notions, which make them patiently bear the present distress, lest more severe tortures should be inflicted; or possibly they may think, that, by thus tormenting the body, they render themselves more acceptable to the divine Being, and expiate the heinous sins of which they may imagine themselves to have been guilty.\n\nIt is, however, also highly probable that their feelings differ exceedingly from what they are in a natural state; at least they are every day observed to endure, apparently without the smallest uneasiness, watching, hunger, and cold, to an extent which in a state of health would not only be highly distressing, but to the greater part of individuals would even prove fatal. And this resistance of hunger, cold, and sleep, affords perhaps the best test for distinguishing cases of real insanity, from cases where the disease is only feigned, and appearances of it put on, to answer particular purposes; at least where this power of resistance is present, we have good reason to conclude that the affection is not feigned.\n\nCure. Although we be well acquainted with many of the remote causes of this disease, some of the principal of which have already been mentioned, yet we are still so ignorant of the influence of these upon the system, as giving a derangement of the mental faculties, that no general principles on which the cure may be conducted, can with any confidence be pointed out.\n\nIt may, however, be observed, that while some remedies seem to operate by producing an artificial termination of this complaint, many others have effect only as aiding a natural termination. And where a recovery from this disease does take place, it most frequently happens in consequence of a natural convalescence. All the species and degrees of madness which are hereditary, or that grow up with people from their early youth, are out of the power of physic; and so for the most part, are all maniacal cases of more than one year's standing, from whatever source they may arise. Very often mere debility, the dregs of some particular disease, such as an ague, the small-pox, or a nervous fever, shall occasion different degrees of foolishness or madness. In these cases, the cure must not be attempted by evacuations; but, on the contrary, by nourishing diet, clear air, moderate exercise, and the use of wine: whereas, in almost all the other maniacal cases, which arise from different sources, and which come on in consequence of intemperate living, violent passions, or intense thinking, it is generally held, that evacuations of every kind are necessary, unless the constitution of the patient be such as absolutely forbids them.\n\nBlood is most conveniently drawn either from the arm or jugulars; and if the weakness be such as renders it improper to take away much blood, we may apply cupping-glasses to the occiput.\n\nVomiting, in weakly people, must be excited by the vinum ipecacuanhae; but in the more robust by emetic tartar or antimonial wine: the most efficacious cathartics are the infusion or tincture of black hellebore, or infusion of senna quickened with tincture of jalap; but if there be suppression of the menses, or of an habitual hemorrhoidal discharge, then aloetic purges will be more proper; and in some instances cooling saline purgatives, such as lixiviated tartar, are of great service. In general, mad people require very large doses, both of the emetics and cathartics, before any considerable operation ensues.\n\nDr Monro assures us, that the evacuation by vomiting is infinitely preferable to any other: the prodigious quantity of phlegm with which the patients in this disease abound, he says, is not to be overcome but by repeated emetics; and he observes, that the purges have not their right effect, or do not operate to so good purpose, until the phlegm be broken and attenuated by frequent emetics. He mentions the case of a gentleman who had laboured under a melancholy for three years, from which he was relieved entirely by the use of vomits and a proper regimen. Increasing the discharge by urine, is also of the greatest moment, especially when any degree of fever is present. The cutaneous discharges are also to be promoted; for which purpose the hot bath is of the highest service in maniacal cases. Hoffman asserts, that he has seen numerous instances, both of inveterate melancholy and raging madness, happily cured by means of warm bathing;\nbleeding and nitrous medicines having been premised. Camphor has also been highly commended; but, if we can believe Dr Locker of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, not very deservedly. Having found very good effects from a solution of this medicine in vinegar, he took it for granted that all the success was owing to the camphor; therefore, in order to give it a fair trial, he selected seven patients, and gave it in large doses of half a dram twice a-day. This was continued for two months, and the doctor was surprised to find that only one of his patients received any benefit. He then returned the other six back to the camphorated julep made with vinegar, and in a few weeks four of them recovered the use of their reason. This inclined him to think that the virtue depended solely on the vinegar, and accordingly he began to make the trial. Common vinegar was first given; but after a little while he fixed on that which had been distilled, and gave about an ounce and a half of it every day; the patients having been previously prepared by bleeding and purging, which was repeated according as it was found necessary. He gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of eight patients who were cured by this method; some in six weeks, others in two months, and none of them took up more than three months in perfecting the cure. He does not indeed give the ages of the patients, nor mention the circumstances of the cases; he only mentions the day on which the use of the vinegar was begun and the day on which they were discharged; and he adds, that they all continued well at the time of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>.\n\nDr Locker informs us, that this medicine acts chiefly as a sudorific; and he observed, that the more the patients sweated, the sooner they were cured: it was also found to promote the menstrual discharge in such as had been obstructed, or had too little of this salutary evacuation.\n\nBoth reason and experience show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of confining such as are deprived of their senses; and no small share of the management consists in preventing them from hurting either themselves or others. It has sometimes been usual to chain and to beat them; but this is both cruel and absurd; since the contrivance called the strait waistcoat answers every purpose of restraining without hurting them.\n\nThese waistcoats are made of ticken, or some such strong stuff; are open at the back, and laced on like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of stays; the sleeves are made tight, and long enough to cover the ends of the fingers, where they are drawn close with a string like a purse mouth, by which contrivance the patient has no power of his fingers; and when laid on his back in bed, and the arms brought across the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, and fastened in that position by tying the sleeve-strings round the waist, he has no use of his hands. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> strap of girth-web is then carried across the breast, and fastened to the bedstead, by which means the patient is confined on his back; and if he should be so outrageous as to require further restraint, the legs are secured by ligatures to the foot of the bed; or they may be secured by being both put into one bag not very wide, which may be more easily fixed than the feet themselves, at least without giving pain.\n\nIt is of great use in practice to bear in mind, that all mad people are cowardly, and can be awed even by the menacing look of a very expressive countenance; and when those who have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of them once impress them with the notion of fear, they easily submit to anything that is required. The physician, however, should never deceive them in any thing, but more especially with regard to their distemper: for as they are generally conscious of it themselves, they acquire a kind of reverence for those who know it; and by letting them see that he is thoroughly acquainted with their complaint, he may very often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> such an ascendant over them that they will readily follow his directions.\n\nIt is a more difficult matter to manage those whose madness is accompanied either with excessive joy or with great dejection and despondency, than those who are agitated with rage: and all that can be done is to endeavour to excite contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, by repressing the immoderate fits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAUGHTER\">laughter</a> in the one kind by chiding or threatening (taking care, however, not absolutely to terrify them, which can never be done without danger, and has often added to the misery of the unhappy sufferer); and dispelling the gloomy thoughts in the other, by introducing pleasing concerts of music, or any other species of entertainment which the patients have been known to delight in while they had the use of their reason. Upon the whole, in the cure of insanity, more perhaps to be effected by moral than by medical treatment. And this moral treatment should be as gentle as is consistent with safety. Chains, bolts, and severity of every kind are to be avoided as much as possible. But while great benefit is often derived from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> and amusement, so also, on the other hand, solitary confinement is in not a few cases productive of the best effects.\n\nThough blistering the head has generally been directed, Dr Mead says he has oftener found it to do harm than service: but he recommends issues in the back; and advises to keep the head always close shaved, and to wash it from time to time with warm vinegar. Opium has by many been forbidden in maniacal cases, from a supposition that it always increases the disturbance; but there are instances where large doses of this medicine have been found to prove a cure, and perhaps if it were tried oftener we should find powerful effects from it: there certainly cannot much harm ensue from a few doses, which may be immediately disused if they should be found to exasperate the disease.\n\nThe diet of maniacal patients ought to be perfectly light and thin: their meals should be moderate; but they should never be suffered to live too low, especially while they are under a course of physic: they should be obliged to observe great regularity in their hours: even their amusements should be such as are best suited to their disposition. After the disease appears to be subdued, chalybeate waters and the cold bath will be highly proper to strengthen their whole frame and secure them against a relapse.\n\n**Genus LXVIII.

Those seized with it seem to have a weight on their breasts and about their precordia. Sometimes they imagine they see spectres of various kinds which oppress or threaten them with suffocation. Neither does this uneasiness continue only while they are asleep; for it is some time after they awake before they can turn themselves in their beds or speak; nay, sometimes, though rarely, the distemper has proved mortal.\u2014The incubus rarely seizes people except when the stomach is oppressed with aliment of hard digestion, and the patient lies on his back. It is to be cured by eating light suppers, and raising the head high; or, if it become very troublesome, antispasmodic medicines are to be administered, and the body strengthened by chalybeates. The same method is to be followed by those who are subject to walking in their sleep; a practice which must necessarily be attended with the greatest danger; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOMNAMBULISM\">somnambulism</a> may justly be considered as merely a different modification of this disease. Accordingly Dr Cullen has distinguished the one by the title of oneirodynia activa, and the other by that of oneirodynia gravans.\n\nClass III. Cachexiae.\n\nCachexiae, Sauv. Class X. and Class VIII.

Tabes.\n\nWasting of the Body.\n\nTabes, Sauv. gen. 275. Lin. 209. Vog. 306. Sag. 100.\n\nThis disorder is occasioned by the absorption of pus from some ulcer, external or internal, which produces an hectic fever. The primary indication therefore must be to heal the ulcer, and thus take away the cause of the disease. If the ulcer cannot be healed, the patient will certainly die in an emaciated state. But the proper treatment of the tabes proceeding from this cause, falls to be considered under the head of Ulcer in Surgery, and likewise under the genera Syphilis, Scrofula, Scorbutus, &c. diseases in which ulcers are at least a very common symptom.\n\nGenus LXX. Atrophia.\n\nNervous Consumption.\n\nDescription. This affection consists principally in a wasting of the body, without any remarkable fever, cough, or difficulty of breathing; but attended with want of appetite and a bad digestion, whence the whole body grows languid, and wastes by degrees.\u2014Atrophia. Dr Cullen, however, asserts, that some degree of fever, or at least of increased quickness of the pulse, always attends this disease.\n\nCauses. Sometimes this distemper will come on without any evident cause. Sometimes it will arise from passions of the mind; from an abuse of spirituous liquors; from excessive evacuations, especially of the semen, in which case the distemper has got the name of tabes dorsalis. It may arise from mere old age, or from famine.\n\nPrognosis. This distemper, from whatever cause it may arise, is very difficult to cure, and often terminates in a fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DROPSY\">dropsy</a>.\n\nCure. The general principles on which the treatment of this disease is to be regulated, very much depend on the cause by which it is induced; and it is unnecessary to add, that this must be removed as far as possible. Next to this, the disease is most effectually combated by the introduction of nutritious aliment into the system, and by obtaining the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSIMILATION\">assimilation</a> and digestion of this. With the first of these intentions, recourse must be had to the diet which is most nutritious, and at the same time of easiest digestion. But from the condition of the stomach commonly attending this disease, it is necessary that small quantities only should be taken at a time, and that it should be frequently repeated. With the second intention, stomachic and nervous medicines are the articles chiefly at least to be depended upon in this case. The Peruvian bark, sulphuric acid, and chalybeates, are excellent; and these should be conjoined with gentle exercise, as far as the strength and other circumstances of the patient will admit. In that species of the distemper occasioned by venereal excesses, it is so essentially necessary to abstain from them, that without it the best remedies will prove altogether useless.\n\nOrder II.

Lin. 213. Vog. 540. Sag. 160. Scatiles, Vog. 390.\n\nIn a natural and healthy state, the fat, or animal oil, is not allowed to diffuse itself throughout the cellular interstices at large, but is confined to the places where such an oily fluid is necessary, by a particular apparatus of distinct vesicles. But in some constitutions the oily part of the blood appears to exceed the requisite proportion, and easily separates from the other constituent parts; or there is an uncommon tendency to the separation of oily matter. In these cases it is apt to accumulate in such quantities, that we may suppose it to burst those vesicles which were originally destined to hinder it from spreading too far; or almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELL\">cell</a> of the membrana adiposa, many of which are in ordinary cases altogether empty, may be completely filled and distended with fat.\n\nThe increase of the omentum particularly, and the accumulation\naccumulation of fat about the kidneys and mesentery, swell the abdomen, and obstruct the motions of the diaphragm; whence one reason of the difficulty of breathing which is peculiar to corpulent people; while the heart, and the large vessels connected with it, are in like manner so encumbered, that neither the systolic nor subsultory motion can be performed with sufficient freedom, whence weakness and slowness of the pulse: but when the whole habit is in a manner overwhelmed with an oily fluid, the enlargement of the cellular interstices will necessarily interrupt the general distribution and circulation throughout the nervous and vascular systems; impeding the action of the muscular fibres, and producing insensibility, somnolency, and death.\n\nThese cases are the more deplorable, as there is but little prospect of a cure. For the animal oil is of too gross a nature to be easily taken up by absorption; and we know, that when fluids are accumulated in the cellular system, there are only two ways in which they can be carried off or escape; namely, by the absorbents, which take their rise from the cellular interstices, and through the pores of the skin by transudation.\n\nAnother misfortune is, that the disease steals on so imperceptibly, that it becomes inveterate before people begin to think of pursuing the proper means of relief.\n\nIn this disease the cure must turn upon two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>: First, on preventing the farther deposition of fat, by avoiding the introduction of superfluous aliment, particularly of fatty matters, into the system; and, secondly, on promoting and forwarding the absorption of fat. On these grounds, besides what may be done by proper regimen, a variety of articles have been recommended in the way of medicine.\n\nSoap has been proposed as a remedy to melt down and facilitate the absorption of the fat in corpulent people; and Dr Fleming some years ago published a little treatise, wherein he recommends this medicine, and relates the case of a gentleman who is said to have received considerable benefit from it. But perhaps the soap-leys would be more powerful, and might be more easily taken, sheathed in the manner directed when used as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLVENT\">dissolvent</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>.\n\nLientaud advises to take acetum scilliticum in small doses, with frequent purging and brisk exercise. But it will seldom happen that the patients will be found sufficiently steady to persist in any of these courses, it being the nature of the disorder to render them irsolute and inattentive to their condition. Therefore the principal use of rules must be with a view to prevention; and persons who are disposed to corpulency should take care in time to prevent it from becoming an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> disease by using a great deal of exercise, not indulging in sleep, and abridging their meals, especially that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>. Salted meats are less fattening than such as are fresh; and drinking freely of coffee is recommended to corpulent people.\n\nBut Dr Fothergill observes, that a strict adherence to vegetable diet reduces exuberant fat more certainly than any other means that he knows; and gives two cases in which this regimen succeeded remarkably well. The famous Dr Cheyne brought himself down in this way, from a most unwieldy bulk to a reasonable degree of weight; as he himself informs us. It deserves, however, to be remarked, that every practice for the removal or prevention of fatness must be used with great caution and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>; for not a few, anxious to prevent this affection, have had recourse to a regimen and to medicine which have proved fatal. This has particularly arisen from the excessive use of acids, probably operating by entirely destroying the action of the chylopoietic viscera.\n\nGenus LXXII. PNEUMATOSIS.\n\nEmphysema, or Windy Swelling.\n\nPneumatosis, Sauv. gen. 280. Vog. 391. Sag. 107.\nEmphysema, Sauv. gen. 13. Lin. 288. Vog. 392.\nLeucophlegmatia, Lin. 214.\n\nThe emphysema sometimes comes on spontaneously; but more frequently is occasioned by wounds of the lungs, which, giving vent to the air, that fluid insinuates itself into the cellular texture, and often blows it up to a surprising degree. It must be observed, however, that it is only in cases of laceration of the lungs where this disease can take place; for in a simple wound, the effusion of blood always prevents the air from getting out. The cure is to be accomplished by scarifications and compresses; but in some cases only by the paracentesis of the thorax. When air introduced from the lungs is collected in a considerable quantity in the cavity of the thorax, the operation of the paracentesis is perhaps the only means of cure. Upon an opening being thus made, the air sometimes rushes out with incredible violence; and the patient receives at least immediate relief from circumstances the most distressing imaginable. In some instances it is followed even by a complete cure.\n\nGenus LXXIII. TYMPANITES.\n\nTympany.\n\nTympanites, Sauv. gen. 291. Lin. 219. Vog. 316.\nSag. 118. Boerh. 226. Junck. 87.\nAffectio tympanitica, Hoffm. III. 339.\nMeteorismus, Sauv. gen. 292.\n\nThis is an inflation of the abdomen, and is of two kinds: 1. That in which the flatus is contained in the intestines, in which the patient has frequent explosions of wind, with a swelling of the belly commonly unequal. 2. When the flatus is contained in the cavity of the abdomen; in which case the swelling is more equal, and the belly sounds when struck, without any considerable emission of flatus. Of these two, however, the former disease is by much the most common; insomuch, that many, even extensively engaged in practice, have never met with an instance of true abdominal tympanites. In both cases the rest of the body falls away.\n\nCauses, &c. The tympany sometimes takes place in those who have been long troubled with flatulencies in the stomach and intestines. It happens frequently to women after abortion; to both sexes after the suppression of the hemorrhoids; and sometimes from tedious febrile disorders injudiciously treated.\n\nPrognosis. This disease is generally very obstinate, and for the most part proves fatal by degenerating in\nto an ascites. Sometimes, if the patient be healthy and strong, the disease may terminate favourably, and that the more readily if it has followed from some disorder. A hectic consumption, dry cough, and emaciated countenance in a tympany, with a swelling of the feet, denote approaching death in a very short time.\n\nCure. With a view to the prevention of this affection, it is necessary, in the first place, to avoid, as far as it can be done, causes giving rise to an uncommon extrication of air; by preserving the proper tone of the alimentary canal. After the affection has taken place, the indications are, first, to expel the air already extricated and confined in different cavities; and, secondly, to prevent further accumulation. On these grounds different remedies are employed. The cure, however, is principally attempted by carminative, resolvent, and stomachic medicines, gentle laxatives, and at last tonics, especially chalybates. In the Edinburgh Medical Essays, vol. i. we have a very remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of a tympany by Dr Monro senior. The patient was a young woman of 22 years of age, who fell into the distemper after a tertian ague, in which she was badly treated. She became a patient in the Edinburgh Infirmary the 24th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1730; took several purgatives, and some doses of calomel; used the warm bath; and had an antihysteric plaster applied over the whole belly, but with very little effect. She was monstrously distended, insomuch that the skin seemed to be in danger of bursting: her breathing was much strained; but the swelling sometimes gradually decreased without any evacuation. The returns and degree of this swelling were very uncertain; and when the belly was most distended, several unequal and protuberant balls could be felt over the whole abdomen, but especially at its sides. Her stomach was good, she had no thirst, and her urine was in proportion to the quantity she drank. She was very costive, had her menses at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> periods, but no oedematous swellings appeared in the feet or anywhere else. In this situation she continued from the time of her admission till the 21st of June, during which interval she had only menstruated twice. Throughout the space of time, the following circumstances were observed, 1. Several times, upon the falling of the swelling, she complained of a headache; once of pains throughout all her body, once of a giddiness, twice of a nausea and vomiting, and the last time threw up green bile; and once her stomach swelled greatly, whilst the rest of the abdomen subsided. 2. During the flowing of the menses she did not swell, but became very big upon their stopping. 3. Blood-letting and emetics, which were made use of for some accidental urgent symptoms, had no very sensible effect in making the tympany either better or worse. 4. She never had passage of wind either way, except a little belching some days before the monthly evacuation.\n\nSome time before the last eruption of the menses, the purgatives were given more sparingly; and anti-hysteric medicines of the strongest kinds, such as asafoetida, oleum corn. cerv. &c. mixed with soap, were given in large doses, accompanied with the hotter antiscorbutics as they are called, as horseradish and ginger-root infused in strong-ale with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>. The patient was ordered to use frequent and strong frictions to all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of her body and extremities, and to use moderate exercise. Immediately before the menses began to flow, Physomelsters of the same kind of medicines were injected. The menses were in sufficient quantity; but as soon as they ceased, her belly increased in its circumference four inches and a half, but soon subsided. She then complained of pains, which a gentle sweat carried off. Borborygmus were for the first time observed on the same day, June 25th; and having taken some tinctura sacra at night, she passed a small quantity of blood next day by stool. This was the first appearance of the return of the hemorrhoids, to which she had been formerly subject.\n\nThe two following days her saponaceous, antihysteric, and antiscorbutic medicines being still continued, she had such explosions of wind upwards and downwards, that none of the other patients would remain in the same room, nay scarce on the same floor with her. Her belly became less and softer than it had been from the first attack of the disease; her medicines, with a dose of syrup of buckthorn at proper intervals, still were continued, only the proportion of steel was increased; her flatulent discharge went on successfully, and she gradually recovered her former health.\n\nGenus LXXIV. PHYSOMETRA.\n\nWindy Swelling of the Uterus.\n\nPhysometra, Sauv. gen. 290. Sag. 119.\nHysterophyse, Vog. 317.\n\nThe treatment of this is not different from that of the tympany. It is however, upon the whole, a very rare disease; and when it takes place, very seldom if ever admits of a cure.\n\nGenus LXXV.

Millman Animadversiones de hydropoe 1779.\nPhlegmatia, Sauv. gen. 282.\nAngina aquosa, Boerh. 791.\n\nIn this disease the feet first begin to swell, especially in the evening, after exercise, and when the patient has stood or sat long; this swelling rises frequently to the thighs. By lying in bed, the swelling becomes less, or even almost disappears. In the progress of the disease, the swelling often rises to the hips, loins, and belly, and at last covers the whole body. This disease, besides the other symptoms afterwards mentioned under ASCITES, is attended with a remarkable difficulty of breathing. In the cure of this, as well as other species of dropsy, the general intentions are, first, the evacuation of the water already effused either by natural or artificial outlets; and, secondly, the prevention of fresh accumulation, which is chiefly to be expected from supporting a due action of the absorbents, and from keeping up a proper discharge by the serous excretories.\n\nThe remedies employed with these intentions are much the same with what are employed against the more\nmore important genus of ascites. Only it may be here noticed, that in anaesthesia it has by many been recommended to scarify the feet and legs. By this means the water is often discharged; but the operator must be cautious not to make the incisions too deep; they ought barely to penetrate through the skin; and special care must be taken, by spirituous fomentations and proper digestives, to prevent a gangrene. Dr Fothergill observes, that the safest and most efficacious way of making these drains is by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> used for cupping, called a scarificator; and he always orders it to be so applied as to make the little wounds transversely; as they not only discharge better, but are also longer in healing, than when made longitudinally.\n\nNotwithstanding every precaution, however, gangrene will often ensue; and it is upon the whole a much safer practice to evacuate the water by the natural outlets, the valvular lymphatic absorbents; and with this intention emetics and cathartics, but particularly diuretics, are often employed with success.\n\nGENUS LXXVI. HYDROCEPHALUS.\n\nWater in the Head.\n\nExternal or Chronic Hydrocephalus.\n\nHydrocephalus, Sauv. gen. 285. Lin. 216. Boerh. 1217.\n\nHydrocephalum, Vog. 384.\n\nThis differs from the hydrocephalus formerly treated of at some length under the title of Apoplexia Hydrocephalica, chiefly in the water being collected in the external parts of the head, whereas the former is entirely within the skull. In the fifth volume of the Medical Observations we have an account of a very extraordinary case of this kind. The patient was a child only of a few days old, and had a tumor on his head about the size of a common tea-cup, which had the appearance of a bladder distended with water; near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a> was a small opening, through which a bloody serum was discharged. In other respects the child was healthy. No application was used but a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> dipt in brandy. The tumor continued to increase for many months; at the end of which time the membrane containing the water appeared equally thick with the other part of the scalp, except at one place about the size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a>, which continued thin, and at times appeared as if it would burst. He remained in this situation for about 17 months, when the circumference of the head was 20 inches, the base 16\u00bd, the middle 18\u00bd; and from the base to the apex near 8\u00bd. The water was then drawn off, and the child died in two days. Almost all other cases of this distemper have proved fatal; the sutures of the skull generally give way, and the whole external part of the head is equally enlarged; but in the instance just now given there was a deficiency of part of the bones. Although, however, in some instances, where the head is thus enlarged to an enormous size, the water is exterior to the brain, and therefore entitled to the appellation of hydrocephalus exterior, yet much more frequently in those instances where there is a manifest separation of the bones of the cranium at the sutures, the water is still contained within the ventricles; and accordingly the disease may be much more properly distinguished into the acute and chronic hydrocephalus, than as is commonly done into the internal and external. Although the latter be much slower in its progress, sometimes subsisting even for years, yet it is equally difficult of cure with the former, and very often it proves fatal in a few days if the water be drawn off by an artificial opening, which may be very easily performed by a mere puncture with a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCET\">lancet</a>, without either pain or any immediate hazard from the operation itself, although the water be lodged in the ventricles; for these are distended to an enormous size, and the substance of the brain almost totally destroyed, so that hardly anything is to be punctured but membrane.\n\nGENUS LXXVII.

HYDROTHERAX.\n\nDropsy of the Breast.\n\nHydrotorax, Sauv. gen. 350. Vog. 311. Boerh. 1219.\n\nThis affection, particularly with respect to its causes, is in many circumstances similar to other kinds of dropsy, particularly to ascites. But from the situation of the water, which is here deposited in the cavity of the thorax, it may naturally be supposed that some peculiar symptoms will occur. Besides the common symptoms of dropsy, paleness of the countenance, scarcity of urine, and the like, this disease is, in some instances, attended with a fluctuation of water within the breast; which, when it does occur, may be considered as a certain distinguishing mark of this affection. But besides this, it is also distinguished by the remarkable affections of circulation and respiration with which it is attended.\n\nThe breathing is peculiarly difficult, especially in a recumbent posture; and in many instances patients cannot breathe with tolerable ease, unless when sitting erect, or even stooping somewhat forwards. The pulse is very irregular, and has often remarkable intermissions. But the disease has been thought to be principally characterized by a sudden starting from sleep, in consequence of an almost inexpressible uneasy sensation referred to the breast, and attended with strong palpitation, which may probably arise from an affection either of circulation or of respiration.\n\nThat these symptoms are common attendants of this disease, is undeniable; and they are certainly the best characteristics of this affection with which we are yet acquainted: but it must be allowed that they are present in some cases where there is no water in the breast;\nand that in other instances where the disease exists, they are either altogether wanting, or occur only to a very slight degree. Certain diagnostics, therefore, of this disease still remain to be discovered.\n\nWhen hydrothorax is present, from the affection of the vital functions with which it is attended, it may readily be concluded that it is a dangerous disease, and in many instances it proves fatal. The cure, as far as it can be accomplished, is obtained very much on the same principles as in other dropsies. Here, however, probably from the uncertainty of the diagnostics, the artificial abstraction of water, by paracentesis of the thorax, is less frequently had recourse to than in ascites; though in some instances, after other means have failed, it has been said not only to give relief of symptoms highly urgent, particularly dyspnoea, but even to produce a complete cure. Benefit is often obtained from an artificial discharge of water by the application of blisters to the breast: but in this, as well as other dropsies, a discharge is chiefly effected by the natural outlets, particularly from the use of cathartics and diuretics. In this species of dropsy, more perhaps than in any other, recourse has been had to the use of the digitalis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PURPUREA\">purpurea</a>, or foxglove, so strongly recommended as a diuretic by Dr Withering in his treatise respecting the use of it. There can be no doubt that this article, though sometimes productive of inconvenience from the distressing sickness and severe vomiting which it not unfrequently excites, though used even but in small doses, often operates as a powerful diuretic, and produces a complete evacuation of water, after other articles have failed. From the effects mentioned above, however, as well as from its influence on the pulse, which it renders much slower, it is necessary that it should be employed with great caution, and in small doses. A dram of the dried leaves of the digitalis, macerated for four hours in half a pint of warm water, forms an infusion which may be given in doses of an ounce, and the dried powder of the leaves in doses of one or two grains: these doses may be gradually increased, and repeated twice or oftener in the day; but this requires to be done with great caution, lest severe vomiting, or other distressing symptoms, should take place.\n\nGENUS LXXIX.

When it is interposed between the abdominal muscles and peritoneum. Or, 3. When it is contained in sacs and hollow vesicles: in which case it is called the encysted dropsy. Some physicians of great reputation have asserted, that the water was often placed within the duplicature of the peritoneum: but this is alleged by Dr Milman to be a mistake, as that membrane is looked upon by the best anatomists to be single; and he thinks that the above-mentioned physicians have been led into this error from observing the water collected in the cellular substance of the peritoneum.\n\nIn the beginning of an ascites the patient becomes languid, breathless, and has an aversion to motion: his belly swells; and, when struck, the sound of fluctuating water is perceptible; there is a difficulty of breathing when the belly is pressed. There is an almost continual thirst, which in the progress of the disease becomes very urgent; the urine is thick, in small quantity, and high coloured. The pulse is small and frequent; and as the belly swells, the other parts waste away. A fever at last arises, which constantly increasing, in the end carries off the patient. These symptoms are most urgent where the waters are in immediate contact with the intestines; in the other kinds the rest of the body is less wasted; nor is there so great thirst or difficulty of breathing.\n\nCauses, &c. The immediate cause of dropsy is a greater effusion of serum by the exhalant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a> than the absorbents take up. This may be occasioned either by too great a quantity of liquid thrown out by the former, or by an inability of the latter to perform their office. This commonly happens in people whose bodies are of a weak and lax texture, and hence women are more subject to this malady than men; chlorotic girls especially are very apt to become dropsical.\n\nSometimes, however, this disease is occasioned by a debility of the vital powers, by great evacuations of blood, or by acute diseases accidentally protracted beyond their usual period; and although this cause seems very different from a laxity of fibres, yet the dropsy seems to be produced in a similar manner by both. For the vital powers being debilitated by either of these causes, naturally bring on a certain debility and laxity of the solids; and, on the other hand, a debility of the solids always brings on a debility of the vital powers; and from this debility of the vital powers in both cases it happens, that those humours which ought to be expelled from the body are not discharged, but accumulate by degrees in its cavities. There is, however, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the two kinds of dropsy arising from these two different causes: That in the one which arises from laxity, the solid parts are more injured than in that which arises from a debility of the vital powers. In the former, therefore, the water seems to flow out from every quarter, and the body swells all over. But when the disease is occasioned by a debility of the vital powers, though the solids be less diseased, yet the power of the heart being much diminished, and the humours scarce propelled through the extreme vessels, the thin liquids, by which in a healthy state the body is daily recruited, are carried by their own weight either into the cavities or into the cellular texture. Hence those aqueous effusions which follow great evacuations of blood, or violent loosenesses, begin in the more depending parts of the body, gradually ascending, till they arrive at the cavity of the abdomen, or even the thorax.\n\nBut another and much more sufficient cause for the production of dropsy is an obstruction of the circulation; and this may take place from polypi in the heart or large vessels, and hard swellings in the abdomen. Instances have been observed of a dropsy arising from steatomatous tumors in the omentum, and many more from a scirrhou liver or spleen, and from an infarction.\nIntumescence and obstruction of the mesenteric glands, by which means the lymph coming from the extremities is prevented from arriving at the heart. Scirrhosity of the liver, the most common cause of ascites, probably operates by augmenting effusion, in consequence of its preventing the return of the venous blood, the greater part of the veins from the abdomen going to the formation of the vena portatium.\n\nLastly, Whatever, either within or without the vessels, contracts or shuts up their cavities, produces a more copious and easy transmission of the thin humours through the exhalant arteries, at the same time that it prevents their return by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> veins. This has been established by experiment: For Lower having perforated the right side of the thorax in a dog, tied the vena cava, and sewed up the wound. The animal languished for a few hours, and then died. On dissection, a great quantity of serum was found in the abdomen, as if he had long laboured under an ascites. In like manner, having tied the jugular veins of another dog, a surprising swelling took place in those parts above the ligatures, and in two days the animal died. On dissection, all the muscles and glands were vastly distended, and quite pellucid, with limpid serum. From these experiments, and some cases of the disease mentioned by different authors, it appears, that when the veins are obstructed so that they cannot receive the arterial blood, the serum is separated as by a filter into the more open cavities and laxer parts of the body, while the thicker part stagnates and is collected in the proper blood-vessels.\n\nThe too great tenacity of the humours is very frequently accused as the cause of dropsy, and many authors have asserted that dropsy might arise merely from a superabundance of water in the blood. For this, some experiments are quoted, from which they would infer, that when a great quantity of aqueous fluid is introduced into the blood, the superfluous fluid ought by no means to pass through the extremities of the sanguiferous arteries into the veins in the common course of circulation, but by being effused into the cavities should produce a dropsy. But this can only happen when the vital powers are very much diminished; for, in a natural state, the superfluous quantity is immediately thrown out by the skin or the kidneys: and agreeable to this we have an experiment of Schulzius, who induced a dropsy in a dog by causing him drink a great quantity of water; but he had first bled him almost ad deliquium, so that the vital powers were in a manner oppressed by the deluge of water. In this manner do those become hydroptic who are seized with the disease on drinking large quantities of water either when wearied with labour, or weakened by some kinds of diseases. Dr Fothergill relates an instance of a person who, being advised to drink plentifully of barley-water, in order to remove a fever, rashly drunk 12 pounds of that liquor every day for a month, and thus fell into an almost incurable dropsy. But if this quantity had been taken only during the prevalence of the fever, he would in all probability have suffered no inconvenience, as may be inferred from what has been related concerning the dieta aquae used by the Italians.\n\nIt is moreover evident from experiments, that, in a healthy state, not only water is not deposited in the cavities, but that if it is injected into them it will be absorbed, unless some laxity of the solids has already taken place. Dr Musgrave injected into the right side of the thorax of a dog four ounces of warm water; whence a difficulty of breathing and weakness immediately followed. But these symptoms continually lessened, and in the space of a week the animal seemed to be in as good health as before. Afterwards he injected 16 ounces of warm water into the left cavity of the thorax in the same dog; the same effects followed, together with great heat, and strong pulsation of the heart; but he again recovered in the space of a week. Lastly, He injected 18 ounces of water into one side of the thorax, and only six into the other: the same symptoms followed, but vanished in a much shorter time; for within five days the dog was restored to perfect health. During this time, however, he observed that the dog made a greater quantity of urine than usual.\n\nThe remote causes of dropsy are many and various. Whatever relaxes the solids in such a manner as to give an occasion of accumulation to the serous fluids, disposes to the dropsy. A lazy indolent life, rainy wet weather, a swampy or low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and every thing which conduces to vitiate the viscera, or insensibly to produce obstructions in them, paves the way for a dropsy. Hence those are ready to fall into the disease who use hard and viscid aliments, such as poor people in some countries who use coarse brown bread, and children who are fed with unwholesome aliments; and the same thing happens to those who drink immoderately of spirituous liquors.\n\nPrognosis. When the dropsy arises from a scirrhus of the liver or spleen, or any of the other viscera, the prognosis must always be unfavourable, and also when it arises from disorders of the lungs. Neither is the case more favourable to those in whom the small vessels are ruptured, and pour out their liquids into the cavity of the abdomen. Those certainly die who have polypi in the vessels, or tumors compressing the veins and vessels of the abdomen. A dropsy arising from obstructions in the mesenteric glands is likewise difficult to cure, whether such obstructions arise from a bad habit of body, or from any other cause; if we can, however, by any means remove the disease of the glands, the dropsy soon ceases. But in those who fall into dropsy without any disease preceding, it is not quite so dangerous; and even though a disease has preceded, if the patient's strength be not greatly weakened, if the respiration be free, and the person be not affected with any particular pain, we may entertain great hopes of a cure. But where a great loss of blood is followed by a fever, and that by a dropsy, the patients almost always die, and that in a short time: those, however, are very frequently cured who fall into this disease without any preceding hemorrhage.\n\nCure. In the cure of this disease authors chiefly mention two indications: 1. To expel the effused water; and, 2. To prevent its being again collected. But before we proceed to speak of the remedies, it is necessary to take notice, that by the laws of the animal economy, if a great evacuation of a fluid takes place in any part of the body, all the other fluids in the body are directed towards that part, and those which lie, as it were, lurking in different parts will be immediately absorbed, and thrown out by the same passage. Hence the humours which in hydroptic per-\nsons are extravasated into the different cavities of the body will be thrown into the intestines, and evacuated by purgatives; or by diuretics will be thrown upon the kidneys, and evacuated by urine. It is, however, not only necessary to excite these evacuations in order to remove this malady, but they must be assiduously promoted and kept up till the abundant humour is totally expelled. For this reason Sydenham has advised purgatives to be administered every day, unless, either through the too great weakness of the body, or the violent operation of the purgative, it shall be necessary to interpose a day or two now and then; because if any considerable intervals be allowed to take place between the exhibition of the purgatives, an opportunity is given to the waters of collecting again. In this method, however, there is the following inconvenience, that, when the waters are totally evacuated, the strength is at the same time so much exhausted, that the distemper commonly returns in a very short time. Hence our chief hopes of curing a dropsy consist in gently evacuating the waters by means of diuretics. But the efficacy of these is generally very doubtful. Dr Freind has long ago observed, that this part of medicine is of all others the most lame and imperfect; but a French physician, Mr Bacher, lately discovered, as he alleges, a method of making the diuretics much more successful. His reputation became at last so great, that the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> thought proper to purchase his secret for a great sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>. The basis of his medicine was the black hellebore root, the malignant qualities of which he pretended to correct in the following manner: A quantity of the dried roots of black hellebore were pounded, and then put into a glazed earthen vessel, and afterwards sprinkled with spirit of wine. They were suffered to stand for twelve hours, stirring them about twice or thrice during that space of time. They were then sprinkled again, and at last good Rhenish wine was poured on till it stood six fingers above the roots. The mixture was frequently agitated with a wooden spatula; and as the wine was imbibed by the roots, more was poured on, so as to keep it always at the same height for 48 hours. The whole was then put on the fire and boiled for half an hour, after which the decoction was violently pressed out; the same quantity of wine was added as at first, and the mixture boiled as before. After the second expression the woody residuum was thrown away as useless. Both the strained liquors were then mixed together with two parts of boiling water to one of the decoction. The whole is afterwards evaporated in a silver vessel to the consistence of a syrup. One part of the extract is again mixed with two parts of boiling water, and the whole inspissated as before.\u2014By this means, says he, the volatile nauseous acid particles are separated by evaporation, and the fixed ones remain corrected and prepared for medicinal uses; adding, towards the end, a ninth part of old brandy, and evaporating to the consistence of turpentine. Mr Bacher reasons a good deal on the way in which this process corrects the medicine; but tells us, that notwithstanding the improvement, his pills will not have the desired effect unless properly made up. For forming them, they ought to be mixed with matters both of an invasivating and indurating nature; yet so prepared that it will be readily soluble in the stomach, even of a person much debilitated. For answering these purposes, he chose myrrh and carduus benedictus, and he gives the following receipt for the formation of his pills:\n\n\"Take of the extract of hellebore prepared as above directed, and of solution of myrrh, each one ounce; of powdered carduus benedictus, three drams and a scruple. Mix them together, and form into a mass, dividing it into pills of a grain and a half each.\" To these pills Mr Bacher gives the name of the pilulae tonicae, from an idea, that, while they evacuate the water, they at the same time act as tonics; and thus, from augmenting the action of the lymphatics, prevent the return of the disease. And if both these intentions could be effectually answered by the use of the same remedy, it would unquestionably be of great importance in practice.\n\nThe effects of these pills were, we are told, very surprising. Dr Daigman relates that he gave them to eighteen hydropic patients at once; and these he divided into three classes, according to the degree of the disease with which they were affected. The first class contained those who laboured under an anasarca following intermittent fevers. The second class contained those who had an anasarca, together with some degree of ascites, arising from tedious febrile disorders. All these were cured; but these two classes consisted of such cases as are most easily removed. But the third contained six who were seized with a most violent anasarca and ascites, after being much weakened by tedious disorders, and of consequence in whom the disease was very difficult to be cured. Even of these, however, four were cured, and the other two died. The body of one of these being dissected, both sides of the cavity of the thorax were found to be full of a blackish-red water. The lungs were unsound; there was a polypous concretion in the right ventricle of the heart; the liver and spleen were hard, and of a preternatural bulk; and the glands of the mesentery were obstructed and infarcted. In the other, the liver and pancreas were scirrhous, and the spleen very hard.\n\nThe same medicines were given by De Horne to eight persons, six of whom had both an anasarca and ascites, but the other two only an ascites. Four of these recovered; three died without being freed from the dropsy; one in whom the dropsy was cured died in a short time after, having for some time before his death become speechless.\n\nBy these patients ten of the pills were taken at once; and the same dose repeated to the third time, with an interval of an hour betwixt each dose. At first they proved purgative, and then diuretic: by which last evacuation they finally cured the disease. But though Mr Bacher was firmly of opinion that his pills cured the dropsy by reason of the above-related correction, yet it is certain that, in the hands of other practitioners, these very pills have failed, unless they also make use of the same regimen recommended by that physician; while, on the other hand, it is also certain, that different medicines will prove equally efficacious in dropsical cases, provided this regimen is made use of.\n\nFor a great number of ages it has been recommended to dropsical patients to abstain as much as possible from drink, and thus to the torments of their disease was added that of an intolerable thirst; and how great this torment was, we may understand from an example of a friend of King Antigonus, who, having\nbeen closely watched both by order of the physicians and also of the king, was so unable to bear the raging thirst occasioned by his disease, that he swallowed his own excrements and urine, and thus speedily put an end to his life. Dr Milman shows at great length the pernicious tendency of this practice. He maintains that it is quite contrary to the sentiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a> and the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> physicians. He asserts, that unless plenty of diluting drink be given, the best diuretics can have no effect. He condemns also in the strongest terms the practice of giving dropsical patients only dry, hard, and indigestible aliments. These would oppress the stomach even of the most healthy; and how much more must they do so to those who are already debilitated by labouring under a tedious disorder! By what means also are these aliments to be dissolved in the stomach when drink is withheld? In this disease the saliva is viscid, and in small quantity; from whence it may be reasonably conjectured, that the rest of the fluids are of the same nature, and the gastric juices likewise depraved. Thus the aliments lie long in the stomach; and if the viscera were formerly free of obstructions, they are now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a>; the strength fails; perspiration and other excretions are obstructed; the viscid and pituitous humours produced by these kinds of food float about the precordia, and increase the disease, while the surface of the body becomes quite dry. Nay, so much does this kind of diet conspire with the disease, that 100 pounds of fluid will sometimes be imbibed in a few days by hydropic persons who take no drink. Even in health, if the body from any cause becomes dry, or deprived of a considerable part of its juices, as by hunger, labour, &c. it will imbibe a considerable quantity of moisture from the air; so that we must impute the above-mentioned extraordinary inhalation, in part at least, to the denial of drink, and to the nature of the aliment given to the sick. The following is the account given by Sir Francis Milman of his practice in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a> hospital.\n\nIf the patient be not very much debilitated, he is sometimes treated with the purging waters, and a dose of jalap and calomel alternately. On the intermediate days he gets a saline mixture, with 40 or 60 drops of acetum scillitium every sixth hour; drinking with the purgatives oat-gruel and some thin broths. That he might the better ascertain what share the liquids given along with the medicines had in producing a copious flow of urine, he sometimes gave the medicines in the beginning of the distemper without allowing the drink; but though the swellings were usually diminished a little by the purgatives, the urine still continued scanty, and the patients were greatly weakened. Fearing, therefore, lest, by following this course, the strength of the sick might be too much reduced, he then began his course of diuretic medicines, giving large quantities of barley water with a little sal diureticus; by which means, sometimes in the short space of 48 hours after the course was begun, the urine flowed out in very large quantity: but as saline drinks are very disagreeable to the taste, a drink was composed purposely for hydropic persons, of half an ounce of supertartrite of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>, dissolved in two pounds of barley-water, made agreeably sweet with syrup, adding one or two ounces of French brandy.\n\nTo this composition Sir Francis Milman was induced by the great praises given to supertartrite of potash by some physicians in hydropic cases. In the Acta Bono-niensia, 15 cases of hydropic patients are related who were cured only by taking half an ounce of cream of tartar daily. But it is remarkable, that by these very patients the cream of tartar was taken for 20, 30, nay 40 days, often without any perceptible effect; yet when dissolved in a large quantity of water, it showed its salutary effects frequently within as many hours, by producing a plentiful flow of urine. This liquor is now the common drink of hydropic patients in the hospital above mentioned, of which they drink at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> along with their medicines.\n\nAmong purgative medicines Sir Francis Milman recommends the radix senecae; but says the decoction of it, according to the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia is too strong, as he always found it excite vomiting when prepared as there directed, and thus greatly to distress the patients: but when only half an ounce or six drams of the root are used to a pound of decoction, instead of a whole ounce as directed by the Edinburgh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, he finds it an excellent remedy; and though it may sometimes induce a little vomiting, and frequently a nausea, yet it seldom failed to procure nine or ten stools a day, and sometimes also proved diuretic. But we must take care not to be too free in the use of seneca, or any other purgative, if the patients be very weak; and therefore, after having used purgatives for some time, it will be proper to depend upon diuretics entirely for perfecting the cure; and of the success of this method our author gives some very remarkable instances. But he observes, that after the dropsy is removed, the patients will sometimes die without any evident cause; and of this it is proper that the physicians should be aware. It is remarkable with what ease a flux of urine is induced in those who have a scirrhus liver; while, on the other hand, in one who had the mesenteric glands obstructed, along with a scirrhosity of the liver and vitiated state of the lungs, the most powerful diuretics proved ineffectual. In some cases Sir Francis Milman thinks the kidneys may be so pressed with the weight of the water, as to be unable to perform their office. With regard, however, to diuretics in general, it may be remarked, that the operation of none of them can be certainly depended upon. In particular constitutions, and at particular times, one will be observed to succeed, after another, though commonly much more powerful, has been tried in vain. Accordingly various articles of this kind are often used in succession. Recourse is particularly often had to the root of taraxacum, of colchicum, and of squills; the latter, especially when combined with calomel, is often found to be a very powerful diuretic. And indeed mercury in different forms, probably from acting as a deobstruent, is often of very great use in dropsical complaints. Among other diuretics, the lactuca virosa has of late been highly extolled by Dr Collins of Vienna, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICOTIANA\">nicotiana</a> tabacum by Dr Fowler of York: but neither has been extensively introduced into practice, although we have known some instances in which the latter, in particular, has been used with great advantage.\n\nThe water having been drawn off, we are to put the patient on a course of strengtheners; such as cinehona, with some of the warm aromatics, and a due proportion of\nof rhubarb infused in wine and chalybeates. Gentle exercise, and frictions on the belly, with such a course of diet as shall be light and nourishing, are also to be enjoined; and it may be observed, that the use of tonic medicines is by no means to be delayed till a complete evacuation of the water can be obtained. On the contrary, by alternating, and even combining the use of evacuants and tonics, the influence of both is often very much promoted.","sp":433,"ep":465},{"h":"GREEK COINS","t":"| A. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARGOS\">Argos</a>, Aulus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">Asylum</a>; primi <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> first; as \u0395\u03c6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u0394. \u0394\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2; Ephesians, first people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>. |\n| A.

The remedies here in general are the same as in the dyspepsia and hypochondriasis; only in the chlorosis stronger purgatives may be made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of: those which stimulate the rectum are useful by stimulating\nSpasmi, lating also the vessels of the uterus; and for this reason <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> in venery has sometimes been said to produce a cure, particularly with love-sick maids. The cold bath is also extremely proper.\n\nOrder III. SPASMI.\n\nSpasmi, Sauv. Class IV. Vog. Class V. Sag. Class VIII.\nMotorii, Lin. Class VII.\nMorbi spasmodici et convulsivi, Hoffm.

In both, the vital actions are very imperfectly performed, most of those which are called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> being as it were suspended at once; and so far is the patient from being able to execute any voluntary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, that the whole machine undergoes the most excruciating distortions, from the violent and unnatural contractions of the muscles. Happy it is for the inhabitants of the more temperate climates, that such diseases appear rarely among them; but in those countries which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in the more southern and warmer latitudes, they are endemic, especially to negro slaves. In South Carolina, they show themselves at all seasons, but not so often in winter, more frequently in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> and autumn; and are most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, when people <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> abroad and are alternately exposed to the scorching heat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and heavy showers, which often happen suddenly, and greatly alter the temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. Others are seized with the opisthotonos after sleeping without doors, that they may enjoy the deceitful refreshment of the cool night-air, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> is warm: one youth chose to cut off his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> and shave his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> on a warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, and went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, but the weather changed, and became cold in the night, and he was found rigid with tetanus next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>.\n\nThese diseases so rarely appear as originals in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, that a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of them cannot be expected from the physicians who practise in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the world; nor has any thing like a full description been given of them by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> author which I have seen. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a> indeed takes notice of them in many places, and seems to regard them only as consequences of other diseases, or of wounds or ulcers of the nervous or tendinous parts; of which symptomatic kind of opisthotonos he gives three remarkable cases in lib. v. \u00a7 vii. de Morb. vulg. and repeats them in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>: but the few symptoms he recounts do not show themselves with us. Galen, Coelius Aurelianus, Aretaeus, &c. seem only to have copied Hippocrates, with the addition of some supposititious symptoms, which really do not appear; and the little that Bontius says of it is very faulty.\n\nAmong the numerous class of spasmodic diseases, there are three which distinguish themselves in a very particular manner, on which the names of emprosthotonos, opisthotonos, and tetanus, have been justly enough bestowed, as being expressive of the posture into which they throw and confine the patient. When therefore those muscles which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> the head, neck, and body forwards, suffer such involuntary, violent, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> contractions, as to fix the chin to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, incurvate the spine and body, and retain the sick in this painful and prone posture, the disease is called emprosthotonos. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> muscles are similarly affected, so that the head is drawn towards the spine, and the spine itself is recurved, it has then the name of opisthotonos; although in fact, in this, all those muscles which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in deglutition, bend the head forwards, or turn it to either side, are equally contracted with those which raise the head and spine. The tetanus differs from, or rather is compounded of, both the others; for in this the patient is found rigid and inflexible, being as it were braced between the opposite contractions of the anterior and posterior muscles; yet even here the head is much retracted.\n\nI never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the emprosthotonos; and shall only speak of the opisthotonos and tetanus, the first being by far the most common, and in the last stage of which the tetanus frequently intervenes. Let it be observed, that the following description by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means respects such symptomatic contractions as often happen immediately before death, both in acute and chronic diseases; neither will it agree with that spurious opisthotonos or tetanus which appear sometimes in the first and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> stages of quotidian intermittents in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, however they may emulate the true diseases in some of their symptoms.\n\nStad. I. The opisthotonos, contrary to what Bontius asserts, often comes on gradually and by slight approaches, the patient complaining rather of an uneasy stiffness in the back part of the neck and about the shoulders, than of any acute pain, with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of a general lassitude. These increase, and become so troublesome when he attempts to turn his head, or to bend it forward, as to oblige him to walk very erect; for he can by no means look downward, nor to either side, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> his whole body. He cannot open his jaws without pain; and has some difficulty in swallowing, which discourages him from attempting to eat. At times he feels a sudden and painful traction under the cartilago ensiformis, which strikes through to the back, and instantly increases the rigidity about the neck and shoulders, draws the head backward a little, and shuts the jaws closer. The pain under the sternum returns more frequently and with greater violence;\nand the other contractions become so strong, that the head from this time continues much retracted, and he now refuses nourishment, as swallowing is attended with great pain, and occasions a return of the spasm; which extends along the spine quite to the lower extremities, so that they will no longer support him, and he is under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of going to bed.\n\n\"In this manner passes over the first stage of the opisthotonus, which sometimes takes up three or four days; the patient, as well as those about him, mistaking the first appearances of it for that rheumatic complaint, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called a crick in the neck; but it sometimes forms itself much quicker, and invades the unfortunate person with the whole train of its mischievous symptoms in a few hours: in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the danger may truly be estimated from the violence of the first attack; for such generally die in 24, 36, or 48 hours, and very rarely survive the third day. But when it is less acute, few are lost after the ninth or eleventh: which number of days it would not be possible for them to complete, unless the violence of the disease was in a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> subdued; although I had one who recovered, after having been subject to its tyrannical attacks daily for six weeks. In this stage the pulse is slow, and very hard, and the belly is bound; blood taken away seems not to be altered from the natural state, so that no indication can be deduced therefrom, and it only varies with regard to laxity or compaction, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the person and season of the year.\n\n\"Stad. II. The spasm under the sternum (which is the pathognomonic symptom of this disease) becomes more violent, returning every 10 or 15 minutes; and never fails to be instantly succeeded by a stronger retraction of the head, with great rigidity and pain all round the neck, and along the spine to the lower extremities, which are suddenly put to the stretch. The countenance is very pale and contracted; the jaws are that moment snapped together, and cannot afterwards be opened so wide as to receive the end of one's little finger; an attempt to do which, by way of experiment, almost constantly hurries on the spasm. The mastoid, coraco-hyoid and sterno-hyoid muscles, as well as all the others concerned in deglutition, and the deltoid and pectorals, are most violently contracted, so that the shoulders are strongly raised forward, and the arms are stretched out or drawn across the body; but the wrists and fingers seem not to be affected.\n\n\"Such is the condition of the patient in the time of the spasm, which ceases in a few seconds: after which the shoulders and arms recline, and the inferior extremities relax; yet not so entirely, but that such a degree of rigidity for the most part remains as will not permit them to bend when this is attempted by another person; for as to the sick himself, he cannot at all move them. The muscles on the sides and forepart of the neck continue still contracted, although not so strongly; but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> is overcome by the number and strength of the posterior ones; so that the retraction of the head constantly remains. The patient breathes quick for some minutes, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he had been excessively exercised; and the pulse is small, fluttering, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, but both become more calm and slow. The face is sometimes pale in the intervals, but oftener flushed; and the whole countenance expresses strong appearances of the most melancholy distress, as well because of the dread he has of a return of the spasm, which he is sure will soon happen, as from the pain he suffers by the present contractions, and the more general and severe ones which he has so lately sustained. The tongue is stiff and torpid; but so far as it can be seen, is not foul. The belly is always bound, and cannot easily be loosened. In drinking, the liquid passes with great difficulty to the stomach, even in the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>; and if the spasm should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> him at that time, which an attempt to swallow for the most part occasions, the liquor returns through the nose with some force. The patients desire to lie still as much as possible; and avoid drinking, speaking, or being moved, either of which are apt to occasion a return of the spasm.\n\n\"Stad. III. In this last stage, the patient is reduced to the most calamitous and distressful circumstances: for he is on a continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a>, according to the most literal meaning of that word; the spasm returning oftener than once in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, is much more violent, and holds him longer, so that he has scarcely any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a>. The anterior muscles of the whole body now suffer equal contractions with the posterior; but the last overcome the force of the others, so that the spine is strongly recurvated, and forms a hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> with the bed, and he rests on the back part of the head and the heels. The belly is flat, and is drawn inward; and the muscles are so rigidly contracted, that they will not give way to pressure, and do not seem in the least to yield to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of the diaphragm in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>; the several muscles about the neck, sides, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>, being plainly distinguishable from each other. Although the lower extremities are always rigid in this state, yet are they so suddenly and violently distended in the time of the spasms, that were it not for the standers by, the patient would be projected feet foremost off the bed; while others again are as it were pushed upwards with such a spring, that the head is struck with great force against whatever happens to be in the way, the thighs and legs being in this case no less rigid than the other parts. The tongue is spasmodically darted out, and is often miserably torn, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> are that moment snapped together; so that it is necessary to prevent this by keeping the handle of a spoon, wrapped round with soft rags, between the teeth, when this can be done. At the time that the tongue is thus thrust out, the muscular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, which lies between the arch of the lower jaw and head of the trachea, seems to be drawn upwards within the throat. The countenance is very much contracted, and he is in a foam of sweat, the heat being very great; and the pulse between the spasms is exceedingly quick, small, and irregular, although the heart throbs so strongly, that its motions may be plainly seen, and a palpitating subsultory kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNDULATION\">undulation</a> may not only be felt, but perceived all over the epigastric region. The eyes are watery and languid, and a pale or bloody <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FROTH\">froth</a> bubbles out from between the lips. The jaws are for the most part locked fast, so that it is impossible to give drink or nourishment, nor could he swallow any thing that was put into his mouth. In this state patients are commonly delirious: and as they cannot subsist many hours under so great a suspension of the vital and natural functions, a mortal anxiety ensues and releases...\"\nreleases them; oftener a continued and severe spasm finishes the tragedy, when it was before almost at an end: but most frequently a general convulsion puts a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> to their sufferings; and whichever way this happens, they for the most part relax <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> before death.\n\n\"In the tetanus, the general symptoms are nearly the same as in the opisthotonus, except that from the first attack, the lateral, abdominal, and other anterior muscles, are equally contracted with the posterior ones; and the arms become rigid as well as the lower extremities. The abdomen is always flat and rigid as in the last stage of the opisthotonus, and its contents seem to be thrust up into the thorax, which at the same time appears to be much dilated. There are here also some intervals between the spasms, in the time of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> are drawn towards the ears, so that all the teeth may be seen as in the spasms cynicus. Deglutition is more free in this than in the other disease; yet so far is the sick from being equally balanced between the contractions of the opposite muscles, that the head is retracted and the spine is recurvated, although not quite so much as in the opisthotonus. And the spasm, which commences under the sternum, is likewise common to the tetanus, which terminates as the other, and on the same fatal days. But whoever recovers from either, labours <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> under a general atonia; and they cannot for some months raise themselves from a supine or recumbent posture without pain, nor without help for some time.\"\n\nPrognosis and Cure. There has never been any thing like a crisis observed in these frightful cases, or favourable termination from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> efforts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; and therefore all the physician's dependence must be upon art. As in cases of tetanic affections, the disease often arises from some particular irritation, the removal of this must necessarily be an important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in the cure: But where it cannot be removed, benefit may often be obtained by the prevention of its influence being communicated to the brain. When, however, that influence is communicated to the brain, a cure is to be expected only by diminishing and obviating it. This is principally brought about by the use either of those means which have a general tendency to diminish action, or of those which induce a different state of action. On these grounds the operation of those remedies which are employed with greatest success in this affection, may, we apprehend, be explained. Fortunately it has been found, that opium is capable of giving some relief, if administered in proper time, and if the disease happens not to be in the most violent degree: the warm bath must also be brought in aid; and the patients should lie horizontally in the bath, and while in it have the whole body extremely well rubbed: when taken out, they are not to be dried, but immediately be put to bed wrapt in the softest blankets; and while they remain there, the belly ought either to be stuped, or two or three bladders filled with warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> kept constantly lying on it. The bowels at the same time must, if possible, be kept open, by solutions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">manna</a> and sal polychores, or some other purging salt, mixed with oleum ricini; or if that should not be at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of sweet almonds and a little tincture of senna. The opiates are to be given in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and frequently repeated doses; such as a grain of the extractum thebaicum, or 20 drops of the tincture, every second or third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>; and it will be safest not to trust to the thebaic tincture which is kept ready prepared in the shops, but to order the necessary dose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> opium, and either give it in pills or dissolve it in some convenient liquid. If swallowing should be difficult, or the jaws closed up, the opium must be given in clysters; for during the whole course of the disease it will be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to order emollient clysters to be injected from time to time, since these will answer not only as a relaxing fomentation, but also contribute to keep the intestinal canal perfectly free.\n\nWhen the patients recover, they continue for a long time very relaxed and weak; and no wonder, since it is the nature of all spasmodic affections to leave behind them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> weakness and relaxation of the muscular fibres. In order to perfect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>, a course of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a> and the Peruvian balsam is to be tried; and the spine may be rubbed with spirituous liniments, or with a mixture of rum and Barbadoes tar: but those and all other stimulating things, either internally or externally, during the violence of the spasms, must, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of some practitioners, be omitted, since all of them as well as blisters have been alleged to exasperate the disease.\n\nThis, in general, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of treatment recommended by Dr Chalmers.\n\nThe same dreadful disorders frequently attack young children in the warm climates. Dr Hillary tells us, that they will there arise from the same causes which usually produce convulsions with children in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, viz. from a retention of the meconium or first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCREMENT\">excrement</a> after birth; or from a glutinous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which is too often found in the intestines of young children soon after the other is discharged; or from a cheesy matter from the coagulation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> by an acid in the stomach; or from hard excrements; or from something taken in by the mouth which is over acrid, or too hard to digest, which irritates their tender bowels, and so produces startings and convulsive spasms, with all the other symptoms which precede and accompany convulsions in young children in Britain. And this shows how much more readily and easily the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> are affected and irritated in that warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, and the tetanus produced from a much less cause there, than it is in Britain, where it is but seldom seen. But these causes not being timely removed, their acrimony is increased, partly by the heat of the climate, and partly by the fever which they produce, which still renders them more acrid, and so increases the irritation of their bowels, that it first brings on startings, then convulsive spasms, and regular convulsion fits; which, if not soon removed, usually end in a perfect tetanus, and the disease is but seldom cured in such young children when it arrives at that state: for when the child lies in this miserable, rigid, immovable condition, upon moving its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> or feet in the most gentle manner, or softly touching any part of its body, or giving it the least motion, even feeling its pulse in the most tender manner, or the least noise, or even touching its clothes, will bring on the convulsive spasms, and cause it to be strongly convulsed backwards or drawn into a rigid straight line, strongly extended and immovable like a statue, and will so remain immovable out of either of those postures for a considerable time, a minute or two; and when the disease is arrived at this degree, Dr Hillary thinks...\nthinks it is never cured. But if the physician be called in time, before the tetanus has come on (which is too seldom the case there), though he finds strong convulsive spasms have seized the child, or that it has had a convulsive fit or two, it may most commonly be relieved, the coming of the tetanus be prevented, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of the babe saved, as Dr Hillary has more than once seen, by removing and carrying off the irritating cause which stimulates their tender bowels, by such gentle evacuations as are suitable to their age; and then quieting and composing the irritation of their nerves by proper anodynes, and correcting the remaining acrimony of the nutritious juices in the prima via.\n\nTo answer these intentions, the following method, with variations pro re nota et pro ratione statis, as the cause is different, has been found to answer the desired effect best: R. Seri lactis 3ij. Sapon. Venet. 3j. Mannee Calab. 3ij. vel iii. Ol. amygd. dul. 3ss. Ol. ficinuli dul. gut. ij. Bals. Peruvi gut. v. Misc. Fi enema quam primum injicendum.\n\nAnd if the symptoms of the approaching tetanus will permit, he gives something of the following nature to assist the operation of the clyster, and to carry off the acrimony the sooner: R. Ag. sem. ficinuli 3ij. Magnes. albae 3ss. Ocul. cancer. prop. 3j. Syr. e cicchor. cum rheo. Rosar. solut. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANA\">ana</a> 3ij. Misc. Or, R. Ag. sem. ficinuli 3ij. Sapon. amygdal. 3ss. Magnes. albae 3ss. Syr. e cicchor. cum rheo. Mannee opt. ana 3ij. Ol. amygd. dul. 3ij. Misc.: Exhibe cochl. parv. vel duo pro ratione statis, omni semihora, vel omni hora, donec respond. alvus.\n\nTwo or three stools being obtained by these, the following is exhibited in order to abate the convulsive twitchings, and prevent the tetanus from coming on: R. Ag. sem. ficinuli 3ij. Magnes. albae 3ss. Ocul. cancer. prop. 3j. Moschi orient. gr. iiij. Spir. C. C. gut. xv. Syr. e mecon. 3ss. Misc.: Exhibe cochl. parv. (a child's spoonful) ter quatuor de die, vel septem, urgent. convuls. vel spasm.\n\nBut if the symptoms show that the tetanus is more immediately coming on, so that we have no time to wait till the operation of the clyster and opening laxative be over, something of the following nature must be immediately given; or the tetanus will come on, and most probably prove fatal to such tender babes. R. Ag. ficinuli. 3ij. Moschi orient. gr. j. Tinct. thebaica gut. iiij. Syr. e mecon. 5ij. Misc. pro duobus dos. de quibus exhibe unam quam primum, et alteram si convul. spasmi. reducent.\n\nThis, Dr Hillary observes, may be thought a bold attempt, to give tinct. thebaica to such a tender young infant: but it is to be considered that the little patient will certainly die if the tetanus seize it, and that it will come on if this do not prevent it: and he has known a bold ignorant old midwife give four or five drops of that tincture to a very young infant without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> more than its dosing three or four hours, though not in this case, but in one much less violent.\n\nThe clyster may be given at the same time, and the opening laxative not long after it; though it may retard the operation of that for some time, yet it operates soon after, and gives relief; after which the other medicines, and fomenting the body and anointing it as before, may be used, if the physician finds it necessary; also a little of the laxative mixture may be given once or twice a-day, if the above julep does not answer the intention of keeping the child's body open for a few days afterwards, which in this case is generally found necessary to be observed.\n\nThese methods and medicines may be varied according to circumstances. For neither the same method nor the same medicines will answer in all cases, though the disease be the same; but they must be changed as the causes differ, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the sick, or the time of the disease, or as some other circumstances may require: which is a thing of great importance, not only in this, but in the cure of most other diseases.\n\nWhen proper medicines are thus timely and judiciously given in this case, they seldom fail to carry off the irritating cause, quiet and ease the nerves, remove the convulsions and spasms: and consequently prevent the tetanus from coming on, and the death of the patient. But if calling in the physician be deferred till the tetanus has already strongly seized the child, as is too often the case here, neither warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>, fomenting, nor any other methods or medicines whatever, will remove it or its causes, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the life of the little tender patient.\n\nDr Chalmers gives an account of his having cured one child seized with a tetanus, by purging with an infusion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a>: to which a few grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSK\">musk</a>, and a little ol. tartar., per deliq. were added, together with the warm bath, and the frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJECTION\">injection</a> of clysters made with an infusion of chamomile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, to each of which was added a small portion of Castile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>. It is much to be regretted, however, that in those cases where the assistance of the medical art is most wanted, it most generally fails. We have been assured by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who practised for some time in the warm parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, that out of 30 cases of the tetanus he had seen, not one of the patients recovered, though he had given opium to the quantity of 20 grains thrice a-day; and others, he was assured, had taken 30 grains thrice a-day. In the beginning of the disease, the medicine produced a violent headache; but towards the end, it had no manner of effect whatever. In two patients, the disease came on from the slightest causes imaginable. The one accidentally fell in attempting to avoid a loaded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a>, and put the heel of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOE\">shoe</a> upon one of his thumbs in rising; the other, in avoiding the same cart, slightly ruffled the skin of his nose. Both were seized with the tetanus; and both died, notwithstanding all possible assistance was given. The former had his thumb amputated without effect.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Physical and Literary Essays vol. iii. Dr Donald Monro describes a new method of cure, communicated to him by a gentleman who was formerly a practitioner in Jamaica. While this gentleman practised in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, he had under his care a great number of cases of tetanus attended with the locked jaw. At first, he used to give very freely of opium, musk, and other medicines of this class; to bleed, and make other evacuations; while he used <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>, fomentations, embrocations, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> applications, but all without the least success; and, as he had lost a great many patients without being so lucky as to make one cure, he began to believe that this disorder always proved fatal, and was not to be cured by medicine, notwithstanding what some practitioners\nSpasmi. titioners had alleged. However, having received an unexpected hint concerning the good effects of the mercurial ointment in such cases, he resolved to try it; and ordered the first patient that offered to be put into a warm room, and to be rubbed two or three times a day with the ointment, till such time as a salivation was raised; when he with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> observed, that, as soon as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> began to affect the mouth, the convulsions of the muscles of the jaws, as well as all the other spasms and convulsions, ceased, and the patient was freed of all his complaints. After this, he treated every case of this kind, which came under his care in the same manner, and cured twelve, which were all who applied to him for advice so early in the disorder that there was time to bring the mercury to the mouth before the fatal period was expected. A few died, in whom the disease was so far advanced before he saw them that there was no time to raise a salivation. None of the cases which were under this gentleman's care in the West Indies were the consequences of wounds or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> operations; nor has he had any opportunity of trying it since in cases of the locked jaw, which sometimes follows capital operations, owing to his having given over practice: but he thinks, that from the similarity of the complaint, there is no doubt that the mercurial frictions would be equally efficacious in such cases, as when the disorder comes from catching cold or other such causes.\n\nIn the second volume of the Medical Transactions, we have an account of a cure performed by Dr William Carter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>, by means very different from any of those above related.\u2014On the 17th of May 1767, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> was called to a strong healthy man, in the 21st year of his age, and who had been confined to his bed for three weeks. What gave rise to his present disorder was an wound on the inner ankle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> leg, which he had received six weeks before from a joiner's chisel. At that time his mouth was so far closed, as to admit only the most liquid nourishment, which he constantly sucked through his teeth: but his legs and jaw, and the whole length of the spina dorsi, were quite immoveable, being as stiff and rigid as those of a person long dead; his head was drawn backward, and he was frequently strongly convulsed. The motion indeed of both his arms was but little impaired. From the beginning to the end, his sight, hearing, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, continued perfect; his appetite was good; and his senses, in the daytime, entire, though sometimes wandering in the night. As to his pulse, it was regular; if it deviated at all from the pulse of a person in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, it was rather slow than quick, and somewhat fuller than natural. Such was the situation of the patient; a detail of which had been given before the doctor set out on his journey, which he undertook with a determined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to make use of the method recommended by Dr Silvester, in the first volume of Medical Observations and Inquiries, published in the year 1757; (and which has been related from Dr Chalmers and Dr Hillary.) But, on his arrival at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, he found great quantities of the extractum thebaicum dissolved had been already given him; and that, for the five last days, he had taken no less than 28 grains of that medicine, with 50 grains of musk, in the space of 24 hours, without any sensible effect, except the bringing Tetanus on a confused <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, out of which he frequently awoke in great hurries, attended with a violent pain in the head, which almost deprived him of his senses. The doctor was afraid to extend the dose; and soon determined to take some other method, though at a loss what method to pursue, as, during a course of almost 30 years practice, nothing of the same kind had ever fallen under his cognizance before. Reflecting, however, that this disorder had always been deemed of the spasmodic kind, and that the good effects produced by the extractum thebaicum must probably be owing to the relaxing and resolving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of that medicine, he directed a blister to be applied between the shoulders, the whole length of the spine; the jaw to be anointed with the oleum latertium; and a purge consisting of the tinctura sacra, tinctura jalape, and the syrupus de rhanno cathartico, to be given him. This was repeated three several times afterwards, at the distance of three or four days between each dose. On the intermediate days, he was ordered the oleum succinii, the fetid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, and the oleum amygdalimum. Of the first he took 30 drops, of the gum 20 grains, and of the last four ounces, in 24 hours. By these means, and these only, the convulsions soon ceased; and he grew daily better and better, till at the end of a fortnight he was able to walk about his room, and in less than three weeks became in all respects well, some small weakness in the parts only excepted. The jaw was relieved first, after that the spine, and last of all the legs. A pain and uneasiness in the places affected, neither of which he had felt before, were the forerunners of his approaching amendment.\n\nFrom all this it seems reasonable to conclude, either that there is no certain remedy for tetanus in all cases, or that the medicines which prove effectual in one constitution will fail in another. Thus, it is possible, that in cases where opium proves ineffectual, mercury may be a remedy; and, on the contrary, where mercury fails, opium may be effectual; and even where both are ineffectual, the antispasmodics recommended by Dr Carter may be of use. It is therefore necessary for physicians to be extremely careful to observe the effects of the first doses of their remedies: for if the symptoms show not the least appearance of remission after a large dose of opium, it is improbable that it can be cured by a repetition of the medicine; and as no time can be lost with safety, it will then be proper to apply mercurial ointment, or whatever else may be judged proper.\u2014In the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries we have an account of the cold bath being used as a remedy, by Dr Thomas Cochrane, at that time physician at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEVIS\">Nevis</a>. The patient was an East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> boy, who had been gored by a cow, and afterwards exposed to a rainy damp air for some hours. Dr Cochrane ascribes his cure to the cold bath, which was applied by dashing the water upon his body. But as the patient at the same time got laudanum, at first in the quantity of 200 drops a-day, and afterwards in still larger doses; and had besides his throat and shoulders anointed with warm oil of turpentine, was bled, and had lenient elysters and laxatives; it is by no means easy to say what share the cold bath had in his cure. Dr Cochrane, however, says he has heard of some cases being treated successfully by cold water and cinchona.\ncinehona in St Eustatia and St Kitt's, and in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> mentions his having used the cold bath in other cases of tetanus with success. But since Dr Coehrane's publication, a more full and satisfactory account of the benefit of this practice has been communicated in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> published by Dr Wright, in the sixth volume of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> Medical Observations. Dr Wright gives a particular account of six cases, in which the best effects were obtained from dashing cold water upon the patient; and he observes, that since he first used this method of cure he never failed in one instance to effect a recovery, and that in a shorter time than by any other method hitherto proposed. This practice has on some occasions been adopted by practitioners in Britain, although here the disease is a much less frequent occurrence. It has particularly been employed with success by Dr Currie of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>; and we hope that still more extensive practice will confirm the benefit to be derived from it, although not in every instance, yet in many cases of this affection. We are, however, sorry to say that we have of late heard of several cases in which it has been tried in Britain, and which, notwithstanding the use of it, had a fatal termination.\n\nVery lately a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of cure in this affection has been recommended by Dr Rush, professor of medicine in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>, in a paper entitled Observations on the Cause and Cure of Tetanus, published in the second volume of the Transactions of the American Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>. Dr Rush, viewing tetanus as being a disease occasioned by relaxation, thinks the medicines indicated to cure it are such only as are calculated to remove this relaxation, and to restore tone to the system. On this ground he recommends the liberal use of wine and cinchona; and tells us, that he has employed them with success in actual practice. When the disease arises from an wound of any particular place, he recommends stimulants to the part affected; such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> of the wound, and filling it with the oil of turpentine. How far this practice will be confirmed by more extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, we cannot take upon us to determine. We may only observe, that a very contrary practice has been recommended as highly successful by some practitioners in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, where tetanic affections are a very frequent occurrence in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of slight accidents. There gentle emollients are strongly recommended, particularly immersing the wounded part in tepid oil for the space of an hour or so at a time, and repeating this application at short intervals. By this mode many cases, after very alarming appearances had taken place, are said to have been completely and speedily removed. While the practice is very simple, it appears at the same time in many respects very rational, and may perhaps be considered as well deserving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> in the first instance.\n\nAmong other remedies employed in tetanus it has been said that the spasms have sometimes been allayed by a strong electric shock. And in obstinate cases <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALVANISM\">galvanism</a> certainly well deserve a trial.\n\n**GENUS XLIX.

These partial convulsions may attack almost any part of the body; and are not unfrequently symptomatic, in fevers, the cholera morbus, &c. The involuntary startings of the tendons, the picking of the bedclothes, &c. in acute diseases are all of them convulsive disorders. Convulsions, even when most generally extended, differ from epilepsy in not being attended with any mental affection or abolition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, and not followed by the same torpid state.\n\n**Causes.** Convulsions, not only of particular parts, but also over the whole body, often take place from causes not very evident. Sometimes they seem to de-\npend on a certain delicacy or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> of the nervous system, which is framed with such exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> as to be strongly affected by the slightest causes. Delicate women are often subject to hysterical convulsions, and also hypochondriac people. Convulsions, however, often take their rise from wounds, irritations of the stomach and intestines by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, poisons, violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a> and emetics, &c.; and very often they are symptomatic, as in dentition, the smallpox, and many kinds of fevers.\n\nPrognosis. Except in some few cases, convulsive disorders are always to be dreaded; but less in young people than in such as are advanced in life. Those which attack girls under the age of puberty, will generally cease on the appearance of the menses; and boys have likewise a chance of being relieved as they advance in life: but in grown-up people, unless the cause be very evident, a cure is hardly to be expected, especially after the disease has been of long continuance.\n\nCure. The treatment is very much the same with that of epilepsy, afterwards to be considered: but a recovery is most frequently obtained by the removal of the existing cause.\n\nGENUS LI.

He considers not only the hypochondriasis hysterica, phthisica, and asthmatica, but also the biliosa, sanguinea, and pituitosa, as being only symptomatic; but he views the true melancholic hypochondriasis as being a proper idiopathic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, perfectly distinct from hysteria, with which it has often been confounded.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a>. The symptoms of hypochondriasis are, stretching, pressing, gripping, and tormenting pains under the ribs, and chiefly in the left side; which sometimes are exasperated, and become pungent, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> lancinating.

The general causes of the hypochondriae affection are said to be a plethora, and preternatural thickness of the blood; suppressions of customary evacuations; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and full diet, together with a sparing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of drink; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> disposition; indolence; atony of the intestines; violent passions of the mind, &c.\n\nPrognosis.

In illustrating the application of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the epicycloid, which was discovered by Olaus Roemer the celebrated Danish astronomer, we shall call the small wheel the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a>, and its teeth the leaves of the pinion. The line which joins the centre of the wheel and pinion is called the line of centres. There are three different ways in which the teeth of one wheel may drive another, and each of these modes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> requires a different form for the teeth.\n\n1.

The first of these modes of action is represented in fig. 1, where B is the centre of the wheel (P), A that of the pinion, and AB the line of centres. It is evident from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, that the part b of the tooth ab of the wheel, does not act on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> m of the pinion till they arrive at the line of centres AB; and that all the action is carried on after they have passed this line, and is completed when the leaf m comes into the situation n.

But when one circle rolls within another whose diameter is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> that of the rolling circle, the line generated by any point of the latter is a straight line, tending to the centre of the larger circle. Therefore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the generating circle above mentioned should be taken with its diameter equal to the radius of the pinion, and be made to roll upon the concave superficies \\(a d h\\) of the pinion, it will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> a straight line tending to the pinion's centre, which will be the form of the faces of its leaves; and the teeth of the wheel will be exterior epicycloids, formed by a generating circle, whose diameter is equal to the radius of the pinion, rolling upon the convex superficies \\(o d p\\) of the wheel. This rectilineal form of the teeth is exhibited in fig. 2, and is perhaps the most advantageous, as it requires less trouble, and may be executed with greater accuracy, than if the epicycloidal form had been employed, though the teeth are evidently weaker than those in fig. 1; it is recommended both by De la Hire and Camus as particularly advantageous in clock and watch-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>.\n\nFig. 1.\n\n399. The attentive reader will perceive from fig. 1, that in order to prevent the teeth of the wheel from acting upon the leaves of the pinion before they reach the line of centres \\(A B\\); and that one tooth of the wheel may not quit the leaf of the pinion till the succeeding tooth begins to act upon the succeeding leaf, there must be a certain proportion between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of leaves in the pinion and the number of teeth in the wheel, or between the radius of the pinion and the radius of the wheel, when the distance of the leaves \\(A B\\) is given. But in machinery the number of leaves and teeth is always known from the velocity which is required at the working point of the machine: It becomes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> therefore of great importance to determine with accuracy the relative radii of the wheel and pinion.\n\nRelative size of the wheel and pinion.\n\n400. For this purpose, let \\(A\\), fig. 2, be the pinion having the acting faces of its leaves straight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> tending to the centre, and \\(B\\) the centre of the wheel. \\(A B\\) will be the distance of their centres. Then as the tooth \\(C\\) is supposed not to act upon the leaf \\(A m\\) till it arrives at the line \\(A B\\), it ought not to quit \\(A m\\) till the following tooth \\(F\\) has reached the line \\(A B\\). But since the tooth always acts in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of a line drawn perpendicular to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the leaf \\(A m\\) from the point of contact, the line \\(C H\\), drawn at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to the face of the leaf \\(A m\\), will determine the extremity of the tooth \\(C D\\), or the last part of it which should act upon the leaf \\(A m\\), and will also mark out \\(C D\\) for the depth of the tooth. Now, in order to find \\(A H\\), \\(H B\\), and \\(C D\\), put \\(a\\) for the number of teeth in the wheel, \\(b\\) for the number of leaves in the pinion, \\(c\\) for the distance of the pivots \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and let \\(x\\) be the radius of the wheel, and \\(y\\) that of the pinion. Then, since the circumference of the wheel is to the circumference of the pinion, as the number of teeth in the one to the number of leaves in the other, and as the circumferences of circles are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to their radii, we shall have \\(a : b = x : y\\), then by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> (Eucl. v. 18.) \\(a + b : b = c : y\\) (\\(c\\) being equal to \\(x + y\\)), and consequently the radius of the pinion, viz. \\(y = \\frac{c}{a + b}\\); then by inverting the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>, we have \\(b : a = y : x\\), and consequently the radius of the wheel, viz. \\(x = \\frac{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AY\">ay</a>}{b}\\); \\(y\\) being now a known number.\n\nNow, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> \\(A H C\\), right-angled at \\(C\\), the side \\(A H\\) is known, and likewise all the angles (\\(H A C\\) being equal to \\(\\frac{360^\\circ}{b}\\)); the side \\(A C\\), therefore, may be found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a>. Then, in the triangle \\(A C B\\), the \\(\\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> CAB\\), equal to \\(H A C\\), is known, and also the sides \\(A B\\), \\(A C\\), which contain it; the third side, therefore, viz. \\(C B\\), may be determined; from which \\(D B\\), equal to \\(H B\\), already found, being subtracted, there will remain \\(C D\\) for the depth of the teeth. When the action is carried on after the line of centres, it often happens that the teeth will not work in the hollows of the leaves. In order to prevent this, the \\(\\angle CBH\\) must always be greater than half the \\(\\angle H B P\\). The \\(\\angle H B P\\) is equal to \\(360^\\circ\\) degrees, divided by the number of teeth in the wheel, and \\(CBH\\) is easily found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> trigonometry.\n\n401. If the teeth of wheels and the leaves of pinions be formed according to the directions already given, they will act upon each other, not only with uniform force, but nearly without friction. The one tooth rolls upon the other, and neither slides nor rubs to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> as to retard the wheels, or wear their teeth. But as it is impossible in practice to give that perfect curvature to the faces of the teeth which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> requires, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of friction will remain after every precaution has been taken in the formation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> parts.\n\n402. 2. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> mode of action is not so advantageous as that which we have been considering, and should, if possible, always be avoided. It is represented in fig. 3, where \\(A\\) is the centre of the pinion, \\(B\\) that of the wheel, and \\(A B\\) the line of centres. It is evident from the figure, that the tooth \\(C\\) of the wheel acts upon the leaf \\(D\\) of the pinion before they arrive at the line \\(B A\\); that it quits the leaf when they reach this line, and have assumed the position of \\(E\\) and \\(F\\); and that the tooth \\(C\\) works deeper and deeper between the leaves of the pinion, the nearer it comes to the line of centres. From this last circumstance a considerable quantity of friction arises, because the tooth \\(C\\) does not, as before, roll upon the leaf \\(D\\), but slides upon it; and from the same cause the pinion soon becomes foul, as the dust which lies upon the acting faces of the leaves is pushed into the interjacent hollows. One advantage, however, attends this mode of action: It allows us to make the teeth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> wheel rectilineal, and thus renders the labour of the mechanic less, and the accuracy of his work greater, than if they had been of a curvilineal form. If the teeth \\(C, E\\), therefore of the wheel \\(B C\\) are made rectilineal, having their surfaces directed to the wheel's centre, the acting faces of the leaves \\(D, F, &c.\\) must be epicycloids formed by a generating circle, whose diameter is equal to the radius \\(B o\\) of the circle \\(o p\\), rolling upon the circumference \\(m n\\) of the pinion \\(A\\). But if the teeth of the wheel and the leaves of the pinion are made curvilineal as in the figure, the faces of the teeth of the wheel must be portions of an interior epicycloid formed by any gene-\nNow, in the triangle \u0394PB, AB is known, and also practical PB, which is the cosine of the angle ABD, PC being perpendicular to DB; AP or the radius of the pinion therefore may be found by plane trigonometry. The reader will observe that the point P marks out the parts of the tooth D and the leaf SP where they commence their action; and the point I marks out the parts where their mutual action ceases (E); AP therefore is the proper radius of the pinion, and BI the proper radius of the wheel, the parts of the tooth L without the point I, and of the leaf SP without the point P, being superfluous. Now, to find BI, we have ES : CS = m : n, and CS = \\(\\frac{ES \\times n}{m}\\); but ES was shewn to be \\(= \\frac{360}{b}\\), therefore, by substitution, CS = \\(\\frac{360 \\times n}{b \\times m}\\). Now the arch ES, or \u2220EAS, being equal to \\(\\frac{360}{b}\\), and CS, or \u2220CAS, being equal to \\(\\frac{360 \\times n}{b \\times m}\\), their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> EC, or the angle EAC, will be equal to \\(\\frac{360}{b} - \\frac{360 \\times n}{b \\times m}\\), or \\(\\frac{360 \\times m - n}{b \\times m}\\). The \u2220EAC being thus found, the triangle EAB, or IAB, which is almost equal to it, is known, because AB is given, and likewise AI, which is equal to the cosine of the angle IAB, AC being radius, and AIC being a right angle, consequently IB the radius of the wheel may be found by trigonometry. It was formerly shewn that AC, the radius of what is called the primitive pinion, was equal to \\(\\frac{c \\times b}{a + b}\\), and that BC the radius of the primitive wheel was equal to \\(\\frac{AC \\times a}{b}\\). If then we subtract AC or AS from AP, we shall have the quantity SP which must be added to the radius of the primitive pinion, and if we take the difference of BC (or BL) and DE, the quantity LE will be found, which must be added to the radius of the primitive wheel. We have all along supposed that the wheel drives the pinion, and have given the proper form of the teeth upon this supposition. But when the pinion drives the wheel, the form which was given to the teeth of the wheel in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, must in this be given to the leaves of the pinion; and the shape which was formerly given to the leaves of the pinion must now be transferred to the teeth of the wheel.\n\n495. Another form for the teeth of wheels, different from any which we have mentioned, has been recommended by Dr Robison. He shews that a perfect uniformity of action may be secured, by making the acting faces of the teeth involutes of the wheel's circumference, which are nothing more than epicycloids, the centres of whose generating circles are infinitely distant. Thus, in fig. 1, let AB be a portion of the wheel on which\n\n(E) The letter L marks the intersection of the line BL with the arch e m, and the letter E the intersection of the arch b O with the upper surface of the leaf m. The letters D and S correspond with L and E respectively, and P with I.\nMechanics\n\nwhich the tooth is to be fixed, and let \\( A p a \\) be a thread lapped round its circumference, having a loop hole at its extremity \\( a \\). In this loop hole fix the pin \\( a \\), and with it describe the curve or involute \\( a b c d e h \\), by unlapping the thread gradually from the circumference \\( A p m \\). This curve will be the proper shape for the teeth of a wheel whose diameter is \\( AB \\). Dr Robison observes, that as this form admits of several teeth to be acting at the same time (twice the number that can be admitted in M. de la Hire's method), the pressure is divided among several teeth, and the quantity upon any one of them is so diminished, that those dents and impressions which they unavoidably make upon each other are partly prevented. He candidly allows, however, that the teeth thus formed are not completely free from sliding and friction, though this slide is only \\( \\frac{1}{60} \\)th of an inch, when a tooth three inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> fixed on a wheel ten feet in diameter drives another wheel whose diameter is two feet. Append. to Ferguson's Lectures.\n\n406. On the Formation of Exterior and Interior Epicycloids, and on the Disposition of the Teeth on the Wheel's Circumference.\n\nNothing can be of greater importance to the practical mechanic, than to have a method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> epicycloids with facility and accuracy; the following, we trust, is the most simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> method that can be employed.\u2014Take a piece of plain wood \\( GH \\), fig. 6, and fix upon it another piece of wood \\( E \\), having its circumference \\( m b \\) of the same curvature as the circular base upon which the generating circle \\( AB \\) is to roll. When the generating circle is large, the segment \\( B \\) will be sufficient: in any part of the circumference of this segment, fix a sharp pointed nail \\( a \\), sloping in such a manner that the distance of its point from the centre of the circle may be exactly equal to its radius; and fasten to the board \\( GH \\) a piece of thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, or tinplate, \\( a b \\), distinguished by the dotted lines. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">Place</a> the segment \\( B \\) in such a position that the point of the nail \\( a \\) may be upon the point \\( b \\), and roll the segment towards \\( G \\), so that the nail \\( a \\) may rise gradually, and the point of contact between the two circular segments may advance towards \\( m \\); the curve \\( a b \\) described upon the brass plate will be an accurate exterior epicycloid. In order to prevent the segments from sliding, their peripheries should be rubbed with resin or chalk, or a number of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> may be fixed on the circumference of the generating segment. Remove, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILE\">file</a>, the part of the brass on the left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of the epicycloid, and the remaining concave arch or gage \\( a b \\) will be a pattern tooth, by means of which all the rest may be easily formed. When an interior epicycloid is wanted, the concave side of its circular base must be used. The method of describing it is represented in fig. 7, where \\( CD \\) is the generating circle, \\( F \\) the concave circular base, \\( MN \\) the piece of wood on which this base is fixed, and \\( c d \\) the interior epicycloid formed upon the plate of brass, by rolling the generating circle \\( C \\), or the generating segment \\( D \\), towards the right hand. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYCLOID\">cycloid</a>, which is useful in forming the teeth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a>-work, is generated precisely in the same manner, with this difference only, that the base on which the generating circle rolls must be a straight line.\n\nIn order that the teeth may not embarrass one another before their action commences, and that one tooth may begin to act upon its corresponding leaf of the pinion, before the preceding tooth has ceased to act upon the preceding leaf, the height, breadth, and distance of the teeth must be properly proportioned. For this purpose the pitch-line or circumference of the wheel, which is represented in fig. 2. and 3. by the dotted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, must be divided into as many equal spaces as the number of teeth which the wheel is to carry. Divide each of these spaces into 16 equal parts; allow 7 of these for the greatest breadth of the teeth, and 9 for the distance between each; or the distance of the teeth may be made equal to their breadth. If the wheel drive a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNDLE\">trundle</a>, each space should be divided into 7 equal parts, and 3 of these allotted for the thickness of the tooth, and 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) for the diameter of the cylindrical stave of the trundle. If each of the spaces already mentioned, or if the distance between the centres of each tooth, be divided into three equal parts, the height of the teeth must be equal to two of these. These distances and heights, however, vary according to the mode of action which is employed. The teeth should be rounded off at the extremities, and the radius of the wheel made a little larger than that which is deduced from the rules in Art. 400, 404. But when the pinion drives the wheel, a small addition should be made to the radius of the pinion.\n\nOn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> of Bevelled Wheels, and the method of giving an epicycloidal form to their Teeth.\n\n407. The principle of bevelled wheels was pointed out by De la Hire, so long ago as the end of the 17th century. It consists in one fluted or toothed cone acting upon another, as is represented in fig. 8, where the cone \\( O \\) drives the cone \\( OC \\), conveying its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> in the direction \\( OC \\). If these cones be cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to their bases as at \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), and if the two small cones between \\( AB \\) and \\( O \\) be removed, the remaining parts \\( AC \\) and \\( BD \\) may be considered as two bevelled wheels, and \\( BD \\) will act upon \\( AC \\) in the very same manner, and with the same effect, that the whole cone \\( OD \\) acted upon the whole cone \\( OC \\). If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> be made nearer the bases of the cones, the same effect will be produced: this is the case in fig. 9, where \\( CD \\) and \\( DE \\) are but very small portions of the imaginary cones \\( ACD \\) and \\( ADE \\).\n\n408. In order to convey motion in any given direction, and determine the relative size and situation of the wheels for this purpose, let \\( AB \\), fig. 10, be the axis of a wheel, and \\( CD \\) the given direction in which it is required to convey the motion by means of a wheel fixed upon the axis \\( AB \\), and acting upon another wheel fixed on the axis \\( CD \\), and let us suppose that the axis \\( CD \\) must have four times the velocity of \\( AB \\), or must perform four revolutions while \\( AB \\) performs one. Then the number of teeth in the wheel fixed upon \\( AB \\) must be four times greater than the number of teeth in the wheel fixed upon \\( CD \\), and their radii must have the same proportion. Draw \\( cd \\) parallel to \\( CD \\) at any convenient distance, and draw \\( ab \\) parallel to \\( AB \\) at four times that distance, then the lines \\( im \\) and \\( in \\) drawn perpendicular to \\( AB \\) and \\( CD \\) respectively, will mark the situation and size of the wheels required.\nMechanics.\n\nIn this case the cones are O n i and O m i, and s r n i, r p m i, are the portions of them that are employed.\n\nThe formation of the teeth of bevelled wheels is more difficult than one would at first imagine. The teeth of such wheels, indeed, must be formed by the same rules which have been given for other wheels; but since different parts of the same tooth are at different distances from the axis, these parts must have the curvature of their acting surfaces proportioned to that distance. Thus, in fig. 10, the part of the tooth at r must be more incurvated than the part at i, as is evident from the inspection of fig. 9; and the epicycloid for the part i must be formed by means of circles whose diameters are i m and F f, while the epicycloid for the part r must be generated by circles whose diameters are C n and D d.\n\nLet us suppose a plane to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the points O, A, D; the lines A B, A O, will evidently be in this plane, which may be called the plane of centres. Now, when the teeth of the wheel D E, which is supposed to drive C D the smallest of the two, commence their action on the teeth of C D, when they arrive at the plane of centres, and continue their action after they have passed this plane, the curve given to the teeth of C D at C, should be a portion of an interior epicycloid formed by any generating circle rolling on the concave superficies of a circle whose diameter is twice C n perpendicular to C A, and the curvature of the teeth at i should be part of a similar epicycloid, formed upon a circle, whose diameter is twice i m. The curvature of the teeth of the wheel D E at D, should be part of an exterior epicycloid formed by the same generating circle rolling upon the concave circumference of a circle whose diameter is twice D d perpendicular to D A; and the epicycloid for the teeth at F is formed in the same way, only instead of twice D d, the diameter of the circle must be twice F f. When any other mode of action is adopted, the teeth are to be formed in the same manner that we have pointed out for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> wheels, with this difference only, that different epicycloids are necessary for the parts F and D. It may be sufficient, however, to find the form of the teeth at F, as the remaining part of the tooth may be shaped by directing a straight ruler from different points of the epicycloid at F to the centre A, and filling the tooth till every part of its acting surface coincide with the side of the ruler. The reason of this operation will be obvious by attending to the shape of the tooth in fig. 8. When the small wheel C D impels the large one D E, the epicycloids which were formerly given to C D must be given to D E, and those which were given to D E must be transferred to C D.\n\nThe wheel represented in fig. 11, is sometimes called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> wheel, though it is evident from the figure that it belongs to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of wheels which we have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> been considering; for the acting surfaces of the teeth both of the wheel M B and of the pinion E D G are directed to C the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> of the two cones C M B, C E G. In this case the rules for bevelled wheels must be adopted, in which A S is to be considered as the radius of the wheel for the profile of the tooth at A, and M N as its radius for the profile of the tooth at M; and the epicycloids thus formed will be the sections or profiles of the teeth in the direction M P, at right angles to M C the surfaces of the cone. When the vertex C of the cone M C G approaches to N till it be in the same plane with the points M, G, some of the curves will be cycloids and others involutes, as in the case of rack-work, for then the cone C F G will revolve upon a plane surface. Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. II. On the Wipers of Stampers, &c., the Teeth of Rack-work, &c., &c.\n\n411. In fig. 12, let A B be the wheel which is employed to elevate the rack C, and let their mutual action not commence till the acting teeth have reached the line of centres A C. In this case C becomes as it were the pinion or wheel driven, and the acting faces of its teeth must be interior epicycloids formed by any generating circle rolling within the circumference p q; but as p q is a straight line, these interior epicycloids will be cycloids, or curves generated by a point in the circumference of a circle, rolling upon a straight line or plane surface. The acting face o p, therefore, will be part of a cycloid formed by any generating circle, and m n, the acting face of the teeth of the wheel, must be an exterior epicycloid produced by the same generating circle rolling on m r the convex surface of the wheel. If it is required to make o p a straight line, as in the figure, then m n must be an involute of the circle m r formed in the manner represented in fig. 5.\n\n412. Fig. 12, likewise represents a wheel depressing the rack c when the third mode of action is used. In this case also c becomes the pinion, and D E the wheel; e h therefore must be part of an interior epicycloid formed by any generating circle rolling on the concave side e x of the wheel, and b c must be an exterior epicycloid produced by the same generating circle rolling upon the circumference of the rack. The remaining part e d of the teeth of the wheel must be an exterior epicycloid described by any generating circle moving upon the convex side e x, and b a must be an interior epicycloid engendered by the same generating circle rolling within the circumference of the rack. But as the circumference of the rack is in this case a straight line, the exterior epicycloid b e and the interior one b a will be cycloids formed by the same generating circles which are employed in describing the other epicycloids. Since it would be difficult, however, as has already been remarked, to give this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> curvature to the teeth of the wheel and rack, we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> a generating circle whose diameter is equal to D x the radius of the wheel, for describing the interior epicycloid e h, and the exterior one b e; and a generating circle whose diameter is equal to the radius of the rack, for describing the interior epicycloid a b, and the exterior one d e; a b and e h, therefore, will be straight lines, and b e will be a cycloid, and d e an involute of the circle e x, the radius of the rack being infinitely great.\n\n413. In the same manner may the form of the teeth of rack-work be determined, when the second mode of action is employed, and when the teeth of the wheel or rack are circular or rectilincal. But if the rack be part of a circle, it must have the same form of its teeth as that of a wheel of the same diameter with the circle of which it is a part.\nIn machinery, where large weights are to be raised, such as fulling-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>, mills for pounding ore, &c., or where large pistons are to be elevated by the arms of levers, it is of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> that the power should raise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> with an uniform force and velocity; and this can be effected only by giving a proper form to the wiper.\n\nNow there are two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> in which this uniformity of motion may be required, and each of these demands a different form for the communicating parts.\n\n1. When the weight is to be raised vertically, as the piston of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>, &c.\n2. When the weight to be raised or depressed moves upon a centre, and rises or falls in the arch of a circle, such as the sledge hammer in a forge, &c.\n\n414. 1. Let AH be a wheel moved by any power which is sufficient to raise the weight MN by its extremity O, from O to c, in the same time that the wheel moves round one-fourth of its circumference, it is required to fix upon its rim a wing OBCEDEH which shall produce this effect with an uniform effect. Divide the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> OH into any number of equal parts Om, mn, &c., the more the better, and oe into the same number ob, bc, cd, &c., and through the points m, n, p, H draw the indefinite lines AB, AC, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, AE, and make AB equal to Ab, AC to Ac, AD to Ad, and AE to Ae; then through the points O, B, C, D, E, draw the curve OBCDE, which is a portion of the spiral of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, and will be the proper form for the wiper or wing OHE. It is evident that when the point m has arrived at O, the extremity of the weight will have arrived at b; because AB is equal to Ab, and for the same reason, when the points n, p, H have successively arrived at O, the extremity of the weight will have arrived at the corresponding points c, d, e. The motion therefore will be uniform, because the space described by the weight is proportional to the space described by the moving power, Ob being to Oc as Om to On. If it be required to raise the weight MN with an accelerated or retarded motion, we have only to divide the line Oe according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> or retardation, and divide the curve OBCDE as before.\n\n415. 2. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> moves upon a centre, the weight's weight will rise in the arch of a circle, and consequently a new form must be given to the wipers or wings of a circle.\n\nLet AB, fig. 14, be a lever lying horizontally, which it is required to raise uniformly through the arch BC into the position AC, by means of the wheel BFH furnished with the wing BNOP, which acts upon the extremity C of the lever; and let it be required to raise it through BC in the same time that the wheel BFH moves through one-half of its circumference; that is, while the point M moves to B in the direction MFB. Divide the chord CB into any number of equal parts, the more the better, in the points 1, 2, 3, and draw the lines 1a 2b 3c parallel to AB, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> line passing through the point B, and meeting the arch BC in the points a, b, c. Draw the lines CD, aD, bD, cD, and BD <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> the circle BFH in the points m, n, o, p.\n\nHaving drawn the diameter BM, divide the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a> BFH into as many equal parts as the chord CB, in the points q, s, u. Take Bm, and set it from q to r; Take Bn and set it from s to t; Take Bo and set it from u to v, and lastly set Bp from M to E. Through the points r, s, t, v, E, draw the indefinite lines DN, DO, DP, DQ, and make DN equal to Dc; DO equal to Db; DP equal to Da; and DQ equal to DC. Then through the points G, P, O, N, B, draw the spiral B, N, O, P, Q, which will be the proper form for the wing of the wheel when it moves in the direction EMB.\n\nThat the spiral BNO will raise the lever AC, with an uniform motion, by acting upon its extremity c, will appear from the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the figure. It is evident, that when the point q arrives at B, the point r will be in m, because Bm is equal to qr, and the point N will be at c, because DN is equal to Dc; the extremity of the lever therefore, will be found in the point c, having moved through Bc. In like manner, when the point s has arrived at B, the point t will be at n, and the point O, in b, where the extremity of the lever will now be found; and so on with the rest, till the point M has arrived at B. The point E will then be in p, and the point Q in C; so that the lever will now have the position AC, having moved through the equal heights Bc, c b, b a, a c, (r) in the same time that the power has moved through the equal spaces q B, s q, u s, M u. The lever, therefore, has been raised uniformly, the ratio between the velocity of the power, and that of the weight, remaining always the same.\n\n416. If the wheel D turn in a contrary direction, according to the letters MHB, we must divide the semicircle BH EM, into as many equal parts as the chord cB, viz. in the points e, g, h. Then, having set the arch Bm from e to d, the arch Bn from g to f, and the rest in a similar manner, draw through the points d, f, h, E, the indefinite lines DR, DS, DT, DQ; make DR equal to Dc; DS equal to Db; DT equal to Da, and DQ equal to DC; and through the points B, R, S, T, Q, describe the spiral BRSTQ, which will be the proper form for the wing, when the wheel turns in the direction MEB. For, when the point e arrives at B, the point d will be in m, and R in c, where the extremity of the lever will now be found, having moved through Bc in the same time that the power, or wheel, has moved through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> eB. In the same manner it may be shewn, that the lever will rise through the equal heights c b, b a, a C, in the same time that the power moves through the corresponding spaces e g, g i, i M. The motion of the lever, therefore, and also that of the power, are always uniform. Of all the positions that can be given to the point B, the most disadvantageous are those which are nearest the points F, H; and the most advantageous position is when the chord Bc is vertical, and passes, when prolonged, through D, the centre.\n\n(f) The arches Bc, cb, &c., are not equal; but the perpendiculars let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> from the points c, a, b, &c., upon the horizontal lines, passing through ab, &c., are equal, being proportional to the equal lines c 1, 1, 2, Eucl. VI. 2.\nMechanics.\n\nIn this particular case the two curves have equal bases, though they differ a little in point of curvature. The farther that the centre A is distant, the nearer do these curves resemble each other; and if it were infinitely distant, they would be exactly similar, and would be the spirals of Archimedes, as the extremity c would in this case rise perpendicularly.\n\nIt will be easily perceived that 4, 6, or 8 wings may be placed upon the circumference of the circle, and may be formed by dividing into the same number of equal parts as the chord BC, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the circumference, instead of the semicircle BFM.\n\nThat the wing BNO may not act upon any part of the lever between A and C, the arm AC should be bent; and that the friction may be diminished as much as possible, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROLLER\">roller</a> should be fixed upon its extremity C. When a roller is used, however, a curve must always be drawn parallel to the spiral described according to the preceding method, the distance between it and the spiral being everywhere equal to the radius of the roller.\n\nIf it should be required to raise the roller with an accelerated or retarded motion, we have only to divide the chord BC, according to the degree of retardation or acceleration required, and the circle into the same number of equal parts as before.\n\n417. As it is frequently more convenient to raise or depress weights by the extremity of a constant radius, furnished with a roller, instead of wings fixed upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> of a wheel; we shall now proceed to determine the curve which must be given to the arm of the lever which is to be raised and depressed, in order that this elevation or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> may be effected with an uniform motion.\n\nLet AB be a lever, which it is required to raise uniformly through the arch BC, into the position AC, by means of the arm or constant radius DE, moving upon D as a centre, in the same time that the extremity E describes the arch EeF. From the point C draw CH at right angles to AB, and divide it into any number of equal parts, suppose three, in the points 1, 2; and through the points 1, 2, draw 1a2b, parallel to the horizontal line AB, cutting the arch CB in the points a, b, through which draw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">aA</a>, bA. Upon D as a centre, with the distance DE, describe the arch Ei e F, and upon A as a centre, with the distance AD, describe the arch eOD, cutting the arch E i e F in the point c. Divide the arches E i e, and F s e, each into the same number of equal parts as the perpendicular c H, in the points k, i, s, m, and through these points about the centre A, describe the arches k z, i g, q r, m n. Make x x and set it from k to k, and take g f, and set it from i to h. Take r g also, and set it from s to t, and set n m from o to p, and d c from c to O. Then through the points E, i, h, O, and O, t, p, F, draw the two curves E l h O, and O l p F, which will be the proper form that must be given to the arm of the lever. If the handle DE moves from E towards F, the curve EO must be used, but if in the contrary direction, we must employ the curve OF.\n\nIt is evident, that when the extremity E of the handle DE, has run through the arch E k, or rather E l, the point l will be in k, and the point x in x, because x x is equal to k l, and the lever will have the position A b. For the same reason, when the extremity E of the handle has arrived at i, the point h will be in i, and the point g in f, and the lever will be raised to the position A a. Thus it appears, that the motion of the power and the weight are always proportional. When a roller is fixed at E, a curve parallel to EO, or OF, must be drawn as formerly. See Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures.\n\nChap. VI. On the First Movers of Machinery.\n\n418. The powers which are generally employed as the first movers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>, and animal exertion. The mode of employing water as an impelling power has already been given at great length in the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRODYNAMICS\">Hydrodynamics</a>. The application of wind to turn machinery will be discussed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> on Windmills; and what regards steam will be more properly introduced into the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\">Steam-Engine</a>. At present, therefore, we shall only make a few general remarks on the strength of men and horses; and conclude with a general view of the relative powers of the first movers of machinery. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> contains the weight which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> is able to raise through a certain height in a certain time, according to different authors.\n\n| Number of pounds raised | Height to which the weight is raised | Time in which it is raised | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">Duration</a> of the Work | Names of the authors |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 1000                    | 180                               | 60 minutes               | 8 hours             | Euler               |\n| 60                      | 1                                 | 1 second                 |                     | Bernouilli          |\n| 25 French               | 220                               | 145 seconds              | half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>        | Amontons            |\n| 170 French              | 1                                 | 1 second                 |                     | Coulomb             |\n| 1000                    | 330                               | 60 minutes               |                     | Desaguliers         |\n| 1000                    | 225                               | 60 minutes               |                     | Smcaton             |\n| 30                      | 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)                  | 1 second                 | 10 hours            | Emerson             |\n| 29 or 30                | 2.45 feet                         | 1 second                 |                     | Schulze             |\n\n(g) In the figure we have taken the point B in a disadvantageous position, because the intersections are in this case more distinct.\nAccording to Amontons, a man weighing 133 pounds French, ascended 62 feet French by steps in 34 seconds, but was completely exhausted. The same author informs us that a sawer made 200 strokes of 18 inches French each, with a force of 25 pounds, in 145 seconds; but that he could not have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> the exertion above three minutes.\n\nIt appears from the observations of Desaguliers, that an ordinary man can, for the space of ten hours, turn a winch with a force of 30 pounds, and with a velocity of two feet and a half per second; and that two men working at a windlass with handles at right angles to each other, can raise 70 pounds more easily than one man can raise 30. The reason of this is, that when there is only one man, he exerts variable efforts at different positions of the handle, and therefore the motion of the windlass is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>; whereas in the case of two men, with handles at right angles, the effect of the one man is greatest when the effect of the other is least, and therefore the motion of the machine is more uniform, and will perform more work. Desaguliers also found, that a man may exert a force of 80 pounds with a fly when the motion is pretty quick, and that by means of a good common pump, he may raise a hogshead of water 10 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, and continue the exertion during a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nA variety of interesting experiments upon the force of men were made by the learned M. Coulomb. He found that the quantity of action of a man who ascended stairs with nothing but his own weight, was double that of a man loaded with 223 pounds avoirdupois, both of them continuing the exertion for a day. In this case the total or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> effect of the unloaded man is the greatest possible; but the useful effect which he produces is nothing. In the same way, if he were loaded to such a degree that he was almost incapable of moving, the useful effect would be nothing. Hence there is a certain load with which the man will produce the greatest useful effect. This load M. Coulomb found to be 173.8 pounds avoirdupois, upon the supposition that the man is to ascend stairs, and continue the exertion during a whole day. When thus loaded, the quantity of action exerted by the labourer is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to 183.66 pounds avoirdupois raised through 3282 feet. This method of working is however attended with a loss of three-fourths of the total action of the workman.\u2014It appears also from Coulomb's experiments, that a man going up stairs for a day raises 205 chilogrammes (a chilogramme is equal to three ounces five drams avoirdupois) to the height of a chilometre (a chilometre is equal to 3957.1 English inches); that a man carrying wood up stairs raises, together with his own weight, 109 chilogrammes to one chilometre;\u2014that a man weighing 150 pounds French, can ascend by stairs three feet French in a second, for the space of 15 or 20 seconds;\u2014that a man cultivating the ground performs \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) as much labour as a man ascending stairs, and that his quantity of action is equal to 328 pounds avoirdupois raised through the space of 3282 feet;\u2014that a man with a winch does \\( \\frac{6}{8} \\) as much as by ascending stairs;\u2014and that in a pile-engine, a man by means of a rope drawn horizontally, raised for the space of five hours 55.7 pounds French through one foot French in a second.\u2014When men walk on a horizontal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, Coulomb found that the quantity of action was a maximum when they were loaded, and that this maximum quantity of action is to that which is exerted by a man loaded with 190.25 pounds avoirdupois as 7 to 4.\u2014The weight which a man ought to carry in order that the useful effect may be a maximum, is 165.3 pounds avoirdupois. When the workman, however, returns unloaded for a new burden, he must carry 200.7 pounds avoirdupois.\n\nAccording to Dr Robison a feeble old man raised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> cubic feet of water=437.5 pounds avoirdupois, 11\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet high, in one minute, for eight or ten hours a day, by walking backwards and forwards on a lever;\u2014and a young man weighing 135 pounds, and carrying 30 pounds, raised 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) cubic feet of water =578.1 pounds avoirdupois, 11\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet high, for 10 hours a day, without being fatigued.\n\nFrom the experiments of Mr Buchanan, it appears that the forces exerted by a man pumping, acting at a winch, ringing and rowing, are as the numbers 1742, 2876, 3883, 4995.\n\nAccording to Desaguliers and Smeaton, the power of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> is equal to the power of five men, strength Several French authors suppose a horse equal to seven men, while M. Schulze considers one horse as equivalent to 14 men.\u2014Two horses, according to the experiment of Amontons, exerted a force of 150 pounds French, when yoked in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>. According to Desaguliers, a horse is capable of drawing, with a force of 200 pounds, two miles and a half an hour, and of continuing this action eight hours in the day. When the force is 240 pounds he can work only six hours. It appears from Smeaton's reports, that by means of pumps a horse can raise 250 hogsheads of water, 10 feet high, in an hour.\u2014The most disadvantageous way of employing the power of a horse is to make him carry a load up an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined plane</a>, for it was observed by De la Hire, that three men, with 100 pounds each, will go faster up the inclined plane than a horse with 300 pounds. When the horse walks on a good road, and is loaded with about two hundred weight, he may easily travel 25 miles in the space of seven or eight hours.\n\nWhen a horse is employed in raising coals by means of a wheel and axle, and moves at the rate of about two miles an hour, Mr Fenwick found that he could continue at work 12 hours each day, two and a half of which were spent in short intervals of rest, when he raised a load of 1000 pounds avoirdupois, with a velocity of 13 feet per minute;\u2014and that he will exert a force of 75 pounds for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> hours and a half, when moving with the same velocity. Mr Fenwick also found that 230 ale gallons of water delivered every minute on an overshot water-wheel, 10 feet in diameter; that a common steam-engine, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> eight inches in diameter, and an improved engine with a cylinder 6.12 inches in diameter, will do the work of one horse, that is, will raise a weight of 1000 pounds avoirdupois, through the height of 13 feet in a minute. It appears from Mr Smeaton's experiments, that Dutch sails in their common position with a radius of 9 feet and a half, that Dutch sails in their best position with a radius of eight feet, and that his enlarged sails with a radius of seven feet, perform the same work as one man; or per-\n### Table showing the relative strength of Overshot Wheels, Steam Engines, Horses, Men, and Wind-mills of different kinds.\n\n| Number of ale gallons delivered on an overshot wheel, 10 feet in diameter, every minute. | Diameter of the cylinder in the common steam-engine, in inches. | Diameter of the cylinder of the improved steam-engine, in inches. | Number of horses working 12 hours per day, and moving at the rate of two miles per hour. | Number of men working 12 hours a-day. | Radius of Dutch sails in their common position, in feet. | Radius of Dutch sails in their best position, in feet. | Radius of Mr Smeaton's enlarged sails, in feet. | Height to which these different powers will raise 1000 pounds avoirdupois in a minute. |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 235 | 8 | 6.12 | 1 | 5 | 21.24 | 17.89 | 15.65 | 13 |\n| 390 | 9.5 | 7.8 | 2 | 10 | 30.04 | 25.30 | 22.13 | 26 |\n| 528 | 10.5 | 8.2 | 3 | 15 | 36.80 | 30.98 | 27.11 | 39 |\n| 660 | 11.5 | 8.8 | 4 | 20 | 42.48 | 35.78 | 31.30 | 52 |\n| 790 | 12.5 | 9.35 | 5 | 25 | 47.50 | 40.00 | 35.00 | 65 |\n| 970 | 14 | 10.35 | 6 | 30 | 52.03 | 43.82 | 38.34 | 78 |\n| 1170 | 15.4 | 11.75 | 7 | 35 | 56.90 | 47.33 | 41.41 | 90 |\n| 1350 | 16.8 | 12.8 | 8 | 40 | 60.09 | 50.60 | 44.27 | 104 |\n| 1445 | 17.3 | 13.6 | 9 | 45 | 63.73 | 53.66 | 46.96 | 117 |\n| 1584 | 18.5 | 14.2 | 10 | 50 | 67.17 | 56.57 | 49.50 | 130 |\n| 1740 | 19.4 | 14.8 | 11 | 55 | 70.46 | 59.33 | 51.91 | 143 |\n| 1900 | 20.2 | 15.2 | 12 | 60 | 73.59 | 61.97 | 54.22 | 156 |\n| 2100 | 21 | 16.2 | 13 | 65 | 76.59 | 64.45 | 56.43 | 169 |\n| 2300 | 22 | 17 | 14 | 70 | 79.49 | 66.94 | 58.57 | 182 |\n| 2500 | 23.1 | 17.8 | 15 | 75 | 82.27 | 69.28 | 60.62 | 195 |\n| 2686 | 23.9 | 18.3 | 16 | 80 | 84.97 | 71.55 | 62.61 | 208 |\n| 2870 | 24.7 | 19 | 17 | 85 | 87.07 | 73.32 | 64.16 | 221 |\n| 3055 | 25.5 | 19.6 | 18 | 90 | 90.13 | 75.90 | 67.41 | 234 |\n| 3240 | 26.25 | 20.1 | 19 | 95 | 92.60 | 77.98 | 68.23 | 247 |\n| 3420 | 27 | 20.7 | 20 | 100 | 95.00 | 80.00 | 70.00 | 260 |\n| 3750 | 28.5 | 22.2 | 22 | 110 | 99.64 | 83.90 | 73.42 | 286 |\n| 4000 | 29.8 | 23 | 24 | 120 | 104.06 | 87.63 | 76.68 | 312 |\n| 4460 | 31.1 | 23.9 | 26 | 130 | 108.32 | 91.22 | 79.81 | 338 |\n| 4850 | 32.4 | 24.7 | 28 | 140 | 112.20 | 94.66 | 82.82 | 364 |\n| 5250 | 33.6 | 25.5 | 30 | 150 | 116.35 | 97.98 | 85.73 | 390 |\n\n---\n\n426. Dutch sails are always constructed so that the angle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> may diminish from the centre to the extremity of the sail. They are concave to the wind, and are in their common position when their extremities are parallel to the plane in which they move, or perpendicular to the direction of the wind. Dutch sails are in their best position when their extremities make an angle of seven degrees with the plane of their motion. Mr Smeaton\u2019s enlarged sails are Dutch sails in their best position, but enlarged at their extremities.\n\n427. It appears from M. Coulomb\u2019s experiments on Dutch wind-mills, with rectangular sails, that when the distance between the extremities of two opposite sails is 66 feet from end to end, and the breadth of each sail six feet, a wind moving at the rate of 20 feet per second will produce an effect equivalent to 1000 pounds raised through the space of 218 feet in a minute.\n\nAccording to Watt and Boulton, one of their steam engines, with a cylinder 31 inches in diameter, and which makes 17 double strokes per minute, is equivalent to 40 horses working day and night; that is, to 101 horses working nine hours and a half, the time of constant exertion in the preceding table. When the cylinder is 19 inches in diameter, and the engine makes 25 strokes of four feet each per minute, its power is equivalent to twelve horses working constantly, or thirty horses working nine hours and a half\u2014and when the cylinder is 24 inches in diameter, and the engine makes 22 strokes, of five feet each, in a minute, its power is equal to that of 20 horses working constantly, or 50 horses working nine hours and a half.\n\n---\n\n**CHAP. VII. On the Construction of Wind-mills.**\n\n428. A wind-mill is represented in fig. 1, where MN is the circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> that contains the machinery, E the extremity of the windshaft, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> axis, which is generally inclined from 8 to 15 degrees to the horizon; and EA, EB, EC, ED four rectangular frames upon which sails of cloth of the same form are stretched. At the lower extremity G of the sails their surface is inclined to the axis 72\u00b0; and at their farthest extremities A, D, &c., the inclination of the sail is about 83\u00b0. Now, when the sails are adjusted to the wind, which happens when the wind blows in the direction of the windshaft E, the impulse of the wind...\nMechanics.\n\nPractical upon the oblique sails may be resolved into two forces, one of which acts at right angles to the windshaft, and is therefore employed solely in giving a motion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> to the sails and the axis upon which they are fixed. When the mill is used for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> corn, a crown wheel, fixed to the principal axis P, gives motion to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANTERN\">lantern</a> or trundle, whose axis carries the moveable millstone.\n\nMethods of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the windmill sails to the wind.\n\n429. That the wind may act with the greatest efficacy upon the sails, the windshaft must have the same direction as the wind. But as this direction is perpetually changing, some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> is necessary for bringing the windshaft and sails into their proper position. This is sometimes effected by supporting the machinery on a strong vertical axis, whose pivot moves in a brass socket firmly fixed into the ground, so that the whole machine, by means of a lever, may be made to revolve upon this axis, and be properly adjusted to the direction of the wind. Most windmills, however, are furnished with a moveable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> which revolves upon friction rollers inserted in the fixed kerb of the mill; and the adjustment is effected by the assistance of a simple lever. As both these methods of adjustment require the assistance of men, it would be very desirable that the same effect should be produced solely by the action of the wind. This may be done by fixing a large wooden vane or weather-cock at the extremity of a long horizontal arm which lies in the same vertical plane with the windshaft. By this means when the surface of the vane, and its distance from the centre of motion, are sufficiently great, a very gentle breeze will exert a sufficient force upon the vane to turn the machinery, and will always bring the sails and windshaft to their proper position. This weather-cock, it is evident, may be applied either to machines which have a moveable roof, or which revolve upon a vertical arbor.\n\nOn the Form and Position of Wind-mill Sails.\n\n430. It appears from the investigations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARENT\">Parent</a>, that a maximum effect will be produced when the sails are inclined 54\u00b0 degrees to the axis of rotation, or when the angle of weather is 35\u00b0 (c) degrees. In obtaining this conclusion, however, M. Parent has assumed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> which are inadmissible, and has neglected several circumstances which must materially affect the result of his investigations. The angle of inclination assigned by Parent is certainly the most efficacious for giving motion to the sails from a state of rest, and for preventing them from stopping when in motion; but he has not considered that the action of the wind upon a sail at rest is different from its action upon a sail in motion; for since the extremities of the sails move with greater rapidity than the parts nearer the centre, the angle of weather should be greater towards the centre than at the extremity, and should vary with the velocity of each part of the sail. The reason of this is very obvious. It has been demonstrated by Boasut, and established by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that when any fluid acts upon a plain surface, the force of impulsion is always exerted most advantageously when the impelled surface is in a state of rest, and that this force diminishes as the velocity of the surface increases. Now, let us suppose with Parent, that the most advantageous angle of weather for the sails of wind-mills is 35\u00b0 degrees for that part of the sail which is nearest the centre of rotation, and that the sail has everywhere this angle of weather; then, since the extremity of the sail moves with the greatest velocity, it will in a manner withdraw itself from the action of the wind, or, to speak more properly, it will not receive the impulse of the wind so advantageously as those parts of the sail which have a less degree of velocity. In order therefore to counteract this diminution of force, we must make the wind act more perpendicularly upon the sail, by diminishing its obliquity or its angle of weather. But since the velocity of every part of the sail is proportional to its distance from the centre of motion, every elementary portion of it must have a different angle of weather diminishing from the centre to the extremity of the sail. The law or rate of diminution, however, is still to be discovered, and we are fortunately in possession of a theorem of Euler's, afterwards given by MacLaurin, which determines this law of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>. Let \\(a\\) represent the Euler's velocity of the wind, and \\(c\\) the velocity of any given part of the sail; then the effort of the wind upon that part of the sail will be greatest when the tangent of the angle of the wind's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a>, or of the sail's inclination to the axis, is to radius, as \\(\\sqrt{2 + \\frac{9c}{4aa} + \\frac{3c}{2a}} = 1\\).\n\n431. In order to apply this theorem, let us suppose that the radius or whip ED of the sail \\(a\\) is divided into six equal parts; that the point \\(n\\) is equidistant from E and D, and is the point of the sail which has the same velocity as the wind; then, in the preceding theorem, we shall have \\(c = a\\), when the sail is loaded to a maximum; and therefore the tangent of the angle, which the surface of the sail at \\(n\\) makes with the axis, when \\(a = 1\\), will be \\(\\sqrt{2 + \\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{3}{2}} - 3.561 = \\text{tangent of } 74^\\circ\\).\n\n\\(19'\\), which gives \\(15^\\circ 41'\\) for the angle of weather at the point \\(n\\). Since, at \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of the radius \\(c = a\\), and since \\(c\\) is proportional to the distance of the corresponding part of the sail from the centre, we will have, at \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of the radius \\(s m\\), \\(c = \\frac{a}{3}\\); at \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the radius, \\(c = \\frac{2a}{3}\\); at \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\), \\(c = \\frac{4a}{3}\\); at \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\), \\(c = \\frac{5a}{3}\\); and at the extremity of the radius, \\(c = 2a\\). By substituting these different values of \\(c\\), instead of \\(c\\) in the theorem, and by making \\(a = 1\\), the following table will be obtained, which exhibits the angles of inclination and weather which must be given to different parts of the sails.\n\nParts\n\n(c) The weather of the sails is the angle which the surface forms with the plane in which they move, and is equal to the complement of the angle which that surface forms with the axis.\n432. Mr Smeaton found, from a variety of experiments, that the common practice of inclining plane sails from 72\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 to the axis, was much more efficacious than the angle assigned by Parent, the effect being as 45 to 31. When the sails were weathered in the Dutch manner, that is, when their surfaces were concave to the wind, and when the angle of inclination increased towards their extremities, they produced a greater effect than when they were weathered either in the common way, or according to Euler's theorem. But when the sails were enlarged at their extremities, as represented at \u03b1 \u03b2, in fig. 2, so that \u03b1 \u03b2 was one-third of the radius E D, and \u03b1 D to D \u03b2 as 5 to 3, their power was greatest of all, though the surface acted upon by the wind remained the same. If the sails be farther enlarged, the effect is not increased in proportion to the surface; and besides, when the quantity of cloth is great, the machine is much exposed to injury by sudden squalls of wind. In Mr Smeaton's experiments, the angle of weather varied with the distance from the axis; and it appeared from several trials, that the most efficacious angles were those in the following table.\n\n| Parts of the radius E A, which is divided into 6 parts | Angle with the axis | Angle of weather |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| 1                                                   | 72                | 18              |\n| 2                                                   | 71                | 19              |\n| 3                                                   | 72                | 18 middle       |\n| 4                                                   | 74                | 16              |\n| 5                                                   | 77\u00bd               | 12\u00bd             |\n| 6                                                   | 83                | 7               |\n\nIf the radius E D of the sail be 30 feet, then the sail will commence at \u2153 E D, or 5 feet from the axis, where the angle of inclination will be 72\u00b0. At \u2154 E D, or 10 feet from the axis, the angle will be 71\u00b0, and so on.\n\nOn the Effect of Wind-mill Sails.\n\n433. The following maxims deduced by Mr Smeaton from his experiments, contain the most accurate information upon this subject.\n\nMaxim 1. The velocity of wind-mill sails, whether unloaded or loaded, so as to produce a maximum effect, is nearly as the velocity of the wind, their shape and position being the same.\n\nMaxim 2. The load at the maximum is nearly as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the velocity of the wind, the shape and position of the sails being the same.\n\nMaxim 3. The effects of the same sails at a maximum, are nearly, but somewhat less than, as the cubes of the velocity of the wind.\n\nMaxim 4. The load of the same sails at the maximum is nearly as the squares, and their effects as the cubes of their number of turns in a given time.\n\nMaxim 5. When sails are loaded, so as to produce a maximum at a given velocity, and the velocity of the wind increases, the load continuing the same:\n\n1st, The increase of effect, when the increase of the velocity of the wind is small, will be nearly as the squares of those velocities;\n\n2dly, When the velocity of the wind is double, the effects will be nearly as 10 : 27\u00bd;\n\nBut, 3dly, When the velocities compared are more than double of that where the given load produces a maximum, the effects increase nearly in the simple ratio of the velocity of the wind.\n\nMaxim 6. In sails where the figure and positions are similar, and the velocity of the wind the same, the number of turns in a given time will be reciprocally as the radius or length of the sail.\n\nMaxim 7. The load at a maximum that sails of a similar figure and position will overcome at a given distance from the centre of motion, will be as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> of the radius.\n\nMaxim 8. The effects of sails of similar figure and position are as the square of the radius.\n\nMaxim 9. The velocity of the extremities of Dutch sails, as well as of the enlarged sails, in all their usual positions when unloaded, or even loaded to a maximum, are considerably quicker than the velocity of the wind.\n\n434. A new mode of constructing the sails of windmills has been recently given by Mr Sutton, and fully described by Mr Heselden of Barton, in a work exclusively devoted to the subject.\n\nThe limits of this article will not permit us to enter into any discussion respecting the principles upon which Mr Sutton's gravitated sails are constructed; but the subject shall be resumed under the article Windmill. It may be proper however to remark that Mr Sutton gives his sails the form represented in fig. 4, and makes the angle of weather at the point M, equidistant from A and B, equal to 22\u00b0 30\u2032. The inclination of the sail at any other point N of the sail, is an angle whose sine is the distance of that point from the centre of motion A, the radius being the breadth of the sail at that point. Fig. 3 shows the angles at the different points of the sail; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> and absolute breadth of the sail at these points. Mr Sutton's mode of regulating the velocity of the sails, and of bringing them to a state of rest, is particularly ingenious.\nOn Horizontal Wind-mills.\n\n435. Various opinions have been entertained respecting the relative advantages of horizontal and vertical wind-mills. Mr Smeaton, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, gives a decided preference to the latter; but when he asserts that horizontal wind-mills have only \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the power of vertical ones, he certainly forms too low an estimate of their power. Mr Beatson, on the contrary, who has received a patent for the construction of a new horizontal wind-mill, seems to be prejudiced in their favour, and greatly exaggerates their comparative value. From an impartial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, it will probably appear, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> lies between these two opposite opinions; but before entering on this discussion, we must first consider the nature and form of horizontal wind-mills.\n\n436. In fig. 4, CK is the windshaft, which moves upon pivots. Four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> bars, CA, CD, IB, FG, are fixed to this arbor, which carry the frames APIB, DEFG. The sails AI, EG, are stretched upon these frames, and are carried round the axis CK, by the perpendicular impulse of the wind. Upon the axis CK, a toothed wheel is fixed, which gives motion to the particular machinery that is employed. In the figure, only two sails are represented; but there are always other two placed at right angles to these. Now, let the sails be exposed to the wind, and it will be evident that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> motion will ensue; for the force of the wind upon the sail AI, is counteracted by an equal and opposite force upon the sail EG. In order then, that the wind may communicate motion to the machine, the force upon the returning sail EG must either be removed by screening it from the wind, or diminished by making it present a less surface when returning against the wind.\n\nThe first of these methods is adopted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>, and in some provinces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>; but is objected to by Mr Beatson, from the inconvenience and expense of the machinery and attendance requisite for turning the screens into their proper positions. Notwithstanding this objection, however, I am disposed to think that this is the best method of diminishing the action of the wind upon the returning sails, for the moveable screen may easily be made to follow the direction of the wind, and assume its proper position, by means of a large wooden weathercock, without the aid either of men or machinery. It is true, indeed, that the resistance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a> in the returning sails is not completely removed; but it is at least as much diminished as it can be by any method hitherto proposed. Besides, when this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> is resorted to, there is no occasion for any moveable flaps and hinges, which must add greatly to the expense of every other method.\n\n437. The mode of bringing the sails back against the wind, which Mr Beatson invented, is perhaps, the simplest and best of the kind. He makes each sail AI consist of six or eight flaps or vanes, AP b 1, b 1 c 2, &c., moving upon hinges represented by the dark lines, AP, b 1, c 2, &c., so that the lower side b 1 of the first flap overlaps the hinge or higher side of the second flap, and so on. When the wind, therefore, acts upon the sail AI, each flap will press upon the hinge of the one immediately below it, and the whole surface of the sail will be exposed to its action. But when the sail AI returns against the wind, the flaps will revolve round upon their hinges, and present only their edges to the practical wind, as is represented at EG, so that the resistance occasioned by the return of the sail must be greatly diminished, and the motion will be continued by the great superiority of force exerted upon the sails in the position AI. In computing the force of the wind upon the sail AI, and the resistance opposed to it by the edges of the flaps in EG, Mr Beatson finds, that when the pressure upon the former is 1872 pounds, the resistance opposed by the latter is only about 36 pounds, or \\( \\frac{1}{50} \\) part of the whole force; but he neglects the action of the wind upon the arms CA, &c. and the frames which carry the sails, because they expose the same surface in the position AI, as in the position EG. This omission, however, has a tendency to mislead us in the present case, as we shall now see, for we ought to compare the whole force exerted upon the arms, as well as the sail, with the whole resistance which these arms and the edges of the flaps oppose to the motion of the windmill. By inspecting fig. 4, it will appear, that if the force upon the edges of the flaps, which Mr Beatson supposed to be 12 in number, amounts to 36 pounds, the force spent upon the bars CD, DG, GF, FE, &c., cannot be less than 60 pounds. Now, since these bars are acted upon with an equal force, when the sails have the position AI, 1872 + 60 = 1932 will be the force exerted upon the sail AI, and its appendages, while the opposite force upon the bars and edges of the flaps when returning against the wind will be 36 + 60 = 96 pounds, which is nearly \\( \\frac{1}{50} \\) of 1932, instead of \\( \\frac{1}{50} \\) as computed by Mr Beatson. Hence we may see the probable advantages of a screen over moveable flaps, as it will preserve not only the sails, but the arms and the frame which support it, from the action of the wind.\n\n438. We shall now conclude this chapter with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the power of horizontal and vertical wind-mills. It was already stated, that Mr Smeaton thought they have only \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the power of the latter. He observes, that when the vanes of a horizontal and a vertical mill are of the same dimensions, the power of the latter is four times that of the former, because, in the first case, only one sail is acted upon at once, while, in the second case, all the four receive the impulse of the wind. This, however, is not strictly true, since the vertical sails are all oblique to the direction of the wind. Let us suppose that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of each sail is 100 square feet; then the power of the horizontal sail will be 100, and the power of a vertical sail may be called 100 \\( \\times \\sin 70^\\circ \\) (70\u00b0 being the common angle of inclination) = 88 nearly; but since there are four vertical sails, the power of them all will be 4 \\( \\times \\) 88 = 352; so that the power of the horizontal sail is to that of the four vertical ones as 1 to 3.52, and not as 1 to 4, according to Mr Smeaton. But Mr Smeaton also observes, that if we consider the further disadvantage which arises from the difficulty of getting the sails back against the wind, we need not wonder if horizontal wind-mills have only about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) the power of the common sort. We have already seen, that the resistance occasioned by the return of the sails amounts to \\( \\frac{1}{50} \\) of the whole force which they receive; by subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\), therefore, from \\( \\frac{1}{3.52} \\), we shall find that\nthe power of horizontal wind-mills is only $\\frac{1}{4}$, or little more than $\\frac{1}{4}$ that of vertical ones. This calculation proceeds upon a supposition, that the whole force exerted upon vertical sails is employed in turning them round the axis of motion; whereas a considerable part of this force is lost in pressing the pivot of the axis or windshaft against its gudgeon. Mr Smeaton has overlooked this circumstance, otherwise he could never have maintained that the power of four vertical sails was quadruple the power of one horizontal sail, the dimensions of each being the same. Taking this circumstance into the account, we cannot be far wrong in saying, that in theory at least, if not in practice, the power of a horizontal wind-mill is about $\\frac{1}{4}$ or $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the power of a vertical one, when the quantity of surface and the form of the sails is the same, and when every part of the horizontal sails has the same distance from the axis of motion as the corresponding parts of the vertical sails. But if the horizontal sails have the position AI, EG, in fig. 4, instead of the position CA dm, CD on, their power will be greatly increased, though the quantity of surface is the same, because the part CP 3 m being transferred to BI 3 d, has much more power to turn the sails.\n\n**Chap. VIII. On the Construction of Wheel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">Carriages</a>.**\n\nIt is evident from Art. 60. that when a wheel surmounts an obstacle, it acts as a lever of the first kind, and that its power to overcome such resistances increases with its diameter. The power of the force P, for example, to raise the wheel NB over the eminence C, is proportional to the vertical lever FC, which increases with the diameter of the wheel, while the lever of resistance FA, by which the weight of the wheel acts, remains unchanged; hence we see the advantages of large wheels for overcoming such obstacles as generally resist the motion of wheel carriages. There are some circumstances, however, which, independent of the additional weight and expense of large wheels, prescribe limits to their size. If the radius AC of the wheel exceeds the height of that part of the horse to which the traces are attached, the line of traction DA will be oblique to the horizon, and part of the power P will be employed in pressing the wheel upon the ground. A wheel exceeding four and a half feet radius, which is the general distance from the ground of that part of the horse to which the traces are attached, has still the advantage of a smaller wheel; but when we consider that the traces or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a> will, in this case, rub against the flanks of the horses, so that the power of the wheel is diminished by the increase of its weight, we shall be convinced that no power is gained by making the radius of the wheels greater than four and a half feet. Even this size is too great, as shall be afterwards shown, when we treat of the line of traction, so that we may safely assert, that the diameter of wheels should never be greater than six feet. The fore wheels of our carriages are still unaccountably small, and it is not uncommon to see carts moving upon wheels scarcely 14 inches in diameter. The convenience of turning is urged as the reason for diminishing the fore wheels of carriages, and the facility of loading the cart is considered as a sufficient reason for using wheels so small as 14 inches. Mechanics. The first of these advantages, however, may be obtained by going to the end of a street, or to a proper place for turning the carriage; and a few additional turns of a windlass will be sufficient to convey the heaviest loads into carts mounted on high wheels.\n\nThe next thing to be determined is the shape of the wheels. Now it is certainly a matter of surprise how the unnatural shape which is at present given to them could ever have been brought into use. A cylindrical wheel, with the spokes perpendicular to the naves, is undoubtedly the form which every mechanic would give to his wheels, before he had heard of the pretended advantages of concave or dishing wheels, or those which have inclined spokes and conical rims. It has been alleged, indeed, that the form represented in fig. 5, when A r, B s is the conical rim, and o A, p B the inclined spokes, renders the wheel stronger than it would otherwise be; that by extending the base of the earring it prevents it from being overturned; that it hinders the felloes from rubbing against the load or the sides of the cart; and that when one wheel falls into a rut, and therefore supports more than one half of the load, the spokes are brought into a vertical position, which renders them more capable of sustaining the additional weight. Now it is evident that the second of these advantages is very trifling, and may be obtained, when required, by interposing a piece of board between the wheel and the load.\n\nThe other two advantages exist only in very bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>; and if they are necessary, which we much question, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> like this, where the roads are so excellently made, and so regularly repaired, they can easily be procured, by making the axle-tree a few inches longer, and increasing the strength of the spokes. But it is allowed on all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> that perpendicular spokes are preferable on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> ground. The inclination of the spokes, therefore, which renders concave wheels advantageous in rugged and unequal roads, renders them disadvantageous when the roads are in good order; and where the good roads are more numerous than the bad ones, as they certainly are in this country, the disadvantages of concave wheels must overbalance their advantages. It is true indeed that in concave wheels, the spokes are in their strongest position, when they are exposed to the severest strains, that is, when one wheel is in a deep rut, and sustains more than one half of the load; but it is equally true that on level ground, where the spokes are in their weakest position, a less severe strain, by continuing for a much longer time, may be equally if not more detrimental to the wheel.\n\nUpon these observations we might rest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> which we have been maintaining, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> for its truth to the judgment of every intelligent and unbiased mind; but we shall go a step farther, and endeavour to show that concave dishing wheels are more expensive, more injurious to the roads, more liable to be broken by accidents, and less durable in general, than those wheels in which the spokes are perpendicular to the naves. By inspecting fig. 5, it will appear that the whole of the pressure which the wheel AB sustains is exerted along the inclined spoke p s, and therefore acts obliquely upon the level ground n D, whether the rims are conical or cylindrical. This oblique action must necessarily\nMechanics.\n\nPractical necessarily injure the roads, by loosening the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> more between B and D than between B and n, and if the load were sufficiently great, the stones would start up between s and D. The texture of the roads, indeed, is sufficiently firm to prevent this from taking place; but in consequence of the oblique pressure, the stones between s and D will at least be loosened, and by admitting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> the whole of the road will be materially damaged. But when the spokes are perpendicular to the nave as pn, and when the rims mA, nB are cylindrical, or parallel to the ground, the weight sustained by the wheel will act perpendicularly upon the road; and however much that weight is increased, its action can have no tendency to derange the materials of which it is composed, but is rather calculated to consolidate them, and render the road more firm and durable.\n\n442. It was observed that concave wheels are more expensive than plane ones. This additional expense arises from the greater quantity of wood and workmanship which the former require; for in order that dishing wheels may be of the same perpendicular height as plane ones, the spokes of the former must exceed in length those of the latter, as much as the hypotenuse oA of the triangle oAn exceeds the side om; and therefore the weight and the resistance of such wheels must be proportionably great. The inclined spokes, too, cannot be formed nor inserted with such facility as perpendicular ones. The extremity of the spoke which is fixed into the nave is inserted at right angles to it, in the direction o p, and if the rims are cylindrical, the other spoke should be inserted in a similar manner; while the intermediate portion has an inclined position. There are therefore two flexures or bendings in the spokes of concave wheels, which requires them to be formed out of a larger piece of wood than if they had no such flexures, and renders them liable to be broken by any sudden strain at the points of flexure.\n\n443. We shall now dismiss the subject of concave wheels with one observation more, and we beg the reader's attention to it, because it appears to be decisive of the question. The obstacles which carriages have to encounter, are almost never spherical protuberances that permit the elevated wheel to resume by degrees its horizontal position. They are generally of such a nature, that the wheel is instantaneously precipitated from their top to the level ground. Now the momentum with which the wheel strikes the ground is very great, arising from a successive accumulation of force. The velocity of the elevated wheel is considerable when it reaches the top of the eminence, and while it is tumbling into the level ground, it is receiving gradually that proportion of the load which was transferred to the other wheel, till having recovered the whole, it impinges against the ground with great velocity and force. But in concave wheels the spoke which then strikes the ground is in its weakest position, and therefore much more liable to be broken by the impetus of the fall, than the spokes of the lowest wheel by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> transference of additional weight. Whereas, if the spokes be perpendicular to the nave, they receive this sudden shock in their strongest position, and are in no danger of giving way to the strain.\n\n444. In the preceding observations we have supposed the rims of the wheels to be cylindrical. In concave wheels, however, the rims are uniformly made of a conical form, as A r, B s, fig. 5, which not only increases the disadvantages which we have ascribed to them, but adds many more to the number. Mr Cumming, in a late Treatise on Wheel Carriages, solely devoted to the consideration of this single point, has shewn with great ability the disadvantages of conical rims, and the propriety of making them cylindrical; but we are of opinion that he has ascribed to conical rims several disadvantages which arise chiefly from an inclination of the spokes. He insists much upon the injury done to the roads by the use of conical rims; yet though we are convinced that they are more injurious to pavements and highways than cylindrical rims, we are equally convinced, that this injury is occasioned chiefly by the oblique pressure of the inclined spokes. The defects of conical rims are so numerous and palpable, that it is wonderful they should have been so long overlooked. Every cone that is put in motion upon a plane surface will revolve round its vertex, and if force is employed to confine it to a straight line, the smaller parts of the cone will be dragged along the ground and the friction greatly increased. Now when a carriage moves upon conical wheels, one part of the cone rolls while the other is dragged along, and though confined to a rectilineal direction by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> force, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> tendency to revolve round their vertex occasions a great and continued friction upon the linch pin, the shoulder of the axle-tree, and the sides of deep ruts.\n\n445. The shape of the wheels being thus determined, we must now attend to some particular parts of their construction. The iron plates of which the rims are composed should never be less than three inches in breadth, as narrow rims sink deep into the ground, and therefore injure the roads and fatigue the horses. Mr Walker, indeed, attempts to throw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> upon the act of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> which enjoined the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> wheels; but he does not assign any sufficient reason for his opinion, and ought to have known that several excellent and well devised experiments were lately instituted by Boulard and Margueron, which evince in the most satisfactory manner, the great utility of broad wheels. Upon this subject an observation occurs to us, which has not been generally attended to, and which appears to remove all the objections which can be urged against broad rims. When any load is supported upon two points, each point supports one half of the weight; if the points are increased to four, each will sustain one-fourth of the load, and so on; the pressure upon each point of support diminishing as the number of points increases. If a weight therefore is supported by a broad surface, the points of support are infinite in number, and each of them will bear an infinitely small portion of the load; and, in the same way, every finite portion of this surface will sustain a part of the weight inversely proportional to the number of similar portions which the surface contains. Let us now suppose that a cart carrying a load of sixteen hundred weight is supported upon wheels whose rims are four inches in breadth, and that one of the wheels passes over four stones, each of them an inch broad and equally high, and capable of being pulverized only by a pressure of four hundred pounds weight. Then as each wheel sustains one half of the load, and as the wheel which passes\nMechanics.\n\nOn the Line of Traction, and the Method by which Horses exert their strength.\n\n449. M. Camus attempted to show that the line of traction should always be parallel to the ground on which the carriage is moving, both because the horse can exert his greatest strength in this direction, and because the line of draught being perpendicular to the vertical spoke of the wheel, acts with the largest possible lever. M. Couplet, however, considering that the roads are never perfectly level, and that the wheels are constantly surmounting small eminences even in the best of roads, recommends the line of traction to be oblique to the horizon. By this means the line of draught (which is by far too much inclined in the figure) will in general be perpendicular to the lever AC which mounts the eminence, and will therefore act with the longest lever when there is the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for it. We ought to consider also, that when a horse pulls hard against any load, he always brings his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> nearer the ground, and therefore it follows, that if a horizontal line of traction be preferable to all others, the direction of the traces should be inclined to the horizon when the horse is at rest, in order that it may be horizontal when he lowers his breast and exerts his utmost force. The particular manner, however, in which living agents exert their strength against great loads, seems to have been unknown both to Camus and Couplet, and to many succeeding writers upon this subject. It is to M. Deparcieux, an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> and ingenious mechanic, that we are indebted for the only accurate information with which we are furnished; and we are sorry to see that philosophers who flourished after him have overlooked his important instructions. In his memoir on the draught of horses he has shewn in the most satisfactory manner, that animals draw by their weight, and not by the force of their muscles. In four-footed animals, the hinder feet is the fulcrum of the lever by which their weight acts against the load, and when the animal pulls hard, it depresses its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a> and thus increases the lever of its weight, and diminishes the lever by which the load resists its efforts. Thus, in fig. 6, let P be the load, AD the line of traction, and let us suppose FC to be the hinder leg of the horse, and AE part of its body, A its chest or centre of gravity, and CE the level road. Then AFC will represent the crooked lever by which the horse acts, which is equivalent to the straight one AC. But when the horse's weight acts downwards at A, so as to drag forward the rope AD and raise the load P, CE will represent the power of the lever in this position, or the lever of the horse's weight, and CF the lever by which it is resisted by the load, or the lever of resistance. Now if the horse lowers its centre of gravity A, which it always does when it pulls hard, it is evident that CE, the lever of its weight, will be increased, while CF the lever of its resistance will be diminished, for the line of traction AD will approach nearer to CE. Hence we see the great benefit which may be derived from large horses; for the lever AC necessarily increases with their size, and their power is always proportioned to the length of this lever, their weight remaining the same. Large horses, therefore, and other animals, will draw more than small ones, even though they have less muscular force,\n\nOn the Position of the Wheels.\n\n447. It must naturally occur to every person reflecting upon this subject, that the axle-trees should be straight and the wheels perfectly parallel, so that they may not be wider at their highest than at their lowest point, whether they are of a conical or a cylindrical form. In this country, however, the wheels are always made concave, and the ends of the axle-trees are universally bent downwards, in order to make them spread at the top and approach nearer below. In some carriages which we have examined, where the wheels were only four feet six inches in diameter, the distance of the wheels at top was fully six feet, and their distance below only four feet eight inches. By this foolish practice the very advantages which may be derived from the concavity of the wheels are completely taken away, while many of the disadvantages remain; more room is taken up in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COACH\">coach</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and the carriage is more liable to be overturned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of its base.\n\n448. With some mechanics it is a practice to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> the ends of the axle-trees forwards, and thus make the wheels wider behind than before. This blunder has been strenuously defended by Mr Henry Beighton, who maintains that wheels in this position are more favourable for turning, since, when the wheels are parallel, the outermost when turning would press against the hitch pin, and the innermost would rest against the shoulder of the axle-tree. In rectilineal motions, however, these converging wheels engender a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of friction both on the axle and the ground, and must therefore be more disadvantageous than parallel ones.\nMechanics.\n\nPractical force, and are unable to carry such a heavy burden. Mechanics. The force of the muscles tends only to make the horse carry continually forward his centre of gravity, or, in other words, the weight of the animal produces the draught, and the play and force of its muscles serve to continue it.\n\n450. From these remarks, then, we may deduce the proper position of the line of traction. When the line of traction is horizontal, as AD, the lever of resistance is CF; but if this line is oblique to the horizon, as A d, the lever of resistance is diminished to C f, while the lever of the horse's weight always remains the same. Hence it appears, that inclined traces are much more advantageous than horizontal ones, as they uniformly diminish the resistance to be overcome. Deparcieux, however, has investigated experimentally the most favourable angle of inclination, and found, that when the angle DAF made by the trace A d and a horizontal line is fourteen or fifteen degrees, the horses pulled with the greatest facility and force. This value of the angle of draught will require the weight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>-tree <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>, to which the traces are attached in four-wheeled carriages, to be one-half of the height of that part of the horse's breast to which the fore end of the trace is connected.\n\n451. When several horses are yoked in the same carriage as represented in fig. 7, and when the declivity changes, the length of the traces has a considerable influence upon the draught. From the point E where the traces are fastened to the horse next the load, draw ER to the same point in the second horse R, and let R' be another position of the second horse, it is required to find the difference of effect that will be produced by placing the second horse at R or at R', or the comparative advantages of short and long traces. From R', the point where the traces are fixed, draw R'F'E; and from E draw Em parallel to the declivity DA. Take EF = EF' to represent the power of the horse in the direction of the traces, which will be the same whether he is yoked at R or at R'; draw EA perpendicular to DA, F n, F'm parallel to EA, and F'\u03c6, F'f parallel to En. Then since the second horse when at R pulls with a force represented by FE, in the direction FE, we may resolve this force into two forces, En, Ef, one of which En is solely employed in dragging the cart, up the inclined plane DA, while the other Ef is solely employed in pressing the first horse E to the ground. Let the horse be now removed from R to R', the direction of the traces becomes RF'E, and F'E = PE is the power exerted by the horse at R' and the direction in which it is exerted. But this force is equivalent to the forces Em, Ef, the first of which acts directly against the load, while the other presses the horse against the ground. Hence we see the disadvantages of long traces, for the force which draws the load when the horse is at R' is to the force when the horse is at R, as Em to En, and the forces which press the horse upon the ground as Ef to E\u03c6, or as F'm to Fn. Now E\u03c6 = Fn = FE \u00d7 sin. n Ef; hence F'\u03c6 = FE \u00d7 sin. (n Eg - FE g') (g' being parallel to AB') and En = EF \u00d7 cos. (n Eg - F'E g'). In like manner we have Ef = FF' \u00d7 sin. (n Eg - F'E g'), and Em = EF \u00d7 cos. (n Eg - F'E g'). Now sin. F'E g' = sin. FE g = ER, and sin. FE g' = ER' = ER; but ER\n\n\\[ R'g' = BR - EQ = BR \\times \\cos. n Eg' = BR \\times \\text{Practical} (1 - \\cos. n Eg'). \\]\n\nBy substituting this value in the mechanic equations which contain the values of Ef, En, Ff, Em, and considering that the angles FE g', F'E g' are always so small that their arcs differ very little from their sines, we have\n\n\\[ FE g = \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\cos. n Eg}{ER}, \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ F'E g' = \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\cos. n Eg'}{ER'}. \\]\n\nBy substituting these values in the preceding equations, we have\n\n\\[ E\u03c6 = EF \\times \\sin. (n Eg - \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\cos. n Eg}{ER}), \\]\n\n\\[ Ef = EF \\times \\sin. (n Eg - \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\cos. n Eg'}{ER'}), \\]\n\n\\[ En = EF \\times \\cos. (n Eg - \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\cos. n Eg}{ER}), \\]\n\n\\[ Em = EF \\times \\cos. (n Eg - \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\cos. n Eg'}{ER'}). \\]\n\nIf AB is horizontal, and the declivity AD = 3\u00b0, we shall have n Eg = 9\u00b0 28', or in parts of the radius = 0.1652, and cos. n Eg = 0.98638. Then, if EF = 200 pounds, BR = 3 feet, ER = 8 feet, ER' = 12 feet, then we shall have from the preceding formulae, E\u03c6 = 31.716 pounds, Ef = 32.350 pounds, En = 197.470 pounds, and Em = 197.404. Hence an additional length of four feet to traces eight feet long, presses the horse E to the ground with an additional force of 32.250 - 31.716 = 0.534 pounds, and diminishes the effect of the other horse by 0.66 pounds.\n\nOn the Position of the Centre of Gravity, and the manner of disposing the load.\n\n452. If the axle-tree of a two-wheeled carriage pass through the centre of gravity of the load, the carriage will be in equilibrium in every position in which it can be placed with respect to the axle-tree; and in going up and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> hill the whole load will be sustained by the wheels, and will have no tendency either to press the horse to the ground or to raise him from it. But if the centre of gravity is above the axle-tree, as it must necessarily be, according to the present construction of wheel-carriages, a great part of the load will be thrown on the back of the horses from the wheels when going down a steep road, and thus tend to accelerate the motion of the carriage which the animal is striving to prevent; while, in ascending steep roads, a part of the load will be thrown behind the wheels, and tend to raise the horse from the ground, when there is the greatest necessity for some weight on his back to enable him to fix his feet in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and overcome the great resistance which is occasioned by the steepness of the road. On the contrary, if the centre of gravity is below the axle, the horse will be pressed to the ground in going up hill, and lifted from it when going down. In all these cases, therefore, where the centre of gravity is either on the axle-tree or directly above it or below,\nMechanics.\n\nIn some situations the animal will be lifted from the ground when there is the greatest necessity for his being pressed to it, and he will sometimes bear a great proportion of the load when he should rather be relieved of it.\n\n453. The only way of remedying these evils, is to assign such a position to the centre of gravity, that the horse may bear some portion of the weight when he must exert great force against the load, that is, in level ground, and when he is ascending steep roads; for no animal can pull with its greatest effort unless it is pressed to the ground.\u2014Now this may be in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> effected in the following manner. Let RCN be the wheel of a cart, AD one of the shafts, D that part of it where the cart is suspended on the back of the horse, and A the axle-tree; then, if the centre of gravity of the load is placed at m, a point equidistant from the two wheels, but below the line DA, and before the axle-tree,\u2014the horse will bear a certain weight on level ground,\u2014a greater weight when he is going up hill and has more occasion for it, and less weight when he is going down hill, and does not require to be pressed to the ground: All this will be evident from the figure.\u2014When we recollect that the shaft DA is horizontal, the centre of gravity will press more upon the point of suspension D the nearer it comes to it; or the pressure upon D, or the horse\u2019s back, will be proportional to the distance of the centre of gravity from A. If m, therefore, be the centre of gravity, b A will represent its pressure upon D, when the shaft DA is horizontal. When the cart is ascending a steep road, AH will be the position of the shaft, the centre of gravity will be raised to a, and a A will be the pressure upon D. But if the cart is going down hill, AC will be the position of the shaft, the centre of gravity will be depressed to n, and c A will represent the pressure upon the horse\u2019s back. The weight sustained by the horse, therefore, is properly regulated by placing the centre of gravity at m. We have still, however, to determine the proper length of b a and b m, the distance of the centre of gravity from the axle, and from the horizontal line DA; but as these depend upon the nature and inclination of the roads, upon the length of the shaft DA, which depends on the size of the horse, on the magnitude of the load, and on other variable circumstances, it would be impossible to fix their value.\u2014If the load, along with the cart, weighs 400 pounds; if the distance DA be eight feet, and if the horse should bear 50 pounds of the weight, then b A should be one foot, which, being one-eighth of DA, will make the pressure upon D exactly 50 pounds. If the road slopes four inches in a foot, b m must be four inches, or the angle b A m should be equal to the inclination of the road; for then the point m will rise to a when ascending such a road, and will press with its greatest force on the back of the horse.\n\n454. When carts are not made in this manner, we may, in some degree obtain the same end by judiciously disposing the load. Let us suppose that the centre of gravity is at O when the cart is loaded with homogeneous materials, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, lime, &c. then if the load is to consist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> substances, or bodies of different weights, we should place the heaviest at the bottom and nearest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, which will not only lower the point o, but will bring it forward, and practically nearer the proper position m. Part of the load, too, might be suspended below the fore part of the carriage in dry weather, and the centre of gravity would approach still nearer the point m. When the point m is thus depressed, the weight on the horse is not only judiciously regulated, but the cart would be prevented from overturning; and in rugged roads the weight sustained by each wheel would be in a great degree equalised.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> of different Carriages.\n\n455. In figure 8, is represented a carriage invented Carriages by Mr Richard, a physician in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROCHELLE\">Rochelle</a>, which moves that move without horses, merely by the exertion of the passengers\u2019 legs. The machinery by which this is effected is placed in a Fig. 5. box behind the carriage, and is shewn in figure 9, where AA is a small axis fixed into the box, and B a pulley over which a rope passes whose two extremities are tied to the ends of the levers or treddles C, D: the other ends of the levers are fixed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> to the cross Fig. 9, beam MF. The cranks FF are fixed to the axle KL, and move upon it as a centre. Each of them has a detent tooth at F which catches in the teeth of the wheels II, H, so that they can move from F to H without moving the wheel, but the detent tooth catches in the teeth of the wheels when the cranks are brought backward, and therefore bring the wheel along with them. When the foot of the passenger, therefore, is placed upon the treddle D, it brings down the crank F and along with it the wheel H, so that the large wheels fixed on the same axis perform part of a revolution; but when D is depressed, the rope DA descends, the extremity C of the other treddle rises, and the crank F rising along with it, takes into the teeth of the wheel H, so that when the elevated treddle C is depressed, the wheels II, H, and consequently the wheels I, I, perform another part of a revolution. In this way, by continuing to work at the treddles, the machine advances with a regular pace.\n\n456. A carriage of this kind, where the mechanism is much more simple and beautiful than that which we have described, has been lately invented and constructed by Mr Nasmyth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> whose mechanical genius is scarcely inferior to his talents as a painter. The pulley B and axle AA, are rendered unnecessary; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> straps are substituted in place of the cranks F, F, and the whole mechanism is contained in two small cylindrical boxes about six inches in diameter, and one and a half broad.\n\n457. A carriage driven by the action of the wind is Fig. 10. exhibited in fig. 10. It is fixed on four wheels, and moved by the impulse of the wind upon the sails C, D, being guided by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDDER\">rudder</a> E. Carriages of this kind will answer very well in a level country where the roads are good and the wind fair; and are said to be much used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>.

Others say, he fell in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> with a young woman of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of a painter, and they allege that love alone wrought the miracle, as he could have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> prospect of obtaining her except by a distinguished merit in the profession of painting: for which reason he applied himself with incessant labour to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> and practise the art, till he became so eminent as to be entitled to demand her in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, and he succeeded. Whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> may be in either of these accounts, it is certain that he appeared to have an uncommon genius; his manner was singular, not resembling the manner of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>; and his pictures were strongly coloured and carefully finished, but yet they are somewhat dry and hard. By many competent\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENT\">tent</a> judges it was believed, when they observed the strength of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> in some of his compositions, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he had studied in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> to acquire some knowledge of the antiques and the great masters of the Roman school, he would have proved one of the most eminent painters of the Low Countries. But he only imitated ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and seemed more inclined, or at least more qualified, to imitate the defects than the beauties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.

It was written, according to the testimony of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> or Syriac <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>; but the Greek version, which now passes for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, is as old as the apostolical times.\n\nSt Matthew the Evangelist's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">Day</a>, a festival of the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, observed on September 21st.\n\nSt Matthew, the son of Alpheus, was also called Levi. He was of a Jewish original, as both his names discover, and probably Galilean. Before his call to the apostolate, he was a publican or toll-gatherer to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, an office of bad repute among the Jews, on account of the covetousness and exaction of Matthew, those who managed it; St Matthew's office particularly consisting in gathering the customs of all merchandise that came by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> of Galilee, and the tribute that passengers were to pay who went by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. And here it was that Matthew sat at the receipt of customs, when our Saviour called him to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a>. It is probable, that, living at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPERNAUM\">Capernaum</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of Christ's usual residence, he might have some knowledge of him before he was called. Matthew immediately expressed his satisfaction in being called to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, by entertaining our Saviour and his disciples at a great dinner at his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, whither he invited all his friends, especially those of his own profession, hoping, probably, that they might be influenced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> and conversation of Christ. St Matthew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> with the rest of the apostles till after our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>'s ascension. For the first eight years afterwards, he preached in Judea. Then he betook himself to propagating the gospel among the Gentiles, and chose Ethiopia as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of his apostolical ministry; where it is said he suffered martyrdom, but by what kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> is altogether uncertain. It is pretended, but without any foundation, that Hyrtaeus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Ethiopia, desiring to marry Iphigenia, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> and predecessor \u00c6gillus, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> having represented to him that he could not lawfully do it, the enraged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> ordered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> immediately to be cut off.

See the Acts of the Apostles, chap. i. There was a gospel published under Matthias's name, but rejected as spurious; as likewise some traditions, which met with the same fate.\n\nSt Matthias's Day, a festival of the Christian church, observed on the 24th of February. St Matthias was an apostle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ, but not of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the twelve chosen by Christ himself. He obtained this high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> upon a vacancy made in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of the apostles by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a> and death of Judas Iscariot.

Matthias was qualified for the apostleship, by having been a constant attendant upon our Saviour all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his ministry. He was, probably, one of the 70 disciples. After our Lord's resurrection, he preached the gospel first in Judea. Afterwards\nAfterwards it is probable he travelled eastward, his residence being principally near the irruption of the river Apsarus and the haven Hyssus. The barbarous people treated him with great rudeness and inhumanity; and, after many labours and sufferings in converting great numbers to Christianity, he obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of martyrdom; but by what kind of death, is uncertain.\u2014They pretend to show the relics of St Matthias at Rome; and the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a> of St Matthias near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREVES\">Treves</a> boasts of the same advantage; but doubtless both without any foundation.

In order to make himself known, he began in 1749 to publish in French an account of the productions of the English press, printed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAGUE\">Hague</a> under the name of the Journal Britannique. This journal, which continues to hold its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> amongst the best of those which have appeared since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of Bayle, answered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> end he intended by it, and introduced him to the acquaintance of some of the most respectable literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> he had made his own. It was to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and uninterrupted friendship he owed the places he afterwards possessed. In 1758 he was chosen fellow, and in 1765, on the resignation of Dr Birch, who died a few months after, and had made him his executor, secretary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>. He had been appointed one of the under librarians of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">museum</a> at its first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> in 1753, and became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> librarian at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIGHT\">Knight</a> in 1772. Useful in all these situations, he promised to be eminently so in the last, when he was seized with a languishing disorder, which in 1776 put an end to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> which had been uniformly devoted to the pursuit of science and the offices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>.

In 1776 he also succeeded his father in the office of secretary to the Royal Society. On the disputes respecting the reinstatement of Dr Hutton in the department of secretary for foreign correspondence in 1784, Mr Maty took a warm and distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, and resigned the office of secretary; after which he undertook to assist gentlemen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> ladies in perfecting their knowledge of the Greek, Latin, French, and Italian classics. Mr Maty was a thinking conscientious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; and having conceived some doubts about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> he had subscribed in early life, he never could be prevailed upon to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> himself in the way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> preferment, though his connexions were amongst those who could have served him essentially in this point; and soon after his father's death he withdrew himself from ministering in the established church, his reasons for which he published in the 47th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Gent. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, p. 466. His whole life was thenceforwards taken up in literary pursuits.

In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1782 he set on foot a Review of publications, principally foreign, which he carried on, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to himself and satisfaction to the public, for near five years, when he was obliged to discontinue it from ill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>.

He first served in the Grey musqueteers; but in the year 1720, his father purchased for him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of cavalry in the regiment of La Rocheboyon. He remained but five years in the army, during which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he pursued his mathematical studies with great vigour; and it was soon remarked by M. Freret and other academicians, that nothing but geometry could satisfy his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> and unbounded thirst for knowledge. In the year 1723, he was received into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy of Sciences, and read his first performance, which was a memoir upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> and form of musical instruments, November 15, 1724. During the first years of his admission, he did not wholly confine his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>; he dived into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> philosophy, and discovered great knowledge and dexterity in observations and experiments upon animals. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of travelling into remote climates, like the sages of antiquity, in order to be initiated into the learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of those times had still subsisted, no one would have conformed to it with greater eagerness than M. de Maupertuis. His first gratification of this passion was to visit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> which had given birth to Newton; and during his residence at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> he became as zealous an admirer and follower of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> as any one of his own countrymen. His next excursion was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, where he formed a friendship with the famous John Bernouilli and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. At his return to Paris, he applied himself to his favourite studies with greater zeal than ever:\u2014And how well he fulfilled the duties of an academician, may be gathered by running over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> of the academy from the year 1724 to 1736; where it appears that he was neither idle nor occupied by objects of small importance. The most sublime questions in geometry and the relative sciences received from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> that elegance, clearness, and precision, so remarkable in all his writings. In the year 1736, he was sent by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of France to the polar circle to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, in order to ascertain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, accompanied by Messrs Clairault, Camus, Le Monnier, l'Abbe Outhier, and Celsius the celebrated professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> at Upsal. This distinction rendered him so famous, that at his return he was admitted a member of almost every academy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\n\nIn the year 1740 Maupertuis had an invitation from the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a> to go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>; which was too flattering to be refused. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> among men of letters had not wholly effaced his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> for his first profession, namely that of arms. He followed his Prussian majesty into the field, and was a witness of the dispositions and operations that preceded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Molwitz; but was deprived of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of being present, when victory declared in favour of his royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>, by a singular kind of adventure. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, running away with him, he fell into the hands of the enemy; and was at first but roughly treated by the Austrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, to whom he could not make himself known for want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>; but being carried prisoner to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, he received such honours from their Imperial Majesties as were never effaced from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>. From Vienna he returned to Berlin; but as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> of the academy which the king of Prussia then meditated was not yet mature, he went again to Paris, where his affairs called him, and was chosen in 1742 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a> of the Academy of Sciences. In 1753 he was received into the French academy; which was the first instance of the same person being a member of both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a> at Paris at the same time. M. de Maupertuis again assumed the soldier at the siege of Fribourg, and was pitched upon by Marshal Cogny and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> d'Argenson to carry the news to the French king of the surrender of that citadel.\n\nHe returned to Berlin in the year 1744, when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> was negotiated and brought about by the good offices of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>-mother, between our author and Mademoiselle de Boreck, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and merit, and nearly related to M. de Boreck, at that time minister of state. This determined him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> at Berlin, as he was extremely attached to his new spouse, and regarded this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> as the most fortunate circumstance of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>.\n\nIn the year 1746, M. de Maupertuis was declared by his Prussian majesty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and soon after by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> was honoured with the order of Merit: However, all these accumulated honours and advantages, so far from lessening his ardour for the sciences, seemed to furnish new allurements to labour and application. Not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> passed but he produced some new project <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> for the advancement of knowledge. Nor did he confine himself to mathematical studies only: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a>, polite literature, all shared his attention, and contributed to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>. At the same time, he had, it seems, a strange inquietude of spirit, with a morose temper, which rendered him miserable amidst honours and pleasures.\u2014Such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a> did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> a very pacific life, and he was engaged in several quarrels. He had...\nMaupertuis, a quarrel with Koenig the professor of philosophy at Franeker, and another more terrible with Voltaire. Maupertuis had inserted into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin for 1746, a discourse upon the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; which Koenig was not content with attacking, but attributed to Leibnitz. Maupertuis, stung with the imputation of plagiarism, engaged the academy of Berlin to call upon him for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>; which Koenig failing to produce, he was struck out of the academy, of which he was a member. Several pamphlets were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this; and Voltaire, for some reason or other, engaged against Maupertuis. We say, for some reason or other; because Maupertuis and Voltaire were apparently upon the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMICABLE\">amicable</a> terms; and the latter respected the former as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> in the mathematics. Voltaire, however, exerted all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and satire against him; and on the whole was so much transported beyond what was thought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, that he found it expedient in 1753 to quit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Prussia.\n\nOur philosopher's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been considerably impaired by the great fatigues of various kinds in which his active mind had involved him; though from the amazing hardships he had undergone in his northern expedition, most of his future bodily sufferings may be traced. The intense sharpness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a> could only be supported by means of strong liquors, which served to increase his disorder, and bring on a spitting of blood, which began at least 12 years before he died. Yet still his mind seemed to enjoy the greatest vigour; for the best of his writings were produced, and most sublime <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> developed, during the time of his confinement by sickness, when he was unable to occupy his presidial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> at the academy. He took several journeys to St Malo, during the last years of his life, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>: And though he always received benefit by breathing his native air, yet still, upon his return to Berlin, his disorder likewise returned with greater violence.\u2014His last journey into France was undertaken in the year 1757; when he was obliged, soon after his arrival there, to quit his favourite retreat at St Malo, on account of the danger, and confusion which that town was thrown into by the arrival of the English in its neighbourhood. From thence he went to Bordeaux, hoping there to meet with a neutral ship to carry him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMBURG\">Hamburg</a>, in his way back to Berlin; but being disappointed in that hope, he went to Thoulouse, where he remained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> months. He had then thoughts of going to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, in hopes a milder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> would restore him to health; but finding himself grow worse, he rather inclined towards Germany, and went to Neufchatel, where for three months he enjoyed the conversation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Marischal, with whom he had formerly been much connected. At length he arrived at Basil, October 16, 1758, where he was received by his friend Bernouilli and his family with the utmost tenderness and affection. He at first found himself much better here than he had been at Neufchatel; but this amendment was of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>; for as the winter approached, his disorder returned, accompanied by new and more alarming symptoms. He languished here many months during which he was attended by M. de la Condamin; and died in 1759.\n\nHe wrote in French, 1. The figure of the earth determined. 2.

But this life is considered as apocryphal. In rejecting it, however, as well as the circumstances of the mission, we must beware of denying the mission itself. It is certain that it was believed in France as early as the 9th century; and notwithstanding the silence of Bede, Gregory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOURS\">Tours</a>, and others, there are several documents which prove this, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> at least render it extremely probable. A celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEDICTINES\">Benedictines</a>, took the name of St Maur in the beginning of the last century, and received the sanction of Pope Gregory XV. in 1621. This society was early distinguished by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and the knowledge of its members, and it still supports the character. There are, perhaps, fewer eminent men in it than formerly; but this may be ascribed to the levity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and partly to the little encouragement for the researches of learned men. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> persons of ingenuity which this society has produced are, the Fathers Menard, d'Acheri, Mabillon, Ruinart, Germain, Lami, Montfaucon, Martin, Vaissette, le No\u00fcrr, Martianay, Martonne, Massuet, &c. &c.

It was sent by DIOCLESIAN to check the Bagaudae, who had excited some disturbances in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>. Maurice having carried his troops over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Maximilian commanded him to employ his utmost exertions to extirpate Christianity.

The emperor, enraged at their opposition, commanded the legion to be decimated; and when they still declared\nMaurice declared that they would sooner die than do anything prejudicial to the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, every tenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of those who remained was put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Their perseverance excited the emperor to still greater cruelty; for when he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> that nothing could make them relinquish their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, he commanded his troops to surround them, and cut them to pieces. Maurice, the commander of these Christian heroes, and Exuperus and Candidus, officers of the legion, who had chiefly instigated the soldiers to this noble resistance, signalized themselves by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the doctrines of the Christian religion. They were massacred, it is believed, at Agaune, in Chablais, the 22d of September 286.\n\nNotwithstanding many proofs which support this transaction, Dubordier, Hottinger, Moyle, Burnet, and Mosheim, are disposed to deny the fact. It is defended, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, by Hicks an English writer, and by Dom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISLE\">Lisle</a> a Benedictine monk de la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a> de Saint Vannes, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of his, entitled Defense de la Verite du Martyre de la Legion Thebienne, 1737. In defense of the same fact, the reader may consult Historia de S. Mauritie, by P. Rosignole a Jesuit, and the Acta Sanctorum for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of September. The martyrdom of this legion, written by St Eucherius bishop of Lyons, was transmitted to posterity in a very imperfect manner by Surius. P. Chiflet a Jesuit, discovered, and gave to the public, an exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of this work. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Ruinart maintains, that it has every mark of authenticity. St Maurice is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of a celebrated order in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDINIA\">Sardinia</a>'s dominions, created by Emanuel Phillibert <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Savoy, to reward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> merit, and approved by Gregory XIII. in 1572. The commander of the Theban legion must not be confounded with another St Maurice, mentioned by Theodoret, who suffered martyrdom at Apamea in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>.\n\nMaurice, (Mauritius Tiberius), was born at Arassus in Cappadocia, A.D. 539. He was descended from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. After he had filled several offices in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Tiberius Constantine, he obtained the command of his armies against the Persians. His gallantry was so conspicuous that the emperor gave him his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> Constantina in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, and invested him with the purple the 13th August 582. The Persians still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to make inroads on the Roman territories, and Maurice sent Philippicus, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, against them. This general conducted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with various success. At first he gained several splendid victories, but he did not continue to have a decided superiority. As there was a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> for soldiers in these unfortunate times, the emperor issued a mandate in 592, forbidding any soldier to become a monk till he had accomplished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of his military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. Maurice acquired much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> in restoring Chosroes II. king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, to the throne, after he had been deposed by his subjects. The empire was in his reign harassed by the frequent inroads of the Arabian tribes. He purchased peace from them, by granting them a pension nearly equal to 100,000 crowns; but these barbarians took frequent opportunities to renew the war. In different engagements the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> destroyed 50,000, and took 17,000 prisoners. These were restored, on condition that the king of the Abari should return all the Roman captives in his dominions. Maurice, regardless of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, he demanded a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RANSOM\">ransom</a> of 10,000 crowns. Maurice, full of indignation, refused the sum; and the barbarian, equally enraged, put the captives to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>. While the emperor, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> this cruelty, was making preparations against the Abari, Phocas, who from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CENTURION\">centurion</a> had attained the highest military preferment, assumed the purple, and was declared emperor. He pursued Maurice to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHALCEDON\">Chalcedon</a>, took him prisoner, and condemned him to die. The five sons of this unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> were massacred before his eyes, and Maurice, humbling himself under the hand of God, was heard to exclaim, Thou art <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, O <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>, and thy judgments are without partiality. He was beheaded on the 26th November 602, in the 63d year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> and 20th of his reign. Many writers have estimated the character of this prince by his misfortunes instead of his actions. They believed him guilty without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, and condemned him without reason. It cannot be denied, however, that he allowed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> to be harassed; but he was a father to the rest of the empire. He restored the military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, humbled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of his enemies, supported the Christian religion by his laws, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> by his example. He loved the sciences, and was the patron of learned men.\n\nMaurice, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, son of Henry le Pieux, was born A.D. 1521. He was early remarkable for his courage, and during his whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> he was engaged in warlike pursuits. He served under the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> of 1544 against France; and in the year following against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> of Smalkalde; with which, although a Protestant, he would have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> manner of connexion. The emperor, as a reward for his services, in the year 1547, made him elector of Saxony, having deprived his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a> John Frederick of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELECTORATE\">electorate</a>. Ambition had led him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> the views of Charles, in the hope of being elector, and ambition again detached him from that prince. In 1551 he entered into a league against the emperor, together with the elector of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDENBURG\">Brandenburg</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Palatine, the duke of Wurttemburg, and many other princes. This league, encouraged by the young and enterprising Henry II. of France, was more dangerous than that of Smalkalde. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> was the deliverance of the landgrave of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESSE\">Hesse</a>, whom the emperor kept prisoner. Maurice and the confederates marched, in 1552, to the defiles of Tyrol, and put to flight the Imperial troops who guarded them. The emperor and his brother Ferdinand narrowly escaped, and fled from the conquerors in great disorder. Charles having retired into Passau, where he had collected an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, brought the princes of the league to terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>. By the famous peace of Passau, which was finally ratified the 12th of August 1552, the emperor granted an amnesty without exception to all those who had carried arms against him from the year 1546. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> not only obtained the free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of their religion, but they were admitted into the imperial chamber, from which they had been excluded since the victory of Mulberg. Maurice soon after united himself with the emperor against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MARGRAVE\">margrave</a> of Brandenburg, who laid waste the German provinces. He engaged him in 1553, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a>-\nMaurice, ed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Sivershausen, and died of the wounds he had received in the engagement two days after. He was one of the greatest protectors of the Lutherans in Germany, and a prince equally brave and politic. After he had profited by the spoils of John Frederick, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of the Protestants, he became himself the leader of the party, and by these means maintained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> of power against the emperor in Germany.\n\nMaurice de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NASSAU\">Nassau</a>, Prince of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>, succeeded to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the Low Countries after the death of his father William, who was killed in 1584 by the fanatic Gerard. The young prince was then only eighteen years of age, but his courage and abilities were above his years. He was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> general of the United Provinces, and he reared that edifice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of which his father had laid the foundation. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREDA\">Breda</a> submitted to him in 1590; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZUTPHEN\">Zutphen</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVENTER\">Deventer</a>, Hulst, Nimoguen, in 1591. He gained several important advantages in 1592, and in the year following he made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of Gorinburg. When he had performed these splendid services, he returned to the Low Countries by the way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZEALAND\">Zealand</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> was attacked by a dreadful tempest, in which he lost forty vessels, and he himself had very nearly perished. His death would have been considered by the Hollanders as a much greater calamity than the loss of their vessels. They watched over his safety with exceeding care. In 1594, one of his guards was accused of an intention to take away his life; and it was generally believed that he was bribed to this service by the enemies of the republic. He fell a sacrifice at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUGES\">Bruges</a>, either to his own fanaticism <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to the jealous anxiety of the friends of Maurice. The prince of Orange, increasing in reputation, defeated the troops of the archduke Albert in 1597, and drove the Spaniards entirely out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>. In 1600 he was obliged to raise the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUNKIRK\">Dunkirk</a>; but he took ample vengeance on Albert, whom he again defeated in a pitched battle near Nieuport. Before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, this great general sent back the ships which had brought his troops into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>: My brethren (said he to his army), we must conquer the enemy or drink up the waters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. Determine for yourselves; I have determined I shall either conquer by your bravery, or I shall never survive the disgrace of being conquered by men in every respect our inferiors. This speech elevated the soldiers to the highest pitch of enthusiasm, and the victory was complete. Rhinberg, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">Grave</a>, and Ecluse, cities in Flanders, submitted to the conqueror the following year. Maurice, however, not only laboured for the commonwealth, but also for himself. He coveted the sovereignty of Holland, and was opposed in the prosecution of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> by the pensioner Barneveldt. The zeal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of this wise republican cost him his life. He was an Arminian; and at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> Maurice defended Gomar against Arminius.\u2014Taking advantage of the general odium under which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMINIANS\">Arminians</a> lay, he found means to get Barneveldt condemned in 1619. His death, wholly owing to the cruel ambition of the Prince of Orange, made a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the minds of the Hollanders. The truce with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> being expired, Spinola laid siege to Breda in 1624, and in six months, by the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of his great talents, though with great slaughter of his troops, he took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. The prince of Maurice, Orange, unsuccessful in every attempt to raise the Mauritanian siege, died of vexation in 1625, aged 55 years, with the reputation of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a> of his time.\n\n\"The life of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STADTHOLDER\">stadtholder</a> (says the abbe Raynal) was almost an uninterrupted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of battles, of sieges, and of victories. Of moderate abilities in every thing else, he shone conspicuous in his military capacity. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> was the school of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; and those who received their military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> in his armies augmented, perhaps, the glory of their master. Like Montecucculi, he discovered inimitable skill in his marches and encampments; like Vauban, he possessed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> of fortifying places, and of rendering them impregnable; like Eugene, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> of finding subsistence for great armies in countries barren by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, or ravaged by war; like Vendome, the happy talent of calling forth, in the moment they became necessary, greater exertions from his soldiers than could reasonably be expected; like Cond\u00e9, that infallible quickness of eye which decides the fortune of battles; like Charles XII., the art of rendering his troops almost invincible to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, and fatigue; like Turenne, the secret of making war with the least possible expense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> blood.\" The Chevalier Folard maintains, that Maurice was the greatest commander of infantry since the time of the Romans. He studied the military art of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, and applied their rules with great exactness in the various occurrences of war. He not only took advantage of the inventions of others, but he enriched the science of war with several improvements. Telescopes were first used by him for a military purpose; and, besides a kind of gallery in conducting a siege, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of blockading a strong place, which were of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, he greatly improved the whole art by his method of pushing an attack with great vigour, and of defending, for the greatest length of time, and in the best manner, a place besieged. In short, the many useful things which he practised or invented, placed him in the highest rank among men of a military character. On one occasion, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> asked him, Who was the first general of the age? Spinola (replied he) is the second. It was his constant practice, during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, to have two guards placed by his bedside, not only to defend him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of danger, but to awake him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> there should be the least occasion. The war betwixt Spain and Holland was never carried on with greater keenness and animosity than during his administration.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> Signior, hearing of the vast torrents of blood shed in this contest, thought that a great empire must depend on the decision. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of so many battles was pointed out to him on a map, and he said coldly, If it were my business, I would send my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIONEERS\">pioneers</a>, and order them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> this little corner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> into the sea. Maurice, like many great men, was impatient under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>, and too much devoted to women. He was succeeded by Frederick Henry his brother.","sp":29,"ep":31},{"h":"MAURICEAU","t":"Francis, a French surgeon, who applied himself with great success and reputation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> and practice of his art for several years at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. Afterwards he confined himself to the disorders of pregnant and lying-in-women, and was at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of all the operators in this way.

It is probable, however, that this country, or at least great part of it, was first called Phut, since it appears from Pliny, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, and St Jerome, that a river and territory not far from Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATLAS\">Atlas</a> went by that name. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a> Targum it likewise appears, that part of the Mauri may be deemed the offspring of Lud the son of Misraim, since his descendants, mentioned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENESIS\">Genesis</a> x., are there called \u05de\u05b4\u05e6\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd Mauri, or Mauritani. It is certain, that this region, as well as the others to the eastward of it, had many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> planted in it by the Phoenicians. Procopius tells us, that in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> two pillars of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> were to be seen there, with the following inscription in the Phoenician <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> and character upon them: \"We are the Canaanites, that fled from Joshua the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUN\">Nun</a>, that notorious robber,\" Ibnu Rachi, or Ibnu Raguz, an African writer cited by Leo, together with Evagrius and Nicephorus Callistus, assert the same thing.\n\nThe Mauritians, according to Ptolemy, were divided into several cantons or tribes. The Metagonitae were seated near the straits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, now those of Gibraltar. The Saccosii, or Cocossii, occupied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of the Iberian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. Under these two petty nations the Musices, Vercues, and Verbicea or Vercicea, were settled. The Salisea or Salinse, were situated lower, towards the ocean; and, still more to the south, the Volubiliani. The Mauritensii and Herpiditani possessed the eastern part of this country, which was terminated by the Mulucha. The Angacauani, or Jangacauani, Nectiberes, Zogrensis, Baninbea, and Faucaule, extended themselves from the southern foot of Ptolemy's Atlas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a> to his Atlas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a>. Pliny mentions the Baninurea, whom Father Hardouin takes to be Ptolemy's Baninube; and Mela the Atlantes, whom he represents as possessed of the western part of this district.\n\nThe earliest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of Mauritania mentioned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEPTUNE\">Neptune</a>; and next to him were Atlas and Antaeus his two sons, both famous in the Grecian fables on account of their wars with Hercules. Antaeus, in his contention with that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>, seems to have behaved with great bravery and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>. Having received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> reinforcements of Libyan troops, he cut off great numbers of Hercules's men. But that celebrated commander, having at last intercepted a strong body of Libyans sent to the relief of Antaeus, gave him a total overthrow, wherein both he and the best part of his forces were put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>. This decisive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> put Hercules in possession of Libya and Mauritania, and consequently of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> of all these kingdoms. Hence came the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>, that Hercules, finding Antaeus, a giant of an enormous size with whom he was engaged in single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>, to receive fresh strength as often as he touched his mother <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> when thrown upon her, at last lifted him up in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a> and squeezed him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Hence likewise may be deduced the fable intimating that Hercules took the globe from Atlas upon his own shoulders, overcame the dragon that guarded the orchards of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HESPERIDES\">Hesperides</a>, and made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>-Mauritanian fruit there. Bochart thinks that the fable alluded chiefly to naval engagements, wherein Hercules, for the most part, was victorious; though Antaeus from time to time received succours by sea. But at last Hercules, coming up with one of his squadrons which had a strong reinforcement on board, made himself master of it, and thus rendered Antaeus incapable for the future of making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> against him. The same author likewise insinuates, that the notion of Antaeus's gigantic stature prevailing for so many centuries amongst the Tingitanians, pointed out the size of the vessels of which his fleets and squadrons were composed. As for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> apples so frequently mentioned by the old mythologists, they were the treasures that fell into Hercules's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> upon the defeat of Antaeus; the Greeks giving the oriental word \u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u1fe6 riches, the signification affixed to their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1 apples.\n\nWith regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> in which Atlas and Antaeus lived, the most probable supposition seems to be that of Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton. According to that illustrious author, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMMON\">Ammon</a> the father of Sesae was the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Libya, or that vast tract extending from the borders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> to the Atlantic ocean; the conquest of which country was effected by Sesae in his father's lifetime. Neptune afterwards excited the Libyans to a rebellion against Sesae, and slew him; and then invaded Egypt under the command of Atlas or Antaeus, the son of Neptune, Sesae's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a>. Not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after, Hercules, the general of Thebais and Ethiopia for the gods or great men of Egypt, reduced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time the whole continent of Libya, having overthrown and slain Antaeus near a town in Thebais, from that event called Antea or Antaeopolis: this, we say, is the notion advanced by Sir Isaac Newton, who endeavours to prove, that the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Libya, by Sesae, happened a little above a thousand years before the birth of Christ, as the last, by Hercules, did some few years after. Now, though we do not pretend to adopt every particular circumstance of Sir Isaac Newton's system, yet we cannot forbear observing, that it appears undeniably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> from Scripture, that neither the western extremity of Libya, nor even the other parts of that region, could possibly have been so well peopled before the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>, as to have sent a numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> to invade Egypt. For Egypt and Phoenicia, from whence the greatest part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> of the Libyans came, and which were much nearer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> from whence the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a> of mankind was made, could not themselves have been greatly overstocked with inhabitants any considerable time before the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAUL\">Saul</a>. And that such an invasion happened in the reign of Neptune, or at least of his son Antaeus, has been most fully evinced by this most excellent chronologer.\n\nFrom the defeat of Antaeus, nothing remarkable occurs in the history of Mauritania till the times of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who at last brought the whole kingdom under their jurisdiction; for which see the article Rome. 1. With regard to the customs, &c. of this people, it would seem, from what Hyginus insinuates, that they fought only with clubs, till one Belus, the son of Neptune, as that author calls him, taught them\nthem the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the sword. Sir Isaac Newton makes this Belus to have been the same person with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SESOSTRIS\">Sesostris</a> king of Egypt, who overran a great part of the then known world. 2. All persons of distinction in Mauritania went richly attired, wearing much gold and silver in their clothes. They took great pains in cleansing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, and curled their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> in a curious and elegant manner. They combed their beards, which were very long, and always had their nails pared extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>. When they walked out in any numbers, they never touched one another, for fear of disconcerting the curls into which their hair had been formed. 3. The Mauritanian infantry, in time of action, used shields made of elephants skins, being clad in those of lions, leopards, and bears, which they kept on both night and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. 4. The cavalry of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> was armed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> short lances, and carried targets or bucklers, made likewise of the skins of wild beasts. They used <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> saddles. Their horses were small and swift, had wooden collars about their necks, and were so much under the command of their riders, that they would follow them like dogs. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of these horsemen was not much different from that of the foot above mentioned, they constantly wearing a large tunic of the skins of wild beasts. The Phutaei, of whom the Mauritanians were a branch, were eminent for their shields, and the excellent use they made of them, as we learn from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, Xenophon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>, and Scripture. Nay, Herodotus seems to intimate, that the shield and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HELMET\">helmet</a> came from them to the Greeks. 5. Notwithstanding the fertility of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, the poorer sort of the Mauritanians never took care to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> the ground, being strangers to the art of husbandry; but roved about the country in a wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> manner, like the ancient Scythians or Arabes Scenitea. They had tents, or mapalia, so extremely small, that they could scarce breathe in them. Their food was corn, herbage, &c. which they frequently did eat green, without any manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, being destitute of wine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, and all the elegancies as well as many necessaries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Their habit was the same both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> and winter, consisting chiefly of an old tattered, though thick garment, and over it a coarse rough tunic; which answered probably to that of their neighbours the Numidians. Most of them lay every night upon the bare ground; though some of them strewed their garments thereon, not unlike the present African Kabyles and Arabs, who, according to Dr Shaw, use their lykes for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> and covering in the night. 6. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the most approved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of Horace may be admitted, the Mauritanians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> poisoned arrows; which clearly intimates, that they had some skill in the art of preparing poisons, and were excellent dartmen. This last observation is countenanced by Herodian and \u00c6lian, who entirely come into it, affirming them to have been in such continual danger of being devoured by wild beasts, that they durst not stir out of their tents or mapalia without their darts. Such perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> must render them exceedingly skilful in hurling that weapon. 7. The Mauritanians sacrificed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> victims to their deities, as the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, &c. did.\n\nThe country people were extremely rude and barbarous; but those inhabiting cities must undoubtedly have had at least some smattering in the literature of the several nations they deduced their origin from. That Mauritania the Mauritanians had some knowledge in naval affairs, seems probable, not only from the intercourse they had with the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, as well as the situation of their country; but likewise from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORPHEUS\">Orpheus</a>, or Onomacritus, who asserts them to have made a settlement at the entrance into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLCHIS\">Colchis</a>, to which place they came by sea. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGIC\">Magic</a>, sorcery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>, &c. they appear to have applied themselves to in very early times. Cicero and Pliny say, that Atlas was the inventor of astrology, and the doctrine of the sphere, i.e. he first introduced them into Mauritania. This, according to Diodorus Siculus, gave rise to the fable of Atlas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the heavens upon his shoulders.

It is about 150 miles in circumference. In the beginning of the 16th century it was discovered by the Portuguese, who knowing that Pliny and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> writers had mentioned the island of Cerne in these seas, took it for granted that this must be it; and accordingly we find it styled Cerne or Sirne, in their maps: but, notwithstanding this, they did not think fit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> it; and indeed their force was so small, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the vast dominions they grasped, that it was very excusable. However, according to their laudable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, they put some hogs, goats, and other cattle, upon it, that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> any of their ships either going to the Indies or returning to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a> should be obliged to touch there, they might meet with refreshments. The Dutch, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> voyage they made to the East Indies under their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a> James Cornelius Vanneck, came together with five ships on the 15th of September 1668; anchored in a commodious port, to which they gave the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARWICK\">Warwick</a> Haven; and gave a very good account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in their journals. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Samuel Castleton, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEARL\">Pearl</a>, an English East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> ship, arrived there on the 27th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1612; and taking it to be an island undiscovered before, bestowed upon it the name of England's Forest, though others of his crew called it Pearl Island; and in the account of their voyage, written by John Tatton the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the ship, celebrated it as a place very convenient for shipping, either outward or homeward bound, to refresh at. This they sometimes accordingly did, and brought some cargoes of ebony, and rich wood from thence, but without fixing any settlement.\n\nAt length, in 1638, the Dutch seated themselves here: and it is highly remarkable, that at the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> they were employed in making their first settlement, the French sent a vessel to take possession of it, who found the Dutch beforehand with them, and refused the assistance of an English Indiaman, wooding and watering in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the island, who very frankly offered it, to drive the Dutch from their half settled posts. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for some time in quiet possession.\nMauritius, possession of the places they fortified in this island, to which they gave the name of Mauritius, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Maurice their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STADTHOLDER\">stadtholder</a>. But having engaged the French, who were settled on Madagascar, to steal 50 of the natives, and sell them for slaves, for the improvement of the Dutch settlements here, this proved the ruin of both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a> surprised and massacred the French in Madagascar; and the slaves in Mauritius fled into the centre of the island; from whence they so much and so incessantly molested those who had been formerly their masters, that they chose to quit a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> where they could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer remain in any tolerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of safety. The East India <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>, however, from motives of convenience, and a very imperfect notion of its value, disapproved this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, and therefore ordered it to be resettled; which was accordingly done, and three forts erected at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> havens. Things now went on somewhat better than they did before; but they were still very much disturbed by the revolted negroes in the heart of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a>, whom they could never subdue. One principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> that the company made of this place, was to send thither state prisoners, who, as they were not men of the best morals, quickly corrupted the rest of the inhabitants, and rendered them such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of outrageous smugglers, the situation of the place concurring with their bad disposition, that after various ineffectual attempts made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> them, orders were at length given to abandon Mauritius a second time, which after some delays, were put in execution in the year 1710.\n\nTwo years after this, the French took possession of it, and named it the isle de France. This name has obtained among themselves, but the Europeans in general continue to call it Mauritius. It lies in S. Lat. 20\u00b0 15' E. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>. 6\u00b0 15'. The inconveniences arising from the want of a port at the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOURBON\">Bourbon</a>, induced the French to take possession of Mauritius, it having two very good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, to fortify which no expense has been spared. That on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORT_LOUIS\">Port <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a>, that on the south-east side of the island is called Port Bourbon. The trade-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> from the south-east in these latitudes blows all the year round, excepting for a few days at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> solstice, when it is interrupted by hard gales and hurricanes from the north. The ease with which this wind enables ships to enter the port of Bourbon, caused the French, when they first took possession of this spot, to esteem it the best port in the island; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> pointing out to them, that the same wind often rendered the passage out of the harbour so difficult, that a ship was sometimes obliged to wait a considerable time before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> admitted of her putting to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, this harbour is in a great measure abandoned, and the principal town and seat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> is now fixed at Port Louis, which is nearly in the middle of the north side of the island, and its entrance is through a channel formed by two shoals, which advance about two miles into the sea. When a ship arrives opposite to this channel, the south-east wind hinders her from entering the port under sail, and she must either warp in with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CABLES\">cables</a> or be towed in with boats. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of this operation, joined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> narrowness of the channel, which does not admit of two ships <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABREAST\">abreast</a> of each other entering at the same time, is one of the best defences the harbour has against an attack by sea; for, Mauritius, from these obstacles, an enemy would find it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of the greatest difficulty to force the port; and in addition to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> strength, they have built two forts and as many batteries, which are mounted with heavy cannon, and entirely command the approach to the harbour, should ships presume to force an entry under sail. This port is capable of containing 100 sail of ships, and is well provided with every requisite for repairing and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of ships. This port has proved of the greatest advantage to France in the several wars which have been carried on between Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> and her; and has proved of great utility to the French East India Company's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>; for here their ships and crews were sure to meet with all necessary refreshment after a long voyage. The port of Bourbon is also fortified; and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> landed here would find it an extremely difficult task to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> to the different parts of the island. There are several places between the north-east extremity and Port Louis where boats may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, but all these are defended by batteries; and the country behind them is a continued thicket: The rest of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> is inaccessible. In the north-eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> extending about 10 miles from east to west, and in some places five miles inland from the northern coast. All the rest of the island is full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and steep mountains, lying so near to one another, and the intervals between them so narrow, that, instead of valleys, they rather resemble the beds of torrents; and these are choked with huge fragments of rocks which have fallen from the steep sides of the impending mountains. On the summits of the mountains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> is frequently to be found, and they are covered with forests of ebony and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> trees. The ground they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> produces herbage, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> of various sorts, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> grass to the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THORN\">thorn</a>, and that in such profusion, that they form a thicket so closely interwoven, that no progress can be made but by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HATCHET\">hatchet</a>. Notwithstanding these difficulties, plantations have been formed on these mountains, and very considerable progress has been made in the plains; but the productions, although mostly of the same kind, are not only in less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, but of an inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to those produced at Bourbon island.\n\nIn a course of years, however, the settlement cost so much, and was considered in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> worth so little, that it had been more than once under deliberation, whether, after the example of the Dutch, they should not leave it again to its old negro inhabitants; which sooner or later in all likelihood would have been its fate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a>, in 1735, the famous M. de la Bourdonnais had not been sent thither with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of governor-general of the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>.\n\nHe found this isle in the worst state possible, thinly inhabited by a set of lazy people, who equally hated industry and peace, and who were continually flattering this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, and betraying him wherever and as far as they durst. He gave himself no trouble about this, having once found the means to make himself obeyed; he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the vast importance of the island; he conceived that it might be settled to great advantage; and, without so much as expecting the thanks of those for whom he laboured, he began to execute this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>. His first step was to bring over\nMauritius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> boys from Madagascar, whom he carefully trained up in good principles, and in continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>; by which he rendered them so good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, that he very quickly obliged the Marones, or wild negroes, either to submit or to quit the island: he taught the planters to cultivate their lands to advantage; he, by an aqueduct, brought fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> to the sea side; and whereas they had not so much as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> at his coming thither, he made a very fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOCK\">dock</a>, where he not only built sloops and large vessels, but even a ship of the burden of 500 tons. However incredible it may seem, yet it is certainly fact, that in the space of five years he converted this country into a paradise, that had been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> wilderness for 5000; and this in spite of the inhabitants, and of the company, who being originally prejudiced by them, behaved ill to him at his return. He soon made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> de Fleury, however, sensible of the true state of things; and compelled the company to acknowledge, though they did not reward, his services.\n\nHe afterwards returned into the Indies, and perfected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> he had begun, and to him it is owing that the isle of France was rendered one of the finest and most important spots upon the globe. Here no coffee is raised; but by the indefatigable industry of M. de Bourbonnais, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, and cotton (which are not at Bourbon), came to be cultivated with success. Since the departure of that most excellent governor, the plantations have been neglected, and are fallen off; but if a proper spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> was raised among the inhabitants, they might soon be made to resume their flourishing appearance. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">Mines</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> have been discovered in the mountains near the great plain, in the north-east part of the island; and these mountains affording in great abundance the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>, forges have been erected: but the iron produced is of a very inferior quality, it being brittle, and only fit for making cannon-balls and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOMB\">bomb</a>-shells. Black cattle, sheep, and goats, are preserved with difficulty; the first generally die before they have been a year in the island, and this occasions frequent importations of them from Madagascar and other parts. Common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a> breed in great plenty; and, with fish and turtle, furnish a great part of the food of the European inhabitants.\n\nThe approach to the island is extremely dangerous, it being surrounded with ledges of rocks, and many of them covered by the sea. The shore abounds with coral and shells. This island is said to contain 60 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>: some are considerable streams, and most of them have their sources from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, of which there are several in the middle part of the island. The rivers afford plenty of various kinds of fish, particularly eels. These are of an enormous size, some having been found that were six feet long, and six inches in circumference, and so extremely voracious, that it is dangerous to bathe in those parts of the river where they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a>, as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> a man without fear, and have strength sufficient to keep him under water till he is drowned. Here is a great variety of birds, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATS\">bats</a> as large as a young kitten: the inhabitants esteem them a delicate morsel. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is both hot and moist, but not unwholesome. The place abounds with insects, which are very troublesome; but there are no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a>. It has been discovered, that off Port Louis the south-west wind generally blows with least strength about Mauritius sunrise; and it also happens, on four or five days, at intervals, in the course of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, that early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> the wind ceases in the northern part of the island for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> or two, when a breeze rises, although but faintly, from the north-west; during which, a ship stationed at the entrance of the channel to avail herself of this breeze, may enter the harbour and attack the forts.\n\nThis island, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of the French revolution, did not entirely escape from the storm which then agitated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> country. In the year 1799, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> was formed, and broke out, for the purpose of resisting the government which had been established under the authority of the republic. It was, however, soon suppressed by the activity of the civil authorities, supported by the majority of the inhabitants.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of this island in 1799 amounted to 65,000, viz. 55,000 slaves, and 10,000 whites and mulattoes. The following is a state of the produce of this island in 1800: viz. coffee, 6000 bales, of 100 lbs. French; indigo, 300,000 lbs. from 2s. to 8s. per lb.; cotton, 2000 bales, of 250 lbs.; raw sugar, 20,000,000 lbs.; cloves, 20,000 lbs. The island of Mauritius, as well as the other French islands in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> ocean, were taken by the British in 1811; and their possession was confirmed to Britain by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in 1814.","sp":33,"ep":35},{"h":"MAURUA","t":"one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> in the South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>.

In 1750, the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOTTINGEN\">Gottingen</a> chose him for their mathematical professor; and every year of his short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> was thenceforward marked with some considerable discoveries in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>.

He was born in 1573, and had for his godfather Theodore Beza. He studied physic at Montpelier, and was made physician in ordinary to Henry IV. who promised to do great things for him, provided he would change his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. James I. of England invited him over, and made him first physician to himself and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>, in which office he served the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> family to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his death in 1655.

While his majesty resided at Oxford, he was one of the divines appointed to preach before him. He published in 1647 a piece entitled Oxaomaxia, or The people's war examined according to the principles of reason and scripture, by Jasper Mayne. In 1648 he was deprived of his studentship at Christ <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, and two livings he had; but was restored with the king, who made him his chaplain and archdeacon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHICHESTER\">Chichester</a>; all which he held till he died. Dr Mayne was held in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> esteem both for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> parts and his acquired accomplishments. He was an orthodox preacher, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and exemplary behaviour; yet of a ready and facetious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, and a very singular turn of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>. From some stories that are related of him, he seems to have borne some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of resemblance in his manner to the celebrated Dr Swift; but if he did not possess those very brilliant parts that distinguished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAN\">Dean</a>, he probably was less subject to that capricious and those unaccountable whimsies which at times so greatly eclipsed the abilities of the latter. Yet there is one anecdote related of him, which, although it reflects <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great honour on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, as it seems to carry some degree of cruelty with it, yet it is a strong mark of his resemblance to the Dean, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that his propensity for drollery and joke did not quit him even in his latest moments. The story is this: The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> had an old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>, who had lived with him some years, to whom he had bequeathed an old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>, in which he told him he would find something that would make him drink after his death. The servant, full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, under this familiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, had left him somewhat that would be a reward for the assiduity of his past services, as soon as decency would permit, flew to the trunk; when, behold, to his great disappointment, the boasted legacy proved to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a>. The doctor, however, bequeathed many legacies by will to pious uses; particularly 50 pounds towards the rebuilding of St Paul's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a>, and 200 pounds to be distributed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> of the parishes of Cassington and Pyrton, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WATLINGTON\">Watlington</a>, of both which places he had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICAR\">vicar</a>. In his younger years he had an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>; and wrote two plays, the latter of which may be seen in the tenth volume of Dodson's Collection, viz. 1. Amorous war, a tragi-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a>. 2. The city-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a>, a comedy. He published a poem upon the naval victory by the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> over the Dutch, printed in 1665.

They had only petitioned for leave to establish a seminary; but the parliament also granted 800l. per annum for its support, which was afterwards enlarged to 13,000l.; but has since been diminished.

Though he was himself a hearty whig, yet, uninfluenced by party principles, he was a friend to all men of merit, by whatever denomination they might happen to be distinguished. Thus he was intimate with Garth, with Arbuthnot, and with Freind; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> kept up a constant correspondence with the great Boerhaave, who had been his fellow student at Leyden: they communicated to each other their observations and projects, and never loved each other the less for being of different sentiments. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, intent as Dr Mead was on the duties of his profession, he had a greatness of mind that extended itself to all kinds of literature, which he spared neither pains nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> to promote. He caused the beautiful and splendid edition of Thuanus's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> to be published in 1713, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> volumes folio; and by his interposition and assiduity, Mr Sutton's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> foul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a> from ships and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> places was carried into execution, and all the ships in his majesty's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> provided with this useful machine. Nothing pleased him more than to call hidden talents into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>; to give encouragement to the greatest projects, and to see them executed under his own eye. During almost half a century he was at the head of his business, which brought him one year about seven thousand pounds, and for several years between five and six thousand; yet clergymen, and in general all men of learning, were welcome to his advice. His library consisted of 10,000 volumes, of which his Latin, Greek, and oriental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a>, made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> inconsiderable part. He had a gallery for his pictures and antiquities, which cost him great sums. His reputation, not only as a physician, but as a scholar, was so universally established, that he corresponded with all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> literati in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>: even the king of Naples sent to desire a complete collection of his works; and in return made him a present of the two first volumes of Signior Bajardi, which may be considered as an introduction to the collection of the antiquities of Herculaneum. At the same time that prince invited him to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, that he might have an opportunity of showing him those valuable monuments of antiquity; and nothing but his great age prevented his undertaking a journey so suited to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. No foreigner of learning ever came to London without being introduced to Dr Mead; and on these occasions his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> was always open, and the magnificence of princes was united with the pleasures of philosophers. It was principally to him that the several counties of England and our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> abroad applied for the choice of their physicians, and he was likewise consulted by foreign physicians from Russia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, &c.

Monita et Praecepta medica. 5. A Discourse concerning pestilential contagion, and the methods to be used to prevent it.

A foot-rule may be used as a standard for measures of length, a bushel for measures of capacity, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> for weights. There should be only one authentic standard of each kind, formed of the most durable materials, and kept with all possible care. A sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of copies, exactly corresponding to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> standard, may be distributed for adjusting the weights and measures that are made for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. There are several standards of this kind both in England\nMeasure. England and Scotland. See the article Weights and Measures.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> any one of the standards above mentioned be justly preserved, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> serve as a foundation for the others, by which they may be corrected if inaccurate, or restored if entirely lost. For instance, if we have a standard foot, we can easily obtain an inch, and can make a box which shall contain a cubical inch, and may serve as a standard for measures of capacity. If it be known that a pint contains 100 cubical inches, we may make a vessel five inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, and four inches deep, which will contain a pint. If the standard be required in any other form, we may fill this vessel with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and regulate another to contain an equal quantity. Standards for weights may be obtained from the same foundation; for if we know how many inches of water it takes to weigh a pound, we have only to measure that quantity, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> which balances it may be assumed as the standard of a pound.\n\nAgain, If the standard of a pound be given, the measure of an inch may be obtained from it; for we may weigh a cubical inch of water, and pour it into a regular vessel; and having noticed how far it is filled, we may make another vessel of like capacity in the form of a cube. The side of this vessel may be assumed as the standard for an inch; and standards for a foot, a pint, or a bushel, may be obtained from it. Water is the most proper substance for regulating standards; for all other bodies differ in weight from others of the same kind; whereas it is found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RIVER_WATER\">river water</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, and melted snow, and all other kinds, have the same weight; and this uniformly holds in all countries when the water is pure, alike warm, and free from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> and minerals.\n\nThus, any one standard is sufficient for restoring all the rest. It may further be desired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> on some expedient, if possible, for restoring the standards, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> that all of them should ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into disorder, or should be forgotten, through the length of time, and the vicissitudes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> affairs. This seems difficult, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> words can convey a precise idea of a foot-rule, or a pound weight. Measures, assumed from the dimensions of the human body, as a foot, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>-breadth, or a pace, must nearly be the same in all ages, unless the size of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> undergo some change; and therefore, if we know how many square feet a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> contained, we may form some judgment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a> which restricted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of a Roman citizen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> acres; and this is sufficient to render <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> intelligible; but it is too inaccurate to regulate measures for commercial purposes. The same may be said of standards, deduced from the measure of a barley-corn, or the weight of a grain of wheat. If the distance of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> be accurately measured and recorded, the nature of the measure used will be preserved in a more permanent manner than by any standard; for if ever that measure fall into disuse, and another be substituted in its place, the distance may be measured again, and the proportion of the standards may be ascertained by comparing the new and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> distances.\n\nBut the most accurate and unchangeable manner of establishing standards is, by comparing them with the length of pendulums. The longer a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> is, it vibrates the slower; and it must have one precise length in order to vibrate in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>. The slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in length will occasion a difference in the time; which will become abundantly sensible after a number of vibrations, and will be easily observed if the pendulum be applied to regulate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of a clock. The length of a pendulum which vibrates seconds in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> is about 39\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches, is constantly the same at the same place, but it varies a little with the latitude of the place, being shorter as the latitude is less. Therefore, though all standards of weights and measures were lost, the length of a second pendulum might be found by repeated trials; and if the pendulum be properly divided, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> measure of an inch will be obtained; and from this all other standards may be restored. See Whitehurst on Invariable Measures.\n\nMeasures are various, according to the various kinds and dimensions of the things measured.\u2014Hence arise lineal or longitudinal measures, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> or lengths; square measures, for areas or superficies; and solid or cubic measures, for bodies and their capacities; all which again are very different in different countries and in different ages, and even many of them for different commodities. Whence arise other divisions of ancient and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> measures, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> and foreign ones, dry measures, liquid measures, &c.\n\nI. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">Long</a> Measures, or Measures of Application.\n\n1.] The English and Scotch Standards.\n\nThe English lineal standard is the yard, containing 3 English feet; equal to 3 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> feet 1 inch and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of an inch, or \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\) of a Paris ell. The use of this measure was established by Henry I. of England, and the standard taken from the length of his own arm. It is divided into 36 inches, and each inch is supposed equal to 3 barleycorns. When used for measuring cloth, it is divided into four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, and each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> subdivided into 4 nails. The English ell is equal to a yard and a quarter, or 45 inches, and is used in measuring linens imported from Germany and the Low Countries.\n\nThe Scots ell was established by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> I, and divided into 37 inches. The standard is kept in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> chamber of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, and being compared with the English yard, is found to measure 37\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches; and therefore the Scots inch and foot are larger than the English, in the proportion of 180 to 185; but this difference being so inconsiderable, is seldom attended to in practice. The Scots ell, though forbidden by law, is still used for measuring some coarse commodities, and is the foundation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> measure of Scotland.\n\nItinerary measure is the same both in England and Scotland. The length of the chain is four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>, or 22 yards; 80 chains make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>. The old Scots computed miles were generally about a mile and a half each.\n\nThe reel for yarn is 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) yards, or 10 quarters, in circuit; 120 threads make a cut, 12 cuts make a hank or hank, and 4 hanks make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SPINDLE\">spindle</a>.\n\n2.] The French standard was formerly the aune or ell, containing 3 Paris feet 7 inches 8 lines, or 1 yard \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\) English; the Paris foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> exceeding the English by \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\) parts, as in one of the following tables. This\nMeasure. ell is divided two ways; viz. into halves, thirds, sixths, and twelfths; and into quarters, half-quarters, and sixteenths.\n\nThe French, however, have also formed an entirely new system of weights and measures, according to the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>.\n\n| Proportions of the measures of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> to its principal measure or unity. | First part of the name which indicates the proportion to the principal measure or unity. | Length. | Capacity. | Weight. | Agrarian. | For firewood. |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 10,000 | Myria | Metre. | Litre. | Gramme. | Are. | Stere. |\n| 1,000 | Kilo | | | | | |\n| 100 | Hecto | | | | | |\n| 10 | Deca | | | | | |\n| 1 | | | | | | |\n| 0.1 | Deci | | | | | |\n| 0.01 | Centi | | | | | |\n| 0.001 | Milli | | | | | |\n\nProportion of the principal measures between themselves and the length of the meridian.\n\n| Proportion of the principal measures between themselves and the length of the meridian. | Weight of a centimetre cube of distilled water. | 100 square metres. | One cubic metre. |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 10,000,000th part of the distance from the pole to the equator. | A decimetre cube. | | |\n\nValue of the principal measures in the ancient French measures.\n\n| Value of the principal measures in the ancient French measures. | 3 feet 11 lines and 1/2 nearly | 1 pint and 1/4 or 1 litre and 1/4 nearly | 18 grains and 8,100 parts | Two square perch\u00e9es d'\u0153ufs et for\u00eat. | 1 demi-voie, or 1/4 of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> des caux et for\u00eat. |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| | | | | | |\n\nValue in English measures.\n\n| Value in English measures. | Inches 39.383 | 61.083 inches, which is more than the wine, and less than the beer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">quart</a>. | 22,966 grains. | 11,968 square yards. |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nThe English avoirdupois pound weighs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">troy</a> grains 7004; whence the avoirdupois ounce, whereof 16 make a pound, is found equal to 437.75 troy grains.\n\nAnd it follows that the troy pound is to the avoirdupois pound as 88 to 107 nearly; for as 88 to 107, so is 5760 to 7023.636, that the troy ounce is to the avoirdupois ounce, as 80 to 73 nearly; for as 80 to 73, so is 480 to 438. And, lastly, That the avoirdupois pound and ounce is to the Paris two marc weight and ounce, as 63 to 68 nearly; for as 63 to 68, so is 7504 to 7559.873. See Weight.

In Holland it contains one Paris foot eleven lines, or four-sevenths of the Paris ell. The Flanders ell contains two feet one inch five lines and half a line; or seven-twelfths of the Paris ell. The ell of Germany, Brabant, &c. is equal to that of Flanders.\n\n4.] The Italian measure is the braccio, brace, or fathom.

At Venice, it contains one Paris foot eleven inches three lines, or eight-fifteenths of the Paris ell. At Bologna, Modena, and Mantua, the brace is the same as at Venice. At Lucca it contains one Paris foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> inches ten lines, or half a Paris ell. At Florence, it contains one foot nine inches four lines, or forty-nine hundredths of a Paris ell. At Milan, the brace for measuring of silks is one Paris foot seven inches four lines, or four-ninths of a Paris ell: that for woollen cloths is the same with the ell of Holland. Lastly, at Bergama, the brace is one foot seven inches six lines, or five-ninths of a Paris ell. The usual measure at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, however, is the canna, containing six feet ten inches and two lines, or one Paris ell and fifteen-seventeenth.\n\n5.] The Spanish measure is the vara or yard, in some places called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARA\">bara</a>; containing seventeen twenty-fourths of the Paris ell. But the measure in Castile and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALENCIA\">Valencia</a> is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAN\">pan</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAN\">span</a>, or palm; which is used, together with the canna, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a>. In Arragon, the vara is equal to a Paris ell and a half; or five feet five inches six lines.\n\n6.] The Portuguese measure is the cavedos, containing two feet eleven lines, or four-sevenths of a Paris ell; and the vara, an hundred and six whercof make an hundred Paris ells.\n\n7.] The Piedmontese measure is the ras, containing...\nMeasure. one Paris foot nine inches ten lines, or half a Paris ell.

In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, and some parts of the Indies, the gueze, whereof there are two kinds; the royal gueze, called also the gueze monkelsei, containing two Paris feet ten inches eleven lines, or four-fifths of the Paris ell; and the shorter gueze, called simply gueze, only two-thirds of the former. At Goa and Ormuz, the measure is the vara, the same with that of the Portuguese, having been introduced by them. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEGU\">Pegu</a>, and some other parts of the Indies, the cando or candi, equal to the ell of Venice. At Goa, and other parts, they use a larger cando, equal to seventeen Dutch ells; exceeding that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BABEL\">Babel</a> and Balsora by $\\frac{7}{8}$ per cent. and the vara by $6\\frac{1}{2}$. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIAM\">Siam</a>, they use the ken, short of three Paris feet by one inch.

SQUARE, SUPERFICIAL, or LAND Measure.\n\n1. English square measures are raised from the yard of 36 inches multiplied into itself, and thus producing 1296 square inches in the square yard; the divisions of this are square feet and inches; and the multiples, poles, rods, and acres. Because the length of a pole is 5\u00bd yards, the square of the same contains 30\u00bc square yards. A square mile contains 640 square acres. In measuring fens and woodlands, 18 feet are generally allowed to the pole, and 21 feet in forest lands.\n\nA hide of land, frequently mentioned in the earlier part of the English history, contained about 100 arable acres; and 5 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a> were esteemed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>'s fee. At the time of the Norman conquest, there were 243,600 hides in England.\n\n2. Scotch square or land measure is regulated by the Scotch ell: 36 square ells = 1 fall, 40 falls = 1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOD\">rood</a>, 4 roods = 1 acre.\u2014The proportion between the Scotch and English acre, supposing the feet in both measures alike, is as 1369 to 1089, or nearly as 5 to 4. If the difference of the feet be regarded, the proportion is as 10,000 to 7869. The length of the chain for measuring land in Scotland is 23 ells, or 74 feet.\u2014A husband-land contains 6 acres of sock and scythe land, that is, of land that may be tilled with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a> or mown with a scythe; 13 acres of arable land make one ox-gang, and four ox-gangs make a pound-land of old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>.\n\n3. French square measures are regulated by 12 square lines in the inch square; 12 inches in the foot, 22 feet in the perch, and 100 perches in the arpent or acre.\nTables of Square Measure.\n\n1.

Grecian square measures were the plethron or acre, by some said to contain 1444, by others 10,000 square feet; and aroura, the half of the plethron. The aroura of the Egyptians was the square 100 cubits.\n\n3. Roman square measure reduced to English.

Cubical Measures, or Measures of Capacity, for Liquids.\n\n1. The English measures were originally raised from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TROY_WEIGHT\">troy weight</a>: it being enacted by several statutes, that eight pounds troy of wheat, gathered from the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, and well dried, should weigh a gallon of wine measure, the divisions and multiples whereof were to form the other measures; at the same time it was also ordered, that there should be but one liquid measure in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>: yet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> has prevailed; and there having been introduced a new weight, viz. the avoirdupois, we have now a second standard gallon adjusted thereto, and therefore exceeding the former in the proportion of the avoirdupois weight to troy weight. From this latter standard are raised two several measures, the one for ale, the other for beer. The sealed gallon at Guildhall, which is the standard for wines, spirits, oils, &c. is supposed to contain 231 cubic inches; and on this supposition the other measures raised therefrom will contain as in the table underneath: yet, by actual experiment, made in 1688, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> mayor and the commissioners of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCISE\">excise</a>, this gallon was found to contain only 224 cubic inches; it was, however, agreed to continue the common supposed contents of 231 cubic inches: so that all computations stand on their own footing. Hence, as 12 is to 231, so is 14\u00bd to 281\u00bc the cubic inches in the ale gallon: but in effect the ale quart contains 70\u00bd cubic inches, on which principle the ale and beer gallon will be 282 cubic inches. The several divisions and multiples of these measures, and their proportions, are exhibited in the tables underneath.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> for ale in London is 32 gallons, and the barrel for beer 36 gallons. In all other places of England, the barrel, both for ale and beer, is 34 gallons.\n\n2. Scotch liquid measure is founded on the pint. The Scotch pint was formerly regulated by a standard jug of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> metal, the custody of which was committed to the borough of Stirling. This jug was supposed to contain 105 cubic inches; and though, after several careful trials, it has been found to contain only about 103\u00bd inches; yet, in compliance with established custom, founded on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, the pint stamps are still regulated to contain 105 inches, and the customary ale measures are about \u00bc above that standard. It was enacted by James I. of Scotland, that the pint should contain 41 ounces trone weight of the clear water of Tay, and by James VI. that it should contain .55 Scots troy ounces of the clear water of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEITH\">Leith</a>. This affords another method of regulating the pint, and also ascertains the ancient standard of the trone weight. As the water of Tay and Leith is alike, the trone weight must have been to the Scots troy weight as 55 to 41; and therefore the pound trone must have contained about 21\u00bd ounces Scots troy.\n\n4 gills = 1 muthkin.\n2 muthkins = 1 chopin.\n2 chopins = 1 pint.\n2 pints = 1 quart.\n4 quarts = 1 gallon.\n\nThe Scotch quart contains 210 inches; and is, therefore, about \u00bc less than the English wine gallon, and about \u00bc less than the ale gallon.\n\n3. As to the liquid measures of foreign nations, it is to be observed, that their several vessels for wine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>, &c. have also various denominations according to their different sizes and the places wherein they are used. The woeders of Germany, for holding Rhenish and Moselle wines, are different in their gauges; some containing 14 annes of Amsterdam measure, and others more or less. The name is reckoned at Amsterdam for 8 steckans, or 20 verges, or for \u00bc of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TUN\">tun</a> of 2 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a>, or 4 barrels, of French or Bordeaux, which at this latter place is called tiergon, because\nMeasure, because 3 of them make a pipe or 2 barrels, and 6 the said tun. The steckan is 16 mingles, or 32 pints; and the verge is, in respect of the said Rhenish and Moselle, and some other sorts of wine, 6 mingles; but, in measuring brandy it consists of 6\u00bd mingles. The same is divided into 4 anckers, and the ancker into 2 steckans, or 32 mingles. The ancker is taken sometimes for \u00bc of a tun, or 4 barrels; on which footing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURDEAUX\">Bourdeaux</a> barrel ought to contain at Amsterdam (when the cask is made according to the just gauge) 12\u00bd steckans, or 200 mingles, wine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEES\">lees</a>; or 12 steckans, or 192 mingles, racked wine; so that the Bourdeaux tun of wine contains 50 steckans, or 800 mingles, wine and lees; and 48 steckans, or 768 mingles, of pure wine. The barrels or poin\u00e7ons of Nantes and other places on the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOIRE\">Loire</a>, contain only 12 steckans, Amsterdam measure. The wine tun of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROCHELLE\">Rochelle</a>, Cogniac, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARENTE\">Charente</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of Rh\u00e9, differs very little from the tun of Bourdeaux, and consequently from the barrels and pipes. A tun of wine of Chalosse, Bayonne, and the neighbouring places, is reckoned 60 steckans, and the barrel 15, Amsterdam measure.\n\nThe muid of Paris contains 150 quarts or 300 pints, wine and lees; or 280 pints clear wine; of which muids 3 make a tun, and the fractions are,\n\n| The muid | 36 setiers |\n|----------|-----------|\n| The setier | 4 quarts |\n| The quart | 2 pints |\n| The pint | 2 chopins |\n| The chopin | 2 demi-setiers |\n| The demi-setier | 2 poissons |\n\nThe muid is also composed of pipes or poin\u00e7ons, quarteaux, queves, and demiqueves; those poin\u00e7ons of Paris and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a> contain about 15 steckans Amsterdam measure, and ought to weigh with the cask 666lb, a little more or less. In Provence they reckon by milleroles, and the millerole of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOULON\">Toulon</a> contains 66 Paris pints, or 100 pints of Amsterdam, nearly, and the Paris pint is nearly equal to the English wine quart (A).\n\nThe butts or pipes from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADIZ\">Cadiz</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MALAGA\">Malaga</a>, Alicant, Benecarlo, Saloe, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MATARO\">Mataro</a>, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANARIES\">Canaries</a>, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPORTO\">Oporto</a>, and Fayal, are very different in their gauges, though in affreightments they are all reckoned two to the tun.\n\nVinegar is measured in the same manner as wine; but the measures for brandies are different: these spirits from France, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, &c. are generally shipped in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> casks called pipes, butts and pieces, according to the places from whence they are imported, &c. In France, brandy is shipped in casks called pieces at Bourdeaux, and pipes at Rochelle, Cogniac, the isle of Rh\u00e9, and other neighbouring places, which contain some more and some less, even from 60 to 90 Amsterdam verges or veertcls, according to the capacity of the vessels, and the places they come from, which, being reduced into barrels, will stand as follows, viz.\n\nAt Rochelle, Cogniac, the isle of Rh\u00e9, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of Aunis, 27 Veertcls\nAt Nantes, and several places of Bretagne and Anjou, 29 Veertcls\nAt Bourdeaux, and different parts of Guienne, 32 Verges\nAt Amsterdam, and other cities of Holland, 30 Veertcls\nAt Hamburgh and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUBECK\">Lubeck</a>, 30 Verges\nAt Embden, 27 Verges\n\nIn Provence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUEDOC\">Languedoc</a>, brandy is sold by the quintal, the casks included; and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUGES\">Bruges</a> in Flanders, the verges are called seeters of 16 stops each, and the spirits is sold at so much per stop.\n\nOlive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> is also shipped in casks of various sizes, according to the custom of the places where it is embarked, and the conveniency of stowage. In England it is sold by the tun of 256 gallons; and at Amsterdam by the tun of 717 mingles, or 1434 pints. In Provence it is sold by milleroles of 66 Paris pints; from Spain and Portugal it is brought in pipes or butts, of different gauges; at the first place it is sold by roves, where 40 go to the butt; and at the latter place by almoudas, whereof 26 make a pipe. Train oil is sold in England by the tun, at Amsterdam by the barrel.\n\n### Tables of Liquid Measure.\n\n#### 1.

Measure of Capacity for things Dry.\n\n1.] English dry or corn measure. The standard for measuring corn, salt, coals, and other dry goods, in England, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a> gallon, which contains 272\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) cubic inches. The bushel contains 8 gallons, or 2178 inches. A cylindrical vessel, 18\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches diameter, and 8 inches deep, is appointed to be used as a bushel in levying the malt tax. A vessel of these dimensions is rather less than the Winchester bushel of 8 gallons, for it contains only 2150 inches; though probably there was no difference intended. The denominations of dry measure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> used, are given in the first of the subjoined tables. Four quarters corn make a chaldron, 5 quarters make a wey or load, and 10 quarters make a ton. In measuring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> coal, 5 pecks make a bushel, 9 bushels make a quarter or vatt, 4 quarters make a chaldron, and 21 chaldrons make a score.\n\n- 40 feet hewn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> make a load.\n- 50 feet unhewn timber make a load.\n- 32 gallons make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a> barrel.\n- 42 gallons make a salmon barrel.\n- 1 cwt. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> makes a barrel.\n- 256 lbs. soup make a barrel.\n- 10 dozen candles make a barrel.\n- 12 barrels make a last.\n\n2.] Scotch dry measure. There was formerly only one measure of capacity in Scotland; and some commodities were heaped, others strained, or measured exactly to the capacity of the standard. The method of heaping was afterwards forbidden, as unequal, and a larger measure appointed for such commodities as that custom had been extended to.\n\nThe wheat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIRLOT\">firlot</a>, used also for rye, peas, beans, salt, and grass seeds, contains 21 pints 1 nyctchkin, measured by the Stirling jug. The barley firlot, used also for oats, fruit, and potatoes, contains 31 pints. A different method of regulating the firlot was appointed from the dimensions of a cylindrical vessel. The diameter for both measures was fixed at 10\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches, the depth 7\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches for the wheat firlot, and 10\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) for the barley firlot. A standard constructed by these measures is rather less than when regulated by the pint; and as it is difficult to make vessels exactly cylindrical, the regulation by the pint has prevailed, and the other method gone into disuse.\n\nIf the Stirling jug contains 10\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches, the wheat firlot will contain 2100 inches; which is more than 2 per cent. larger than the legal malt bushel of England, and about 1 per cent. larger than the Winchester bushel; and the barley firlot will contain 3298 inches. The barley boll is nearly equal to six legal malt bushels.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-STIRLINGSHIRE\">Stirlingshire</a>, 17 pecks are reckoned to the boll; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INVERNESS_SHIRE\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERNESS\">Inverness</a>-shire, 18 pecks; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AYRSHIRE\">Ayrshire</a> the boll is the same as the English quarter. And the firlots, in many places, are larger than the Linlithgow standard.\n\n3.] French dry, are, the litron, bushel, minot, mine, septier, muid, and tun. The litron is divided into two demilitrons, and four quarter litrons, and contains 36 cubic inches of Paris. By ordonnance, the litron is to be three inches and a half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, and three inches 10 lines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. The litron for salt is larger, and is divided into two halves, four quarters, eight demi-quarters, and 16 mesurettes. The French bushel is different in different jurisdictions. At Paris it is divided into demibushels; each demibushel into two quarts; the quart into two half quarts; and the half quart into two litrons: so that the bushel contains 16 litrons. By ordonnance the Paris bushel is to be eight inches two lines and a half high, and ten inches broad, or in diameter within-side. The minot consists of three bushels, the mine of two minots or six bushels, the septier of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> or 12 bushels, and the muid of 12 septiers or 144 bushels. The bushel of oats is estimated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> that of any other grain: so that there go 24 bushels to make the septier, and 288 to make the muid. It is divided into four picotins, the picotin containing two quarts, or four litrons. The bushel for salt is divided into two half bushels, four quarters, eight half quarters, and 16 litrons: four bushels make a minot, 16 a septier, and 192 a muid. The bushel for wood is divided into halves, quarters, and half quarters. Eight bushels make the minot, 16 a mine; 20 mines or 320 bushels, the muid. For <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a>, 12 bushels make a sack, and 36 sacks a muid. For lime, three bushels make a minot, and 48 minots a muid. The minot is by ordonnance to be 11 inches 9 lines high, and 14 inches 8 lines in diameter. The minot is composed of three bushels, or 16 litrons: four minots make a septier, and 48 a muid. The French mine is no real vessel, but an estimation of several others. At Paris the mine contains six bushels, and 24 make the muid; at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROUEN\">Rouen</a> the mine is four bushels; and at Dieppe 18 mines make a Paris muid. The septier differs in different places: at Paris it contains two mines, or eight bushels, and 12 septiers the muid. At Rouen the septier contains two mines or 12 bushels. Twelve septiers make a muid at Rouen as well as at Paris; but 12 of the latter are equal to 14 of the former. At Toulon the septier contains a mine and a half; three of which mines make the septier of Paris. The muid or mui of Paris consists of 12 septiers; and is divided into mines, minots, bushels, &c. That for oats is double that for other grain, i.e. contains twice the number of bushels. At Orleans the muid is divided into mines, but those mines only contain two Paris septiers and a half. In some places they use the tun in lieu of the muid; particularly at Nantes, where it contains 10 septiers of 16 bushels each, and weighs between 2200 and 2250 pounds. Three of these tuns make 28 Paris septiers. At Rochelle, &c. the tun contains 42 bushels, and weighs two per cent. less than that of Nantes. At Brest it contains 20 bushels, is equal to 10 Paris septiers, and weighs about 2240 pounds. See Tun.\n\n4.] Dutch, Swedish, Polish, Prussian, and Muscovite. In these places, they estimate their dry things on the foot of the last, lest, leth, or lecht; so called according to the various pronunciations of the people who use it. In Holland, the last is equal to 19 Paris septiers, or 38 Bourdeaux bushels, and weighs about 4560 pounds; the last they divide into 27 mudes, and the mude into four scheplecs. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>, the last is 40 Bourdeaux bushels, and weighs about 4800 Paris pounds. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>, the last is 133 Paris septiers. In Sweden and Muscovy they measure by the great and little last; the first containing 12 barrells, and the second half as many. See Last.\nIn Museovy, they likewise use the chefford, which is different in various places: that of Archangel is equal to three Ronen bushels.\n\n5.] Italian. At Veniee, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEGHORN\">Leghorn</a>, and Lucca, they estimate their dry things on the foot of the staro or staio; the staro of Leghorn weighs 54 pounds: 112 staros and seven-eighths are equal to the Amsterdam last. At Lucea, 119 staros make the last of Amsterdam. The Venetian staro weighs 128 Paris pounds: the staro is divided into four quarters. Thirty-five staros and one-fifth, or 140 quarters and four-fifths, make the last of Amsterdam. At Naples and other parts, they use the tomolo or tomalo, equal to one-third of the Paris septier. Thirty-six tomoli and a half make the carro, and a carro and a half, or 54 tomoli, make the last of Amsterdam. At Palermo, 16 tomoli make the salma, and four mondili the tomolo. Ten salmas and three-sevenths, or 171 tomoli and three-sevenths, make the Measure last of Amsterdam.\n\n6.] Flemish. At Antwerp, &c., they measure by the viertel; 32 and one-half whereof make 19 Paris septiers. At Hamburgh, the schepel; 90 whereof make 19 Paris septiers.\n\n7.] Spanish and Portuguese. At Cadiz, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BILBOA\">Bilboa</a>, and St Sebastian, they use the fanega; 23 whereof make the Nantes or Rochelle tun, or 9 Paris septiers and a half: though the Bilboa fanega is somewhat larger, insomuch that 21 fanegas make a Nantes tun. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEVILLE\">Seville</a>, &c., they use the anagoras, containing a little more than the Paris mine; 36 anagoras make 19 Paris septiers. At Bayonne, &c., the concha; 30 whereof are equal to nine Paris septiers and a half. At Lisbon, the alquier, a very small measure, 240 whereof make 19 Paris septiers, 60 the Lisbon muid.\n\n**Tables of Dry Measure.**\n\n1.

In describing the parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, Tournefort introduced a geometrical scale, which many of his followers have retained. They measured every part of the plant; and the essence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> consisted in an accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENSURATION\">mensuration</a> of the whole.\n\nAs the parts of plants, however, are liable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in no circumstance so much as that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a>, Linn\u00e6us very rarely admits any other mensuration than that arising from the respective length and breadth of the parts compared together. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> that require actual mensuration, the same author recommends, in lieu of Tournefort's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> scale, the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> scale of the human body, which he thinks is much more convenient, and equally accurate.\n\nThe scale in question consists of 11 degrees, which are as follow: 1. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>'sbreadth, or the diameter of a hair, (capillus). 2. A line, (linea), the breadth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRESCENT\">crescent</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> appearance at the root of the finger (not thumb, measured from the skin towards the body of the nail; a line is equal to 12 hairbreadths, and is the 12th part of a Parisian inch. 3. A nail (unguis), the length of a finger nail; equal to six lines, or half a Parisian inch. 4. A thumb (pollex), the length of the first or outermost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> of the thumb; equal to a Parisian inch. 5. A palm (palma), the breadth of the palm exclusive of the thumb; equal to three Parisian inches. 6. A span (spithama), the distance between the extremity of the thumb and that of the first finger when extended; equal to seven Parisian inches. 7. A great span (dodrans), the distance between the extremity of the thumb and that of the little finger, when extended; equal to nine inches. 8. A foot (pes), measuring from the elbow to the basis of the thumb; equal to 12 Parisian inches. 9. A cubit (cubitus), from the elbow to the extremity of the middle finger; equal to 17 inches. 10. An arm length (brachium), from the armpit to the extremity of the middle finger; equal to 24 Parisian inches, or two feet. 11. A fathom (orgya), the measure of the human stature; the distance between the extremities of the two middle fingers, when the arms are extended; equal, where greatest, to six feet.\n\nMeasure is also used to signify the cadence and time observed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>, and music, to render them regular and agreeable.\n\nThe different measures or metres in poetry, are the different","sp":41,"ep":52},{"h":"MEASURE","t":"different manners of ordering and combining the quantities, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and short syllables.

The most usual are the heroic, generally consisting of five long and five short syllables; and verses of four feet; and of three feet and a caesura, or single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, by variously combining and transposing their quantities, made a vast variety of different measures. Of words, or rather feet of two syllables, they formed a spondee, consisting of two long syllables; a pyrrhic, of two short syllables; a trochee, of a long and a short syllable; and an iambic, of a short and a long syllable.\n\nOf their feet of three syllables they formed a molossus, consisting of three long syllables; a tribrach, of three short syllables; a dactyl, of one long and two short syllables; and an anapest, of two short and one long syllable. The Greek poets contrived 124 different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> or measures, under as many different names, from feet of two syllables to those of six.\n\nMeasure, in Music, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> or space of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> which the person who beats time takes between the rising and falling of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> or foot, in order to conduct the movement, sometimes quicker, and sometimes slower, according to the kind of music, or the subject that is sung or played.\n\nThe measure is that which regulates the time we are to dwell on each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>.

The measure usually takes up the space that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> of two feet and a half long employs in making a swing or vibration. The measure is regulated according to the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> or value of the notes in the piece; by which the time that each note is to take up is expressed. The semibreve, for instance, holds one rise and one fall; and this is called the measure or whole measure, sometimes the measure note, or time note; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINIM\">minim</a>, one rise, or one fall; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROTCHET\">crotchet</a>, half a rise, or half a fall, there being four crotchets in a full measure.\n\nMeasure Binary, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">Double</a>, is that wherein the rise and fall of the hand are equal.\n\nMeasure Ternary, or Triple, is that wherein the fall is double to the rise; or where two minims are played during a fall, and but one in the rise. To this purpose, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> 3 is placed at the beginning of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, when the measure is intended to be triple; and a C, when the measure is to be common or double.

Roast meat, boiled meat, and ragouts, were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> among the Hebrews, but we meet with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> kind of seasoning except <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, bitter herbs, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>.\u2014They never mingled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> in any ragout or hash, and never ate at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a> both meat and milk, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, or cheese.

Their loaves were sometimes baked under the ashes, and sometimes in an oven. They also used a sort of bread called \u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03ac. Barley meal was used amongst the Greeks, which they called \u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2. They had a frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISH\">dish</a> called \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03ce\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, which was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, cheese, eggs, and honey, wrapped in fig leaves. The \u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 was made of cheese, garlic, and eggs, beaten and mixed together. Their bread, and other substitutes for bread, were baked in the form of hollow plates, into which they poured a sauce. Garlic, onions, and figs, seem to have been a very common food amongst the poorer Athenians. The Greeks, especially in the heretical times, ate flesh roasted; boiled meat seldom was used. Fish seems not to have been used for food in the early ages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>. The young people only, amongst the Lacedemonians, ate animal food; the men and the old men were supported by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> soup called \u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03be\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, which to people of other nations was always a disagreeable mess. Grasshoppers and the extremities or tender shoots of trees were frequently eaten by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> among the Greeks. Eels dressed with beech root were esteemed a delicate dish, and they were fond of the jowl and belly of salt-fish. Neither were they without their sweet-meats; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESSERT\">dessert</a> consisted frequently of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, almonds, nuts, figs, peaches, &c. In every kind of food we find salt to have been used.\n\nThe diet of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> consisted wholly of milk, herbs, and roots, which they cultivated and dressed with their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>; they also had a kind of gruel, or coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> pap, composed of meal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; this served for bread: And when they began to use bread, they had none for a great while but of unmixed rye. Barley-meal was eaten by them, which they called polenta. When they began to eat animal food, it was esteemed a piece of luxury, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> not to be justified but by some particu-\nMeat, lar occasion. After animal food had grown into com-\nmon use, the meat which they most frequently produced\nupon their tables was pork.\n\nMethod of Preserving Flesh-Meat without spices,\nand with very little salt. Jones, in his Miscellanea\nCarissima, gives us the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the\nMoorish Elcholle, which is made of beef, mutton, or\ncamel's flesh, but chiefly beef, which is cut in\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> slices, and laid for 24 hours in a pickle. They\nthen remove it out of those jars or tubs into others\nwith water; and when it has lain a night, they\ntake it out, and put it on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a>\nto dry. When it is thoroughly dried and hard, they\ncut it into pieces of two or three inches long, and\nthrow it into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAN\">pan</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALDRON\">caldron</a>, which is ready with\nboiling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> and suet sufficient to hold it, where it boils\ntill it be very clear and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> when cut. After this they\ntake it out, and set it to drain; and when all is thus\ndone it stands to cool, and jars are prepared to put it\nup in, pouring upon it the liquor in which it was fried;\nand as soon as it is thoroughly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, they stop it up\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>.

In each of the portions thus separated from\nthe four provinces, Tuathal caused palaces to be erect-\ned, which might adorn them, and commemorate the\nname in which they had been added to the royal do-\nmain. In the tract taken out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNSTER\">Munster</a>, he built\nthe palace called Flachtaga, where the sacred fire, so\ncalled, was kindled, and where all the priests and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRUIDS\">druids</a>\nannually met on the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of October; on the evening\nof which day it was enacted, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other fire should\nbe used throughout the kingdom, in order that all the\nfires might be derived from this, which being lighted\nup as a fire of sacrifice, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> led them to\nbelieve would render all the rest propitious and holy;\nand for this privilege every family was to pay three-\npence, by way of acknowledgment to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of\nMunster.

That which supports it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> of a great many thousand pilgrims annually, for the shops are scarcely open all the year besides. The inhabitants are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, very thin, lean, and swarthy. The hills about the town are very numerous; and consist of a blackish rock, some of them half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> in circumference. On the top of one of them is a cave, where they pretend Mahomet usually retired to perform his devotions, and hither they affirm the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCORAN\">Alcoran</a> was brought him by the angel Gabriel. The town has plenty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and yet little garden-stuff; but there are several sorts of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> to be had, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>, melons, water melons, and cucumbers. There are also plenty of sheep brought thither to be sold to the pilgrims. It stands in a very hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>; and the inhabitants usually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> on the tops of their houses for the sake of coolness. In order to protect themselves from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> through the day, they carefully shut the windows, and water the streets to refresh the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. There have been instances of persons suffocated in the middle of the town by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> called Simoon.\n\nAs a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the people of distinction in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Hedsjas stay in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, it is better built than any other in Arabia. Amongst the beautiful edifices it contains, the most remarkable is the famous Kaba <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Caaba, \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of God,\" which was held in great veneration by the Arabs even before Mahomet's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>.\n\nNo Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DARES\">dares</a> go to Mecca; not that the approach to it is prohibited by any express <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, or that the sensible part of the Mahometans have any thing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to it; but on account of the prejudices of the people, who regarding this ground as sacred, think <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> unworthy of setting their foot on it; it would be profaned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the superstitious, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it was trod upon by infidels. The people even believe, that Christians are prevented from approaching by some supernatural power; and they tell the story of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a>, who having got so far as the hills that surround Mecca, all the dogs of the city came out and fell upon him; and who, being struck with this miracle, and the august appearance of the Kaba, immediately became a musulman. It is therefore to be presumed that all the Europeans who describe Mecca as eye-witnesses, have been renegadoes escaped from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a>. A recent example confirms this supposition. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> of being allowed to preserve his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, a French surgeon was prevailed on to accompany the Emir Hadsji to Mecca, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of physician; but at the very first station, he was forced to submit to circumcision, and then he was permitted to continue his journey.\n\nAlthough the Mahometans do not allow Europeans to go to Mecca, they do not refuse to give them descriptions of the Kaba, and information with regard to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>; and there are persons who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> by making designs and little pictures of the Kaba, and selling them to pilgrims. See CAABA.\n\nThe Mahometans have so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> an opinion of the sanctity...\nsanctity of Mecca, that they extend it to the places in the neighbourhood. The territory of that city is held sacred to certain distances, which are indicated by particular marks. Every caravan finds in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> a similar mark, which gives notice to the pilgrims when they are to put on the modest garb in which they must appear in those sacred regions. Every Mussulman is obliged to go once in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> at least to Mecca, to perform his devotions there. If that law was rigorously enforced, the concourse of pilgrims would be prodigious, and the city would never be able to contain the multitudes from all the countries where the Mahometan religion prevails. We must therefore, suppose, that devotees alone perform this duty, and that the others can easily dispense with it. Those whose circumstances do not permit a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> absence, have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of going to Mecca by a substitute.\u2014A hired pilgrim, however, cannot go for more than one person at a time; and he must, to prevent frauds, bring an attestation in proper form, from an imam of Mecca, that he has performed the requisite devotions on behalf of such a person, either alive or dead; for, after the decease of a person who has not obeyed the law during his life, he is still obliged to perform the journey by proxy.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARAVANS\">caravans</a>, which are not numerous, when we consider the immense multitude of the faithful, are composed of many people who do not make the journey for purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>. These are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, who think they can transport their merchandises with more safety, and dispose of them more easily; and contractors of every kind, who furnish the pilgrims and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> who escort the caravans, with necessaries. Thus it happens, that many people have gone often to Mecca, solely from views of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. The most considerable of those caravans is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, commanded by the pacha of Damascus. It joins at some distance the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, which is conducted by a bey, who takes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Emir Hadsji. One comes from Yemen, and another, less numerous, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of Lachsa. Some scattered pilgrims arrive by the Red sea from the Indies, and from the Arabian establishments on the coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>. The Persians come in that which departs from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAGDAD\">Bagdad</a>; the place of conductor to this last is bestowed by the pacha, and is very lucrative, for he receives the ransoms of the heretical Persians.\n\nIt is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to a pilgrim to arrive early at the holy places. Without having been present from the beginning at all the ceremonies, and without having performed every particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of devotion, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> cannot acquire the title of Hadsji: this is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> very much coveted by the Turks, for it confers real advantages, and makes those who attain it to be much respected. Its infrequency, however, in the Mahometan dominions, shows how much the observation of the law commanding pilgrimages is neglected. A similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> prevails among the Oriental Christians, who are exceedingly emulous of the title of Hadsji, or Mokdasi, which is given to pilgrims of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a>. In order to acquire this title, it is not sufficient that the person has made the journey to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>; he must also have kept the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSOVER\">passover</a> in that city, and have assisted at all the ceremonies of the holy weeks.\n\nAfter all the essential ceremonies are over, the pilgrims next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> move to a place where they say <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> went to offer up his son <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a>, which is about two or three miles from Mecca: here they pitch their tents, and then throw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> against a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> building. This, as they affirm, is performed in defiance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a>. Every one then purchases a sheep, which is brought for that purpose, eating some of it themselves, and giving the rest to the poor people who attend upon that occasion. Indeed these are miserable objects, and such starved creatures, that they seem ready to devour each other. After all, one would imagine that this was a very sanctified place; and yet a renegade who went in pilgrimage thither, affirms there is as much debauchery practised here as in any part of the Turkish dominions. It is 25 miles from Jodda, the sea port town of Mecca, and 220 south-east of Medina. E. Long. 40\u00b0 55'. N.

DESCRIPTION OF <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">MACHINES</a>.\n\nCHAP. I. Machines which illustrate the doctrines of Mechanics, or are connected with them.\n\n1. Atwood's Machine.\n\nAtwood's machine, Plate CCCXXVI.\n\n460. THE ingenious machine invented by Mr Atwood for illustrating the doctrines of accelerated and retarded motion, is represented in figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Fig. 1, 2, 3, and enables us to discover, 1. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> moved. 2. The moving force. 3. The space described. 4. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of description; and, 5. The velocity acquired at the end of that time.\n\n461. 1. Of the quantity of matter moved.\u2014In order to observe the effects of the moving force, which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of any experiment, the interference of all other forces should be prevented: the quantity of matter moved, therefore, considering it before any impelling force has been applied, should be without weight; for though it be impossible to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> weight from any substance whatever, yet it may be so counteracted as to produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sensible effect. Thus in the machine fig. 1, A, B represent two equal weights affixed to the extremities of a very fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> thread: this thread is stretched over a wheel or fixed pulley a b c d, moveable round a horizontal axis: the two weights A, B being equal, and acting against each other, remain in equilibrium; and when the least weight is superadded to either (setting aside the effects of friction), it will preponderate. When A, B are set in motion by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of any weight m, the sum A+B+m, would constitute the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> moved, but for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INERTIA\">inertia</a> of the materials which must necessarily be used in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of motion. These materials consist of, 1. The wheel a b c d, over which the thread sustaining A and B passes. 2. The four friction wheels on which the axle of the wheel a b c d rests. 3. The thread by which the bodies A and B are connected, so as when set in motion to move with equal velocities. The weight and inertia of the thread are too small to have any sensible effect on the experiments; but the inertia of the other materials constitute a considerable proportion of the mass moved, and must therefore be taken into account. Since when A and B are put in motion, they must move with a velocity equal to that of the circumference of the wheel a b c d to which the thread is applied; it follows, that if the whole mass of the wheels were accumulated in this circumference, its inertia would be truly estimated by the quantity of matter moved; but since the parts of the wheels move with different velocities, their effects in resisting the communication of motion to A and B by their inertia will be different; those parts which are furthest from the axis resisting more than those which revolve nearer, in a duplicate proportion of those distances, (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">Rotation</a>). If the figures of the wheels were regular, the distances of their centres of gyration from their axes of motion would be given, and consequently an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> weight, which being accumulated uniformly in the circumference a b c d, would exert an inertia equal to that of the wheels in their constructed form, would also be given. But as the figures are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, recourse must be had to experiment, to assign that quantity of matter, which being accumulated uniformly in the circumference of the wheel a b c d, would resist the communication of motion to A in the same manner as the wheels.\n\nIn order to ascertain the inertia of the wheel a b c d, with that of the friction wheels, the weights AB being removed, the following experiment was made.\n\nA weight of 30 grains was affixed to a silk thread of inconsiderable weight; this thread being wound round the wheel a b c d, the weight 30 grains by descending from rest communicated motion to the wheel, and by many trials was observed to describe a space of about 38\u00bd inches in 3 seconds. From these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> the equivalent mass or inertia of the wheels will be known from this rule.\n\nLet a weight P, fig. 2, be applied to communicate motion to a system of bodies by means of a very slender and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> thread going round the wheel SLDIM, through the centre of which the axis passes (G being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> centre of gravity, R the centre of gravity of the matter contained in this line, and O the centre of oscillation). Let this weight descend from rest through any convenient space s inches, and let the observed time of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> be t seconds; then if l be the space through which bodies descend freely by gravity in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, the equivalent weight sought \\( \\frac{W \\times SR \\times SO}{SD^2} = \\frac{P \\times t^2}{s} - P \\).\n\nHere we have \\( p = 30 \\) grains, \\( t = 3 \\) seconds, \\( l = 193 \\) inches, \\( s = 38.5 \\) inches; and \\( \\frac{P \\times t^2}{s} - P = \\frac{30 \\times 9 \\times 193}{385} = 30 = 1323 \\) grains, or 2\u00bc ounces.\n\nThis is the inertia equivalent to that of the wheel a b c d, and the friction wheels together; for the rule extends to the estimation of the inertia of the mass contained in all the wheels.\n\nThe resistance to motion therefore arising from the wheel's inertia, will be the same as if they were absolutely\n\nDescription lately removed, and a mass of \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) ounces uniformly accumulated in the circumference of the wheel \\(a b c d\\). This being promised, let the boxes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be replaced, being suspended by the silk thread over the wheel or pulley \\(a b c d\\), and balancing each other; suppose that any weight \\(m\\) be added to \\(A\\) so that it shall descend, the exact quantity of matter moved, during the descent of the weight \\(A\\), will be ascertained, for the whole mass will be \\(A + B + m + 2\\frac{1}{2}\\) oz.\n\nIn order to avoid troublesome computations in adjusting the quantities of matter moved and the moving forces, some determinate weight of convenient magnitude may be assumed as a standard, to which all the others are referred. This standard weight in the subsequent experiments is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of an ounce, and is represented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> \\(m\\). The inertia of the wheels being therefore \\(=2\\frac{1}{2}\\) ounces, will be denoted by \\(11 m\\). \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two boxes constructed so as to contain different quantities of matter, according as the experiment may require them to be varied: the weight of each box, including the hook to which it is suspended, \\(=1\\frac{1}{2}\\) oz. or, according to the preceding estimation, the weight of each box will be denoted by \\(6 m\\); these boxes contain such weights as are represented by fig. 3, each of which weighs an ounce, so as to be equivalent to \\(4 m\\); other weights of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) oz., \\(=2 m\\), \\(\\frac{1}{4} m\\), and aliquot parts of \\(m\\), such as \\(\\frac{1}{8} m\\), \\(\\frac{1}{16} m\\), may be also included in the boxes, according to the conditions of the different experiments hereafter described.\n\nIf \\(4\\frac{1}{2}\\) oz. or \\(19 m\\) be included in either box, this with the weight of the box itself will be \\(25 m\\); so that when the weights \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each being \\(25 m\\), are balanced in the manner above represented, their whole mass will be \\(50 m\\), which being added to the inertia of the wheels \\(11 m\\), the sum will be \\(61 m\\). Moreover, three circular weights, such as that which is represented at fig. 4, are constructed; each of which \\(=\\frac{1}{4} m\\), or \\(m\\): if one of these be added to \\(A\\) and one to \\(B\\), the whole mass will now become \\(63 m\\), perfectly in equilibrium, and moveable by the least weight added to either (setting aside the effects of friction), in the same manner precisely as if the same weight or force were applied to communicate motion to the mass \\(63 m\\), existing in free space and without gravity.\n\n462. 2. The moving force. Since the weight of any substance is constant, and the exact quantity of it easily estimated, it will be convenient here to apply a weight to the mass \\(A\\) as a moving force: thus, when the system consists of a mass \\(=63 m\\), according to the preceding description, the whole being perfectly balanced, let a weight \\(\\frac{1}{4} m\\), or \\(m\\), such as is represented in fig. 5, be applied on the mass \\(A\\); this will communicate motion to the whole system; by adding a quantity of matter \\(m\\) to the former mass \\(63 m\\), the whole quantity of matter moved will now become \\(64 m\\); and the moving force being \\(=m\\), this will give the force which accelerates the descent of \\(A = \\frac{m}{64 m}\\), or \\(\\frac{1}{64}\\) part of the accelerating force of gravity.\n\nBy the preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, the moving force may be altered without altering the mass moved; for suppose the three weights \\(m\\), two of which are placed on \\(A\\) and one on \\(B\\), to be removed, then will \\(A\\) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> \\(B\\). If the weights \\(3 m\\) be all placed on \\(A\\), the moving force will become \\(3 m\\), and the mass moved \\(64 m\\) as before, and the force which accelerates the descent of \\(A = \\frac{3 m}{64 m} = \\frac{3}{64}\\) parts of the force by which gravity accelerates falling bodies.\n\nSuppose it were required to make the moving force \\(2 m\\), the mass moved continuing the same. Let the three weights, each of which \\(=m\\), be removed; \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) will balance each other; and the whole mass will be \\(61 m\\); let \\(\\frac{1}{2} m\\), fig. 5, be added to \\(A\\), and \\(\\frac{1}{2} m\\) fig. 6 to \\(B\\), the equilibrium will be preserved, and the mass moved will be \\(62 m\\); now let \\(2 m\\) be added to \\(A\\), the moving force will be \\(2 m\\); and the mass moved \\(64 m\\) as before; wherefore the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> \\(=\\frac{1}{32}\\) part of the acceleration of gravity. These alterations in the moving force may be easily made in the more elementary experiments, there being no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for altering the contents of the boxes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\); but the proportion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> quantities of the moving force and mass moved, may be of any assigned magnitude, according to the conditions of the proposition to be illustrated.\n\n463. 3. Of the space described. The body \\(A\\), fig. 1, fig. 7, descends in a vertical line; and a scale about \\(64\\) inches in length divided into inches and tenths of an inch is adjusted vertical, and so placed that the descending weight \\(A\\) may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in the middle of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> stage, fixed to receive it at the end of the descent: the beginning of the descent is estimated from \\(o\\) on the scale, when the bottom of the box \\(A\\) is on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with \\(o\\). The descent of \\(A\\) is terminated when the bottom of the box strikes the stage, which may be fixed at different distances from the point \\(o\\); so that by altering the position of the stage, the space described from rest may be of any given magnitude less than \\(64\\) inches.\n\n464. 4. The time of description is observed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a>, vibrating seconds; and the experiments intended to illustrate the elementary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, may easily be so constructed that the time of motion shall be a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of seconds. The estimation of the time, therefore, admits of considerable exactness, provided the observer takes care to let the bottom of the box \\(A\\) begin its descent precisely at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> of the pendulum; then the coincidence of the stroke of the box against the stage, and the beat of the pendulum at the end of the time of motion, will show how nearly the experiment and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> agree. There might be various devices for letting the weight \\(A\\) begin its descent at the instant of a beat of the pendulum \\(W\\); for instance, let the bottom of the box \\(A\\), when at \\(o\\) on the scale, rest on a flat rod, held in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> horizontally; its extremity being coincident with \\(o\\), by attending to the beats of the pendulum; and with a little practice, the rod which supports the box \\(A\\) may be removed at the moment the pendulum beats, so that the descent of \\(A\\) shall commence at the same instant.\n\n465. 5. Of the velocity acquired. It remains only to describe in what manner the velocity acquired by the descending weight \\(A\\), at any given point of its path, is made evident to the senses. The velocity of \\(A\\)'s descent being continually accelerated will be the same in two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of the space described. This is occasioned by the constant action of the moving force; and since the velocity of \\(A\\) at any instant is measured by the space which\nDescription which would be described by it moving uniformly for a given time with the velocity it had acquired at that instant; this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> cannot be experimentally obtained, except by removing the force by which the descending body's acceleration was caused.\n\nIn order to show in what manner this is effected particularly, let us again suppose the boxes A and B = 25 m each, so as together to be = 50 m; this with the wheel's inertia 11 m will make 61 m; now let m be added to A, and an equal weight m to B, these bodies will balance each other, and the whole mass will be 63 m. If a weight m be added to A, motion will be communicated, the moving force being m, and the mass moved 64 m. In estimating the moving force, the circular weight = m was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of as a moving force: but for the present purpose of showing the velocity acquired, it will be convenient to use a flat rod, the weight of which is also = m. Let the bottom of the box A be placed on a level with o on the scale, the whole mass being as described above = 63 m, perfectly balanced.\n\nNow let the rod, the weight of which = m, be placed on the upper surface of A; this body will descend along the scale in the same manner as when the moving force was applied in the form of a circular weight. Suppose the mass A, fig. 6, to have descended by constant acceleration of the force of m, for any given time, or through a given space: let a circular frame be so affixed to the scale, contiguous to which the weight descends, that A may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> centrally through it, and that this circular frame may intercept the rod m by which the body A has been accelerated from rest. After the moving force m has been intercepted at the end of the given space or time, there will be no force operating on any part of the system which can accelerate or retard its motion: this being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the weight A, the instant after m has been removed, must proceed uniformly with the velocity which it had acquired that instant: in the subsequent part of its descent, the velocity being uniform will be measured by space described in any convenient number of seconds.\n\n466. Mr Atwood's machine is also useful for estimating experimentally the velocities communicated by the impact of bodies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> and nonelastic; the quantity of resistance opposed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, as well as for various other purposes. These uses we shall not insist on; but the properties of retarded motion being a part of the present subject, it may be necessary to show in what manner the motion of bodies resisted by constant forces are reduced to experiment by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> above described, with as great ease and precision as the properties of bodies uniformly accelerated. A single instance will be sufficient: Thus, suppose the mass contained in the weights A and B, fig. 6, and the wheels to be 61 m, when perfectly in equilibrium; let a circular weight m be applied to B, and let two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> weights or rods, each = m, be applied to A, then will A descend by the action of the moving force m, the mass moved being 64 m: suppose that when it has described any given space by constant acceleration, the two rods m are intercepted by the circular frame above described, while A is descending through it, the velocity acquired by that descent is known; and when the two rods are intercepted, the weight A will begin to move on with the velocity acquired, being now retarded by the constant force m; and since the mass moved is 62 m, the force of retardation will be \\( \\frac{m}{62} \\) part of that force where-\n\nby gravity retards bodies thrown perpendicularly upwards. The weight A will therefore proceed along the graduated scale in its descent, with an uniformly retarded motion, and the spaces described, times of motion, and velocities destroyed by the resisting force, will be subject to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> as in the examples of accelerated motion already described.\n\nIn the preceding descriptions, two suppositions have been assumed, neither of which is mathematically true: but it might be easily shown that they are so in a physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>; the errors occasioned by them being insensible in practice.\n\n2. Machine for illustrating the Theory of the Wedge.\n\n467. This machine is represented in fig. 7, where KILM and LMNO are two flat pieces of wood joined together by a hinge at LM; P is a graduated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> on which these pieces of wood can be moved so as to subtend any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> not greater than 60\u00b0, and a, b two screws for fixing them at the required angle. The back of the wedge will therefore be represented by IKNO, its sharp edge by LM, and its two sides by KILM, LMNO. The weight p suspended to the wedge by the hook M, and the weight of the wedge itself, may be considered as the force employed to drive the wedge. The wooden cylinders AB, CD, have their extremities made like two flat circular plates to prevent the wedge from slipping off at one side. To the pivots of these cylinders, two of which are represented at e and f, are fastened the cords cW, fU, CV, AX, which passing over the pulleys U, V, X, W are fastened to the two bars u v, x w, on which any equal weights Y, Z may be hung at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. The tendency of these weights is evidently to draw the cylinders towards each other, and they may therefore be regarded as the resistance of the wood acting against the sides of the wedge. The cylinders themselves are suspended by their pivots to the threads E, F, G, H, which may be fixed to the ceiling of the room, or to the horizontal beam of a frame made on purpose.\u2014By placing various equal weights at Y and Z, it may be easy to determine the proportion between the power and the resistance when the wedge is in equilibrium.\u2014In this machine the impelling power is the pressure of the weight p, whereas, in the real wedge, the impelling power is always an impulsive force which is infinitely more powerful.\n\n3. Machine for illustrating the effects of the centrifugal force in flattening the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">Earth</a>.\n\n468. Fig. 8 represents this machine, which consists of two flexible circular hoops, AB and CD, crossing one another at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, and fixed to the vertical axis EF at its lower extremity, but left loose at the pole or intersection e. If this axis be made to revolve rapidly by means of the winch m, and the wheel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a> n, o, the middle parts A, B, C, D will, by their centrifugal force, swell out and strike against the frame at F and G; if the pole e, when sinking, is not stopped by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> F fixed in the vertical axis. The hoops, therefore, will have a spheroidal form; the equatorial being larger than the polar diameter.\n\n4. Machine for trying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRENGTH_OF_MATERIALS\">Strength of Materials</a>.\n\n469. The piece of wood, whose strength is to be tried,\n\nDescription tried, is represented by EF, and the force is applied to it by means of the winch A, which winds up the rope BC, passing over the pulley n, and below the pulley m, and attached to the point D of the beam EF. The pulleys slide on two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> bars fixed in a frame, held <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by a projecting point, at G, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> GR, which is graduated like a steelyard, and measures the force employed. The beam EF is held by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> vice IK with four screws, two of which are invisible. When a wire is to be torn it is fixed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> LM; and when any body is to be crushed, it must be placed beneath the lever NO, the rope BC being fixed to the hook N, and the end O being held down by the click which acts on the double ratchet OP.\u2014The lever is double from O to Q, and acts on the body by a loop fixed to it by a pin. See Young's Nat. Philos. vol. i. p. 768, from which this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> and description are taken.\n\n5. Machine in which all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL_POWERS\"><a class=\"xref\" h</a>ref=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">Mechanical</a> powers are combined.\n\n470. The lever AB, whose centre of motion is C, is fixed to the endless screw DE, which drives the wheel and axle FHG. Round the axle G is coiled a rope GHI, which passes round the four pulleys K, L, m, n, and is fixed to a hook at m on the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a>, which carries the weight W. When equal weights are suspended on the lever at equal distances from the fulcrum C, the lever becomes a balance, and the wedge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> are evidently included in the endless screw DE. If the wheel F has 30 teeth, if the lever AB is equal to twice the diameter of the wheel FH, and if the diameter of the axle G is one-tenth of the diameter of the wheel, a power of 1 exerted at P will raise a weight of 2400, suspended at the lower block of the four pulleys.\n\n6. Fidler's Balance.\n\n471. The balance represented in fig. 3. was made by Fidler for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">Institution</a>, and does not differ much from those which have been constructed by Ramsden and Troughton. The middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> A can be raised at pleasure by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> B, and supports the round ends of the axis in the forks at its upper extremity, in order to remove the pressure on the sharp edges of the axis within the forks. C and D are pillars which occasionally support the scales, and may be elevated or depressed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the nut E. The screw F raises or depresses a weight within the conical beam, for the purpose of regulating the position of the centre of gravity. The graduated arc G measures the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the vibrations. Sec Young's Nat. Philos. vol. i. p. 765.\n\n7. Improvement on the Balance.\n\n472. An improvement on the balance is represented in fig. 4, where DC is a micrometer screw fixed to the arm FA, so that when it is turned round by the nut D, it neither approaches to, nor recedes from, the centre of motion F. The screw DC works in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> screw in the small weight n, and by revolving in one direction, carries this weight from S to R, and thus gives the preponderance to the scale G. The recession of the weight n from the centre F is measured as in the common micrometer, and a weight x placed in the scale suspended at A, will be in equilibrium with n placed at any distance Sn, when \\( s = \\frac{Sn \\times n}{FA} \\).\u2014Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures.\n\n8. Machine for shewing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOSITION\">Composition</a> of Forces.\n\n473. The part BEFC is made to draw other parts into the wooden square ABCD. The pulley H is joined to BEFC so as to turn on an axis which will be at H when the square BEFC is pushed in, and at p when it is drawn out. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> G is made to slide on the wire k which is fixed to BEFC, and the thread m attached to the ball goes over the pulley to I, where it is fixed. Now, when the piece BEFC is pulled out, the pulley, wire, and ball, move along with it, in the direction DCF, and it is evident that the ball G will slide gradually up the wire k. It is therefore acted upon by two forces: one in the direction GH, and the other in the direction GC, and will be found at the end of the motion at g, having moved in the direction GG, the diagonal of a parallelogram whose sides are GH, GC.\n\n9. Smeaton's Machine for experiments on Windmill Sails.\n\n474. In the experiments with this machine, the sails <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">Apparatus</a> were carried round in the circumference of a circle, so that the same effect was produced as if the wind had struck the sails at rest with the velocity which was then given them. In the pyramidal frame ABC is fixed to the axis DE, which carries the arm FG with the sails GI. By pulling the rope Z, which coils round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> H, a motion of rotation is given to the sails, so that they revolve in the circumference of a circle, whose radius is DI. At L is fixed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> which passes round the pulleys M, N, O, and coils round a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> on the axis of the sails and raises the scale C, in which different weights are placed for trying the power of the sails, and which, being in the direction of the axis DE, is not affected by the circular motion of the arm DG. The scale C is kept steady by the pillars Q, R, and prevented from swinging by the chains S, T, which hang loosely round the pillars. VX is a pendulum composed of two leaden balls moveable upon a wooden rod, so that they can be adjusted to vibrate in any given time. The pendulum hangs upon a cylindrical wire, on which it vibrates as on a rolling axis.\n\n10. Smeaton's Machine for experiments on Rotatory Motion.\n\n475. This machine is exhibited in fig. 1, where the Apparatus vertical axis NB is turned by the rope M passing over the pulley R, and carrying the scale S. The axis NB carries two equal leaden weights K, D, moveable at pleasure on the horizontal bar HI. The upper part N of the axis is one half the diameter of the part M, so that when the rope is made to wind round N, it acts at half the distance from the axis, at which it acts when coiled round M.\u2014When the rope is wound round N, the same force will produce in the same time but half the velocity which is produced when the rope coils round M, the situation of the leaden weights being the same: But when the weights K, L are removed to a double distance from the axis, a quadruple force will be required in order to produce an equal angular velocity in a given time.\n**CHAP. II. Machines for various purposes.**\n\n1. Prony's Condenser of Forces.\n\n476. The object of this machine is to obtain a maximum effect from an impelling power which is subject to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in its intensity. Let us suppose that wind is the first mover, and that \\( O \\) is the vertical axis of a windmill; \\( c, c, c, c \\) are several radii issuing from this axis, and carrying a wiper \\( b, d \\), which acts upon the corresponding wipers \\( a, f \\), and gives a motion of rotation to the axis \\( a, a, a, a \\), to which they are attached. The wipers \\( b, d, a, f \\) must be so constructed that when \\( b, d \\) ceases to press on one wiper \\( a, f \\), it shall at the same moment begin to act upon the next wiper. Each of the axes \\( a, a, a, a \\) carries a drum \\( t, r, r, r \\), round which is coiled a cord \\( t, p, r \\), passing over the pulley \\( p \\), and supporting a weight \\( Q \\) which can be placed at different distances from \\( G \\) on the lever \\( F, G \\). The axes \\( a, a, a, a \\) also pass through the pinions \\( g, g \\), to which they are not fixed; but these pinions carry ratchet wheels that bear against the teeth \\( r, r \\), so that when the weight \\( Q \\) rises, the rope merely coils round the drum without moving the pinion \\( g, g \\). But when the wiper \\( b, d \\) ceases to act upon \\( a, f \\), the weight \\( Q \\) descends, and then the toothed wheel \\( r, r \\) acts against the ratchet, so that \\( Q \\) cannot descend without turning the pinion \\( g, g \\) along with the drum. The pinion \\( g, g \\) drives the wheel \\( a, b \\), which again drives the wheel \\( C, E \\) by means of the bevelled teeth \\( C, D \\), and elevates the load at \\( P \\). Hence, when the axis \\( O, O \\) is put in motion by the wind acting on the sails, it will first raise a number of weights \\( Q \\) sufficient to put the machine in motion, and will continue to raise new weights while those before raised are fallen, so that the motion once impressed will be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>.\n\n2. Portable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">Stone</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRANE\">Crane</a>, for loading and unloading Carts.\n\n477. This crane is mounted on a wooden stage, and is so constructed that it may be taken to pieces. The frame \\( A, A, A, A \\) is about ten feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> feet long and nine feet wide. The wheels \\( B, B \\) are of iron, and about three feet in diameter. The pinion \\( D \\) that is fixed to the axis of the first wheel \\( B \\) is eight inches diameter, and the other pinion \\( C \\) is about the same diameter. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> are suspended to the rope that coils round the barrel, the workman turns a winch on the axis of the wheel \\( C \\), and raises or lowers the weight according to the direction in which he turns it.\n\n3. Portable Cellar Crane.\n\n478. This crane is represented in fig. 5, where \\( A, A \\) are two wooden supports about six feet high, which are joined at \\( E, E \\) and connected by the iron cylinder \\( C \\) and the wooden bar \\( D \\). The supports \\( A, A \\) are fastened to the edge of the cellar by the iron prongs \\( E, E \\), and the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a> which support the barrel and pass round it are fixed to the iron clamp \\( G, G \\). These ropes coil round the cylindrical bar \\( F \\), which is put in motion by the winch \\( K \\), driving the pinion \\( I \\) about four inches diameter, which gives motion to the wheel \\( H \\), about three feet in diameter. The barrel, therefore, will rise or fall according to the direction in which the winch is moved.\n\n4. Weighing Crane.\n\n479. This crane represented in fig. 6, was invented by Mr Andrews, and weighs the body at the time that it is raising it. The weight \\( W \\) is elevated by means of the levers \\( M, N, O, P \\) which coil the rope \\( H, R \\) round the barrel \\( H \\). The jib \\( E, D \\) stands on a horizontal beam moveable in a vertical plane round the centre \\( F, A \\), and the distance of the upright beam \\( E \\) from the centre of motion \\( A \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) of \\( B, F \\). The weight of the body \\( W \\) is then ascertained by the weight at \\( B \\), which keeps it in equilibrium. The piece of wood \\( C \\) projects from the vertical beam \\( C, T \\), in order to prevent the beam from rising too high.\n\n5. Gilpin's Crane.\n\n480. In fig. 1, where this machine is represented, Gilpin's \\( A, B \\) is the perpendicular stand, formed of two oaken crane planks let into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> iron mortises \\( C, D \\); between these planks is fixed the barrel \\( E \\) with spiral grooves on its surface, on which the chain \\( R, L \\) winds. When the winch \\( N \\) is put in motion it drives the pinion \\( O \\), which again drives the wheel \\( P \\), on whose axis is fixed the barrel \\( F \\), so that the chain is coiled round the barrel and the weight raised. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of this part of the machinery is shown in fig. 2. Figure 3 shows an enlarged view of part of the barrel, and part of the chain lying in its proper position in the spiral grooves or channels. In order to prevent the chain from twisting when it is wound upon the barrel, the lower edge of one link lies in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a>, and the next link upon the surface of the barrel. This will be better understood from fig. 4, which is a section of the barrel \\( F \\), and shows the manner in which one link lies within it, and the other link on its outside. The old method of working chains is exhibited in fig. 5. For a full account of this useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, see Nicholson's Journal, vol. xv. p. 126.\n\n6. Bramah's Jib for Cranes.\n\n481. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of this invention, for which we are indebted to the ingenious Mr Bramah, may be easily understood from a bare inspection of fig. 6, which represents a jib attached to the wall of a warehouse. The jib turns on a perforated axis or pillar. The rope by which the weight is raised, after passing over two pulleys, goes through the perforated axis, and is conducted over another pulley to the barrel of the crane, which is not represented in the figure. In jibs of the common construction which turn in two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> gudgeons, the rope passes over the upper gudgeon, and is confined between two vertical rollers; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> of the rope occasions a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of friction, and produces a constant effort to bring the arm of the jib into a position parallel to the inner part of the rope.\n\n7. Gottlieb's Carriage Crane.\n\n482. This machine, which is useful for carrying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> stones where carts and horses cannot be easily obtained, consists of two sorts of crane wheels applied to the two sets of wheels belonging to the carriage, so that two men, one acting at each winch \\( A, A \\), give motion to the loaded carriage. The pinion \\( B \\), six inches in diameter turns the wheel \\( C \\), three feet in diameter. The wheel \\( C \\) gives motion to the pinion \\( D \\) one foot in diameter.\n8. Common Jack.\n\n483. The common worm jack is represented in fig. 8, and is impelled by the weight W, which is suspended to a rope passing through the pulleys V, R, and rolling round the barrel Q. When the barrel is put in motion by the action of the weight, it drives the wheel KL of 60 teeth, by means of a catch fixed to AB, which lays hold of the cross bars in KL. The wheel KL drives the pinion M of 15 teeth, fixed on the axis of the wheel N of 30 teeth, which gives motion to the endless screw O, and the fly-wheel P. On the axis of the wheel KL is fixed the pulley DG, which, by means of a rope, gives motion to the spit. The axis ET is fixed in the barrel AC; and as this axis is hollow, both it and the barrel turn round upon the axis FD, so that the rope may be coiled round the barrel by the winch H without moving the wheel K.\n\n9. Loading and Unloading Machine.\n\n484. This portable machine, invented by Mr Davis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDSOR\">Windsor</a>, is put in motion by the winch A, which drives the two endless screws C, C. These screws move the wheels E, E, and consequently the barrels connected with them, so that the ropes F, F passing over the pulleys G, G are coiled round the barrels, and the load H which these ropes support is raised into the frame R, R, which shews a part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a>. The barrels and wheels are contained in an iron box L, the sides of which are removed in the figure.\n\n10. Vailloue's Pile Engine.\n\n485. The horses which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> this engine are yoked at S, S, and by moving the wheel B and drum C, which are locked together, raise the follower GH, (carrying the ram Q by the handle R), by means of the rope HH which coils round the drum. When the follower G reaches the top of the frame, the upper legs of the tongs H are closed by pressing against the adjacent beams; and their lower legs are opened, so that they drop the ram Q, which falls and strikes the pile. When G is at the top of the frame, the crooked handle 6, of the follower G, presses against the cords a, a, which raise the end of the lever L (see fig. 2.) round m as a centre, and by depressing the extremity N, and consequently the bar S, S, unlock the drum C and the wheel B, so that the follower G falls by its weight and seizes the ram R. As soon as the follower drops, the horses would tumble down, having no resistance to overcome, were not this prevented by the fly O, which is moved by the wheel B and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNDLE\">trundle</a> X, and opposes a sufficient resistance to the horses till the follower again seizes the ram. When the follower falls, the weight L (fig. 2.) pushes up the bolt Y into the drum C, and locks the wheel and the drum;\u2014and the same operation is afterwards repeated. See Ferguson's Lect. vol. i. p. 118.\n\n11. Bunce's Pile Engine.\n\n486. A side view of this engine is shewn in fig. 3, 4. Bunce's It consists of two endless ropes or chains A, connected pile engine, by cross pieces of iron B, B, &c. (fig. 4.) which pass Fig. 3, 4. round the wheel C, the cross pieces falling into corresponding cross grooves, cut in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> of the wheel. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> at S, therefore, drives the wheel m by means of the pinion p, he moves also the wheel C fixed on the axis of m, and makes the double ropes revolve upon the wheels, C, D. The wheel D is fixed at the end of a lever DHK, whose centre of motion is H, a fixed point in the beam FT. Now, when the ram L (fig. 3, 5.) is fixed to one of the cross-pieces B by the hook M, the weight of the ram, acting by the rope, moves the lever DK round H, and brings the wheel D to G, so that, by turning the winch, the ram L (fig. 3.) is raised in the vertical line LRG. But when it reaches R, the projecting piece R disengages the ram from the cross piece B, by striking the bar Q; and as the weight is removed from the extremity D of the lever, the counterpoise I brings it back from G to its old position at F, and the ram falls without interfering with the chain. When the hook is descending, it is prevented from catching the rope by means of the piece of wood N suspended from the hook M at O; for being specifically <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> than the iron weight L, and moving with less velocity, it does not come in contact with L till the ram is stopped at the end of its path. When N, therefore, falls upon L, it depresses the extremity M of the hook, and therefore brings the hoop over one of the cross pieces B, by which the ram is again raised.\n\n487.

The latter commenced in Duke Adolphus Frederick II., younger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of the duke of Schwerin, and grandfather of Adolphus Frederick IV. who entered on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> in 1752, and whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> received a great additional lustre by his Britannic majesty's taking his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> sister for his consort, and by her own great merit and noble deportment in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> station. Besides the duchy of Strelitz, to this duke belong the principality of Ratzeburg, with the lordship of Stargard, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> commanderies of Miro and Nemo, and a yearly pension of 9000 dollars out of the Boitzenburg toll. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> assumed by both the dukes is duke of Mecklenburg; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WENDEN\">Wenden</a>, Schwerin, and Ratzeburg; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of Schwerin and the country of Rostock, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of Stargard. By the agreement concluded at Wittstock in 1442, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> of Brandenburg, on the extinction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MALE\">male</a> line of the dukes of Mecklenburg, is entitled to their whole succession. The duke of Schwerin has two votes both in the diet of the empire and that of the circle. The matricular assessment for the duchies of Schwerin and Gustro is 40 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> and 67 foot, or 748 florins monthly, including what is paid by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> for Wismar, and the bailiwicks of Poll and Neukloster. To the chamber of Wetzlar, these two duchies pay each 243 rix-dollars, 43 kruitzters. For the government of Mecklenburg, the administration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and the management of the revenue, there is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">privy <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of regency, the demesne chamber, the high and provincial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of justice, to which appeals <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in most causes, both from the consistory and the inferior civil courts, and which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to both the dukes. As to the revenues, those of the Schwerin line must be very considerable, those arising from the demesne bailiwicks and regalia alone amounting to 300,000 rix-dollars per annum. There is a tax on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> that produces no contemptible sum, and that called the princess's tax is fixed at 20,000 rix-dollars: besides all these, there are also free gifts.

This sudden change in \u00c6son astonished the inhabitants of Iolchos; and the daughters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PELIAS\">Pelias</a> were also desirous to see their father restored by the same power to the vigour of youth. Medea, willing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> the injuries which her husband's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> had suffered from Pelias, increased their curiosity; and betrayed them into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of their father as preparatory to his rejuvenescence, which she afterwards refused to accomplish. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> greatly irritated the people of Iolchos; and Medea with her husband fled to Corinth to avoid their resentment. Here they lived for 10 years with mutual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of Jason for Glauce the king's daughter interrupted their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>, and Medea was divorced. Medea revenged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a> of Jason, by causing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Glauce, and the destruction of her family. She also killed two of her children in their father's presence; and when Jason attempted to punish the barbarity of the mother, she fled through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a> upon a chariot drawn by winged dragons. From Corinth Medea came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, where, after she had undergone the necessary purification of her murder, she married King \u00c6geus, or (according to others) lived in an adulterous manner with him. From her conduct with \u00c6geus, Medea had a son who was called Medus. Soon after, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THESEUS\">Theseus</a> wished to make himself known to his father, Medea, jealous of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> and fearful of his power, attempted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> him at a feast which had been prepared for his entertainment. Her attempts, however, failed of success, and the sight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> which Theseus wore by his side convinced \u00c6geus that the stranger against whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> he had so basely conspired was his own son. The father and the son were reconciled; and Medea, to avoid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> which her wickedness deserved, mounted her fiery chariot and disappeared through the air. She came to Colchis; where, according to some, she was reconciled to Jason, who had sought her in her native country after her sudden departure from Corinth. She died at Colchis, as Justin mentions, when she had been restored to the confidence of her family. After death she married <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACHILLES\">Achilles</a> in the Elysian fields, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> mentioned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIMONIDES\">Simonides</a>. The murder of Mermenus and Phereus, the youngest of Jason's children by Medea, is not to be attributed to the mother, according to Elian; but to the Corinthians, who assassinated them in the temple of Juno Acroa. To avoid the resentment of the gods, and to deliver themselves from the pestilence which visited their country after so horrid a massacre, they engaged the poet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EURIPIDES\">Euripides</a> for five talents to write a tragedy, which cleared them of the murder, and represented Medea as the cruel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSASSIN\">assassin</a> of her own children. And besides, that this opinion might be the better credited, festivals were appointed, in which the mother was represented with all the barbarity of a fury murdering her own sons.","sp":229,"ep":229},{"h":"MEDEOLA","t":"Climbing African Asparagus, a genus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the hexandria class, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> method ranking under the 11th order, Sarmentaceae.

By a later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, however, all these were reduced to two; the one called Media Magna, the other Media Atropatia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> simply Atropatene. Media Magna was bounded by Persis, Parthia, Hyrcania, the Hyrcanian sea, and Atropatene, and contained the cities of Ecbatan, Laodicea, Apamea, Raga, Rageia or Ragea, &c. Atropatene lay between the Caspian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> and the Caspian sea.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> originally took its name from Madai, the third son of Japhet; as is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> from Scripture, where the Medes are constantly called Madai. Among profane authors, some derive the name Media, from one Medus the son of Jason and Medea; others from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> called Media. Sextus Rufus tells us that in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> it was called Medena, and from others we learn that it was also called Aria. The most probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the Medes is as follows:\n\nThis people lived in subjection to the Assyrians till the reign of Sennacherib, when they threw off the yoke, and lived for some time in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a>. But at last, rapine and violence, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> consequences of such a situation, prevailed so much, that they were constrained to have recourse to some kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, that they might be enabled to live in safety. Accordingly, about 699 B.C., one Dejoces having procured himself to be chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>, united the scattered tribes into which the Medes were at that time divided; and having applied himself as much as possible to the civilization of his barbarous subjects, left the throne to his son Phraortes, after a reign of 53 years.\n\nThe new king, who was of a warlike and enterprising disposition, subdued almost all the Upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> lying between Mount Taurus and the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALYS\">Halys</a> which runs through Cappadocia into the Euxine sea. Elated with this good success, he invaded Assyria, the empire of which was now much declined, and greatly weakened by the revolt of many nations which had followed the example of the Medes. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEBUCHADNEZZAR\">Nebuchadnezzar</a> or Chyniladan, however, the reigning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, having assembled what forces he could, engaged Phraortes, defeated, took him prisoner, and put him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; after which, entering Media, he laid waste the country, took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> of Ecbatan itself, and levelled it with the ground.\n\nOn the death of Phraortes, his son <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYAXARES\">Cyaxares</a> was placed on the throne. He was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less valiant and enterprising than his father, and had better success against the Assyrians. With the remains of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> which had been defeated under his father, he not only drove the conquerors out of Media, but obliged Chyniladan to shut himself up in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINEVEH\">Nineveh</a>. To this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> he immediately laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> siege; but was obliged to give over the enterprise on account of an irruption of the Scythians into his own country. Cyaxares engaged these new enemies with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>; but was utterly defeated; and the conquerors overran not only all Media, but the greatest part of Upper Asia, extending their conquests into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, and as far as the confines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> masters of all this vast tract of country for 28 years, till at last Media was delivered from their yoke by a general massacre at the instigation of Cyaxares.\n\nAfter this deliverance, the Medes soon repossessed themselves of the territories they had lost; and once more extended their frontiers to the river Halys, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> boundary to the westward. After this we find the Medes engaged in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with the Lydians; which, however, ended without any remarkable transaction: but on the conclusion of it, Cyaxares having entered into a strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with Nebuchadnezzar king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>, returned in conjunction with the Babylonians before Nineveh; which they took and levelled with the ground, putting most of the inhabitants to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>.\n\nAfter this victory the Babylonian and Median empires seem to have been united; however, after the death of Nebuchadnezzar, or rather in his lifetime, a war ensued, which was not extinguished but by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of the Babylonian empire. The Medes, under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTYAGES\">Astyages</a> the son of Cyaxares I., withstood the power of the Babylonian monarchs; and under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a> and Cyaxares II., utterly destroyed their empire by the taking of Babylon, as is related under that article. After the death of Cyaxares, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> fell to Cyrus, by whom the seat of the empire was transferred to Persia, under which article the history of Media now falls to be considered, as also the manners, &c. of the inhabitants.","sp":229,"ep":230},{"h":"MEDIANA","t":"the name of a vein <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> little vessel, made by the union of the cephalic and basilic, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> of the elbow.","sp":230,"ep":230},{"h":"MEDIASTINUM","t":"in Anatomy, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> membrane, formed by a duplicature of the pleura; serving to divide the thorax and the lungs into two parts, and to sustain the viscera, and prevent their falling from one side of the thorax to the other.

But we may safely venture to assert, that even from many enlightened governments it has hitherto claimed much less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> than its importance merits. At the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> this has been too much the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. It is indeed true, that for near 20 years a few lectures on this subject have been delivered at the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, by the professor of the institutions of medicine. But he could by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means consider the subject on that extensive scale which its importance merited. And he had often expressed his regret, that, as in several of the foreign universities, a professorship had not been instituted for the express purpose of giving a course of lectures on medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a>. That defect, however, in medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> at Edinburgh is now supplied. When that able and upright statesman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Grenville, to whom every thing that regarded the laws of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of peculiar attention, was at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of his majesty's councils, a regius professorship of juridical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> medicine was established in the university of Edinburgh by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> warrant.\nAnd there is every reason to hope, that the appointment <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be attended with many effects highly beneficial to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>.\n\nA short view of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> and importance of this subject will, we presume, not be unacceptable to the intelligent reader.\n\nWhatever aid the science of medicine can contribute towards the good of the state, and the execution of its laws, has been by the Germans denominated State Medicine; a new, but not improper, appellation, for that branch of knowledge which many writers have termed Medical Jurisprudence.\n\nIt comprehends both medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a> and juridical medicine. The former consists of the medical precepts which may be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> to the legislature <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to the magistracy. The latter is the aggregate of all the information, afforded by the different branches of medicine, which is necessary for elucidating doubtful questions in courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a>.\n\nAlthough there are some traces of juridical medicine in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTINIAN\">Justinian</a> code; such as determining the real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of birth, with a view to prevent the imposition of spurious children: it properly originated with the code of laws enacted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. under the name of Constitutio criminalis Carolina; in which it is ordained, that the opinions of physicians should be taken, with regard to the danger of wounds, child-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, murder, poisoning, procured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABORTION\">abortion</a>, concealed pregnancy, &c. These directions, and the impossibility which was found of determining many questions by simply legal means, induced some legislators to enjoin, that all tribunals and judges should procure from sworn physicians, appointed to this office, their opinions concerning all the subjects to be mentioned hereafter.\n\nSince that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, it has been treated systematically by many learned men; such as Fortunatus Fidelis, Zacchias, Alberti, Hebenstreit, Haller, Ludwig, Plenck; and lastly, in the most masterly manner, by Metzger. Numberless dissertations have been written on all its parts; and among those who contributed to its advancement, we may reckon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBROSE\">Ambrose</a> Parry, Bohn, Butener, Morgagni, Camper, and Gruner. Collections of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, illustrating its principles, have been made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMAN\">Amman</a>, Daniel, Bucholz, Pyl, Scherf and Metzger. These are only a few of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> writers who have attended to this science: to enumerate more would be unnecessary.\n\nFrom its very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, it is evident how necessary a knowledge of this science must be to every medical practitioner, who is liable to be called upon to illustrate any question comprehended under it before a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. On his answers, the fate of the accused person must often depend; both judge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> regulating their decision by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, while he is delivering his sentiments, his own reputation is before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of the public. The acuteness of the gentlemen of the law is universally acknowledged; the versatility of their genius, and the quickness of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, are rendered almost inconceivable, by constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>. It is their duty to make every possible exertion for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of their client, and they seldom leave unnoticed any inaccurate or contradictory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>. How cautious must, then, a medical practitioner be, when examined before such men, when it is their duty to expose his errors, and magnify his uncertainties, till his evidence seem contradictory and absurd? How often must he expose himself to such severe criticism, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he be not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the subject on which he is giving evidence, and have not arranged his thoughts on it according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> principles? On the other hand, he may deserve and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, by so public a display of judgment and professional knowledge.\n\nSome acquaintance with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of medical science must be useful at least, and sometimes necessary, to judges and lawyers. They will thus be enabled to estimate how much they may depend on the opinion of any physician, and will know how to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> their questions, so as to arrive at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, and avoid being misled by his partiality or favourite opinions.

These good effects are not to be promoted so much by rigid laws, as by recommendation and example. Nor can it be reasonably objected to a system of medical police, that it is a pleasing dream, which flatters the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, but the execution of which is in reality impracticable. As well might we entirely throw aside the rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, because <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> one is able to observe them all; or live without laws, because no existing code is unexceptionable.\n\nMedical police may be defined.\u2014The application of the principles deduced from the different branches of medical knowledge, for the promotion, preservation and restoration of general health.\n\nThe effects to be expected from it are the general welfare of the state, and increase of healthy population; and are to be attained by means of public institutions, express laws, and popular instruction. Instructing the people, and convincing them of the propriety of certain precautions and attentions, in regard to their own and the general state of health, are necessary to secure the good effects of our public institutions and regulations; to obtain respect and obedience in many things, to which no express <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a> can be adapted; and, to induce them to forego what may be prejudicial to the safety of the community, and of themselves.\n\nPublic medical institutions and laws, must be adapted to the country for which they are intended. Many local circumstances, national character, habits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, prevalent customs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>, situation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, &c., make considerable varieties necessary. And many institutions, many a law which would be highly beneficial to the public health, in some circumstances, would be useless, impracticable, and even hurtful, in others. These causes and their effects, must, therefore, be particularly attended to.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> authors who have written on this subject, are Alberti, Heister, Flaz, Frank, Hussey, Metzger, and Hebrenstreit; to whom we may add Howard and Rumford.\n\nThe subjects which it comprehends, cannot be clas- sed very regularly or systematically.

Aged\nObservations on the Means of preserving Health.\n\nHaving now treated of all the most important diseases to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body is subjected, we shall conclude the article Medicine, with a few observations on the means of preserving health, both for the general management of valetudinarians, and of those also who wish to obtain long life and good health by avoiding the causes of those diseases which the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> often bring upon themselves. On this subject much has been written at almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of medicine. And we may refer those readers who wish for a full and extensive view of this interesting subject to a very elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> lately published by Sir John Sinclair, Bart. entitled the Code of Health and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGEVITY\">Longevity</a>. Here we cannot propose to give even an abridged view of this extensive inquiry; but must content ourselves with offering only a very few general observations.\n\nI. Rules for the Management of Valetudinarians.\n\nThat part of the medical system which lays <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> rules for the preservation of health, and prevention of diseases, termed Hygiene, is not to be strictly understood as if it respected only those people who enjoy perfect health, and who are under no apprehensions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, for such seldom either desire or attend to medical advice; but is rather considered as relating to valetudinarians, or such as, though not actually sick, may yet have sufficient reason to fear that they will soon become so: hence it is that the rules must be applied to correct morbid dispositions, and to obviate various particulars which were shown to be the remote or possible causes of diseases.\n\nFrom the way in which the several temperaments are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> mentioned by systematic writers, it should seem as if they meant that every particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> might be referred to one or other of the four; but this is far from being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, since by much the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of people have temperaments so indistinctly marked, that it is hard to say to which of the temperaments they belong.\n\nWhen we actually meet with particular persons who have evidently either,\n\n1. Too much strength and rigidity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a>, and too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>;\n2. Too little strength, and yet too much sensibility;\n3. Too much strength, and but little sensibility;\n4. But little sensibility joined to weakness;\n\nwe should look on such persons as more or less in the valetudinary state, who require that these morbid dispositions be particularly watched, lest they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into preserving those diseases which are connected with the different temperaments.\n\nPeople of the first-mentioned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a> being liable to suffer from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> fevers, especially of the inflammatory species, their scheme of preserving health should consist in temperate living, with respect both to diet and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>: they should studiously avoid immoderate drinking, and be remarkably cautious lest any of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> discharges be checked. People of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> bear evacuations well, especially bleeding: they ought not, however, to lose blood but when they really require to have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> lessened; because too much of this evacuation would be apt to reduce the constitution to the second-mentioned temperament, in which strength is deficient, but sensibility redundant.\n\nPersons of the second temperament are remarkably prone to suffer from painful and spasmodic diseases, and are easily ruffled; and those of the softer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> who have this delicacy of habit, are very much disposed to hysterical complaints. The scheme here should be, to strengthen the solids by moderate exercise, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a>, and chalybeate waters; particular attention should constantly be had to the state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGESTIVE\">digestive</a> organs, to prevent them from being overloaded with any species of saburra which might engender flatus, or irritate the sensible membranes of the stomach and intestines, from whence the disorder would soon be communicated to the whole nervous system. Persons of this constitution should never take any of the drastic purges, or strong emetics; neither should they lose blood but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of urgent necessity. But a principal share of management, in these extremely irritable constitutions, consists in avoiding all sudden changes of every sort, especially those with respect to diet and clothing, and in keeping the mind as much as possible in a state of tranquility: hence the great advantages which people of this frame derive from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of medicinal waters drank on the spot, on account of that freedom from care and serious business of every kind, which generally obtains in all the places planned for the reception of valetudinarians.\n\nThe third-mentioned temperament, where there is an excess of strength and but little sensibility, does not seem remarkably prone to any distressing or dangerous species of disease; and therefore it can hardly be supposed that persons so circumstanced will either of themselves think of any particular scheme of management, or have recourse to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> for their instructions: such constitutions, however, we may observe, bear all kinds of evacuations well, and sometimes require them to prevent an over-fullness, which might end in an oppression of the brain or some other organ of importance.\n\nBut the fourth temperament, where we have weakness joined to want of sensibility, is exceedingly apt to fall into tedious and dangerous diseases, arising from a defect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> power in the proper sets of vessels, and from languor of the circulation in general; whence corpulency, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DROPSY\">dropsy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JAUNDICE\">jaundice</a>, and different degrees of scorbutic affection. In order to prevent these, or any other species of accumulation and deprivation of the animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, the people of this constitution should use a generous course of diet, with brisk exercise,\nMeans of exercise, and be careful that none of the secretions be preserving interrupted, nor any of the natural discharges suppressed.\n\nThese constitutions bear purging well, and often require it; as also the use of emetics, which are frequently found necessary to supply the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of exercise, by agitating the abdominal viscera, and are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to prevent the stagnation of bile, or the accumulation of nucous humours, which hinder digestion, and clog the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>. The free use of mustard, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-radish, and the like sort of stimulating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIETETICS\">dietetics</a>, is serviceable in these torpid habits.\n\nWhen the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of fluids is increased beyond what is conducive to the perfection of health, there arises what the writers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> a plethora, which may prove the source of different diseases; and therefore, when this overfulness begins to produce languor and oppression, care should be taken in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to reduce the body to a proper standard, by abridging the food and increasing the natural discharges, using more exercise, and indulging less in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>.\n\nBut in opposite circumstances, where the fluids have been exhausted, we are to attempt the prevention of further waste by the use of strengthening stomachics, nourishing diet, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> from fatigue of body or mind.\n\nVitiated fluids are to be considered as tainted either with the different kinds of general acrimony, or as betraying signs of some of the species of morbid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which give rise to particular diseases, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a>, scurvy, &c.\n\nDuring the state of infancy, we may sometimes observe a remarkable acidity, which not only shows itself in the first passages, but also seems to contaminate the general mass of fluids. As it takes its rise, however, from weak bowels, our views, when we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to prevent the ill consequences, must be chiefly directed to strengthen the digestive organs, as on their soundness the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of good chyle depends; and hence small doses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a> and chalybeate (either the natural chalybeate waters mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, or the murias ammoniae et ferri) in doses of a few grains, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the child), are to be administered; and the diet is to be so regulated as not to add to this acid tendency: brisk exercise is likewise to be enjoined, with frictions on the stomach, belly, and lower extremities.\n\nWhere the fluids tend to the putrescent state, which shows itself by fetid breath, sponginess and bleeding of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, a bloated look and livid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, the diet then should be chiefly of fresh vegetables and ripe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, with wine in moderation, due exercise, and strengthening bitters.\n\nWhere acrimony shows itself by itching eruptions, uncommon thirst, and flushing heats, nothing will answer better than such sulphureous waters as the Harrogate and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOFFAT\">Moffat</a>, at the same time using a course of diet that shall be neither acrid nor heating.\n\nSo far with respect to those kinds of morbid matter, which do not invariably produce a particular species of disease; but there are others of a specific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, some of which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in the body spontaneously, and seem to arise from errors in diet, or other circumstances of ill management with respect to the animal economy; and hence it is sometimes possible, to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> if not altogether, to prevent the ill consequences. Thus, there are instances where returns of the gout have been prevented by adhering strictly to a preserving milk diet.\n\nThe rheumatism has also been sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a> off by wearing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> shirt, or by using the cold bath without interruption.\n\nCalculus may be retarded in its progress, and prevented from creating much distress, by the internal use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a> and lime-water, by soap-leses taken in milk or in veal-broth, or by the use of aerated alkaline water, which may perhaps be considered as being both more safe and more efficacious, and at the same time more pleasant than any of the other practices.\n\nThe scurvy may be prevented by warm clothing and perseverance in brisk exercise, by drinking wine or cider, and eating freely of such vegetable substances as can be had in those situations where this disease is most apt to show itself.\n\nIn constitutions where there is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> disposition to the scrophula, if early precautions be taken to strengthen the solids by cold bathing, a nourishing course of diet, and moderate use of wine, the constitution which gives rise to the disease will probably be prevented from producing any very bad effects.\n\nThe other kinds of morbid matter, which are of the specific nature, are received into the body by infection or contagion.\n\nThe infection of a putrid fever or dysentery is best prevented by immediately taking an emetic on the first attack of the sickness or shivering; and if that do not completely answer, let a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> blister be applied between the shoulders: by this method the nurses and other attendants on the sick in the naval hospitals have often been preserved. As to other infectious morbid matter, we must refer to what has already been said when treating of hydrophobia, poisons, gonorrhoea, &c.\n\nThe ill effects which may arise from the different species of saburra, are to be obviated, in general, by the prudent administration of emetics, and carefully abstaining from such kinds of food as are known to cause the accumulation of noxious matters in the first passages.\n\nCrude vegetables, milk, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, and other oily substances, are to be avoided by persons troubled with a sourness in the stomach; brisk exercise, especially riding, is to be used, and they are to refrain from fermented liquors: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> drink should be pure water; or water with a very little of some ardent spirit, such as rum or brandy. Seltzer or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRMONT\">Pyrmont</a> waters are to be drunk medicinally; and aromatic bitters, infusions, or tinctures, acidulated with sulphuric acid, will be found serviceable, in order to strengthen the fibres of the stomach, and promote the expulsion of its contents, thereby preventing the too hasty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a> of the alimentary mixture. In order to procure immediate relief, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBA\">alba</a>, or creta preparata, will seldom fail; the magnesia, as well as the chalk, may be made into lozenges, with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> and mucilage; and in that form may be carried about and taken occasionally by people afflicted with the acid saburra.\n\nIn constitutions where there is an exuberance or stagnation of bile, and a troublesome bitterness in the mouth, it is necessary to keep the bowels always free, by taking occasionally small doses of pure aloes, oleum ricini,\nWhen there is a tendency to the empyreumatic and rancid saburra, people should carefully avoid all the various kinds of those oily and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>-seasoned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of diet generally termed made-dishes, and eat sparingly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> meat, without rich sauces or much gravy; and in these cases the most proper drink is pure water.\n\nII. Rules for those who enjoy perfect Health.\n\nThere can be no doubt, that, in general, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a> is the true foundation of health; and yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> physicians, as we may see in the rules laid down by Celsus, did not scruple to recommend indulgence now and then, and allowed people to exceed both in eating and drinking; but it is safer to proceed to excess in drink than in meat; and if the debauch should create any extraordinary or distressing degree of pain or sickness, and a temporary fever should ensue, there are two ways of shaking it off, either to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> and encourage perspiration, or to get on horseback, and by brisk exercise restore the body to its natural state. The choice of these two methods must always be determined by the peculiar circumstances of the parties concerned, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> which they may before have had which agrees best with them.\n\nIf a person should commit excess in eating, especially of high-seasoned things, with rich sauces, a draught of cold water, acidulated with sulphuric acid, will take off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> at the stomach, and assist digestion by moderating and keeping within bounds the alimentary fermentation, and thus preventing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> of too much flatus. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> of ices may be here of real service at the tables of the great, as producing similar effects with the cold water acidulated. Persons in these circumstances ought not to lay themselves down to sleep, but should keep up and use gentle exercise until they are sensible that the stomach is unloaded, and that they no longer feel any oppressive weight about the precordia.\n\nIf a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> be obliged to fast, he ought, if possible, during that time, to avoid laborious work: after suffering severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, people ought not at once to gorge and fill themselves; nor is it proper, after being overfilled, to enjoin an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> fast: neither is it safe to indulge in a state of total rest immediately after excessive labour, nor suddenly fall hard to work after having been long without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>: in a word, all changes should be made by gentle degrees; for though the constitution of the human body be such that it can bear many alterations and irregularities without much danger; yet, when preserving the transitions are extremely sudden, there is a great risk of producing some degree of disorder.\n\nIt is also the advice of Celsus to vary the scenes of life, and not confine ourselves to any settled rules: but as inaction renders the body weak and listless, and exercise gives vigour and strength, people should never long omit riding, walking, or going abroad in a carriage. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FENCING\">Fencing</a>, playing at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENNIS\">tennis</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>, or other similar engagements, which afford both exercise and amusement, as each shall be found most agreeable or convenient, are to be used in turn, according to the circumstances and tendency to any particular species of disease. But when the weakness of old age shall have rendered the body incapable of all these, then dry frictions with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> will be very requisite to preserve health, by accelerating the flow of humours through the smallest orders of vessels, and preventing the fluids from stagnating too long in the cellular interstices of the fleshy parts.\n\nSleep is the great restorer of strength; for, during this time, the nutritious particles appear to be chiefly applied to repair the waste, and replace those that have been abraded and washed off by the labour and exercise of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; but too much indulgence in sleep has many inconveniences, both with respect to body and mind, as it blunts the senses, and encourages the fluids to stagnate in the cellular membrane; whence corpulency, and its necessary consequences languor and weakness.\n\nThe proper time for sleep is the night, when darkness and silence naturally bring it on: sleep in the daytime, from noise and other circumstances, is in general not so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> or refreshing; and to some people is really distressful, as creating an unusual giddiness and languor, especially in persons addicted to literary pursuits. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">Custom</a>, however, frequently renders sleep in the day necessary; and in those constitutions where it is found to give real refreshment, the propensity to it ought to be indulged, particularly in very advanced age.\n\nWith regard to the general regimen of diet, it has always been held as a rule, that the softer and milder kinds of aliment are most proper for children and younger subjects: that grown persons should eat what is more substantial; and old people lessen their quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> food, and increase that of their drink both of the diluent and cordial kind.

href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his father Giovanni. His conduct was distinguished for urbanity and kindness to the superior ranks of his fellow-citizens, and by a constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the wants of the lower class, whom his munificence abundantly relieved. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and moderation, however, could not repress the ambitions designs of the rival families, the Florentines and Medici; for in 1433, Rinaldo de Albizi, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a formidable party, carried the appointment of the magistracy. On returning from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> seat he was seized upon by his adversaries, and committed to prison. The conspirators not agreeing as to the proper method of dispatching their prisoner, one Peruzzi recommended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>, which was heard by Cosmo, who refused to take any other sustenance than a small portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>. In this dismal situation he remained four days, shut up from all his kindred and friends, where he soon expected to be numbered with the dead. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> employed to take him off, unexpectedly proved his friend. Malavolta, the keeper of the prison, relented, and declared that he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> reason to be alarmed, as he hesitated not to eat of every thing that was brought him.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Lorenzo, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a> Averardo, raised a considerable body of men in Romagna and other districts; and being joined by the commander of the republican forces, they marched to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> to relieve him. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> was obtained from the magistracy, by which he was banished to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a> for ten years, his brother to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> for five, and several of their relations shared a similar fate. Padua was in the dominions of Venice, and he received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> before he reached it, promising him their protection and assistance in whatever he should desire. He rather experienced the treatment of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> than of an exile, as they entertained the highest expectations from his great commercial knowledge. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> his life may be considered as one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of uninterrupted prosperity, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> equal to that of the greatest potentates. In his public and private charities he was almost unbounded, and perhaps possessed more wealth than any single individual in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> at that period. In his promotion of science and encouragement of learned men he was truly exemplary, and from this source he acquired the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> and esteem.\n\nHis fostering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> protected the arts as well as the sciences; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, all flourished under his powerful protection. The countenance he showed to these arts was not such as their professors generally receive from the great; for the sums of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> which he expended on pictures, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>, and public buildings, appear almost incredible. When he approached the period of his mortal existence, his faculties were still unimpaired; and 20 days before he died, he requested Ficino to translate from the Greek the treatise of Xenocrates on death. He died on the 1st of August 1464, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 75, and gave strict injunctions, that his funeral should be conducted with as much privacy as possible. By public decree he was honoured with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Pater Patriae, an appellation which was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a>, and was declared by competent judges, to be founded in real merit.\n\nMedici, Lorenzo de, stiled, with great propriety, the Magnificent, was the grandson of Cosmo, and about 16 years of age at his decease. In 1469 his father died, and he succeeded to his authority as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it had constituted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his fortune. In the year 1474, Lorenzo incurred the displeasure of the pope for the opposition\nhe made to some of his encroachments on the petty princes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and for this reason he deprived him of the office of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> of the Roman see, which he conferred on one Pazzi, connected with a Florentine family, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of which he thus secured, and intended to sacrifice Lorenzo and Juliano to his private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>. Their assassination was fixed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a>, April 26, 1478, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in which a monster of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> had resolved to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> them by the instigation of the pope. When the people <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> one of their favourites (Juliano) expiring, and the other (Lorenzo) covered with blood, their rage was not to be expressed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. The interference of the magistrates was finally victorious, who had the courage and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> to hang the archbishop from one of the windows, arrayed in his pontifical robes, which made Florence resound with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACCLAMATION\">acclamation</a>\u2014Medici, Medici! <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with their enemies!\n\nLorenzo was delivered from that part of the cathedral to which he had fled for refuge, and was triumphantly carried home, where his wounds were attended to by men of ability. His friends in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> pursued the conspirators, and spared none who happened to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in their way. In a word, the generality of them were either hanged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> decapitated, and very few had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to escape their uncommon vigilance. Much to the honour of Lorenzo, he exerted all his influence to prevent the indiscriminate massacre of his cruel enemies, and restrain the just indignation of the people, begging that they would trust the magistrates with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of the guilty; and the respect in which he was held had the most astonishing effect in restraining the vengeance of popular indignation.\n\nNo sooner had hostilities ceased between Pope Sextus and the Florentine republic, than Lorenzo began to develope plans for securing the internal peace and tranquillity of Italy, by which the highest honour has been conferred on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> life. But the life of this great man was again brought into imminent danger by the intrigues of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Riario, and some Florentine exiles, who determined to assassinate him in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of the Carmeli, on the festival of the Ascension 1481; but the plot was happily discovered, the conspirators were executed, and after this Lorenzo very seldom went abroad without being surrounded by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of friends in whom he could securely confide.\n\nWhen we attentively examine the character of Lorenzo, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not perhaps appear astonishing, that Italy, Christendom, and even the Mahometans themselves, conferred upon him the most flattering approbation. Even Prince <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIRANDOLA\">Mirandola</a> chose Florence as the place of his residence entirely upon his account, and there ended his mortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>. To a most engaging person Lorenzo added almost every other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a>. He was the favourite of the ladies, the envy of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, and the admiration of all. He was declared to be unrivalled in chivalry, and one of the most eminent orators that the world in any age has produced. According to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of his contemporaries, he was even superior to Julius Caesar himself; except as a general, yet he would also have proved a most consummate commander had not peace been always the darling of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>. We recollect a memorable passage in the Rambler, which may here be appositely introduced. A\n\ngreat man condescending to do little things, is like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> in his western declination; he remits his splendor, but retains his magnitude, and pleases more though he dazzles less. To such little things did Lorenzo frequently submit, often seeking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in his nursery, and spending hours there in all the frivolous pranks of childish diversion. The gravity of his life, if contrasted with its levity, must make him appear as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of two different persons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a>, and, as it were, impossible to be joined the one with the other.\n\nSuch were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> and veneration of the citizens for Lorenzo, that the physician who attended him on his deathbed, terrified to return to Florence, left the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in a state of distraction, and plunged himself into a well. When Ferdinand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> was informed of his death, he cried out, \"This man has lived <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> enough for his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, but too short a time for Italy.\" He died on the 8th of April 1492, amidst a number of his weeping friends, who appeared deeply conscious of such an irreparable loss.\n\nMedicis, John de, on account of his bravery and knowledge in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> affairs, was surmamed the Invincible. He was the son of John, otherwise called Jourdain, de Medicis. His only son Cosmo I. styled the Great, was chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Florence after the murder of Alexander de Medicis, A.D. 1537. He first carried arms under Laurence de Medicis against the duke of Urbino, afterwards under Pope Leo X. Upon the death of Leo, he entered into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of Francis I., which he quitted to follow the fortune of Francis Sforza duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>. When Francis I. formed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with the pope and the Venetians against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, he returned to his service. He was wounded in the knee at Governola, a small town in the Mantuan territory, by a musket <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>; and being carried to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANTUA\">Mantua</a>, he died the 29th of November 1526, aged 28. Brantome relates, that when his leg was to be cut off, and when he was informed that he needed some person to support him, \"Proceed without fear (said he), I need nobody!\" and he held the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> himself during the operation. This anecdote is also mentioned by Varchi. John de Medicis was above the middle stature, strong, and nervous. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, to express their affection for him and their concern for his loss, assumed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a> dress and standards, which gave the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> band to the Tuscan troops whom he commanded.\n\nMedicis, Laurence or Laurenein de, was descended from a brother of Cosmo the Great, and affected the name of popular. In 1537, he killed Alexander de Medicis, whom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. had made duke of Florence, and who was believed to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> son of Laurence de Medicis duke of Urbino. He was jealous of Alexander's power, and disguised this jealousy under the specious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> of love to his country. He loved men of learning, and cultivated literature. His works are, 1. Lamenti, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODENA\">Modena</a>, 12mo. 2. Acidosio Commedia, Florence 1595, 12mo. He died without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>.\n\nMedicis, Hypolitus de, natural son of Julian de Medicis and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of Urbino, was early remarkable for the brilliancy of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and the graces of his person. Pope Clement VII. his cousin, made him cardinal in 1529, and sent him as legate into Germany to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Charles V. When that prince went into Italy, Medicis, yielding to his warlike disposition, appeared\nMedici appeared in the dress of an officer, and advanced before the emperor, followed by several respectable gentlemen of the court. Charles, naturally suspicious, and afraid that the legate intended to do him some ill offices with the pope, sent after him and caused him to be apprehended. But when he understood that it was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> sally of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> in the young cardinal, he set him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> in a few days. The character which Medici obtained by the happy success of this appointment was of essential service to him. He was considered as one of the Supports of the Holy See; and a little before Clement's death, when the corsair Barbarossa made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> into Italy, to the great terror of Rome, which was only defended by 200 of the pope's guards, Medici was despatched to protect the coasts from the fury of the barbarians. On his arrival at the place of destination, he was fortunate enough to find that Barbarossa had withdrawn himself at that critical moment; which allowed him to claim the honour of the retreat without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> his person or his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>. When he returned to Rome, he was of great service in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of Paul III., who nevertheless refused to make him legate to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCONA\">Ancona</a>, though that office had been promised to him in the conclave. Enraged also that the pope had bestowed the principality of Florence on Alexander de Medici, supposed to be the natural son of Laurence duke of Urbino, he was prompted by his ambition to believe that he might succeed to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> by the destruction of Alexander. He entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> against him, and determined to carry him off by a mine; but the plot was discovered before he had accomplished his purpose. Octavian Zanga, one of his guards, was arrested as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLICE\">accomplice</a>. Hypolitus de Medici, apprehensive for his own safety, retired to a castle near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TIVOLI\">Tivoli</a>. On his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to Naples, he fell sick at Itri in the territory of Fondi, and died August 13, 1535, in his 24th year, not without suspicion of being poisoned. His house was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> for the unfortunate, and frequently for those who were guilty of the blackest crimes. It was open to men of all nations; and he was frequently addressed in twenty different languages. He had a natural son named Asdrubal de Medici, who was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a>. This anecdote proves that his manners were more military than ecclesiastic. He wore a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, and never put on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of cardinal except on occasions of public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>. He was wholly devoted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, hunting, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>.\n\nMedici, Alexander de, first duke of Florence in 1530, was natural son of Laurence de Medici, surnamed the Younger, and nephew of Pope Clement VII. He owed his elevation to the intrigues of his uncle and to the arms of Charles V. This prince having made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of Florence after an obstinate siege, conferred the sovereignty of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> on Alexander, and afterwards gave him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> Margaret of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a> his natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>. According to the terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a> granted to the Florentines, the new duke was to be only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> doge, and his authority was tempered by councils; which left them at least a shadow of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> liberty. But Alexander, who felt himself supported by the emperor and the pope, was no sooner in possession of his new dignity, than he began to govern like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>; being guided by no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a> but his own caprice, indulging the Medici most brutal passions, and making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of dishonouring families, and of violating even the asylum of the cloisters to gratify his lust. Among the confidants of his debauchery was a relation of his own, Laurence de Medici. This young man, who was only 22 years of age, at the instigation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> Strozzi, a zealous republican, conceived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of assassinating Alexander, and thereby of delivering his country from oppression. From the moment when he first became attached to him, he tried to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> his confidence, for no other reason but that he might the better have it in his power to take away his life. A considerable time elapsed before he found such an opportunity as he desired. At length, under pretence of procuring the duke a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with a lady of whom he was deeply enamoured, he brought him alone and unattended into his chamber, and put him under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>. He went out, under pretence of introducing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>; and returned along with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSASSIN\">assassin</a> by profession, to whom alone he had entrusted his design, only to stab him. This cruel scene happened on the night betwixt the 5th and 6th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1537. Alexander was only 26 years of age. The Florentines derived no advantage from this crime of Laurence, for they failed in their attempt to recover their liberty. The party of the Medici prevailed, and Alexander was succeeded by Cosmo: whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, it must be confessed, was as just and moderate, as that of his predecessor had been violent and tyrannical. Laurence de Medici fled to Venice, to some of the leaders of the malecontents at Florence, who had taken refuge there; but not thinking himself in sufficient security, he went to Constantinople, whence he returned some time after to Venice. He was there assassinated in 1547, ten years after the duke's murder, by two soldiers, one of whom had formerly been in Alexander's guards. And these soldiers were generous enough to refuse a considerable sum of money, which was the price put upon his head.\n\nMedici, Cosmo de, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a>, joined Charles V. against the French, after trying in vain to continue neutral. As a reward for his services, the emperor added to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of Tuscany <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIOMBINO\">Piombino</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELBA\">Elba</a>, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a>. Cosmo soon after received from Pope Pius IV. the title of grand duke, and had it not been opposed by all the princes of Italy, this pontiff, who was entirely devoted to Cosmo, because he had thought proper to acknowledge him to be of his house, would have conferred on him the title of king. There never was a more zealous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of learning. Ambitious of imitating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> Caesar, he like him, was fond of learned men, kept them near his person, and founded for them the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a>. He died in 1574, at the age of 55, after governing with equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and glory. In 1562 he instituted the military order of St Stephen. His son, Francis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> who died in 1587, was the father of Mary of Medici, the wife of Henry the Great and of Ferdinand I., who died in 1608.\n\nMedietas linguae, in Law, signifies a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURY\">jury</a>, or inquest impanelled, of which the one half are natives of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> and the other foreigners.

It had a temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CERES\">Ceres</a>. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> (says Pausanias) may be supposed to have fallen through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.\" The site (as Dr Chandler informs us*) is now covered with rubbish, among which are standing some ruinous churches. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> has been named from them Dode Ecclesiis, \"The Twelve Churches;\" but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> is reduced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a>. The acropolis or citadel, called also Nisaea, was on a rock by the sea side. Some pieces of the wall remain, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> fortress has been erected on it, and also on a lesser rock near it.\n\nThe village Megara (continues the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>) consists of low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> cottages pleasantly situated on the slope of a brow or eminence indented in the middle. On each side of this vale was an acropolis or citadel; one named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARIA\">Caria</a>; the other from Alcathous, the builder of the wall. They related, that he was assisted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>, who laid his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARP\">harp</a> aside on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, which, as Pausanias testifies, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> struck with a pebble returned a musical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of the wall of one citadel is seen by a windmill. The masonry is of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> called Incertum. In 1676 the city wall was not entirely demolished, but comprehended the two summits, on which are some churches, with a portion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> toward the south. The whole site, except the hills, was now green with corn, and marked by many heaps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, the collected rubbish of buildings. A few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a> are found, with pedestals fixed in the walls and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>; and also some maimed or mutilated\nMegara, mutilated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>. One of the former relates to Atticus Herodes, and is on a pedestal which supported a statue erected to him when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>, A.D. 143, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> and people of Megara, in return for his benefactions and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> toward the city. In the plain behind the summits, on one of which was a temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a>, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> basin of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, with scattered fragments of marble, the remains of a bath or of a fountain, which is recorded as in the city, and remarkable for its size and ornaments, and for the number of its columns. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> was named from the local nymphs called Sithnides.\n\nThe stone of Megara was of a kind not discovered anywhere else in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HELLAS\">Hellas</a>; very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, uncommonly soft, and consisting entirely of cockle shells. This was chiefly used; and, not being durable, may be reckoned among the causes of the desolation at Megara, which is so complete, that one searches in vain for vestiges of the many public edifices, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, and sepulchres, which once adorned the city.\n\nMegara was engaged in various wars with Athens and Corinth, and experienced many vicissitudes of fortune. It was the only one of the Greek cities which did not flourish under their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> benefactor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HADRIAN\">Hadrian</a>; and the reason assigned is, that the avenging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> of the gods pursued the people for their impiety in killing Anthemoeritus, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERALD\">herald</a>, who had been sent to them in the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERICLES\">Pericles</a>. The Athenian generals were sworn on his account to invade them twice a-year. Hadrian and Atticus were followed by another friend, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> is preserved by an inscription on a stone lying near a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> in the village:\u2014\n\n\"This too is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of the most magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DIOGENES\">Diogenes</a> son of Archelaus, who regarding the Grecian cities as his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, has bestowed on that of the Megarensians one hundred pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of their towers, and also one hundred and fifty more, with two thousand two hundred feet of marble toward re-edifying the bath; deeming nothing more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> than to do good to the Greeks, and to restore their cities.\" This person is not quite unnoticed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. He was one of the generals employed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Anastasius on a rebellion in Isauria. He surprised the capital Claudiopolis, and sustained a siege with great bravery, A.D. 494.\n\nMegara retains its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> name. It has been much infested by corsairs; and in 1676 the inhabitants were accustomed, on seeing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> approach in the daytime or hearing their dogs bark at night, immediately to secrete their effects and run away. The vairvode or Turkish governor, who resided in a forsaken tower above the village, was once carried off. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> wonder, therefore, that Nisea has been long abandoned. The place was burned by the Venetians in 1687.\n\nMegara, in Ancient Geography, formerly called Hybla, a town towards the east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>; extinct in Strabo's time, though the name Hybla remained on account of the excellence of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>.

He also took particular care of their young ones, and fed them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> after this, the young serpents crept to Melampus as he slept on the grass near the oak; and, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> sensible of the favours of their benefactor, they wantonly played around him, and softly licked his ears. This awoke Melampus, who was astonished at the sudden change which his senses had undergone. He found himself acquainted with the chirping of the birds, and with all their rude notes, as they flew around him. He took advantage of this supernatural gift, and soon made himself perfect in the knowledge of futurity, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a> also instructed him in the art of medicine. He had soon after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of curing the daughters of Proetus, by giving them hellebore, which from that circumstance has been called melampodium; and, as a reward for his trouble, he married the eldest of these princesses. The tyranny of his uncle Neleus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Pylos, obliged him to leave his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and Proetus, to show himself more sensible of his services, gave him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. About this time the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> charms of Pero, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Neleus, had gained many admirers; but the father promised his daughter only to him who brought into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> the oxen of Iphiclus. This condition displeased many; but Bias, who was also one of her admirers, engaged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Melampus to steal the oxen and deliver them to him. Melampus was caught in the attempt, and imprisoned; and nothing but his services as a soothsayer and physician to Iphiclus would have saved him from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. All this pleaded in the favour of Melampus; but when he had taught the childless Iphiclus how to become a father, he not only obtained his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, but also the oxen; and with them he compelled Neleus to give Pero in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> to Bias.

In his youth he made an admirable progress in learning, and was made Greek professor at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITTENBERG\">Wittenberg</a> in 1529. Here his lectures upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> and the Greek text of St Paul's Epistle to Titus, drew to him a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of auditors, and entirely effaced the contempt to which his low stature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> appearance had exposed him. Melancthon reduced the sciences to systems; and acquired such reputation, that he had sometimes 2500 auditors. He soon entered into an intimate friendship with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a>, who taught <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> in the same university; and in 1519 they went together to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEIPZIG\">Leipzig</a>, to dispute with Eccius. The following years he was continually engaged in various employments; he composed several books; he taught divinity; took several journeys, in order to found colleges and visit churches; and in 1530 drew up a confession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, which goes by the name of the Confession of Augsburg, because it was presented to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> at the diet held in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. All <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> was convinced that he was not, like Luther, backward to accommodate the differences between the various sects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>. He hated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> disputes, and was drawn into them only through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> he was called to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in the world; and therefore would have sacrificed many things to have produced an union among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a>. For this reason, Francis I., the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>, wrote to desire him to come and confer with the doctors of the Sorbonne, in order to agree with them about putting an end to all controversies; but though Luther endeavoured to persuade the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a> to consent to that journey, and though Melancthon himself desired it, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, whether he distrusted Melancthon's moderation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> was afraid of quarrelling with the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. would never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> his permission. The king of England also in vain desired to see him. Melancthon, in 1529, assisted at the conferences of Spires. In 1541, he was at the famous conferences at Ratishon. In 1543, he went to meet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOGNE\">Cologne</a> to assist him in introducing the reformation into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>; but that project came to nothing; and in 1548, he assisted at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> conferences on the subject of the interim of Charles V. and wrote a censure on that interim, and all the writings presented at these conferences. He was extremely afflicted at the dissensions raised by Flaccus Illyrius. His last conference with those of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORMS\">Worms</a>, in 1557. He died at Wittenberg in 1562, and was interred near Luther. Some days before he died, he wrote upon a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> the reasons which made him look upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>; that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of them was, that it \"delivered him from theological persecutions.\" <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> had given Melancthon a peaceable temper, which was but ill suited to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he was to live in. His moderation served only to be his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>. He was like a lamb in the midst of wolves. Nobody liked his mildness; it looked as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he was...\nwas lukewarm; and even Luther himself was sometimes angry at it.\n\nMelanchthon was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in whom many good as well as great qualities were wonderfully united. He had great parts, great learning, great sweetness of temper, moderation, contentedness, and the like, which would have made him very happy in any other times but those in which he lived.

Considering the distractions of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and the infinity of disputes and tumults in which he was engaged, it is astonishing how he could find leisure to write so many books. Their number is prodigious, insomuch that it was thought necessary to publish a chronological catalogue of them in the year 1582. His works indeed are not correct, and he himself owned it: but as he found them useful, he chose rather to print a great number, than to finish only a few: \"which however (as Bayle says), was postponing his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> to the advantage of others.\" His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> was very weak, and required great tenderness and management; which made Luther, as hot and zealous as he was, blame him for labouring too earnestly in the vineyard.","sp":539,"ep":540},{"h":"MELANIPPIDES","t":"in fabulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, a Greek poet about 520 years before Christ.

Abraham being desirous to acknowledge in him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of priest of the Lord, offered him the tythes of all he had taken from the enemy. After this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> mention made of the person of Melchisedec: only the Psalmist (cx. 4.) speaking of the Messiah, says, \"Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.\" St Paul, in his epistle to the Hebrews, unfolds the mystery which is concealed in what is said of Melchisedec in the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>. See Heb. v. 6-10. An infinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of difficulties and scruples have been started on the subject of Melchisedec.\u2014St Jerome thought that Salem, of which Melchisedec was king, was not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Salem near Scythopolis, where they still pretended to show the ruins of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>. The greatness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of these ruins are a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the magnificence of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>. He thinks it was at this city of Salem or Shalem, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a> arrived after his passage over Jordan, at his return from Mesopotamia (Gen. xxxiii. 18.). Some believe that Salem, where Melchisedec reigned, is the same as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALIM\">Salim</a> spoken of in the gospel of St John, chap. iii. 23. From the time of Epiphanes, there were names invented for the father and mother of Melchisedec. To his father was given the name of Heraclas or Haracl\u00e8s, and to his mother that of Ashtaroth or Astaria. It is generally agreed on by the learned, that when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> says, he was \"without father and without mother,\" no more is meant, than that he is introduced into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Abraham without acquainting us who he was, or whence he came, where he lived or when he died. Nevertheless, some have taken St Paul's words literally, and contended that he was not of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> but divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGEN\">Origen</a> and Didymus took him to be an angel; and the author of the Questions upon the Old and New Testaments pretends, that he was the Holy Ghost, who appeared to Abraham in a human form. The Arabic Catena upon the ninth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENESIS\">Genesis</a>, makes Melchisedec to be descended from Shem by his father, and from Japheth by his mother. Heraclas or Heraclim his father, was, they say, son or grandson of Phaleg, and son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBER\">Heber</a>; and his mother, named Salathiel, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Gomer son of Japheth. Cedrenus and others derive Melchisedec from an Egyptian stock. They say his father was called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIDON\">Sidon</a> or Sida, and was the founder of the city of Sidon, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of Phoenicia. Suidas says he was of the cursed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANAAN\">Canaan</a>; for which reason the scripture does not mention his genealogy. The Jews and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAMARITANS\">Samaritans</a> believed Melchisedec to be the same\nsame with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> Shem; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> has been followed by a great number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> writers. M. Juriel has undertaken to prove that he is the same as Cham or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAM\">Ham</a>. It would be endless to set <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> all the opinions upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>; therefore we shall only add, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Comaeus and Peter du Moulin have asserted, that Melchisedec who appeared to Abraham was the Son of God, and that the patriarch worshipped him and acknowledged him for the Messiah.\n\nAbout the beginning of the third century arose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> of the Melchisedeicians, who affirmed that Melchisedec was not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, but a heavenly power, superior to Jesus Christ: for Melchisedec, they said, was the intercessor and mediator of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a>, but Jesus Christ was so only for men, and his priesthood only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of that of Melchisedec, who was the Holy Ghost.\n\nWe shall only beg leave to add here one opinion more concerning Melchisedec, which is that of the learned Heidegger, who, as the author of the Hist. Patriar. thinks, has taken the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> method of explaining the accounts of Moses and the apostle Paul relating to this extraordinary person. He supposes a twofold Melchisedec; the one historical, whereof Moses gives an account in the 14th chapter of Genesis, as that he was king as well as high priest of Jerusalem; the other allegorical, whom St Paul describes, and this allegorical person is Jesus Christ.\n\nAs the history of this prince and priest is so little known, it is no wonder, as Selden observes, that many fabulous accounts have been invented of him; of which the following may suffice as a specimen. Eutychus patriarch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> relates, that the body of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> having been embalmed according to his order, was deposited in a cave under a mountain of the children of Seth; but that Adam before his death had commanded that they should take away his remains from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and transport them to the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>: that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a>, to follow the orders of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, had preserved the bodies of Adam and all the patriarchs with him in the ark: that finding himself near his death, he ordered his son Shem to take the body of Adam, to furnish himself with bread and wine for his journey, to take with him Melchisedec the son of Phaleg, and to go to the place in which an angel would show them where to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> the first man: that Noah added this order, \"Command Melchisedec to fix his residence in that place, and to live unmarried all his lifetime, because God has chosen him to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> in his presence; command him, that he build no temple, nor shed the blood of birds, nor four-footed beasts, or any other animal; and that he offer no other oblations to God but bread and wine.\" This is the reason, according to this author, why Melchisedec, when he met Abraham, brought forth only bread and wine.\n\nA Greek author, under the name of Athanasius, relates, that Melchisedec was the son of an idolatrous king called Melehi and of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> called Salem.\u2014Melchi, having resolved to offer a sacrifice to the gods, sent his son Melchisedec to fetch him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> calves. In the way the young prince was enlightened by God, and immediately returned to his father, to demonstrate to him the vanity of his idols. Melchi, in wrath, sent him back to fetch the victims. While he was absent, the king sacrificed his eldest son, and a great many other children, to his gods. Melchisedec returning, and conceiving great horror at this butchery, retired to Mount Tabor, where he lived seven years, without clothes, and fed only on wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>. At the end of seven years, God appeared to Abraham, bid him go up to Mount Tabor, where he should find Melchisedec. He ordered him to clothe him, and to ask his blessing; which Abraham having done, Melchisedec anointed him with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, and they came down together from the mountain.","sp":540,"ep":541},{"h":"MELCHITES","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, the name given to the Syriac, Egyptian, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a>.

In the next reign the French burnt it; and it was thereby rendered so desolate, that the remaining inhabitants prayed and obtained a discharge from customs. On account of its quarrels with Weymouth, in the reign of Henry VI. its privileges as a port were removed to Pool; but in that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> they were restored to it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of parliament, which was confirmed in the next reign, on condition that Melcomb and Weymouth should make but one corporation, and enjoy their privileges in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>; and to this was owing the flourishing state of both. In the two reigns last mentioned, a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> with seventeen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> was built from hence to Weymouth; to which, as well as its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> contributors were certain citizens of London; and upon its decay it was rebuilt in 1770.

At Gesves one may trade yearly for 250 slaves, 80 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 100 quintals of wax, and as many of ivory. Near the mouth of the river of Gesves is a village called Kurballi, where there is a considerable trade for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>; here are also some slaves and ivory. Rio Grande, or the Great River, runs about 10 or 12 leagues to the south of the river of Gesves. About 80 leagues from the mouth of it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a>, who are considerable traders in ivory, rice, millet, and some slaves. They are called Analons.

This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, with those of Carache, Canabac, and La Gallina, are the only ones where the Europeans may trade with some security.

The river Nunho runs 16 leagues to the south of Rio Grande; it is very considerable, and comes from a vast distance inland. One may buy here 300 quintals of ivory and 100 slaves a-year. Rice grows here admirably well, and is very cheap.

They have, however, not yet made their appearance. But the performance for which he justly deserves to be held in perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> is, \"The Great Importance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">Religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">Life</a>;\" concerning which it may be mentioned to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, that notwithstanding many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> editions had before been circulated, 42,000 copies of this useful treatise have been sold in the last 18 years. It is a somewhat singular circumstance, that the real author of this most admirable treatise should never before have been publicly known (it having been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> attributed to the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Egmont, and particularly by Mr Walpole in his Melo Catalogue); which is the more surprising, as the author is plainly pointed out in the following short character prefixed to the book itself: It may add <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, perhaps, to the reflections contained in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>, to inform the reader, that the author's life was one uniform exemplar of those precepts which, with so generous a zeal, and such an elegant and affecting simplicity of style, he endeavours to recommend to general practice. He left others to contend for modes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, and inflame themselves and the world with endless controversy: it was the wiser purpose of his more ennobled aim, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a> up to those clear rules of conduct which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a> hath graciously prescribed.

He employed his industry, not to gratify his own desires; no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> indulged himself less: not to accumulate useless wealth; no man more disdained so unworthy a pursuit: it was for the decent advancement of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, for the generous assistance of his friends, for the ready relief of the indigent. How often did he exert his distinguished abilities, yet refuse the reward of them, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the widow, the fatherless, and him that had none to help him!

Thus, melody in itself is nothing; it is the rhythmus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> measure which determines it, and there can be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> air without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> then we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> measure.\nmeasure from both, we cannot compare melody with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>; for to the former it is essential, but not at all to the latter.\n\nMelody, according to the manner in which it is considered, has a relation to two different principles. When regarded only as agreeable to the proportions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> and the rules of modulation, it has its principle in harmony; since it is a harmonical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, which exhibits the different gradations of the scale, the chords peculiar to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a>, and the laws of modulation, which are the sole elements that compose an air. According to this principle, the whole power of melody is limited to that of pleasing the ear by agreeable sounds, as the eye may be pleased with an agreeable assemblage of suitable colours. But when considered as an imitative art, by which we may affect the mind with various images, excite different emotions in the heart, inflame or soothe the passions; by which, in a word, we produce different effects upon our moral faculties, which are not to be effectuated by the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> alone, we must explore another principle for melody: for in our whole internal frame there appears to be no power upon which either harmony alone, or its necessary results, can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a>, to affect us in such a manner.\n\nWhat then is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> principle? It is as much founded on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> as the first; but, in order to discover its foundation in nature, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> require a more accurate though simpler observation, and a more exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> in the observer. This principle is the same which varies the tone of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, when we speak, according as we are interested in what we say, and according to the different emotions which we feel in expressing it. It is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACCENT\">accent</a> of languages which determines the melody of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>; it is the accent which determines us to employ the emphasis of speaking while we sing, and to speak with more or less energy according as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> is more or less accented. That language whose accents are the most sensible, ought to produce a more passionate and more lively melody; that which has little accentuation, or none at all, can only produce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and languid melody, without character and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>. These are the true principles: in proportion as we depart from them, when we speak of the power of music upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> heart, we shall become unintelligible to ourselves and others: our words will be without meaning.\n\nIf music does not impress the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> with images but by melody, if from thence it obtains its whole power, it must follow, that all musical sounds which are not pleasing by themselves alone, however agreeable to harmony they may be, is not an imitative music; and, being incapable, even with its most beautiful chords, either to present the images of things, or to excite the finer feelings, very soon cloy the ear, and leaves always the heart in cold indifference. It follows likewise, that notwithstanding the parts which harmony has introduced, and which the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of music so wantonly abuses, wherever two different melodies are heard at the same time, they counteract each other, and destroy the effects of both, however beautiful each may be when performed alone: from whence it may be judged with what degree of taste the French composers have introduced in their operas the miserable practice of accompanying one air with another, as well in singing, which is the native expression of pathos and sentiment, as in instrumental performances; which is the same thing as if whimsical orators should take it in their heads to recite two orations at the same time, that the elegance of each might derive more force from the other.\n\nSo much for Rousseau. The translator, however, has reason to fear, that the causes by which national melody is diversified and characterized, are more profound and permanent than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> accentuation of language. This indeed may have great influence in determining the nature of the rhythmus, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of emphatic notes; but very little in regulating the nature of the emphasis and expression themselves. If Rousseau's principle be true in its full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, he must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> acknowledge, that an air which was never set or intended for words, however melodious, cannot be imitative; he must likewise confess, that what is imitative in one nation cannot be such in another: nor can it be denied, upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, that the recitative, which is formed upon the mode of speaking, is the most forcible of all melodies; which is absurd. His other observations are at once judicious and profound. Though it is impossible to exhibit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and variety of harmony by playing the same melody at the same time upon different keys, admitting those keys to form among themselves a perfect chord, which will of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> preserve all the subsequent notes in the same intervals; yet this perfect harmony would by no means be uniformly pleasing to the ear. We must therefore of necessity introduce less perfect chords to vary and increase the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, and these chords in any complex system of music must of necessity produce dissonances. It then becomes the business of the composer to be careful that these discords may arise as naturally from, and return as naturally to perfect harmony as possible. All these causes must inevitably vary the melody of the different parts; but still, amidst all these difficulties, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> ought to be zealous in preserving the melody of each as homogeneous with the others as possible, that the result of the whole may be in some measure uniform. Otherwise, by counteracting each other, the parts will reciprocally destroy the effects one of another.","sp":544,"ep":545},{"h":"MELOE","t":"a genus of insects of the order of coleoptera.

Called also Moph, and Noph, in scripture.\n\nThough this city is now so completely ruined, that authors greatly disagree concerning its situation; yet Strabo informs us that in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> it was the most magnificent in Egypt, next to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, and called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and there was an entire temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OSIRIS\">Osiris</a>, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APIS\">Apis</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> sacred ox was kept and worshipped.

There was likewise a temple of Venus, and a Serapium in a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> place, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> heaps up hills of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> very dangerous to travellers; together with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of sphinxes, the heads of some of them only being visible. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the city there were many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>; and it contained a number of palaces, at that time in ruins. These buildings formerly stood upon an eminence: they lay along the side of the hill, stretching down to the lakes and groves, 40 stadia from the city. On a mountain in the neighbourhood, there was a great number of pyramids, with the sepulchres of the kings. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, Mr Bruce concludes that the celebrated capital of Egypt stood in the place where the villages of Metrahenny are now situated; in opposition to Dr Shaw's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, who thinks it was situated at Geeza or Gisa.\n\nM. Savary has also shown, that Gisa was not the situation of the ancient Memphis, which stood, he says, on the spot where the village of Memph now stands. Large heaps of rubbish are still to be seen there; but the Arabs have transported to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a> the columns and remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, which they have disposed, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and without order, in their mosques and public buildings. This city extended as far as Saccara; and was almost wholly encompassed by lakes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of which are still subsisting. It was necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> them to convey the dead to the sepulchres of their fathers. The tombs, hewn out of the rock, were closed up with stones of a proportionable size, and covered with sand. These bodies embalmed with so much care, preserved with so much respect, are torn from the monuments they repose in, and sold without decency to strangers by the inhabitants of Saccara. This place is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of mummies. There too we find the well of the birds, into which one descends by means of a rope. It leads to subterraneous galleries, filled with earthen vases containing the sacred birds. They are rarely met with entire, because the Arabs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> them in hopes of finding idols of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. They do not conduct travellers into the places where they have found more precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>.

In a journey into Egypt made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> de Chaulnes, he advanced very far into these winding labyrinths, sometimes crawling, and sometimes scrambling on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>. Informed by Mr Edward Wortley Montague, who has carefully visited Egypt, he arrived at one of those passages which had an opening shut up from without by branches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> tree interwoven, and covered with sand. He remarked there some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a> in relief, executed in the highest perfection. But the Arabs resisted every offer he made them to permit him to take drawings of them, or to mould them, in order to preserve their form. The duke de Chaulnes is of opinion that these hieroglyphics, sculptured with so much art that the objects they represent may be discovered at the first sight, might possibly furnish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">key</a> of the others, whose contours are simply expressed, and form a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a> of this unintelligible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>.

His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> in introducing the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a>, and refining an art which had been so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> and licentious in former times, quickly spread his name over the world. Pliny informs us, that the kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> and Macedon gave a noble testimony of his merit, by sending ambassadors to invite him to their courts, and even fleets to bring him over; but that Menander was so much of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, as to prefer the free enjoyment of his studies to the promised favours of the great. Of his works, which amounted to above 100 comedies, we have had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> loss, the originals being not only vanished, but the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of them, when copied by Terence, having unfortunately perished by shipwreck before they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> Rome. Yet the four plays which Terence borrowed from him before that accident happened, are still preserved in the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>; and it is chiefly from Terence that most people form their judgment of Menander, the fragments that remain of him not being sufficient to enable them to do it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> have said <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> things of Menander; and we find the old masters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a> recommending his works as the true patterns of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> of public speaking. Quintilian declares, that a careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of Menander only, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> satisfy all the rules he has laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in his Institutions. It is in Menander that he would have his orator search for a copiousness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, for a happy elegance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, and especially for that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> genius which is able to accommodate itself to persons, things, and affections.\u2014But Julius Caesar has left the loftiest as well as the justest praise of Menander's works, when he calls Terence only a Half-Menander. For while the virtues of the Latin poet are so deservedly admired, it is impossible we should raise a higher notion of excellency than to conceive the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> still shining with half its lustre unreflected, and preserving an equal part of its graces, above the power of the best copier in the world. Menander died in the 3d year of the 122d Olympiad,\nMenander Olympiad, as we are taught by the same old inscription from which we learn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his birth.

Quintilian, in his judgment of Afranius the Roman comedian, who imitated him, censures Menander's morals as much as he commends his writings; and his character, according to Suidas, is, that he was a very \"mad fellow after women.\" Phaedrus has given him the gait and dress of a most affected fop:\n\n\"Unguento delibutus, vestitu adfluens,\nVeniebat gressu delicatulo et languido.\"\n\nLib. v. fab. 2.","sp":550,"ep":551},{"h":"MENANDRIANS","t":"the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> branch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GNOSTICS\">Gnostics</a>; thus called from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENANDER\">Menander</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>, said by some, without sufficient foundation, to have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Simon Magus, and himself a reputed magieian.\n\nHe taught, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> person could be saved, unless he were baptized in his name; and he conferred a peculiar sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a>, which would render those who received it immortal in the next world: exhibiting himself to the world, with the phrensy of a lunatic more than the founder of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>, as a promised saviour.

The great inconvenience that arose from the excessive multiplication of the mendicant orders was remedied by Gregory X. in a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, which he assembled at Lyons in 1272. For here all the religious orders that had sprung up after the council held at Rome in 1215, under the pontificate of Innocent III. were suppressed; and the extravagant multitude of mendicants, as Gregory called them, were reduced to a smaller number, and confined to the four following societies or denominations, viz. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMINICANS\">Dominicans</a>, the Franciscans, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARMELITES\">Carmelites</a>, and the Augustins or hermits of St. Augustin.\n\nAs the pontiffs allowed these four mendicant orders the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of travelling wherever they thought proper, of conversing with persons of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, of instructing the youth and multitude wherever they went; and as those monks exhibited, in their outward appearance and manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, more striking marks of gravity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> than were observable in the other monastic societies, they arose all at once to the very summit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, and were regarded with the utmost esteem and veneration through all the countries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.

The people were unwilling to receive the sacraments from any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> than those of the mendicants, to whose churches they crowded to perform their devotions, while living, and were extremely desirous to deposit there also their remains after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>: nor did the influence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of the mendicants end here; for we find in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of this and of the succeeding ages, that they were employed not only in spiritual matters, but also in temporal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> affairs of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, in composing the differences of princes, concluding treaties of peace, concerting alliances, presiding in cabinet councils, governing courts, levying taxes, and other occupations, not only remote from, but absolutely inconsistent with, the monastic character and profession. However, the power of the Dominicans and Franciscans greatly surpassed that of the other two orders: insomuch that these two orders were, before the Reformation, what the Jesuits have been since that happy and glorious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIERARCHY\">hierarchy</a>, the engines of the state, the secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> of all the motions of the one and the other, and the authors and directors of every great and important event, both in the religious and political world. By very quick progression their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and confidence arrived at such a pitch, that they had the presumption to declare publicly, that they had a divine impulse and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> to illustrate and maintain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a>; they treated with the utmost insolence and contempt all the different orders of the priesthood; they affirmed, without a blush, that the true method of obtaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> was revealed to them alone; proclaimed, with ostentation, the superior efficacy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of their indulgencies; and vaunted beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, and their familiar connexions with the Supreme Being, the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, and the saints in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>. By these impious wiles, they so deluded and captivated the miserable, and blinded the multitude, that they would not entrust any other but the mendicants with the care of their souls. They retained their credit and influence to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the 14th century, that great numbers of both sexes, some in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, others in a state of infirmity, and others at the point of death, earnestly desired to be admitted into the mendicant order, which they looked upon as a sure and infallible method of rendering heaven propitious. Many made it an essential part of their last wills, that their bodies after death should be wrapped in old ragged Dominican or Franciscan habits, and interred among the mendicants. For such was the barbarous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> and wretched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, that people universally believed they should readily obtain mercy from Christ, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of judgment, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they appeared before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> associated with the mendicant friars.\n\nAbout this time, however, they fell under an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> odium; but being resolutely protected against all opposition, whether open or secret, by the popes, who regarded them as their best friends and most effectual supports, they suffered little or nothing from the efforts of their numerous adversaries. In the 15th century,\ncentury, besides their arrogance, which was excessive, a quarrelsome and litigious spirit prevailed among them, and drew upon them justly the displeasure and indignation of many. By affording refuge at this time to the Beguins in their order, they became offensive to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, and were hereby involved in difficulties and perplexities of various kinds. They lost their credit in the 16th century by their rustic impudence, their ridiculous superstitions, their ignorance, cruelty, and brutish manners. They discovered the most barbarous aversion to the arts and sciences, and expressed a like abhorrence of certain eminent and learned men, who endeavoured to open the paths of science to the pursuits of the studious youth, recommended the culture of the mind, and attacked the barbarism of the age in their writings and discourse. Their general character, together with other circumstances, concurred to render a reformation desirable, and to accomplish this happy event.\n\nAmong the number of mendicants are also ranked the Capuchins, Recollets, Minims, and others, who are branches or derivations from the former.\n\nBuchanan tells us, the mendicants in Scotland, under an appearance of beggary, lived a very luxurious life; whence one wittily called them, not Mendicant but Manducant friars.","sp":552,"ep":553},{"h":"MENDIZ PINTO","t":"FERDINAND, was born at Montemor-o-velho in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, and was at first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> to a Portuguese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>.

About the year 1637, Menno was earnestly solicited by many of the sect with which he connected himself, to assume among them the rank and functions of a public teacher; and as he looked upon the persons who made this proposal to be exempt from the fanatical phrensy of their brethren at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNSTER\">Munster</a>, (though according to other accounts they were originally of the same stamp, only rendered somewhat wiser by their sufferings), he yielded to their entreaties.

East and West Friesland, together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRONINGEN\">Groningen</a>, were first visited by this zealous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> of the Anabaptists; from whence he directed his course into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, Guelderland, Brabant, and Westphalia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> it through the German provinces that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> on the coasts of the Baltic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and penetrated as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIVONIA\">Livonia</a>.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of doctrine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> drawn up by Menno was of a much more mild and moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> than that of the furious and fanatical Anabaptists, whose tumultuous proceedings have been recited under that article, but somewhat more severe, though more clear and consistent than the doctrine of the wiser branches of that sect, who aimed at nothing more than the restoration of the Christian church to its primitive purity. Accordingly he condemned the plan of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> discipline that was founded on the prospect of a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, to be miraculously established by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ on the ruins of civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> and the destruction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> rulers, and which had been the fatal and pestilential source of such dreadful commotions, such execrable rebellions, and such enormous crimes. He declared publicly his dislike of that doctrine, which pointed out the approach of a marvellous reformation in the church by the means of a new and extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of the Holy Spirit. He expressed his abhorrence of the licentious tenets, which several of the Anabaptists had maintained, with respect to the lawfulness of polygamy and divorce; and finally, considered as unworthy of toleration those fanatics who were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the Holy Ghost continued to descend into the minds of many chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEVERS\">believers</a>, in an extraordinary manner as he did at the first establishment of the Christian church, and that he testified this peculiar presence to several of the faithful by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>, predictions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> and visions of various kinds. He retained indeed the doctrines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> received among the Anabaptists, in relation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILLENNIUM\">millennium</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 1000 years reign of Christ upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of magistrates from the Christian church, the abolition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and the prohibition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> enjoined by our Saviour, and the vanity as well as the pernicious effects of human science. But while Menno retained these doctrines in a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, he explained and modified them in such a manner as made them resemble the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> tenets that were universally received in the Protestant churches; and this rendered them agreeable to many, and made them appear inoffensive even to numbers who had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> inclination to embrace them. It however so happened, that the nature of the doctrines considered in themselves, the eloquence of Menno which set them off to such advantage, and the circumstances of the times, gave a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to the religious system of this famous teacher among the Anabaptists, so that it made a rapid progress in that sect. And thus it was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the ministry of Menno, that the different sorts of Anabaptists agreed together in excluding from their communion the fanatics that dishonoured it, and in renouncing all tenets that were detrimental to the authority of civil government, and by an unexpected coalition formed themselves into one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>.\n\nThough the Mennonites usually pass for a sect of Anabaptists, yet M. Herman Schyn, a Mennonite minister, who has published their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and apology, maintains, that they are not Anabaptists either in principle or by origin. However, nothing can be more certain than this fact, viz. that the first Mennonite congregations were composed of the different sorts of Anabaptists, of those who had been always inoffensive and upright, and of those who, before their conversion by the ministry of Menno, had been seditious fanatics: besides, it is alleged that the Mennonites\nThe Mennonites do actually retain, at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, some of those opinions and doctrines, which led the sedulous and turbulent Anabaptists of old to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of so many and such enormous crimes: such particularly is the doctrine concerning the nature of Christ's kingdom, or of the church of the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, though modified in such a manner as to have lost its noxious qualities, and to be no longer pernicious in its influence.\n\nThe Mennonites are subdivided into several sects; whereof the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> are the Flandrians or Flemingsians, and the Waterlandians. The opinions, says Mosheim, that are held in common by the Mennonites, seem to be all derived from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> principle, that the kingdom which Christ established upon earth is a visible church or community, into which the holy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> alone are to be admitted, and which is consequently exempt from all those constitutions and rules of discipline that have been invented by human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, for the correction and reformation of the wicked. This principle, indeed, was avowed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Mennonites, but it is now almost wholly renounced: nevertheless, from this ancient doctrine, many of the religious opinions that distinguish the Mennonites from all other Christian communities, seem to be derived: in consequence of this doctrine, they admit none to the sacrament of baptism but persons that are come to the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of their reason; they neither admit civil rulers into their communion, nor allow any of their members to perform the functions of magistracy; they deny the lawfulness of repelling force by force, and consider war, in all its shapes, as unchristian and unjust; they entertain the utmost aversion to the execution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and more especially to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> punishments; and they also refuse to confirm their testimony by an oath. The particular sentiments that divided the more considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> of the Mennonites are the following: The rigid Mennonites, called the Flemingsians, maintain with various degrees of rigour, the opinions of their founder Menno, as to the human nature of Christ, alleging that it was produced in the womb of the Virgin by the creating power of the Holy Ghost; the obligation that binds us to wash the feet of strangers, in consequence of our Saviour's command; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of excommunicating and avoiding, as one would do the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, not only avowed sinners, but also all those who depart, even in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> instances pertaining to dress, &c. from the simplicity of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>; the contempt due to human learning, and other matters of less moment. However this austere system declines, and the rigid Mennonites are gradually approaching towards the opinions and discipline of the more moderate or Waterlandians.\n\nThe first settlement of the Mennonites, in the United Provinces, was granted them by William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>, towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the 16th century; but it was not before the following century that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> and tranquillity were fixed upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> foundations, when, by a confession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> published in the year 1626, they cleared themselves from the imputations of those pernicious and detestable errors that had been laid to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>. In order to appease their intestine discords, a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the Anabaptists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>, Germany, and Friesland, concluded their debates in a conference held at Amsterdam, in the year 1630, and entered into the bonds of fraternal communion, each reserving to themselves a liberty of retaining certain opinions.

This traffic alone would make the place very lively; but, besides this, it has very fruitful vineyards. The hill, at the foot of which it lies, and one side of which is made by the gullet through which the Nahe runs into the Rhine, forms another steep rock behind this gullet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the Rhine and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> Rudesheimer mountain; it therefore enjoys the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> as this does, which makes the Budesheimer wine that grows on it little inferior to the true Rudesheimer. See **Rudesheim**. The rising grounds about it produce wines that are esteemed preferable to those of Bacharac, so much in vogue hitherto.\u20143. Elfeld, five miles west from Mentz, is a strong fortified town, on the north side of the Rhine, and the chief of the Rhinegau.\u2014Here is Rudesheim, a place noted for the growth of the best wines in these parts. 4. Weisbaden lies between six and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> leagues from Francfort, and about five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> six miles north of Mentz; it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> of a country belonging to the branch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NASSAU\">Nassau</a>-Saarbrak, and is famous for its mineral waters.\n\nAccording to Riesbeck, the see of Mentz was indebted for its increase of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> to St Boniface, who may be called, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> of the Germans. It was this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, an Englishman by birth, who in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a> baptized Witikind and the other brave Saxons who had so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> resisted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a> with their swords, and spread the empire of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICAR\">vicar</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ as far as the northern and eastern seas. He it was who introduced the Roman liturgy into Germany, and made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> inhabitants abstain from eating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>. He raised the papal power to a higher pitch than it had been raised in any other country in Christendom; and, in recompense of his services, the pope made all the new founded bishoprics in the north of Germany subject to the see of Mentz, which Boniface\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> had chosen for his residence. The provinces, the most considerable in the whole papal dominions, all Suabia, Franconia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>, and almost all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, with a part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>, and the Upper Rhine, belonged to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>. Though the reformation, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> changes lessened it one-third, it still contained, before the French revolution, the archbishopric of Spirengel, and eleven bishoprics, which are the most considerable of Germany, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WURZBURG\">Wurzburg</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PADERBORN\">Paderborn</a>, &c. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of the papal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> was completed by Gregory VII. the archbishops of Mentz became powerful enough to be at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the empire. In the 13th and 14th centuries, they were so eminent as to be able to make emperors without any foreign assistance; and it was to one of them that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Hapsburg was indebted for its first elevation. After the boundaries of the two powers were more accurately ascertained, and the temporal got so much the better of the spiritual, the power and influence of the archbishops of this place were of course much reduced; still, however, they possessed very important prerogatives, which they might have exerted with much more efficacy than they did, were it not that various circumstances rendered them too dependent on the emperors. They were still the speakers in the electoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, had the appointment of the diets under the emperors, and might order a re-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the proceedings of the imperial courts. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> privileges were, however, too much subject to the control of the house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>. Though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Mentz did not absolutely possess the largest, yet he certainly had the richest and most peopled domain of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> potentate in Germany. The country, it is true, does not contain more than 125 German miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, whereas the archbishopric of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALZBURG\">Salzburg</a> contains 240; but then Salzburg has only 250,000 inhabitants, whereas Mentz has 320,000. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> riches of the territory of Mentz, and its advantageous situation, make a subject of Mentz much richer than one of Salzburg, the greatest part of which is only inhabited by herdsmen. In the territory of Mentz there were 40 cities; in that of Salzburg only seven. The tax on vessels which went <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the Rhine, of itself produced 60,000 guilders or 6000l. a-year, which is nearly as much as all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of Salzburg put together, excepting only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> mine at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALLE\">Halle</a>. The tax on wine, here and in the country round, produced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> above 100,000 guilders or 10,000l. a-year, in which sum we do not reckon the customs of the countries which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> at a greater distance. Upon the whole, the income of the archbishop might amount to 1,700,000 guilders, or 170,000l.\n\nAt the settling of the indemnities in 1802, all that part of the diocese which lay on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of the Maine was given to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of Nassau-Usingen, except the bailiwick of Aschaffenburg. It was then determined that the electoral title should, from that time, be elector of Aschaffenburg, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of Wetzlar; that he should still continue archchancellor of the empire, and hold his office at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATISBON\">Ratisbon</a>, with some abbeys and other indemnities, so as to yield an annual revenue of a million of florins. His jurisdiction as metropolitan of the German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> to extend over all Germany, except the Prussian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a>. The noblest production of this territory is the wine, which is almost the only true Rhenish. Connoisseurs, indeed, allow the wines of Neirstein, Baccarach, and a very few other places out of this country, to be true Rhenish: but they do not give this name to the wines of the Palatinate, of Bardon, and of Alsata. There is a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of wine made in the countries which lie on the south and west of the Rhine, at Laubenheim, Bodenheim, Budesheim, and Bingen; but the true Rhenish, that which inspires so many who are and so many who are not poets, comes only from the Rhinegau, which lies on the northern banks of the Rhine. See Rhine-gau.\n\nThe civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> establishments of the archbishop, like those of the other German princes, were upon a scale disproportionate to his territories. \"He has,\" says Baron Riesbeck, his ministers, his counsellors of state, and eighty or ninety privy counsellors of various denominations. The expense of this establishment is very disproportionate to the revenue of the state. This is owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, who can only accept of employments of this kind. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">Ignorance</a> of the true principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> are the causes of this evil. The consequences are, that a great number of persons, who might be usefully employed, live in idleness. Even the military establishment of the country appears to me more calculated for the purpose of feeding a hungry nobility than for real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. At the accession of the present elector, though the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> only consisted of 2200 men, there were six generals. The regular establishment paid for and supported by the country is 8000 men; but though there are only 2000 men kept up, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> expended for their support, particularly that given to numberless useless officers, might be made use of more for the benefit of the country. The army of the archbishop consists of a German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> of 50 men and 25 horses, a Swiss guard, a squadron of hussars of 130 men (the most useful troops, as they purge the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of robbers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MURDERERS\">murderers</a>), a corps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a> of 104 men, three regiments of infantry of 600 men each, and some companies belonging to the armies of Franconia and the Upper Palatinate. Of the fortifications of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> we may say much the same as of the army. Were they, indeed, improved and kept up as they ought to be, they would vie with Luxemburg, and be the most powerful of all the barriers against France. It is true, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the ground does not allow of a regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>; but for single parts, I have seen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> place of the same capabilities, where greater advantages has been taken of the ground for the erection of the several works. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, as well as size of them, is indeed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of great wonder; but though the circle of the Upper Rhine, and even the empire in general, has laid out great sums on the building these fortifications, parts of them are not finished, and parts of them are ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to pieces. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, indeed, would require a great army to man them. But this, as well as the maintaining and keeping them up, is evidently beyond the power of this court, or indeed of the whole circle of the Upper Rhine united. They are, therefore, also\nMentz, a considerable town of Germany, in the circle of the Lower Rhine, and capital of the late electorate of the same name, is situated on the Rhine near its confluence with the Maine, 20 miles north-west of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORMS\">Worms</a>, 15 west of Francfort, and 75 east of Triers, in E. Long. 8\u00b0 20' N. Lat. 40\u00b0 51'. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> claims a right to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a>: (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Printing). Here is a very beautiful quay along the river, defended by several works well fortified with cannon. That part of the city which extends towards the river is most populous. The best vineyards for Rhenish wine being in this neighbourhood, Mentz has a flourishing trade in that commodity more particularly; and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> is the brisker, by reason that all the merchandise which passes up and down the Rhine stops in its harbour to change bottoms.\n\nThe northern part of the city, in which the archbishop resides, is full of very regular buildings. Here are three regular streets, called the Bleichen, which run parallel to each other from the banks of the Rhine to 600 yards within the city, and are cut almost regularly by very pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> streets. The archbishop's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> has a most commanding view of these streets, the Rhine, and the Rhineau. There are also some good buildings in the old part of the city. The market of beasts is extremely well worth seeing; and you here and there meet with other agreeable spots. The market in the middle of the town, though not regular, is one of the prettiest places in Germany. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> is well worth notice. It is an immense large old Gothic building, the spire of which was struck with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> many years ago, and entirely laid in ashes. As it contained much wood, it burned 14 hours before it was entirely consumed. To prevent these accidents for the future, the chapter had the present one built to the same height in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, an undertaking which cost them 40,000 guilders or 400cl. It is a great pity (Baron Riesbeck observes) that it is overloaded with small ornaments: and a still greater, that this wonderful edifice is so choked up with shops and houses as to be hardly more than half visible. As, however, houses and shops are very dear in this part of the town, one cannot be very angry with the chapter for choosing rather to make the most of its ground, than to show off the church to the best advantage. The rent of a shop and a single room to live in is 150 guilders or 15l. per annum in this part of the town. There is hardly another church in Germany of the height and length of this cathedral; and the inside of it is decorated with several magnificent monuments of princes and other great personages. Besides the cathedral, the city of Mentz contains several other churches in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> style, very well worth seeing. St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>'s, and the Jesuits church, though both too much loaded with ornament, are among this number. The church of the Augustins, of which the inhabitants of Mentz are so proud, is a masterpiece of bad taste; but that of Ignatius, though little is said about it, would be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of the antique, if here likewise there had not been too much ornament lavished. Upon the whole, the palaces of the noblesse want that noble simplicity which alone constitutes true beauty and magnificence. In another century the externals of the city <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be quite changed. The late prince built a great deal, and the present has a taste for the same sort of expense. The monks and governors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a> also have been forced to rebuild their houses; so that when a few more streets are made broader and straighter, the whole will have no bad appearance. The inhabitants, who together with the garrison amount to 30,000, are a good kind of people, and, like all the catholics of Germany, make great account of a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. Their faces are interesting, and they are not deficient either in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>.\n\nThere are few cities in Germany besides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a> which contain so rich and numerous a nobility as this does: there are some houses here which have estates of 100,000 guilders, or 10,000l. a-year. The counts of Bassenheim, Schonborn, Stadion, Ingelheim, Elz, Ostein, and Walderdorf, and the lords of Dahlberg, Breitenbach, with some others, have incomes of from 30,000 to 100,000 guilders. Sixteen or eighteen houses have from 15,000 to 30,000 guilders annual revenue. The nobility of this place are said to be some of the oldest and most untainted in Germany. There are amongst them many persons of extraordinary merit, who join uncommon knowledge to all the duties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Upon the whole, they are far superior to the greater part of the German nobility. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, however, is still too stiff. The first minister of the court was refused admittance into their assemblies for not being sufficiently noble; and they think they degrade themselves by keeping <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with bourgois.\n\nThe clergy of this place are the richest in Germany. A canonry brings in 3,500 Rhenish guilders in a moderate year. The canonry of the provost brings him in 40,000 guilders a-year; and each of the deaneries is worth 2000 guilders. The income of the chapter altogether amounts to 300,000 guilders. Though it is forbidden by the canons of the church for any one to have more than a single prebend, there is not an ecclesiastic in this place who has not three or four; so that there is hardly a man amongst them who has not at least 8000 guilders a-year. The last provost, a count of Elz, had prebends enough to procure him an income of 75,000 guilders. Exclusive of the cathedral, there are several other choirs in which the canonries bring in from 1200 to 1500 guilders a-year. To give an idea of the riches of the monasteries of this place, Baron Riesbeck informs us, that at the destruction of the Jesuits, their wine, which was reckoned to sell extremely cheap, produced 120,000 rixdollars. A little while ago the elector abolished one Carthusian convent and two nunneries, in the holy cellars of which there was found wine for at least 500,000 rixdollars.\n\n\"Notwithstanding this great wealth (continues our author), there is not a more regular clergy in all Germany. There is no diocese, in which the regulations made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a> have been more strictly adhered to than they have here; the archbishops having made a particular point of it both at the time of the reformation and ever since. One thing which greatly contributes to keep up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> is the not suffering any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> to remain in the country who...\"\nwho has not fixed and stated duties, and a revenue annexed to them. Most of the irregularities in Bavaria, Austria, and other countries, arise from abb\u00e9s who are obliged to subsist by their daily industry and any masses which they can pick up. These creatures are entirely unknown here. The theological tenets of this court are also much purer than those of any other ecclesiastical prince in Germany. I was pleased to see the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> people, especially in the country. I was told that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of it was not forbidden in any part of the diocese; only persons were enjoined not to read it through, without the advice of their confessors. For a long time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> has been hunted through its utmost recesses; and though it is not quite possible to get entirely clear of pilgrimages and wonder-working images, you will meet with no priest bold enough to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> or to preach such nonsense as we hear in the pulpits of other German churches.\"\n\nThough the trade of this place has been constantly on the increase for these 18 or 20 years past, yet it is by no means what it ought to be from the situation and other advantages. The persons here who call themselves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, and who make any considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, are in fact only brokers. A few toy-shops, five or six druggists, and four or five manufacturers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, are all that can possibly be called traders. There is not a banker in the whole town; and yet this country enjoys the staple privilege, and commands by means of the Maine, Neckar, and Rhine, all the exports and imports of Alsatia, the Palatinate, Franconia, and a part of Swabia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESSE\">Hesse</a>, as far as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NETHERLANDS\">Netherlands</a>. The port too is constantly filled with ships, but few of them contain any merchandise belonging to the inhabitants of the place. The French took it by surprise in October 1792; it surrendered to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a> in 1793; but the French again got possession of it in October 1797; and it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> united to the French empire till 1814, when it passed into the hands of the allies.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CZAR\">czar</a> remitted the fine; and having restored him to favour, gave him the command of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> in the Ukraine in 1719, and sent him as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> into Poland in 1722. Constantly employed about the means of preserving his influence after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his master, who was then evidently on the decline, Menzikoff discovered the person to whom the czar intended to leave the succession. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> was highly offended, and his penetration cost him the principality of Plescoff. Under the czarina Catherine, however, he was higher in favour than ever; because, on the death of the czar in 1725, he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> in bringing different parties in Russia to agree to her succession. This princess was not ungrateful. In appointing her son-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a> Peter II. to be her successor, she commanded him to marry the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Menzikoff, and gave the czar's sister to his son. The parties were actually betrothed: and Menzikoff was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Cozel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a> to the czar. But this summit of elevation was the prelude to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>. The Dolgoroukis, favourites of the czar, had influence enough to procure his banishment, together with that of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, to one of his own estates at the distance of 250 leagues from Moscow. He had the imprudence to leave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> with the splendor and magnificence of a governor going to take possession of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>. His enemies took advantage of this circumstance to inflame the indignation of the czar. At some distance from Moscow he was overtaken by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>. The officer who commanded them made him alight from his chariot, which he sent back to Moscow; and placed him and his whole family in covered waggons, to be conducted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of peasants. When he arrived at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of his destination, he was presented with cows and sheep big with young, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a>, without knowing from whom he received the favour. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> was a simple cottage; and his employment was to cultivate the ground, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to superintend its cultivation. New causes of sorrow were added to the severities of exile. His wife died in the journey; he had the misfortune to lose\nMenzikoff one of his daughters by the smallpox; and his other two children were seized with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, but recovered. He sunk under his misfortunes, November 2, 1729; and was buried beside his daughter, in a little chapel which he had built. His misfortunes had inspired him with sentiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, which, amid the splendor of his former situation, he had altogether neglected. His two surviving children enjoyed greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> after the death of their father. The officer permitted them to attend public worship on Sundays by turns. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> when his daughter was returning from the village, she heard herself accosted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a> from the window of a cottage, and, to her great surprise, recognised in this peasant the persecutor of her family, Dolgorouki; who, in his turn, had fallen a sacrifice to the intrigues of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. She communicated this intelligence to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, who could not behold, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a>, this new instance of the vanity and instability of honours and power. Young Menzikoff and his sister were soon after recalled to Moscow by the czarina <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNA\">Anna</a>; and left Dolgorouki in possession of their cottage. He was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> of the guards, and received the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his father's possessions.

Maknassa, its founder, built it first at the bottom of a valley; but Muley Ismael extended it considerably over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that lies to the west of the valley. It is surrounded with well cultivated fields and hills, adorned with gardens and olive plantations, and abundantly watered with rivulets. Accordingly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> stuffs thrive here exceedingly, and even the superior urbanity of the inhabitants announces the temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. The winter indeed is very inconvenient, on account of the dirtiness of the town, the streets not being paved, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> being slimy.\n\nMequinez is surrounded with walls; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> itself is fortified with two bastions, on which formerly some small guns were mounted. Muley Ismael, and Muley <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABDALLAH\">Abdallah</a>, often in this city resisted the efforts of the Brebes, the sworn enemies of their tyranny. To the west are seen some walls of circumvallation, six feet in height, which were probably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> intrenchments for the infantry; the attacks of the Brebes being only sudden and momentary inroads, which did not require a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>. There is at Mequinez, as well as at Morocco, a walled and guarded suburb for the Jews. The houses are neater here than at Morocco. The Jews here are more numerous; and they can turn their industry to greater account, because the Moors in this city are more polished, and (being nearer to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>) more visited, than those in the southern parts. Near the Jewry, there is another enclosed and separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, called the Negro town. It was built by Muley Ismael, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> families which composed his soldiery. This town is now uninhabited, as are all those destined for the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> through the rest of the empire.\n\nAt the south-east extremity of the city stands the palace of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, which was built by Muley Ismael. The space occupied by this palace is very great; it includes several gardens, elegantly disposed, and well watered. There is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> garden in the centre, surrounded by a vast and pretty regular gallery resting on columns, which communicates with the apartments. Those of the women are very spacious, and have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with a large chamber which looks into the garden. As you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> from one apartment to another, you find at intervals regular courts paved with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> pieces of black and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> marble; in the middle of these courts is a marble basin, from the centre of which rises a jet d'eau, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> falls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into this basin. These fountains are numerous in the palace; they are useful for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> purposes, and they serve for the ablutions, which the scruples of the Mahometans have exceedingly multiplied. The palaces of the Moorish kings are large, because they are composed only of one range of apartments; these are long and narrow, from 18 to 20 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>; they have few ornaments, and receive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> by two large folding doors, which are opened more or less as occasion requires. The rooms are always lighted from a square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> in the centre, which is generally encompassed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLONNADE\">colonnade</a>.\n\nThe Moors here are more courteous than those in the southern parts; they are civil to strangers, and invite them into their gardens, which are very neat. The women in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the empire are beautiful; they have a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>, with fine black eyes, and white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>.

On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> it was bounded by the Humber and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERSEY\">Mersey</a>, which separated it from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a>; on the east by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and the territories of the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLES\">Angles</a> and Saxons; on the south by the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>; and on the west by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEVERN\">Severn</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEE\">Dee</a>.

Penda assumed the regal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> A.D. 626, and was of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 50 at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his accession; after which he reigned near thirty years. He was of a most furious and turbulent temper, breaking at different times with almost all his neighbours, calling in the Britons to his assistance, and shedding more Saxon blood than had been hitherto spilled in all their intestine quarrels. He killed two kings of Northumberland, three of the East Angles, and compelled Kenwall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of the West Saxons to quit his dominions. He was at length slain, with most of the princes of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and a multitude of his subjects, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> fought not far from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEEDS\">Leeds</a>, by Oswy king of Northumberland. This battle, which the Saxon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHRONICLE\">chronicle</a> tells us was fought at Winwidfield, A.D. 655, made a great change in the Saxon affairs, which the unbridled fury of Penda had thrown into great confusion. He had the year before killed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNA\">Anna</a> king of the East Angles in battle, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ETHELRED\">Ethelred</a> notwithstanding took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> with Penda. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, Penda, the eldest son of Penda, to whom his father had given the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> kingdom of the Mid Angles, had two years before married the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of King Oswy, and had been baptized at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. At that time it should seem that Oswy and Penda were upon good terms; but after the latter had conquered the East Angles, he resolved to turn his arms against the kingdom of Northumberland. Oswy by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means had provoked this rupture; on the contrary, Bede tells us that he offered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> sums of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and jewels of great value, to purchase peace: these offers being rejected, he was reduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of deciding the quarrel by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>. The river near which the battle was fought overflowing, there were more drowned than killed. Amongst these, as the Saxon chronicle says, there were thirty princes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> line, some of whom bore the title of kings; and also Ethelred king of the East Angles, who fought on the side of Penda against his family and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.\n\nHis son Penda, who married the daughter of that conqueror became a Christian, and was not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after murdered, as is said, by the malice of his mother. His brother Wolfher becoming king of Mercia, embraced in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of the gospel, and proved a very victorious and potent monarch; and is, with no fewer than seven of his immediate successors, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> styled king of the Anglo-Saxons, though none of them are owned in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> by the Saxon chronicle. But though possibly none of them might enjoy this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, they were undoubtedly very puissant princes, maintaining great wars, and obtaining many advantages over the sovereigns of other Saxon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, and especially the East Angles, whom they reduced. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the Mercian territories was so ample as to admit, and so situated as to require, the constituting subordinate rulers in several provinces; to whom, especially if they were of the royal line, they gave the title of kings; which occasions some confusion in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. Besides the establishing episcopal sees and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a>, the Saxon monarchs took other methods for improving and adorning their dominions; and as Mercia was the largest, so these methods were most conspicuous therein. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVENTRY\">Coventry</a>, as being situated in the centre, was usually, but not always, the royal residence. Penda, who was almost continually in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, lived as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> operations directed, in some great town on the frontiers. Wolfher built a castle or fortified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> for his own residence, which bore his name.\u2014Offa kept his court at Sutton Walls near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREFORD\">Hereford</a>.\n\nIn each of the provinces there resided a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>; and if he was of the royal blood, had usually the title of king. Penda, at the time he married Oswy's daughter, had the title of king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a>.\nEthelred made his brother Merowald king of Hereford; who, dying without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, bequeathed it to his younger brother Mercelm. The like honours were sometimes conferred upon the princesses; and hence, in Mercia especially, we occasionally read of vice-queens. By these means the laws were better executed, the obedience of the subjects more effectually secured, and the splendour of these residences constantly kept up and augmented.\n\nAt length the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> devolving sometimes on minors and sometimes on weak princes, intestine factions also prevailing, the force of this hitherto mighty kingdom began sensibly to decline. This falling out in the days of Egbert, the most prudent as well as the most potent monarch of the West Saxons, he took advantage of these circumstances; and having encouraged the East Angles to make an attempt for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of their independence, he, in a conjunction every way favourable to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, broke with the Mercians, and after a short war obliged them to submit. But this was not an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> conquest, the kings of Mercia being allowed by him and his successors to retain their titles and dominions, till the invasion of the Danes put an end to their rule, when this kingdom had subsisted above 250 years; and when the Danes were afterwards expelled by the West Saxons, it sunk into a province, or rather was divided into many.\n\n**MERCURIAL,** something consisting of, or relating to, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>.","sp":584,"ep":585},{"h":"MERCURIALIS","t":"DOGS <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">MERCURY</a>,** a genus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the dioecia class; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> method ranking under the 38th order, Tricoccce.

See Lyre.\n\nHis most magnificent temple was on Mount Cylene, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCADIA\">Arcadia</a>.

The animals sacred to him, were the dog, the goat, and the cock. In all the sacrifices offered to him, the tongues of the victims were burnt; and those who escaped imminent danger sacrificed to him a calf with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>.\n\n**MERCURY,** in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>.

Jeremiah (chap.

Evil-merodach was the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEBUCHADNEZZAR\">Nebuchadnezzar</a> the Great, and had for his successor the wicked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELSHAZZAR\">Belshazzar</a>.

The latter, he thinks, is very plainly the Astaboras of the ancients; and Pliny says, that this stream encloses the left side of Merc\u00e9 as the Nile does the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> we must suppose him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> southward from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, otherwise the words would not apply.\n\nWe are told by Diodorus Siculus, that Mero\u00eb had its name from a sister of Cambyses king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, who died there in the expedition undertaken by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> against the Ethiopians. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> perished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> and thirst in the deserts beyond Mero\u00eb, which could not have happened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they had reached Gojam, the latter being one of the most plentiful countries in the world. A further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that Gojam cannot be the ancient Mero\u00eb is, that the latter was enclosed between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> Nile and Astaboras, while Gojam is almost entirely surrounded by the Nile. If the ancients were acquainted with Gojam, they must also have been acquainted with the fountains of the Nile, which we certainly know they were not. Pliny says that Mero\u00eb, the most considerable of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of the Nile, was called Astaboras, from the name of its left channel, which cannot be supposed any other than the junction of the Nile and Atbara. He informs us moreover, that the sun was vertical twice in the year, viz. when proceeding northward he entered the 18th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of Taurus, and when returning he came to the 14th degree of Leo; but this could never be the case with Gojam, which lies in about 10 degrees <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> latitude.\n\nAgain, the poet Lucan describes Mero\u00eb by two circumstances which cannot apply to any other than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Atbara. One is, that the inhabitants were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>; which was the case with the Gymnosophists and first inhabitants, and which has been the case with all the rest down to the Saracen conquest: but the inhabitants of Gojam, as well as the other Abyssinians, are fair, at least greatly different in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> from the blacks; they are also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>-haired, and nobody imagined that they ever had philosophers or science among them, which was eminently the case with the ancient inhabitants of Mero\u00eb. The other circumstance is, that the ebony tree grew in the island of Mero\u00eb, which at this day grows plentifully in the peninsula of Atbara, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the province of Kuara, but not in Gojam, where the tree could not subsist on account of the violent rains which take place during six months in the year. Mr Bruce mentions another circumstance quoted from the poet Lucan, which likewise tends to prove the identity of Mero\u00eb and Atbara, viz. that though there are many trees in it, they afford no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>. This our traveller found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, when returning from Abyssinia through Atbara. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> (says he) is flat, and has very little water. The forests, though thick, afforded no sort of shade, the hunters for the sake of their sport, and the Arabs for destroying the flies, having set fire to all the dry grass and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>; which passing with great rapidity in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> from east to west, though it had not time to destroy the trees, did yet hinder, and occasion every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> that was upon them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, unless in those spaces where villages had been, and where water was. In such spots a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> spreading trees remained full of foliage; which, from their great height and being cleared of underwood, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in full verdure, loaded with large, projecting, and exuberant branches.

The first hostilities commenced about the year 652 B.C. on what occasion is uncertain. Though the Messenians were inferior in the knowledge of the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> to the Spartans; yet, by keeping for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> on the defensive, they improved so much, that in three years time they found themselves in a capacity of giving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> to their enemies in the open field; nor did they appear to be in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> inferior either in courage <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> conduct: the war was therefore protracted, with various success, on both sides. At last, both consulted the oracle at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DELPHI\">Delphi</a>; and received for answer, \"that whoever should first dedicate 100 tripods in the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> at Ithome, a strong hold of the Messenians, should be masters of the country.\" The inhabitants of Messenia, on hearing this, having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> to make the tripods of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, fell to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> them out in wood; but before this could be accomplished, a Spartan having got into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> by stratagem, dedicated 100 little tripods of clay: which threw the Messenians into such despair, that they at last submitted to the Spartans.\n\nThe new subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a> were treated with the utmost barbarity by these cruel tyrants: so that a new war commenced under Aristomenes, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of unconquerable valour, and enthusiastically fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. He perceived that the Argives and Arcadians, who were called the allies of the Lacedaemonians, adhered to them only through fear of their power; but that in reality they hated them, and wished to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> the injuries they had done them. To these Aristomenes applied; and receiving an answer conformable to his wishes, he engaged his countrymen unanimously to take up arms. About a year after the revolt began, and before either party had received any auxiliaries, the Spartans and Messenians met at a village called Derce, where an obstinate engagement ensued. Aristomenes was conceived to have performed more than mortal achievements: in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> therefore, respect being also had to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, his countrymen unanimously saluted him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> he modestly waved, alleging, that he took up arms to set them free, and not to make himself great; he consented, however, to accept the title of general, with a power of doing whatsoever he thought requisite for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the public. Knowing well the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> in which he lived, he resolved to intimidate the Spartans, by showing them what he was sure they would take for an ill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMEN\">omen</a>. Disguising himself therefore, he went privately to the city, where, in the night, he hung up a shield on the wall of the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a>, with this inscription: Aristomenes dedicates this, out of the spoils of the Spartans, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a>. It was easily perceived that this war would be both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and bloody: the Lacedaemonians therefore sent deputies to Delphi, to inquire of the oracle concerning its event: the answer they received was, That it behoved the Spartans to seek a leader from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>. The Athenians naturally envious of the Spartans, granted their request indeed, but in such a manner as manifested their spite; for they sent them for a general Tyrteus, a schoolmaster and poet, lame of one foot, and who was suspected to be a little out of his wits. But here their skill failed them; for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>, notwithstanding his despicable appearance, proved of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to Sparta, teaching them how to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> good, and how to bear up under ill fortune.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, Aristomenes had drawn together a mighty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, the Eleans, Argives, Sicyonians, and Arcadians, having sent troops to his assistance; the Spartans in this, as in the former war, having no ally but Corinth. The Spartan kings, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>\ncustom of their city, no sooner took the field, than, notwithstanding their inferiority in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, they offered the enemy battle, which Aristomenes readily accepted. It was long, obstinate, and bloody; but in the end the Messenians were victorious, and the Lacedemonians put to flight with a great slaughter. It is scarce to be conceived how much the Spartans were struck with this defeat: they grew weary of the war, dissatisfied with their kings, disdained of their own power, and in a word sunk into a state of general uneasiness and want of spirit. It was now that the Athenian general convinced them, that he was capable of fulfilling all the promises of the oracle; he encouraged them by his poems, directed them by his counsels, and recruited their broken armies with chosen men from among the Helotes. Aristomenes, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, acted with no less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and vigour. He thought it not enough to restore the reputation of the Messenians, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he did not also restore their wealth and power: he therefore taught them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a> offensively against their enemies; and, entering the territories of Sparta, he took and plundered Pharae, a considerable borough in Laconia, putting all such as made any resistance to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, carrying off at the same time an immense booty. This, however, was an injury which the Spartans could not brook with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>; they therefore sent immediately a body of forces to overtake the Messenians, which accordingly they did: but Aristomenes routed these pursuers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to make a mighty slaughter of them, till such time as he was disabled by having a spear thrust in his side, which occasioned his being carried out of the battle. His cure, which took up some time, being finished, he resolved to carry the war even to the gates of Sparta; and to that purpose raised a very great army; but, whether he found his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> impracticable, or was really diverted by some dream, he gave out, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASTOR\">Castor</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLLUX\">Pollux</a>, with their sister Helena, had appeared to him, and commanded him to desist. A short time after this retreat, going with a small party to make an incursion, and attempting to take prisoners some women who were celebrating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> near Egila, a village in Laconia, those zealous matrons fell upon him and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> with such fury, that they put them to flight, and took him prisoner: however, he soon afterwards made his escape, and rejoined his forces.\n\nIn the third year of the war, the Spartans with a great force entered Messenia, whither Aristocrates king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCADIA\">Arcadia</a> was come, with a great body of troops to the assistance of his allies: Aristomenes therefore made no difficulty of fighting when the Spartans approached; but they entering privately into a negociation with Aristocrates, engaged him with bribes and promises to betray his confederates. When the battle began, the deceitful Arcadian represented to the forces under his command the mighty danger they were in, and the great difficulty there would be of retreating into their own country, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the battle should be lost: he then pretended, that the sacrifices were ominous; and, having terrified his Arcadians into the disposition of mind fittest to serve his purpose, he not only drew them off from both wings, but, in his flight, forced through the Messenian ranks, and put them too in confusion. Aristomenes and his troops, however, drew themselves into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> order, that they might defend themselves the best they could: and Messenians indeed they had need of all their valour and skill; for the Lacedemonians, who expected this event, immediately attacked and surrounded them on all sides. Fortune was, on this occasion, too powerful either for the courage or the conduct of the Messenians; so that, notwithstanding their utmost efforts, most of their army were cut to pieces, and amongst them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>. Aristomenes, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> remains of his shattered forces, retired as well as he could; and, perceiving that it was now impossible to maintain the war against the Lacedemonians upon equal terms, he exhorted his countrymen to fortify Mount Era, and to make the best dispositions possible for a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>. He likewise placed garrisons in Ilyus and Methone on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> coasts; and to these three places he gathered all the inhabitants, leaving the rest of Messenia to the mercy of the Spartans. They, on the other hand, looked on the war as now in a manner finished; for which reason they divided the lands among their citizens, and caused them to be carefully cultivated, while they besieged Era. But Aristomenes quickly convinced them that the war was far from being over: he chose out of all the Messenians 300 men, with whom he ravaged all the adjacent country: carried off a prodigious booty; and, when Messenia could no longer supply the wants of his garrison, penetrated into Laconia, and bore away corn, wine, cattle, and whatever else was necessary to the subsistence of his countrymen shut up in Era: so that at last the Spartans were constrained to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a>, forbidding the cultivation, not only of the Messenian territory in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, but also of Laconia in its vicinity; whereby they distressed themselves more than their enemies, inducing at last a famine in Sparta itself, which brought with it its usual attendant, sedition. Here again all things had gone wrong, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of the poet Tyrt\u00e6us had not supported the Spartan courage; nor was it without much difficulty that he influenced them to continue the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCKADE\">blockade</a> of Era, and to maintain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> for the security of the country.\n\nAristomenes, in spite of all these precautions, committed terrible depredations with his small corps of 300 men. Amongst other places which he plundered, the city of Amycl\u00e6 was one; from whence he carried not only a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, but also many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. The kings of Sparta lying with their troops in its neighbourhood, as soon as they heard of this expedition, marched after Aristomenes with the utmost diligence; and, as the Messenians were encumbered with their booty, came up with them before they could reach Era. In this situation of things, Aristomenes, prompted rather by despair than prudence, disposed his troops in order of battle; and, notwithstanding they were so few, made a long and vigorous resistance against the whole Lacedemonian army. At length, however, numbers prevailed: the greatest part of the Messenians were slain on the spot; and Aristomenes, with about 50 of his men who survived the slaughter, were taken prisoners; that chief having received so many wounds, that he was senseless when they carried him away. The Lacedemonians expressed the loudest joy at the sight of this illustrious captive; who for so many years, by his single abilities, had\nbad enabled his exhausted country to defend itself against the whole force of Sparta. When he was recovered of his wounds, they decreed him and all his fellow prisoners to be thrown together into a deep cavern, which was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of the lowest kind of offenders. This judgment was executed with the utmost severity, excepting that Aristomenes had leave to put on his armour. Three days he continued in this dismal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, lying upon and covered over with dead bodies. The third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, he was almost famished through want of food, and almost poisoned with the stench of corrupted carcases, when he heard a fox gnawing a body near him. Upon this he uncovered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, and perceiving the fox <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> by him, he with one hand seized one of its hind legs, and with the other defended his face, by catching hold of its jaw when it attempted to bite him. Following as well as he could his struggling guide, the fox at last thrust his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> into a little hole; and Aristomenes then letting go his leg, he soon forced his way through and opened a passage to the welcome rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, from which the noble Messenian had been so long debarred. Feeble as he was, Aristomenes wrought himself an outlet with his nails; and travelling by night with all the expedition he could, at length arrived safe at Era, to the great joy and amazement of his countrymen.\n\nWhen this news was first blazed abroad, the Spartans would have had it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> for a fiction; but Aristomenes soon put the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of it out of doubt, by falling on the posts of the Corinthians, who, as allies of the Spartans, had a considerable body of troops before Era. Most of their officers, with a multitude of private men, he slew; pillaged their camp; and in short, did so much mischief, that the Spartans under the pretence of an approaching festival, agreed to a cessation of arms for 40 days, that they might have time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> their dead. On this occasion, Aristomenes for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time celebrated the \u1f31\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03c6\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, or the sacrifice appointed for those who had killed 100 of the enemy with their own hands. He had performed the same before and after his second battle: and he lived to do it a third time: which must appear wonderful to the reader, when he is informed, that notwithstanding this truce, certain Cretan archers in the service of the Spartans seized Aristomenes as he was walking without the walls, and carried him away a prisoner. There were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> of them in all: two of them immediately flew with the news to Sparta, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> remained to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a>, whom they bound, and conducted to a lone cottage inhabited only by a widow and her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>. It so fell out that the young woman dreamt the night before that she <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a lion without claws, bound, and dragged along by wolves; and that she having loosed his bonds, and given him claws, he immediately tore the wolves to pieces. As soon as Aristomenes came into the cottage, and her mother, who knew him, had told her who he was, she instantly concluded that her dream was fulfilled; and therefore plied the Cretans with drink, and when they were asleep, took a poniard from one of them, cut the thongs with which Aristomenes was bound, and then put it into his hands. He presently verified her vision, by putting all his guards to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and then carried her and her mother to Era, where, as a reward for her service, he married the young woman to his son Gorgus, then about 18 years of age.\n\nWhen Era had held out near eleven years, it fell into the hands of Sparta by an accident: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> of one Empiramus, a Spartan commander, driving his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>'s cattle to drink at the river Neda, met frequently with the wife of a Messenian whom he engaged in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMOUR\">amour</a>. This woman gave him notice, that her husband's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> was without the wall; so that he could come to it without danger, when the good man was abroad; and she likewise gave him intelligence when her husband was upon duty in the garrison. The Spartan failed not to come at the time appointed; but they had not been long in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> before the husband returned, which put the house into great confusion; the woman, however, secured her gallant; and then let in her husband, whom she received in appearance with great joy, inquiring again and again by what excess of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> she was blessed with his return. The innocent Messenian told her, that Aristomenes being detained in his bed by a wound, the soldiers knowing that he could not walk the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROUNDS\">rounds</a>, had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> to retire to their houses, to avoid the inclemency of the season. The Spartan no sooner heard this, than he crept softly out of doors, and hastened away to carry the news to his master. It so happened, that the kings were at this time absent from the camp, and Empiramus had the chief command of the army. As soon as he received this information, he ordered his army to begin its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>, though it rained excessively, and there was no moonlight. The fellow guided them to the ford, and managed matters so well that they seized all the Messenian posts: yet, after all, they were afraid to engage; darkness, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, together with the dread of Aristomenes, keeping them quiet in the places they had seized. As soon as it was light the attack began; and Era had been quickly taken, if only the men had defended it; but the women fought with such fury, and by their mingling in the fray, brought such an accession of numbers, as made the event doubtful. Three days and two nights this desperate engagement lasted: at last, all hopes of preserving the city being lost, Aristomenes drew off his wearied troops. Early in the fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, he disposed the women and children in the centre, the Messenian youth in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> and rear, the less able men in the main body: himself commanded the van; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-REAR_GUARD\">rear-guard</a> was brought up by Gorgus and Mantius, the former the son of Aristomenes, the latter of Thoecles, a Messenian of great merit, who fell with much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> in this attack, fighting valiantly in the cause of his country. When all things were ready, Aristomenes caused the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> to be thrown open; and, brandishing his spear, marched directly towards the Spartan troops, in order to force a passage. Empiramus, perceiving his intent, ordered his men to open to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and left, and fairly gave them a passage; so that Aristomenes marched off in triumph, as it were, to Arcadia.\n\nThe Arcadians, when they heard that Era was taken, were very desirous of succouring their old confederates in this deep distress: they therefore entreated their king Aristocrates to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> them into Messenia.\nBut he, corrupted by the Lacedemonians, persuaded them that it was too late; that the Messenians were all cut off; and that such a step would only expose them to the fury of the conquerors. When the thing appeared to be otherwise, and it was known that Aristomenes was on the frontiers of Arcadia, they went in crowds to carry him provisions, and to testify their readiness to afford him and those under his command all the assistance in their power. Aristomenes desired to be heard before a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>; which being accordingly convoked, he there opened one of the boldest and best laid schemes recorded in history; he said, that he had yet 500 undaunted soldiers, who, at his command, would undertake anything; that it was very probable most of the Spartans were employed in pillaging Era, and that therefore he determined to march and surprise Sparta; which appeared so sensible, that all the assembly loudly commended his great capacity and unshaken courage. Aristocrates, however, took care to betray him; having, by various pretences, retarded the execution of the project. The Arcadians, who began to suspect him, waited for and surprised the messengers as they came back. They took the letters from them, and read them openly in the assembly. The purport of them was, that they acknowledged his great kindness both now and in the battle; and promised, that the Lacedemonians would be grateful. As soon as the letters were read, the Arcadians fell to stoning their king, frequently calling upon the Messenians to assist them; which, however, they did not, waiting for Aristomenes's order; who, far from triumphing in this spectacle, stood still, with his eyes fixed on the ground, which he wet with his tears, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> pierced with sorrow to see a crowned head so shamefully and so deservedly put to death. The Arcadians afterwards erected a monument over him, with an inscription to perpetuate his infamy. As for the Messenians under the command of Gorgus and Manticius, they passed over into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>; where they founded the city of Messene, one of the most famous in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>. Aristomenes remained, however, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>; where he married all his daughters, except the youngest, to persons of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RHODES\">Rhodes</a>, inquiring of the oracle at Delphi, whom he should espouse, that his subjects might be happy under his posterity, was directed to marry the daughter of the most worthy of the Greeks; which answer was immediately understood to point at the virgin daughter of Aristomenes. Her therefore he demanded, and received; Aristomenes accompanying him back to his dominions, where he formed a scheme of uniting the Lydians and Medes against the Spartans, resolving with this view to go into Media, and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDIS\">Sardis</a>; but while he meditated those great things, death surprised him, and thereby freed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LACEDEMON\">Lacedemon</a> from the most formidable enemy she ever had.","sp":591,"ep":594},{"h":"MESSIAH","t":"a word signifying one anointed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> installed into an office by unction. It was usual among the Jews to anoint kings, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> priests, and sometimes prophets, at the designation or installment of them, to signify emblematically the mental qualifications necessary for discharging those offices. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAUL\">Saul</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>, and Joash, kings of Judah, received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> unction. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AARON\">Aaron</a> and his sons received the sacerdotal, and Elisha the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Elijah received the prophetic unction.\u2014The name MESSIAH, Anointed, or Christ, (\u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2), was given to the kings and high priests of the Jews. The patriarchs and prophets are also called by the name of Messiah, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>'s anointed. See 1 Sam. xii. 3, 5, 1 Chron. xvi. 22, Ps. cv. 15.\n\nBut this name MESSIAH was principally and by way of eminence given by the Jews to their expected great deliverer, whose coming they still vainly wait; and is a name the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> apply to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JESUS\">JESUS</a> CHRIST, in whom the prophecies relating to the Messiah were accomplished. The sum of these prophecies is, That there should be a glorious person named Messiah, descended from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a>, who should be born at Bethlehem, of a virgin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of David, then in its decline, before the Jews ceased to be a people, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> temple was standing, and about 500 years after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EZRA\">Ezra</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; who, though appearing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> circumstances, should be introduced by a remarkable forerunner, whose business it should be to awaken the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of the people. That this illustrious person called Messiah should himself be eminent for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> of his character, and the miraculous works he should perform: yet that, notwithstanding all this, he should be rejected and put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> by the Jews; but should afterwards be raised from the dead, and exalted to a glorious throne, on which he should through all generations continue to rule, at the same time making intercession for sinners. That great calamities should for the present be brought on the Jews for rejecting him; whereas the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of God should by his means be erected among the Gentiles, and disperse itself even unto the ends of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; wherever it came, destroying idolatry, and establishing true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and righteousness. In a word, That this glorious person should be regarded by all who believed in him as a divine teacher, an atoning sacrifice, and a royal governor; by means of whom God would make a covenant with his people, very different from that made with Israel of old; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which they should be restored to, and established in, the divine favour, and fixed in a state of perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. See JESUS CHRIST, and CHRISTIANITY.\n\nThe Jews, as was already observed, still wait for the coming of the Messiah, being impressed with the notion of a temporal Messiah, who is to be a mighty conqueror, and to subdue all the world. Most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> rabbins, according to Buxtorf, believe that the Messiah is already come, but that he keeps himself concealed, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not manifest himself because of the sins of the Jews. Some of the Jews, however, in order to reconcile those prophecies that seem to contradict each other as to the character and condition of the Messiah, have had recourse to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> of two Messiahs, who are yet to succeed each other; one in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMILIATION\">humiliation</a> and suffering; the other of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, splendor, and power. The first, they say, is to proceed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of Ephraim, who is to fight against Gog, and to be slain by Amnillus, Zech. xii. 10. The second is to be of the tribe of Judah, and\nand lineage of David, who is to conquer and kill Antillus, and restore the kingdom of Israel, reigning over it in the highest glory and felicity.\n\nJesus Christ asserts himself the Messiah. In St John iv. 25, the Samaritan woman says to Jesus, I know that when Messiah comes, who is called the Christ, he will tell us all things. Jesus answered her, I that speak to thee am he.\n\nThere are several impostors, who have endeavoured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> for Messiahs, as Christ himself predicted. J. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENT\">Lent</a>, a Dutchman, has written a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> De Pseudomessiahs \"Of false Messiahs.\" The first he mentions was one Bareoelab, who appeared under the empire of Adrian. The last was Rabbi Mordecai, who began to be talked of in 1682.

It is seated on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> side, 110 miles east of Palermo, 260 south by east of Rome, and 180 south-east of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>.

This city in the beginning of the year 1783 suffered most dreadfully by the earthquakes which shook great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALABRIA\">Calabria</a> and Sicily to their foundations, overturned many rich and populous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, and buried thousands in their ruins: (see CALABRIA, and EARTHQUAKE, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOLOGY\">GEOLOGY</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>).\u2014The following account of Messina, as it stood before the above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, is extracted from Mr Swinburne's Travels in Sicily.\n\nA large chain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> presses upon the shore, and part of the city stands upon elevated ground. The mountains are many of them nobly wooded; the hills before them finely chequered with groves and fields. As the town runs in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWEEP\">sweep</a> along the edge of a declivity, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> is seen to advantage, while the less noble parts are hidden by the Palazzata. This is a regular ornamental range of lofty houses, with 19 gates, answering to as many streets; it follows the semicircular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> of the port for one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> and five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>, and would have been the handsomest line of buildings in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> been completed; but a considerable part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> is not finished, except merely in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> wall, and that seems to be in a very ruinous condition. Philibert Emmanuel de Savoy, viceroy of Sicily, in 1622, began this princely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. Before it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> quay, decorated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> and fountains; ships of any burden can moor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARAPET\">parapet</a> in great depth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. At the west extremity is a small fort and a gate; the other end is closed by the governor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> and the citadel, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> pentagonal fortress, built on the point where the isthmus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> braccio di San Raniero issues from the main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. On this slip of low ground, which with the Palazzata forms the circular harbour of Messina, is placed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTHOUSE\">lighthouse</a> (lazaretto), and on the point the old castle of St Salvatore. The circumference of the port is four miles: it probably owes its formation to an earthquake, which opened an immense chasm, and then filled it with water. Near the lighthouse is a kind of whirlpool in the sea, shown as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARYBDIS\">Charybdis</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>.\n\nThe inner part of Messina is dirty, though it contains a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of neat churches and large substantial dwellings. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> is Gothic, enriched with Saracenic mosaics on the altars and shrines; the front of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> altar is particularly splendid; Gagini has embellished the pulpit and some tombs with excellent specimens of his art.\u2014In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> is preserved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALLADIUM\">palladium</a> of Messina, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> to its citizens (a). This is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> upon which the Messinese build their pretensions.\n\n(a) The story is as follows: After St Paul had made some stay at Messina (a circumstance of his travels unnoticed by St Luke), the Messinese prevailed upon him to return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a> with an embassy of four persons sent by the city to the Virgin Mary. Their excellencies were graciously received by her, and brought back a letter written with her own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> tongue, which St Paul translated into Greek. By the irruption of the Saracens this invaluable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> was lost, and utterly forgotten till the year 1467, when Constantine Lascaris, a refugee Greek, found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of it, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> it into Latin, made it known to the citizens, and then to all the Catholic world. Its authenticity is now so well established at Messina, that Regna the historian candidly acknowledges, that whoever was to confess even a doubt on the subject in that city would be treated as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a>.\n\nThis curious epistle is conceived in these terms:\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a> Virgo, Joachim filia, Dei humillima Christi Jesu crucifixi mater, ex tribu Judae, stirpe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>, Messanensis omnibus salutem, et Dei Patris Omnipotentis benedictionem.

Out of the abundance of your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, you have, in consequence of a public deliberation, sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> to me; and since you acknowledge that my son is both God and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, and that he ascended into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a>, as you have learned from the preaching of St Paul the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a>,\npretensions to pre-eminence over the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, nay over the whole world; to its virtues and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> every piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a>, and to their own unworthiness all sinister events that have befallen them. The authenticity of this epistle has been seriously impugned, and of course vigorously defended by many Sicilian divines and disputators.\n\nThere is another church in this city that deserves particular notice, not so much on account of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> or ornaments, as for its being the last refuge of the Greek liturgy, which was once the predominant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the island, but gradually abolished by different conquerors. It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary de Grapheo, or of the Letter, which denomination may perhaps have furnished Lascaris with the idea of his letter. It is known at present by the name of la Cattolica. According to the Greek canons, the entrance of monastic churches was reciprocally forbidden to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, and the cathedrals were the only places of worship where a daily sacrifice was offered up by the bishop and clergy, and where both men and women were present at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, but in different parts of the church. From this general admittance the building acquired the title of Catholic or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>.\n\nMessina is all paved with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a>, cut into large flags of two feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>: a material which the vicinity of lavas renders it easy to procure, and which being very hard resists friction better than any other.\n\nDuring a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of ages, notwithstanding the various revolutions and calamities to which it has been exposed, this city has still maintained its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> situation; while most other cities have shifted their ground more or less from the place where they were first founded. But its situation enjoys advantages which have still tempted such of its inhabitants as escaped from the ravages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> and the desolation of earthquakes to prefer it to every other spot, however delightful or secure. It is of very ancient origin; it has been under many different races of monarchs, and its name has been repeatedly changed: It has been at different times called Zanicle, Mamertina, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MESSANA\">Messana</a>. Its first name Zanicle, which in the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Sicily meant \"a sickle;\" alluding, as some authors suppose, to the form of the port; or, according to others, to the fertility of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Allured by the advantages of its situation, the Cum\u00e6ans, a commercial and enterprising people, invaded the island and drove the Siculi from this settlement; they were in their turn overpowered by a band of Samian adventurers, who made way for a colony of citizens of Messene, and under these masters it changed its name to Messana. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> was of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>; for in the 28th year before Christ it was destroyed by the Mamertines, a warlike unprincipled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> inhabiting the south part of Bruttium. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> being received into Messana on their return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> from Syraeuse, where they had served as mercenaries in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of Agathocles, took an opportunity of massacring the inhabitants and usurping their possessions. The city was now called Mamertina; and, in order to support themselves against the resentment of the Sicilian powers, the Mamertines implored the protection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who, eager to extend their dominion beyond the limits of Italy, and jealous of the growing power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>, made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> scruple to succour these assassins with a consular army. This step brought on the first Punic war. The Mamertines reaped no other fruit from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> but a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>; for such was the real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of their connexion with Rome, whatever name it might be disguised under.\n\nMessina was, however, always distinguished by particular attentions and favours from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>; and, excepting a short period during the wars of the triumvirate, appears to have tasted all the sweets of Roman prosperity, without partaking of the bitter draughts of adversity. Its fate, in the ruin of the empire, was similar to that of the rest of Sicily. In 829 Messina fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Saracens, but obtained very honourable terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a>; for half the city was left to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, where they were to be governed by their own laws, and profess their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> undisturbed. In the other resided the bey of one of the five provinces into which the Arabian conquerors had divided the island. Notwithstanding this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>, Messina was the first to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> off the yoke in 1037, when George Maniaces landed an army of Greeks and Normans on the shore of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FARO\">Faro</a>. It afterwards held out against the whole Mussulman force, till the feeble state of a distracted empire shut out all hopes of assistance from Constantinople. This unfortunate city then opened its gates to the army of the caliph, and felt very severely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of his resentment, but it did not long groan under the yoke; for in less than 20 years Roger the Norman took it by surprise, and delivered it from Mahometan oppression. During the crusade our Richard Coeur de Lion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> Augustus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of France wintered here in their way to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>; a sojourn marked by continual quarrels, conflagration, and bloodshed. The Messinese were particularly tardy in entering into the national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> of 1282, but afterwards exceeded the rest of the insurgents in deeds of cruelty: This, and the importance of their situation, singled them out for the first objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a>'s vengeance. He invested their city very closely, and declared so openly his determination to refuse all terms whatever to the besieged, that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> no hopes of safety but in an obstinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>. Their courage, perseverance, and sufferings, were excessive; at length their strength and resources began to fail rapidly, and every circumstance seemed to denounce their speedy destruction, when Roger Lauria appeared off the harbour with the Arragonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, forced the king to retire with precipitation across the\n\nI give my blessing to you and all your city, and agree to become your protectress. In the 42d year of my Son, the 1st of the indiction, the 3d <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, and the 27th of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, at Jerusalem.\"\n\nNot to dwell upon the astronomical blunders in these dates, let it suffice to observe, that Lascaris was not aware that Denis the Little, a Syrian monk in the 6th century, was the first who made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the era that commences at our Saviour's birth.\nthe straits, and in his sight defeated and destroyed his naval armament. Robert, grandson of Charles I., also made a fruitless attack; but in the disturbed reign of Frederic III., Messina was delivered up to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> king of Naples and his consort <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> Joan, who entered it in triumph. In a few years it returned to its former possessors. The year 1672 was remarkable for the revolt of the Messinese.\u2014They threw off the Spanish yoke, and swore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to Louis XIV., king of France. They were for some time vigorously assisted by the French; but before the Spaniards had gained the least advantage to excite any hopes of recovering so valuable a possession, Louis found himself necessitated from motives of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> his new subjects, and leave them to the mercy of their old incensed masters. The horror of being thus abandoned, and the chastisement inflicted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, broke the fierce spirit of the Messinese; they were still stunned with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> and effects of this blow, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> in 1743 was introduced from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a>, and swept away more than half the inhabitants. From this chain of calamities, the opulence, trade, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of Messina, have been gradually sinking; and unless very favourable circumstances happen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> every year <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> lower. The number of its inhabitants does not now exceed 30,000.\n\nThe following particulars are added from M. Houel, who visited this city since the late earthquakes, which completed its destruction.\n\nOn the front of the cathedral there is a square, which, though not regular, is far from being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>. This was not the largest square in Messina before its overthrow; but it was the most elegant, the most splendidly adorned, and the best frequented. There stands in this square an equestrian statue of Charles II. of Spain, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRONZE\">bronze</a>, which has been spared by the earthquake. It stands on a marble pedestal, in the middle of the square. Opposite to this statue is an elegant marble fountain, ornamented with a variety of figures, representing men and other animals, all of them spouting out water in great abundance; which used, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, to spread an agreeable and refreshing coolness over the square, that induced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> to assemble here. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">Seven</a> streets terminated here. The cathedral forms a part of the square. It is dedicated to the blessed Virgin; the occasion of which has been already mentioned.\n\nThere is an anniversary feast celebrated in Messina, which is called the feast of the Letter. A lock of the Virgin's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, which she sent to the Messenians at the same time with the letter, is carried through the city in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a> in a crystal vessel. She made also a present of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> to the Messenian deputies. It is placed over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABERNACLE\">tabernacle</a>. None but the canons of the cathedral are permitted to touch, or take up on their shoulders, the silver shrine in which the crystal vessel with the Virgin's hair is deposited. Eight of those canons, with mitres on their heads, bear this shrine in the procession. The canopy suspended over it is supported by six senators in their robes. The picture and the hair are shown to strangers. This procession, and the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> ceremonies of this festival, are followed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> races. The spirits of the people being already elevated by their religious exercises, they engage with amazing eagerness in these and the other diversions with which they are accompanied: a tumultuous joy reigns over the city; and the evening concludes with illuminations and fireworks. The ships in the harbour pay the citizens the compliment of entertaining them with a discharge of their guns on the occasion.\n\nThrough a square called the Square of the Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">Hospital</a>, runs a large and impetuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>, the Porto delle Legni. It is precipitated from those lofty mountains which overlook this city on the south side. The channel which it has cut out for itself is at times entirely full. It would, on such occasions, overflow the square and other parts of the city, were it not confined by walls which have been built on both sides to prevent such accidents.\u2014Another stream of a similar origin, called the Torrent of La Bocetta, runs through another part of the city, it is also confined within walls to prevent it from overflowing.\n\nThe Square of St John of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a> is one of the largest in Messina. In the middle of this square is a fine marble fountain, ornamented with a variety of sculptured figures and jets d'eau. Beside the fountain there used to stand a large reservoir for horses to drink out of.\n\nIn the time of the annual festivals, there used to be exhibited on the water of the reservoir a galley, or rather a fictitious representation of a galley, with galley-slaves, soldiers, officers, and a commander on board, all in arms, and the galley properly equipped as a ship of war. This galley was decorated with great art; and by night the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a>, and every other suitable part, were hung with lamps, which illuminated it in a very splendid manner. Every thing around was so artificially disposed, that when the fire-works were played off, the spectator was led to think, though he perceived only one galley, that the noise which he heard was produced by a naval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>; and that the other ships were concealed from his view by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> occasioned by the guns and fireworks. This, when properly conducted, was a noble spectacle. The senate repaired thither from the cathedral, attended with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> and a numerous company. In one carriage sat six senators, the governor of the city, and sometimes the archbishop. It was exceedingly large and drawn by six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> horses very richly harnessed. Other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> followed, with the train who attended the governor and the senators.\n\nAlmost all festivals owe their origin to some extraordinary event, or some singular story either true or false. It is said, that when the splendor with which the feast of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">Assumption</a> de la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARA\">Bara</a> was celebrated at Messina, first began to attract foreigners to the city, on that occasion such crowds repaired thither as to alarm the inhabitants with the fears of a famine: But one year, when the number of strangers was greater than usual at the time of this festival, the magistrates were very much at a loss how to supply them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>; and at length, every other resource failing, no hopes of relief remained but from the kindness of the Blessed Virgin. Fervent prayers were addressed to their patroness: and next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> by day-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> three brigantines appeared entering the harbour with full sails. They proved to be loaded with corn. It was eagerly purchased: and the people of the city hastened to appease their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>. But when they came after refreshing\nrefreshing themselves to pay the corn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, neither ships nor merchants could be found. After their first emotions of surprise had subsided, they naturally concluded that such a seasonable supply must undoubtedly be a present from the Virgin, who, being pleased with the zeal of her Messenian votaries, and desirous to prevent the concourse of strangers who attended the festival from diminishing, had interposed in this miraculous manner to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> them from the distresses of famine. A new festival was celebrated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> to their generous benefactress. Three small vessels of silver were made, and dedicated to the Virgin in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the event; and these are at present used as lamps in the cathedral. The senate likewise decreed, that the clergy should pay annually a small tax, to be laid out in constructing a small gallery to swim on the fountain, and in defraying the expenses of the fireworks. The profits of the clergy are so considerable on the occasion of the festival, that they may be supposed to pay the tax with great cheerfulness.\n\nIn Messina, as in the other cities of Sicily, the women wrap themselves in a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> mantle above the rest of their dress. The stuffs are richer or plainer according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and circumstances. People who are not rich enough to have fine clothes of their own, hire them at so much an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>. There are women who make a livelihood by lending out their clothes. The mantle covers the wearer from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> to foot.\u2014It reduces the old and the young, the ill-shaped and the handsome, pretty much to an equality in point of appearance. This must naturally appear very unfavourable to the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>. But yet, on proper occasions, at church or in a public walk, the ladies of Messina find means to open and adjust the mantle so as to display all their beauties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> and shape, and to attract the affections of lovers, perhaps more powerfully than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> their dress were suited to display their charms in a more ostentatious manner.\n\nBetween Messina and the tower of Faro there stands a small church called the Madonna of the Grotto. It was anciently a temple of a round structure, and ornamented with columns like the temple of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> at Rome. Modern columns now supply the place that was occupied by the ancient. There are large niches in the rock adjoining to the temple, which are thought to be of equal antiquity. These contain no sculptured figures; but in Pagan times they might possibly contain some.\n\nMessina being situated between Mount \u00c6tna and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of Charybdis, and being likewise at no great distance from the volcanoes of Lipari and Stromboli, must have been in all ages liable to suffer by earthquakes. Such terrible events, however, appear to have been more unfrequent in ancient than in modern times, and have actually alarmed the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> oftener than any other. In the year 1693 a fourth part of the cities of Sicily was destroyed by an earthquake. Messina merely felt the shock; all its buildings, however, suffered. In the year 1742 it suffered another equally violent. A plague which followed in 1743 retarded the repairs necessary after the earthquake. In the year 1780 this city <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, for more than six months, to suffer from new earthquakes.\n\nWere the state of the elements, previous to these dreadful events, carefully examined, it might perhaps be found to undergo certain changes which might be considered as prognosticating them.\n\nThe autumn of the year 1782 was unusually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and rainy. Fahrenheit's thermometer was often as low as 56 degrees. The succeeding winter was dry; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> never fell under 25 degrees: And, what is uncommon in that season, storms were now and then observed to arise from the west. The pilots in the channel observed that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> no longer rose at the usual periods, and the gulf of Charybdis raged with extraordinary fury.\n\nOn the 5th of February 1783, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a> was heavy and calm; the sky obscured with thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> seemingly all in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>. About half after twelve at noon, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> began to shake with a dreadful noise. The shocks continually increased, and became at length so violent as to open the ground, and to overturn in two or three minutes a considerable part of the buildings.\n\nA long white cloud appeared to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west; and soon after another, very dark, in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the heavens. The latter in a moment spread over the whole horizon, and deluged the city with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>, accompanied with dreadful claps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>. The inhabitants fled in the utmost terror to the fields and the ships in the harbour.\n\nFrom mid-day till five in the afternoon the earthquake continued almost without interruption. The shocks then became somewhat less frequent. The cries of the dying; the shrieks of those who were half buried under the ruins; the wild terror with which others, who were still able, attempted to make their escape; the despair of fathers, mothers, and husbands, bereft of those who were dearest to them; then formed altogether a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of horror, such as can but seldom occur in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the calamities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>. Amid that awful scene, instances of the most heroic courage and the most generous affection were displayed. Mothers, regardless of their own safety, rushed into every danger to snatch their children from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Conjugal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> affection prompted deeds not less desperate and heroic. But no sooner did the earthquake cease, than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> wretches who had escaped began to feel the influence of very different passions. When they returned to visit the ruins, to seek out the situation of their fallen dwellings, to inquire into the fate of their families, to procure food and collect some remains of their former fortunes\u2014such as found their circumstances the most wretched became suddenly animated with rage, which nothing but wild despair could inspire. The distinction of ranks, and the order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> were disregarded, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> eagerly violated. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">Murder</a>, rapine, and lawless robbery, reigned among the smoking ruins.\n\nAbout one in the morning another shock of the earthquake was felt, which overturned most of the houses that were still standing. Most of those whom want, or avarice, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, still detained among the ruins, now shared the same fate with their friends whom the former shocks had buried under them.\n\nThe succeeding day scarce alleviated the distress of this dismal night: the few wretches who still survived found themselves destitute of every necessary. At length order was in some degree re-established; and in\ntwo days after every person was supplied at least with some small portion of the necessaries for subsistence.\n\nNone yet thought of returning to take up their abode among the ruins. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> people fixed their residence on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of Porto Salvo, near the town of Salleo. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, magistrates, and merchants, took up their abode on another plain, on the other part of the stream Porto de Legno; the soldiers at Terra Nuova.\n\nSome violent shocks which were again felt on the 7th of February and the 28th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> completed the destruction of the city. The corn magazines, however, escaped without damage; and the public ovens and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AQUEDUCTS\">aqueducts</a> were but little injured. From these facts it may perhaps be inferred, that had not the houses of Messina been, in general, hastily built at the first, and afterwards carelessly repaired, fewer of them would have been overthrown by the earthquake.\n\nThe neighbouring villages having suffered but little, were the first to relieve the remaining inhabitants of Messina in their distress. Maltese galleys for some days supplied necessaries to the poor and the sick with a generosity which merits the highest praise. They brought surgeons and whatever was needful for the cure of the wounded. The supplies sent by the king of France were refused, for what reason we know not. What money was needed for the support of the people was taken from the treasury of the city of Messina; for what the king of Naples sent was seized and spent by the garrison.\n\nIt is said that not more than 800 or 900 persons perished by this earthquake. The sea during that convulsion of the land was slightly agitated in the harbour. Farther out the sea was more violently agitated; but none of the ships in the harbour were dashed to pieces. The waters rose so high as to be injurious in a very considerable degree to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHAROS\">Pharos</a>, as well as along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCYLLA\">Scylla</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAGNARA\">Bagnara</a>.\n\nThis earthquake was not of a momentary duration, like that by which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a> was destroyed, and like many others; for more than sixty days from the 5th of February to the beginning of April, Messina continued to be shaken, and in that time felt more than 200 shocks; and even after that period the alarm was again and again renewed. Not only the magistrates, the soldiers and the people, but the priests likewise, with their tabernacle and altar, retired to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRACKS\">barracks</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NUNS\">nuns</a>, too, deserted their cloisters, and sought a retreat without the walls. Some of them confined themselves to the gardens of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a>; others mixed indiscriminately with the people.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> damage which the public buildings within the city suffered was the fall of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOME\">dome</a> of the church of Purgatory. Only the walls were left standing; and even these had suffered considerably. One half of the steeple of the cathedral was beaten to the ground. The magazines of Porto Franco were likewise very much shattered. The fort of St Salvator, being built on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> foundation, the side next the sea is there fallen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>; but on the other side, where it is founded on a rock, it has stood unmoved by all the shocks of the earthquake.\n\nOn the 5th of February, when the earthquake was more violent than at any time afterwards, a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> of sulphur was felt. The earth was affected somewhat in the same way as if it had been borne up on a fluid; and seemed to reel with the shocks much like a ship tossed with the waves. This tremendous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> was felt all over Sicily; but towards Pharos it became weaker. On the following days the sky was cloudy; the mountains of Sicily and the shores of Calabria continued covered with a thick fog like smoke. North and north-east winds raged with the most violent impetuosity.\n\nThe disastrous year of this earthquake was scarce concluded, the chasms which it had opened in the ground were still yawning, and the poor inhabitants of the adjacent country still trembled with terror, when the elements again renewed their fury to ravage this miserable land.\n\nOn Tuesday the 6th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1784, about sunrise, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> began to blow softly from the north-east. The sea gradually swelled, rose beyond its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> with rapid impetuosity, overflowed the quay of Messina, and lashed with its billows the ruins of the Palazzata. It loosened and displaced many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a>, spread over the whole street, and attacked the pedestals of the statues which had been spared by the earthquake, and still stood firm among the ruins. The same furious wind which swelled the sea in so extraordinary a manner, ravaged the whole coast from Messina all the way to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>.","sp":595,"ep":599},{"h":"MESSUAGE","t":"MESSAGIUM, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>, a dwelling-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> adjoining assigned for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> here, that of resemblance, belongs to the thought. An additional pleasure arises from the expression: the poet, by figuring his hero to be a lion, goes on to describe the lion in appearance, but in reality the hero; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> is peculiarly beautiful, by expressing the virtues and qualities of the hero in new terms, which, properly speaking, belong not to him, but to the lion. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> better be understood by examples.

A metaphor is defined above to be an act of the imagination, figuring one thing to be another. An allegory requires no such operation, nor is one thing figured to be another: it consists in choosing a subject having properties or circumstances resembling those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> subject: and the former is described in such a manner as to represent the latter: the subject thus represented is kept out of view: we are left to discover it by reflection; and we are pleased with the discovery, because it is our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. (See the word Allegory.)\n\nQuintilian gives the following instance of an allegory.\n\nO navis, referent in mare te <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVI\">novi</a>\nFluctus. O quid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGIS\">agis</a>? fortiter occupa portum.\n\nHorat. lib. ode 14.\n\nand explains it elegantly in the following words: \"Totusque ille Horatii locus, quo navim pro republica, fluctuum tempestates pro bellis civilibus, portum pro pace atque <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCORDIA\">concordia</a>, dicit.\"\n\nIn a figure of speech, there is no fiction of the imagination employed, as in a metaphor; nor a representative subject introduced, as in an allegory. This figure, as its name implies, regards the expression only, not the thought; and it may be defined, the using a word in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> different from what is proper to it\u2014Thus youth, or the beginning of life, is expressed figuratively by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of life: morning is the beginning of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; and in that view it is employed to signify the beginning of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, life especially, the progress of which is reckoned by days. See Figure of Speech.\n\nMetaphor and allegory are so much connected, that it seemed proper to handle them together: the rules particularly for distinguishing the good from the bad, are common to both. We shall therefore proceed to those rules, after adding some examples to illustrate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of an allegory, which, with a view to this article, was but slightly illustrated under its proper name.\n\nHorace, speaking of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> to Pyrrha, which was now extinguished, expressed himself thus:\n\nMe tabula sacer\nVotiv\u00e2 paries indicat uvida\nSuspendisse potenti\nVestimenta maris Deo.\n\nCarm. lib. i. ode 5.\n\nAgain:\nPh\u0153bus volentem pr\u00e6lia me loqui,\nVictas et urbes, increpit, lyra\nNe parva Tyrrhenum per \u00e6quor\nVela darem.\n\nCarm. lib. iv. ode 15.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>. Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,\nBut cheerly seek how to redress their harms.\nWhat though the mast be now blown overboard,\nThe cable broke, the holding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a> lost,\nAnd half our sailors swallowed in the flood!\nYet lives our pilot still. Isn't meet that he\nShould leave the helm, and, like a fearful lad,\n\nWith tearful eyes add <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> to the sea,\nAnd give more strength to that which hath too much;\nWhile in his moan the ship splits on the rock,\nWhich industry and courage might have sav'd?\nAh, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!\n\nThird Part of Henry VI. act v. sc. 5.\n\nOroonoko. Ha! thou has rous'd\nThe lion in his den; he stalks abroad,\nAnd the wide forest trembles at his roar.\nI find the danger now.\n\nOroonoko, act. iii. sc. 2.\n\n\"My well beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill. He fenced it, gathered out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> thereof, planted it with the choicest vine, built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine press therein; he looked that it should bring forth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>, and it brought forth wild grapes. And now, O inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done? Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? And now go to, I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down. And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged, but there shall come up briars and thorns: I will also command the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> no rain upon it. For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant.\"\n\nIsaiah v. 1.\n\nThe rules that govern metaphors and allegories are of two kinds. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of these figures comes under the first kind: the propriety or impropriety of introduction comes under the other.\u2014To begin with rules of the first kind; some of which coincide with those already given for similes; some are peculiar to metaphors and allegories.\n\nIn the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, It has been observed, that a simile cannot be agreeable where the resemblance is either too strong or too faint. This holds equally in metaphor and allegory; and the reason is the same in all. In the following instances, the resemblance is too faint to be agreeable.\n\nMalcolm. But there's no bottom, none,\nIn my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,\nYour matrons, and your maids, could not fill up\nThe cistern of my lust.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MACBETH\">Macbeth</a>, act iv. sc. 4.\n\nThe best way to judge of this metaphor, is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> it into a simile: which would be bad, because there is scarce any resemblance between lust and a cistern, or betwixt enormous lust and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> cistern.\n\nAgain:\nHe cannot buckl\u00e8 his distemper'd cause\nWithin the belt of rule.\n\nMacbeth, act v. sc. 2.\n\nThere is no resemblance between a distempered cause and any body that can be confined within a belt.\n\nAgain:\nSteep me in poverty to the very lips.\n\nOthello, act iv. sc. 9.\n\nPoverty\nMetaphor. Poverty here must be conceived a fluid, which it resembles not in any manner.\n\nSpeaking to Bolingbroke banished for six years:\n\nThe sullen passage of thy weary steps\nEstcem a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, wherein thou art to set\nThe precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEWEL\">jewel</a> of thy home return.\n\nRichard II. act ii. sc. 6.\n\nAgain:\n\nHere is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>,\nAnd every word in it a gaping wound\nIssuing life-blood.\n\nMerchant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, act. iii. sc. 3.\n\nTant\u00e6 molis crat Romanam condere gentem.\n\n\u00c6neid. i. 37.\n\nThe following metaphor is strained beyond all endurance: Timur-bec, known to us by the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAMERLANE\">Tamerlane</a> the Great, writes to Bajazet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> of the Ottomans in the following terms:\n\n\"Where is the monarch who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DARES\">dares</a> resist us? where is the potentate who doth not glory in being numbered among our attendants? As for thee, descended from a Turcman sailor, since the vessel of thy unbounded ambition hath been wreck'd in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of thy self-love, it would be proper, that thou shouldest take in the sails of thy temerity, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> the anchor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPENTANCE\">repentance</a> in the port of sincerity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, which is the port of safety; lest the tempest of our vengeance make thee perish in the sea of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> thou deservest.\"\n\nSuch strained figures, as observed above, are not unfrequent in the first dawn of refinement; the mind in a new enjoyment knows no bounds, and is generally carried to excess, till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> discover the proper limits.\n\nSecondly. Whatever resemblance subjects may have, it is wrong to put one for another, where they bear no mutual proportion. Upon comparing a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> to a very low subject, the simile takes on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURLESQUE\">burlesque</a>; and the same will be the effect where the one is imagined to be the other, as in a metaphor; or made to represent the other, as in an allegory.\n\nThirdly. These figures, a metaphor especially, ought not to be crowded with many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> circumstances; for in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it is scarcely possible to avoid obscurity. A metaphor above all ought to be short: it is difficult, for any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, to support a lively image of a thing being what we know it is not; and for that reason, a metaphor drawn out to any length, instead of illustrating or enlivening the principal subject, becomes disagreeable by overstraining the mind. Here Cowley is extremely licentious. Take the following instance.\n\nGreat and wise conqu'ror, who wherc'er\nThou com'st, dost fortify and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> there!\nWho canst defend as well as get;\nAnd never hadst one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> up yet;\nNow thou art in, thou ne'er will part\nWith one inch of my vanquish'd heart;\nFor since thou took'st it by assault from me\n'Tis garrison'd so strong with thoughts of thee,\nIt fears no beauteous enemy.\n\nFor the same reason, however agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> allegories may at first be by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, they never afford any lasting pleasure: witness the Faery Queen, which with great power of expression, variety of images, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELODY\">melody</a> of versification, is scarce ever read a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time.\n\nIn the fourth place. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> carried on in a simile, being in a metaphor sunk by imagining the principal subject to be that very thing which it only resembles; an opportunity is furnished to describe it in terms taken strictly or literally with respect to its imagined nature. This suggests another rule, That in constructing a metaphor, the writer ought to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of such words only as are applicable literally to the imagined nature of his subject: figurative words ought carefully to be avoided; for such complicated figures, instead of setting the principal subject in a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, involve it in a cloud, and it is well <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the reader, without rejecting by the lump, endeavour patiently to gather the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> meaning, regardless of the figures:\n\nA stubborn and unconquerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>\nCreeps in his veins, and drinks the streams of life.\n\nLady Jane Gray, act i. sc. 1.\n\nCopied from Ovid:\n\nSorbent avid\u00e6 precordia flamm\u00e6.\n\nMetamorph., lib. ix. 172.\n\nLet us analyze this expression. That a fever may be imagined a flame, we admit: though more than one step is necessary to come at the resemblance: a fever, by heating the body, resembles fire; and it is no stretch to imagine a fever to be a fire: again, by a figure of speech, flame may be put for fire, because they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> conjoined; and therefore a fever may be termed a flame. But now admitting a fever to be a flame, its effects ought to be explained in words that agree literally to a flame.

Sir, to conclude, the place you fill has more than amply exacted the talents of a wary pilot; and all these threatening storms, which, like impregnable clouds, hover o'er our heads, will, when they once are grasp'd but by the eye of reason, melt into fruitful showers of blessings on the people.\n\n\"Bayes. Pray mark that allegory. Is not that good?\n\n\"Johnson. Yes, that grasping of a storm with the eye is admirable.\n\nAct ii. sc. 1.\n\nFifthly. The jumbling different metaphors in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, beginning with one metaphor and ending with another, commonly called a mixt metaphor, ought never to be indulged.\n\nK. Henry.\nK. Henry, \u2014 Will you again unknit\nThis churlish knot of all abhorred war,\nAnd move in that obedient orb again,\nWhere you did give a fair and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> light?\nFirst Part Henry VI. act. v. sc. 1.\n\nWhether 'tis nobler in the mind, to suffer\nThe stings and arrows of outrageous fortune;\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\nAnd by opposing end them.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMLET\">Hamlet</a>, act iii. sc. 2.\n\nIn the sixth place, It is unpleasant to join different metaphors in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, even where they are preserved distinct: for when the subject is imagined to be first one thing and then another in the same period without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, the mind is distracted by the rapid transition; and when the imagination is put on such hard duty, its images are too faint to produce any good effect:\n\nAt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REGINA\">regina</a> gravi jamdudum saucia cura,\nVulnus alt venis, et e\u00e6co carpitur igni.\n\u00c6neid. iv. 1.\n\nEst mollis flamma medullas\nInterea, et tacitum vivit sub pectori vulneris.\n\u00c6neid, iv. 66.\n\nMotum ex Metello consule civicum,\nBellique causas, et vitia, et modos,\nLudumque fortun\u00e6, gravesque\nPrincipum amicitias, et arma\nNondum expiatis uneta cruoribus,\nPericulose plenum opus ale\u00e6,\nTraetas, et incedis per ignes\nSubpositos cineris doloso.\nHorat. Carm. lib. ii. ode 1.\n\nIn the last place, It is still worse to jumble together metaphorical and natural expression, so as that the period must be understood in part metaphorically, in part literally; for the imagination cannot follow with sufficient ease changes so sudden and unprepared: a metaphor begun and not carried on, hath no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>; and instead of light there is nothing but obscurity and confusion. Instances of such incorrect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> are without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>: we shall, for a specimen, select a few from different authors. Speaking of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>,\n\n\u2014 This precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> set in the sea,\nWhich serves it in the office of a wall,\nOr as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOAT\">moat</a> defensive to a house,\nAgainst the envy of less happier lands.\nRichard II. act ii. sc. 1.\n\nIn the first line Britain is figured to be a precious stone: in the following line, Britain, divested of her metaphorical dress, is presented to the reader in her natural appearance.\n\nThese growing feathers pluck'd from C\u00e6sar's wing,\nWill make him fly an ordinary pitch,\nWho else would soar above the view of men,\nAnd keep us all in servile fearfulness.\nJulius C\u00e6sar, act i. sc. 1.\n\nRebus angustis animosus atque\nFortis adpare: sapienter idem\nContrales vento nimium secundo\nTurgida vela.\nHor. Carm. lib. ii. ode 10.\n\nThe following is a miserable jumble of expressions, arising from an unsteady view of the subject, between its figurative and natural appearance:\n\nBut now from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GATH\">gath</a>'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> clouds destruction pours,\nWhich ruins with mad rage our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALCYON\">halcyon</a> hours:\nMists from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> jealousies the tempest form,\nWhilst late divisions reinforce the storm.\nDispensary, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTO\">canto</a> iii.\n\nTo thee the world its present homage pays,\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> early, but mature the praise.\nPope's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">Imitation</a> of Horace, book ii.\n\nOui, sa pudeur ne s'est que franche grimace,\nQu'une <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMBRE\">ombre</a> de vertu qui garde mal la place,\nEt qui s'\u00e9vanouit, comme l'on peut savoir,\nAux rayons du soleil qu'une bourse vait voir.\nMoli\u00e8re, L'\u00c9tourdi, act iii. sc. 2.\n\nEt son feu, de pourv\u00fb de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENS\">sens</a> et de lecture,\nS'\u00e9teint \u00e0 chaque pas, faut de nourriture.\nBoileau, L'Art Po\u00e9tique, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANT\">chant</a>. iii. l. 319.\n\nDryden, in his dedication of the translation of Juvenal, says, \"When thus, as I may say, before the use of the loadstone, or knowledge of the compass, I was sailing in a vast ocean, without other help than the pole-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STAR\">star</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, and the rules of the French stage among the moderns,\" &c.\n\n\"There is a time when factions, by the vehemence of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, stun and disable one another.\"\nBolingbroke.\n\nThis fault of jumbling the figure and plain expression into one confused <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, is not less common in allegory than in metaphor.\n\nTake the following examples:\n\n\u2014 Heu! quoties fides,\nMutatosque Deos flebit, et aspera\nNigris aquora ventis\nEmirabitur insolens,\nQui nunc te fruatur credulus aur\u00e9a:\nQui semper vacuam, semper amabilem\nSperat, nec scius aurea\nFallacis.\nHorat.

They never tell you, that the dog which snapped at a shadow, lost his troop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>; that would be unintelligible. This is\nMetaphor. his (Dryden's) new way of telling a story, and confounding the moral and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> together.\" After instancing from the Hind and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PANTHER\">Panther</a>, he goes on thus: \"What relation has the hind to our Saviour? or what notion have we of a panther's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIBLE\">bible</a>? If you say he means the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, how does the church feed on lawns, or range in the forest? Let it be always a church, or always a cloven-footed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a>; for we cannot bear his shifting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> every line.\"\n\nA few words more upon allegory. Nothing gives greater pleasure than this figure, when the representative subject bears a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>, in all its circumstances, to that which is represented: but the choice is seldom so lucky; the analogy being generally so faint and obscure, as to puzzle and not please. An allegory is still more difficult in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> than in poetry: the former can show no resemblance but what appears to the eye; the latter hath many other resources for showing the resemblance. And therefore, with respect to what the abb\u00e9 du <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOS\">Bos</a> terms mixt allegorical compositions, these may do in poetry; because, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, the allegory can easily be distinguished from the historical part: no person, for example, mistakes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FAME\">Fame</a> for a real being. But such a mixture in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> is intolerable; because in a picture the objects must appear all of the same kind, wholly real or wholly emblematical. For this reason, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> de Medicis, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of Luxembourg, painted by Rubens, is unpleasant by a perpetual jumble of real and allegorical personages, which produce a discordance of parts, and an obscurity upon the whole: witness, in particular, the tablature representing the arrival of Mary de Medicis at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARSEILLES\">Marseilles</a>; where, together with the real personages, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEREIDS\">Nereids</a> and Tritons appear sounding their shells: such a mixture of fiction and reality in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> is strangely absurd. The picture of Alexander and Roxana, described by Lucian, is gay and fanciful; but it suffers by the allegorical figures. It is not in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> of man to invent an allegorical representation deviating farther from any shadow of resemblance, than one exhibited by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV. anno 1664; in which an enormous chariot, intended to represent that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, is dragged along, surrounded with men and women, representing the four ages of the world, the celestial signs, the seasons, the hours, &c. a monstrous composition, and yet scarcely more absurd than Guido's tablature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">Aurora</a>.\n\nIn an allegory, as well as in a metaphor, terms ought to be chosen that properly and literally are applicable to the representative subject: nor ought any circumstance to be added that is not proper to the representative subject, however justly it may be applicable properly or figuratively to the principal. The following allegory is therefore faulty:\n\nFerus et Cupido,\nSemper ardentes acuens sagittas\nCote cruenta. Horat. lib. ii. ode 8.\n\nFor though blood may suggest the cruelty of love, it is an improper or immaterial circumstance in the representative subject: water, not blood, is proper for a whetstone.\n\nWe proceed to the next head, which is, to examine in what circumstances these figures are proper, in what improper. This inquiry is not altogether superseded by what is said upon the same subject in the article Comparison; because, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, it will be found, that a short metaphor or allegory may be proper, where a simile, drawn out to a greater length, and in its nature more solemn, would scarcely be relished.\n\nAnd, in the first place, A metaphor, like a simile, is excluded from common conversation, and from the description of ordinary incidents. Secondly, In expressing any severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> that totally occupies the mind, metaphor is unnatural.\n\nThe following example, of deep despair, beside the highly figurative style, has more the air of raving than of sense:\n\nCalista. Is it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>, or my father?\nMadness! confusion! let the storm come on,\nLet the tumultuous roar drive all upon me,\nDash my devoted bark; ye surges, break it:\n'Tis for my ruin that the tempest rises.\nWhen I am lost, sunk to the bottom low,\nPeace shall return, and all be calm again.\n\nFair Penitent, act. v.\n\nThe following metaphor is sweet and lively; but it suits not the fiery temper of Chamont, inflamed with passion: parables are not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of wrath venting itself without restraint:\n\nChamont. You took her up a little tender flow'r,\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">Just</a> sprouted on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>, which the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>\nHad nipp'd; and with a careful loving hand,\nTransplanted her into your own fair garden,\nWhere the sun always shines: there long she flourish'd,\nGrew sweet to sense, and lovely to the eye;\nTill at the last a cruel spoiler came,\nCropt this fair rose, and rifled all its sweetness,\nThen cast it like a loathsome weed away.\n\nOrphan, act. iv.\n\nThe following speech, full of imagery, is not natural in grief and dejection of mind.\n\nGonzalez. O my son! from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> dotage\nOf a father's fondness these ills arose.\nFor thee I've been ambitious, base, and bloody:\nFor thee I've plung'd into this sea of sin;\nStemming the tide with only one weak hand,\nWhile o'ther bore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> (to wreath thy brow),\nWhose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> has sunk me ere I reach'd the shore.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">Mourning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDE\">Bride</a>, act. v. sc. 6.\n\nThere is an enchanting picture of deep distress in Macbeth, where Macduff is represented lamenting his wife and children, inhumanly murdered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>. Stung to the heart with the news, he questions the messenger over and over: not that he doubted the fact, but that his heart revolted against so cruel a misfortune. After struggling some time with his grief, he turns from his wife and children to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a>: and then gives vent to his resentment, but still with manliness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>;\n\nO, I could play the woman with mine eyes,\nAnd braggaan with my tongne. But, gentle Heav'n!\nCut short all intermission; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> to front\nBring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;\nWithin\nMetaphorical expression, indeed, may sometimes be used with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> where a regular simile would be intolerable; but there are situations so severe and dispiriting, as not to admit even the slightest metaphor. It requires great delicacy of taste to determine with firmness, whether the present case be of that nature; perhaps it is; yet who could wish a single word of this admirable scene altered?\n\nBut metaphorical language is proper when a man struggles to bear with dignity or decency a misfortune however great; the struggle agitates and animates the mind:\n\nWolsey. Farewell, a long farewell to all my greatness;\nThis is the state of man; to-day he puts forth\nThe tender leaves of hope; to-morrow blossoms,\nAnd bears his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLUSHING\">blushing</a> honours thick upon him;\nThe third day comes a frost, a killing frost,\nAnd when he thinks, good easy man, full surely\nHis greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,\nAnd then he falls as I do.

But, \"what is first to nature, is not first to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>.\" Nature begins with causes, which produce effects. Man begins with effects, and by them ascends to causes. Thus all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> proceed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> in the reverse of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> order of things, from sensible to intelligible, from body the effect, to mind, which is both the first and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> cause. Now physics being the name given by the Stagyrite to the philosophy of body, some of his interpreters, from this necessary course of human studies, called that of mind METAPHYSICS, implying by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> not only that its subject is more sublime and difficult, but also that the study of it would be most properly and successfully entered upon AFTER THAT OF PHYSICS. To this name, which, though it has sometimes been treated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a>, is abundantly significant, the followers of Aristotle were led by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, who, to the books in which he pretends to elevate the mind above things corporeal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of God and things spiritual, prefixed the Greek words \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1 (A).\n\nThe science of Metaphysics has been divided, according to the objects which it considers, into six principal parts, which are called, 1. Ontology; 2. Cosmology; 3. Anthroposophy; 4. Psychology; 5. Pneumatology; and, 6. Metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>.\n\n1. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the science which is named ontology, investigates and explains the nature and essence of all beings, as well as the qualities and attributes that essentially appertain to them. Hence it has been said that ontology should proceed in its operations from the most simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>; such as do not admit of any other qualities of which they may be compounded. These simple ideas are of being, of essence, of substance, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a>, of existence as well with regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, of a necessary cause of unity; the idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEGATION\">negation</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between a being that is simple or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>, necessary or accidental, finite or infinite; the ideas of essential and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> properties, such as of the greatness, perfection, and goodness of beings, &c. The business therefore of ontology, is to make us acquainted with every kind of being in its nature and essential qualities, which distinguish it from all other beings. This knowledge being once established on simple principles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> consequences may thence be drawn, and those things proved after which the metaphysician inquires, and which is the business of his science to prove.\n\nIt is easy to conceive, that even a clear knowledge of beings, and their essential properties, would be still defective and useless to man, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he did not know how to determine and fix his ideas by proper denominations, and consequently to communicate his perceptions to those whom he would instruct, or against whom he is obliged to dispute. To render our ideas therefore intelligible to others, we must have determinate words or denominations for each being, and the qualities of each being; and ontology teaches us those terms which are so necessary to fix our ideas, and to give them the requisite perspicuity and precision, that when we endeavour to extend the sphere\n\n(A) \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1.

Synopsis Doctr. Peripat.\nDivisions of our knowledge, we may not waste our time in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIS\">dis</a>-\nputes about words.\n\n2. Metaphysics, having, in as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> a manner as possible, explained and established the principles above mentioned, continues its inquiries to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> part, which is called cosmology, and examines into the essence of the world and all that it contains; its eternal laws; of the nature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>; of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; of the nature of tangible bodies, their attributes and adjuncts; and of all that can be known by reasoning and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>.\n\nIt is also in cosmology that the metaphysicians of this school examine the Leibnitzian system; that is, whether God, in creating the world, must necessarily have created the best world; and if this world be so in fact. In this manner they pursue the argument, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to consequence, to its last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a>, frequently with very little advantage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and science.\n\n3. Anthroposophy, or the knowledge of man, forms the third branch of metaphysics. It is subdivided into two parts. The first, which consists in the knowledge of the exterior parts of the human frame, belongs not to this science, but to Anatomy and Physiology. The business of the metaphysician is here to ascertain the nature of those powers by which all the motions essential to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> are produced; and to discover, if possible, whether they be corporeal or spiritual. This inquiry leads at the same time to\n\n4. Psychology; which consists in the knowledge of the intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> in particular; concerning which the most profound, the most subtle, and most abstract researches, have been made that human reason is capable of; and concerning the substance of which, in spite of all these efforts, it is yet extremely difficult to support any positive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> with conclusive or probable arguments.\n\n5. The fifth part of metaphysics is called pneumatology. By this term, which has not been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, metaphysicians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the knowledge of all spirits, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a>, &c. It is easy to conceive what infinite art is necessary to give an account of that, of which nothing positive can ever be known in the present state of human existence. But the metaphysician of this school readily offers to show us, \"what is the idea of a spirit; the effective existence of a spirit; what are its general qualities and properties; that there are rational spirits, and that these rational spirits have qualities that are founded in the moral attributes of God;\" for this is in so many words what is attempted to be taught in pneumatology.\n\n6. Metaphysical theology, which Leibnitz and some others call theodicy, is the sixth and last branch of the science of metaphysics. It teaches us the knowledge of the existence of God; to make the most rational suppositions concerning his divine essence, and to form a just idea of his attributes and perfections, and to demonstrate them by abstract reasoning. Theodicy differs from natural theology, in as much as this last borrows, in fact, from theodicy proofs and demonstrations to confirm the existence of a supreme Being; but after having solidly established that great truth, by extending its consequences natural theology teaches us what are the relations and connexions that subsist between the supreme Being and men, and what are the duties which result from these relations.\n\nWe have briefly mentioned these divisions of the science, because they were once prevalent in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>. The greater part of them, however, appears to us to be not only superfluous, but such as can serve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other purpose than to perplex the mind. The only beings of which we know any thing are mind and body; and we have no reason to think that there are any other beings in the universe. Of bodies indeed there are various kinds, endowed with different properties: and it is extremely probable, that of minds endowed with different powers, the variety may be equally great. Our own minds we know to be united in one system with bodies by which they perform all their operations; and we can demonstrate that there is another Mind, which is independent of all body, and is the cause of all things. Between these there may be numberless orders of minds; but their energies are wholly unknown to us; and therefore they can never become the objects of science.\n\nMind and body therefore, i.e., the minds and bodies which we know to exist, together with their powers and properties, essential and accidental, can alone be the subjects of rational inquiry. We may inquire into the essence of mind and the essence of body, and endeavour to ascertain in what respects they differ. We may examine the nature of different bodies, in order to discover whether all bodies, however modified, have not something in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>; and we may consider the properties, relations, and adjuncts of bodies, and endeavour to distinguish those which are accidental from such as appear to be so necessary that without them body itself could not exist. Of minds we cannot make the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>. In this part of the science we have not sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> for an accurate and complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a>: we can only examine the powers of our own mind; and by probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> make some estimate of the powers of superior minds, as observation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> help us to guess at the powers of those which are placed beneath us in the scale of existence.\n\nIf this be so, Cosmology, as distinguished from Ontology, cannot properly be a branch of Metaphysics. For if mind and body, with their several powers, properties, and adjuncts, compose the universe, it is obvious, that when we have ascertained, as well as we are able, the essence of mind and the essence of body, together with the powers and properties of each, and have traced them all to the first cause, we have done every thing in the science of the universe, if we may use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, which belongs to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of the metaphysician. The particular laws of motion on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> and in the planetary system belong to the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> and astronomer.\n\nIn like manner, Anthroposophy, Psychology, or Pneumatology, if they be not words expressive of distinctions where there is no difference, seem to be at least very needlessly disjoined from each other. Of the nature of spirits we can know nothing but from contemplating the powers of our own minds; and the body of man is in the province, not of the metaphysician, but of the anatomist and physiologist. Anthroposophy, psychology, and pneumatology, if they be used to denote our knowledge of all minds except the Supreme, are words of the same import; for of no created minds except our own can we acquire such knowledge as deserves the name of science.\nOntology has sometimes been defined the science of being in the abstract; but in the course of our inquiries it will be seen, that being in the abstract is a phrase without meaning. Considered as the science of real beings and their properties, Ontology is a very significant word, of the same import with Metaphysics, comprehending in itself the knowledge of the nature of all things existing. Or if it be thought proper to make a distinction between ontology and theology, the former branch of the science will teach the knowledge of body and created minds, whilst it is the province of the latter to demonstrate the existence and attributes of that mind which is uncreated.\n\nBody and mind, therefore, with their properties, adjuncts, and powers, comprehend the whole subject of the science of metaphysics; and as we are earlier acquainted with body than with mind, the natural order of conducting our inquiries seems to be, to begin with the former, and thence proceed to the latter. It is obvious, however, that if we would pursue these inquiries with any hopes of success, we must first trace human knowledge from its source, ascertain the nature of truth, and show what kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> on each topic to be treated ought to enforce conviction. In this view of the science, metaphysics appears to be divided into three parts; the first treating of human understanding; the second, of body with its adjuncts; and the third, of mind with its powers.\n\nPrevious to the entering upon such inquiries, some philosophers of great merit have thought it expedient to explain the terms which they might have occasion to use. Their conduct is judicious and worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>; for the objects of metaphysics being, for the most part, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> not under the cognizance of the senses, are liable to be differently apprehended by different men, if the meanings of the words by which they are expressed be not ascertained with the utmost precision. We intend, however, to use very few words but in the common acceptation; and we therefore hope, that as terms of science are explained under different words in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>, to which references are made, we have little or no occasion for swelling the article by previous definitions. There are indeed two words which have given rise to much useless disputation, which yet cannot be banished from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> philosophy, and which it will therefore be proper here to define. The words to which we allude are idea and notion. These are very generally considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a>; but we think that much logomachy might have been avoided by assigning to each a determinate signification. We know not any philosopher who made much use of the word idea before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>; but with his mysterious doctrine concerning ideas we have here nothing to do: our present business is to ascertain the precise meaning of the word, which is evidently derived from \u1f30\u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd to see, as the word notion is from \"nosco, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVI\">novi</a>, notum,\" and that from \u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 to know or understand. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the two words, therefore, notion is more comprehensive than idea, because we know many things which cannot be seen. We have not a doubt, but that at first the word idea was employed to denote only those forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> objects which men contemplate in their imaginations, and which are originally received through the sense of sight. Its signification was afterwards extended to the relics of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>, of touch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, as well as of sight; and at last it was confounded with notion, which denotes the mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of whatever may be known. In our use of the word idea, except when we quote from others, we shall employ it only to denote that appearance which absent objects of sense make in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> (B); and by the word notion we shall denote our apprehension or knowledge of spirits, and all such things as, though they be the objects of science, cannot be perceived by the external senses. Having said this, we proceed to our inquiries, beginning with that into human understanding.\n\nPART I. OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">Preliminary</a> Observations on the Origin of our Ideas and Notions.\n\nTHAT the mind of man has no innate ideas or notions, but comes into the world ignorant of everything, is a truth which since the days of Locke has been very little disputed. In the first book of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Human Understanding, that acute philosopher has demonstrated, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> or first principles of all our knowledge are communicated to us by sensation; and he has compared the mind, previous to the operation of external objects upon the senses, to a tabula rasa or sheet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>. To repeat his arguments would swell the article to no purpose. There is not a man capable of attending to his own ideas, who\n\n(B) In thus restricting the meaning of the word idea, we have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to agree with the great English Lexicographer.\u2014\"He was particularly indignant against the almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> use of the word idea in the sense of notion or opinion, when it is clear that idea can only signify something of which an image may be formed in the mind. We may have an idea or image of a mountain, a tree, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>; but we cannot surely have an idea or image of an argument or proposition. Yet we hear the sages of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a> delivering their ideas upon the question under consideration; and the first speakers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> entirely coinciding in the idea, which has been so ably stated by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> member; or representing an idea as unconstitutional, and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. This Johnson called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> cant.\" Boswell's Life of Johnson.\nOrigin of who can entertain a doubt in what manner he received Ideas and them. Without the sense of sight, we could never have known colours; nor sound, without hearing; nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>, softness, smoothness, pain, or bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, without touch; nor odours, without smell, &c.\n\nSelf-evident as these facts are, objections have been started to the inferences drawn from them; and Locke has been accused of advancing principles subversive of all distinction between truth and falsehood, and favourable of course to universal scepticism.\u2014\"The first book of his Essay, which, with submission, (says Dr * Essay on Beattie*) I think the worst, tends to establish this dangerous doctrine, that the human mind, previous to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, is as susceptible of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> as of another: a doctrine which, if true, would go near to prove, that truth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> are no better than human contrivances; or at least that they have nothing permanent in their nature, but may be as changeable as the inclinations and capacities of men; and that there is no such thing as common sense in the world. Surely this is not the doctrine which Mr Locke meant to establish.\" We are so thoroughly satisfied that it is not, that we cannot help wondering how such inferences could, by a man of learning, genius, and candour, be drawn from anything which is to be found in the Essay on the Human Understanding.\n\nBut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> thinks Mr Locke's \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SIMILE\">simile</a> of the mind to white paper one of the most unlucky allusions that could have been chosen; because the human soul, when it begins to think, is not extended, nor of a white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, nor incapable of energy, nor wholly unfurnished with ideas, nor as susceptible of one impression or character as of any other:\" and it has been observed by another objector\u2020, that \"on a sheet of white paper you may write that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> is bitter; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WORMWOOD\">wormwood</a> sweet; fire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> pleasing and sufferable; that compassion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> are base; treachery, falsehood, and envy, noble; and that contempt is indifferent to us.\"\n\nAll this is true; but we apprehend it is not to the purpose. Mr Locke has nowhere expressed himself in such a manner as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to suppose that he believed the soul to be extended or coloured; or, when it begins to think, incapable of energy, and wholly unfurnished with ideas: but he certainly did believe, that it begins not to think the first instant of its existence, and that it acquires all the ideas of which it is ever possessed. We may undoubtedly write upon a piece of white paper that sugar is bitter, and that wormwood is sweet; but how the capacity of paper to receive the symbols of false <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> should make Mr Locke's comparison improper or dangerous, we cannot comprehend. Mr Usher indeed says, that it is improper on this account, \"that no human art or industry is able to make those impressions upon the mind: in respect of them, the mind discovers not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> capacity, but resists them with the force of fate.\" Does it indeed? does the mind reject the idea of sugar or of bitterness, of contempt or of indifference? May not any man have the idea of sugar and at the same time the idea of bitterness, and compare the one with the other in his mind, as well as the word sugar may be written beside the word bitter, and connected with it on the same piece of paper? In all this we perceive nothing that is impossible or even difficult.\n\nThe mind cannot indeed be made to feel that sugar has the same taste with wormwood; but who ever thought that it could? Not Mr Locke, we shall be bold to say; nor does his simile give the smallest countenance to such an absurdity. The author of the Essay on the Human Understanding understood his subject too well to imagine that either truth or falsehood could be communicated to paper, or that paper is capable of comparing ideas. Paper is capable of receiving nothing but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> or figures; and it passively receives whatever lines or figures we may choose to inscribe on it: yet if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> be carried over it in a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> impressed will not be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>; just as, to the mind of one eating sugar, the taste communicated is not that of wormwood.\n\nOn a piece of paper a circle may be described, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> beside it a square: in like manner an agreeable sensation may be communicated to the mind, and immediately afterwards a sensation that is disagreeable. These two sensations, or the ideas which they leave behind them, may be compared together; and it is certainly true that no art or industry can make them appear similar in the mind: but is it not equally true, that no art or industry can make the circle and the square similar on the paper? The paper is susceptible of any sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> figures, and the mind is equally susceptible of any sort of ideas or sensations; but figures dissimilar cannot be made to coincide, neither can discordant ideas be made to agree. Again, one may write upon paper, that \"a circle is a square;\" and likewise that \"a circle is not a square;\" and both these propositions may be communicated to the mind by the organs of sight or of hearing. The paper receives the words expressive of the false as well as those expressive of the true proposition; and the mind receives the ideas and relations signified by the one cluster of words as well as those signified by the other: but in the mind the idea of a square is different from that of a circle, and on the paper the figure of a square is different from the figure of a circle. The great difference between the mind and the paper is, that the former is conscious of its ideas, and perceives their agreement or disagreement; whereas the paper is not conscious of the figures drawn upon it, nor perceives anything about them. But still those figures are what they are; they either agree or disagree on the paper, as well as the ideas either agree or disagree in the mind. It is not in the power of the mind to alter the ideas of the square and the circle, nor in the power of the paper to alter the forms of these figures.\n\nIt appears then, that the principles of Mr Locke, and the comparison by which he illustrates them, have no more tendency to subvert the difference between truth and falsehood, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and wrong, than the passiveness of paper has to subvert the difference between a straight line and a crooked, a circle and a square: and with a view to establish the doctrine of innate ideas and distinctive principles of knowledge, we might with as much propriety ask, Whether it be possible to imagine that any mode of manufacture could make paper of such a nature, as that a pen drawn over it in a circular direction would leave the figure of a square? as that, \"Whether it be possible to imagine, that any course of education could ever bring a rational creature to believe that two and two are equal to three.\"\nThe mind being thus, as we may say, originally blank or white paper, void of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, without ideas or notions of any kind, the first question which we have to consider is, Whence and in what manner it derives the materials of all its knowledge? To this question the only answer which can be given is, That it derives them from observation and experience; from observation, either employed upon external objects of sense, or turned inwardly upon its own operations. Our senses, conversant about particular external objects, convey into the mind several distinct perceptions; such as those of colour, figure, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, bitterness, sweetness, and all those things which are usually called sensible qualities. The notions, ideas, or whatever else they may be called which are acquired in this manner, may be called sensible knowledge; and the source of that knowledge is termed sensation.\n\nThe other fountain from which experience furnishes the understanding with knowledge, is that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> which we are capable of giving to the operations of our own minds when employed about those ideas which were originally suggested by objects of sense. These operations, when the soul comes to reflect on them, furnish us with a set of notions entirely different from the ideas of sense; such as the notions of perception, thinking, doubting, believing, reasoning, knowing, willing, and all the different energies and passions of our own minds. Of these operations we are always conscious when we are awake; but it requires, as shall be shown afterwards, no inconsiderable effort to set them, as it were, at a distance, to reflect on them and consider what they are; but when we have made this effort, we acquire notions as distinct, and perhaps more important, than those ideas which we receive through the medium of the senses.\n\nSensation and reflection then furnish mankind with the first materials of all their knowledge. The mind seems not to have ideas or notions of any kind which it did not receive by one or other of these ways. By means of the senses it perceives external objects; and by that power which it has of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> its attention upon itself, it discovers the nature and manner of its own operations.\n\nAlthough the knowledge which we acquire from reflection be of equal importance, and perhaps of greater certainty than that which we receive through the medium of the senses, it comes into the mind at a much later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>; both because it is impossible that the faculties of the mind should operate without materials, and because it is much more difficult to attend to these operations even while they are going on, than to the objects of sense which solicit our attention. It is for this reason pretty late before children have any notions whatever of the operations of their own minds; and of the greater part of these operations the bulk of mankind have no clear or accurate notions during their whole lives. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, every human being is so surrounded with bodies, which perpetually and variously affect his senses, that a variety of sensible ideas force an entrance even into the minds of children. In order therefore to trace the procedure of the understanding, and to ascertain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> and limits of human knowledge, it should seem that we must begin with considering the external senses, that we may discover the manner in which we receive knowledge by means of them, the objects of that knowledge, and its certainty.\n\nIt is to be observed, however, that though we consider Sensation, the mind as possessed of many powers or faculties, and inquire first into the nature of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> which we conceive to be first exerted, this is done merely for the sake of proceeding in our subject with method and perspicuity. The mind is one simple and undivided being; and in every mental energy it is the whole mind, and not any part or portion of it, that is energetic. On this account, it is impossible to explain even the nature of sensation and perception to him who knows not what is meant by will or understanding; but to every one who is acquainted with the common import of these words, and who has read the short system of Logic inserted in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">Work</a>, we hope that our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of perception will be intelligible and convincing.\n\n**Chap. I. Of Sensation and Perception.**\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. I. Of Sensation.**\n\nThe Supreme Being, who made us and placed us Sensation in this world, has given us such powers of mind as he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> to be suited to our state and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>. He has given us the power of perceiving many objects around us; but that power is limited in various ways; and particularly in this, that without the organs of the several senses we perceive no external <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>. The senses, as every one knows, are five in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and each communicates its proper sensation. It is by the eyes alone that we see, by the ears that we hear, by the nose that we smell, and by the tongue and palate that we taste; the sense of feeling or touch is spread over the whole body, for we feel equally by our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> and by our feet, &c. To the powers of perception by the senses it is necessary not only that we have all the organs enumerated, but that we have them also in a sound and natural state. There are many disorders of the eye which cause total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>, as well as others which impair without destroying the power of vision. The same thing is true of the organs of all the other senses.\n\nAll this is so well known from experience, that it needs no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>; but it may be worth while to observe, that it is known from experience only*. For any thing* Reid's that we know to the contrary, our Creator might have endowed us with the power of perception by a thousand organs of sense, all different from those which we possess; and it is certain that he himself perceives every Man thing more perfectly than we do without bodily organs.\n\nFor it is to be observed, that the organs of sense are different from the being which is sentient.\u2014It is not gans them the eye which sees, nor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> which hears; these are selves not only the organs by which we see and hear. A man cannot see the satellites of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> but by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>, nor hear a low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> but by means of an ear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">trumpet</a>. Does he from this conclude that it is the telescope which sees those satellites, or the trumpet which hears that voice? Such a conclusion would be evidently absurd. It is no less absurd to conclude that it is the eye which sees, or the ear which hears. The telescope and the trumpet are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> organs of sight and of hearing, of which the eye and the ear are natural organs; but the natural organs see and hear as little as the artificial.\n\nThat this is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with respect to the eye and the ear,\ncar, is so obvious, that, as far as we know, it has never been denied. But with respect to the senses of touch, taste, and smell, the truth at first view appears not so evident. A celebrated writer has observed*, that \"after the utmost efforts, we find it beyond our power to conceive the flavour of a rose to exist in the mind: we are necessarily led to conceive that pleasure as existing in the nostrils, along with the impression made by the rose upon that organ (c); and the same will be the result of experiments with respect to every feeling of taste, touch, and smell. Touch (he says), affords the most satisfactory evidence, and philosophy detects the delusion.\" To detect this delusion requires, indeed, no great depth in philosophy; for it is so far from being true that we are necessarily led otherwise than by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>, of which the laws shall be explained afterwards, to conceive the pleasure or pain of touch as existing at that part of our body upon which the impression is made, that as every man must have observed, children previous to experience cannot distinguish the precise place of their bodies which is affected by the touch of any external object. Nay, we believe it will be found upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, that if a full grown man, with all the experience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> to guide him, be pricked with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> on any part of his body which he has seldom handled, and never seen, he will not readily nor at first put his finger upon the wound, nor even come very near to the wound. This, however, he would certainly and infallibly do were the sense of touch necessarily conceived as existing at the organ. To these observations objections may perhaps be made, which we cannot stay to obviate; but the following, we think, will admit of none. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to every man who has experienced that particular sensation of touch which Scaliger dignified with the name of a sixth sense, whether, whilst those sensations were new to him, he was necessarily led to conceive them as existing at any particular organ. If he was not, it follows undeniably that the organs of sensation are different from the being which is sentient; that it is not the eye which sees, the ear which hears, the nostrils which smell, the tongue which tastes, nor any part of the body which feels; and that it is by experience that we learn to associate our several sensations with those organs upon which the impressions are made.\n\nIt is, however, certain that we receive no sensation from external objects, unless when some impression is made upon the organ of sense, either by the immediate application of the object itself, or by some medium which passes between the object and the organ\u2020. In the other three the sensation is occasioned by the impression of some medium passing from the object to the organ. The effluvia of bodies drawn into the nostrils or with the breath are the medium of smell; the undulations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a> are the medium of hearing; and the rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> passing from visible objects to the eye are the medium of sight. These are facts known from experience to hold universally both in men and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>. It is likewise a law of our nature perfectly known to all who know anything of anatomy, that in order to actual sensation the impressions made upon the external organs must be communicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>, and from them to the brain. First, The object, either immediately, or by some medium, makes an impression upon the organ; the organ serves only as a medium, by which the impression is communicated to the nerves; and the nerves serve as a medium to carry it on to the brain. Here the corporeal part ends; at least we can trace it no farther. The rest is all intellectual.\n\nThe proof of these impressions upon the nerves and brain in sensation is this, that from many observations and experiments it is found, that when the organ of any sense is perfectly sound, and has the impression made upon it by the object ever so strongly, yet if the nerve which serves that organ be cut or tied hard, there is no sensation; and it is well known that disorders in the brain deprive us of sensation, while both the organ and its nerve are sound.\n\nThere is sufficient reason, therefore, to conclude, that in sensation the object produces some change in nature of the organ; that from the organ the change proceeds sensibly to the nerve, and from the nerve to the brain. Hence it is that we have positive sensations, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> objects, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> nonentities, such as darkness, blackness, and vacuity. For, sensation resulting from changes in the brain, whatever produces any change must of course occasion a new sensation: but it is obvious, that the mere absence of any impression, by the removal of the object which produced it, must as necessarily cause a change in the organ, nerves, and brain, as the presence of a new impression from a new object. To these changes, or that which immediately produces them, we give the name of impressions; because we know not how, in a general manner, to express more properly any change produced by an external cause without specifying the nature of that cause. Whether it be pressure, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a>, or repulsion, or vibration, or something unknown, for which we have no name, still it may be called an impression.\n\nSir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton was perhaps the first who supposed that the rays of light falling upon the bottom of the eye excite vibrations in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUNICA\">tunica</a> retina; and that those vibrations being propagated along the solid fibres of the optic nerves into the brain, cause the actual sensation of seeing. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> was adopted by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a>, applied to the other senses, and shown to be\n\n(c) Another eminent writer thinks on this subject very differently, and in our opinion much more justly.\u2014\"Suppose (says Dr Reid) a person who never had this sense (viz. smell) before, to receive it all at once, and to smell a rose; can he perceive any similitude or agreement between the smell and the rose? or indeed between it and any other object whatever? Certainly he cannot. He finds himself affected in a new way, he knows not why, or from what cause. He is conscious that he is not the cause of it himself; but he cannot from the nature of the thing determine whether it be caused by body or spirit; by something near, or by something at a distance. He cannot give it a place any more than he can give a place to melancholy or joy; nor can he conceive it to have any existence but when it is smelled,\" Inquiry into the Human Mind, ch. 2, sect. 2.\nbe at least as probable as any which has yet been invented to account for the perception of external objects by means of the organs of sense. Be this as it may, experience informs us, that whatever be the nature of those impressions and changes which are made by external objects upon the senses, nerves, and brain, we have without them no actual sensation, and of course perceive nothing *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> extra*. Hence it has been supposed, that the mind is wholly passive in sensation, and that sensation is necessarily produced by those impressions. But this we believe to be a mistake. Every man who has been attentive to his own thoughts and actions, must know instances of impressions having been certainly made upon his organs of sense without producing any sensation, or suggesting to his mind the perception of the particular objects by which the impressions were caused. He whose mind is intensely employed in any particular pursuit, may have his eyes open upon an object which he does not see; or he may not hear the sound of a clock striking within two yards of him: Nay, we will venture to affirm, that there is hardly one reader of this article to whom such absences of sensation have not often occurred. Now, as there is no reason to suppose, that in the one case the undulations of the air, caused by the striking of the clock, did not reach his ears, or that in the other the rays of light, reflected from the object, did not fall upon his eyes, which were open to receive them; the only reason which can be assigned for his not having, in these instances, had audible and visible sensations, is, that his mind was so engaged in something else as not to pay to the vibrations in his brain that attention, if we may so say, without which impressions *ab extra* can produce no sensation. There are, indeed, some impressions on the organs of sense so violent and so sudden, as to force themselves upon the mind however employed. Such are those made on the ear by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>, and on the eye by strong light. In these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, sensation is involuntary and unavoidable; whence we conclude, not that in such instances the mind is passive or destitute of energy, but that by the violent agitation given to the brain, it is roused from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVERIE\">reverie</a>, and compelled to give attention. It appears, therefore, that in sensation the mind exerts some kind of energy; for in nothing but in the sentient being itself can we seek for the cause why, when all external circumstances are the same, organic impressions sometimes produce sensations and sometimes not; and that cause can only be the energy of the mind; what kind of energy we pretend not to say.\n\n**Sect. II. Of Perception by the Senses.**\n\nHow the correspondence is carried on between the thinking principle within us and the material world without us, has always, as Dr Reid observes, been found a very difficult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> to those philosophers who consider themselves as obliged to account for every phenomenon in nature. It is, indeed, a problem of which we expect not to see a complete solution. A few steps beyond the vulgar we may certainly go; but the nature of that connexion by which the mind and body are united, will probably remain forever unknown. One question, however, which has employed much of the attention of philosophers, both ancient and modern, appears to be not wholly unanswerable. It is, Whether by means of our senses we perceive external objects mediately or immediately; or in other words, Whether sensation and perception be one and the same thing, or two things succeeding each other? On this subject, till of late, there appears to have been in the main a great uniformity in the sentiments of philosophers, notwithstanding their variations respecting particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. Of some of the most eminent of them, we shall give the opinions as we find them collected by one* who is well acquainted with* Dr Reid in his Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man.\n\n\"Plato illustrates our manner of perceiving external objects thus: He supposes a dark subterraneous cave, in which men <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> bound in such a manner as that they can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> their eyes only to one part of the cave. Far behind there is a light, of which some rays come over a wall to that part of the cave which is before the eyes of our prisoners. A number of men variously employed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> between them and the light, whose shadows are seen by the prisoners, but not their persons themselves. In this manner did that philosopher conceive that by our senses we perceive not things themselves, but only the shadows of things; and he seems to have borrowed his notions on this subject from the disciples of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>.\n\n\"If we make due allowance for Plato's allegorical genius, his sentiments with respect to sensation and perception correspond very well with those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIPATETICS\">Peripatetics</a>. Aristotle, the founder of that school, seems to have thought, that the soul consists of two or three parts, or rather that we have three souls\u2014the vegetable, the animal, and the rational. The animal soul is held to be a certain form of the body, which is inseparable from it, and perishes at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. To this soul the senses belong; and he defines a sense to be that which is capable of receiving the sensible forms, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of objects, without any of the matter of them; as wax receives the form of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> without any of its matter. Of this doctrine it seems to be a necessary consequence, that bodies are constantly sending forth, in all directions, as many different kinds of forms without matter as they have different sensible qualities. This was accordingly maintained by the followers of Aristotle, though not, as far as we know, taught by himself. They disputed concerning the nature of these forms or species, whether they were real beings or nonentities: but of matter and form we shall have occasion to speak afterwards.\n\n\"After Aristotle had kept possession of the schools of Des Cartes for more than a thousand years, his authority, which had often supplied the place of argument, was called in question by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a> and others. Des Cartes, however, was the first philosopher who, convinced of the defects of the prevailing system, attempted to form another entirely new: but on the nature of perception by means of the senses he differs little or nothing from those who had preceded him in that department of science. He denies, indeed, and refutes by solid reasoning, the doctrine which maintains that images, species, or forms of external objects, come from the objects themselves, and enter into the mind by the avenues...\"\nOf avenues of the senses. But he takes it for granted, as all the old philosophers had done, that what we immediately perceive must be either in the mind itself, or in the brain, in which the mind is immediately present. The impressions made upon our organs, nerves, and brain, can be nothing, according to his philosophy, but various modifications of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>, figure, and motion. There can be nothing in the brain like sound or colour, taste or smell, heat or cold. There are sensations in the mind, which by the laws of the union of the soul and body, are raised on occasion of certain traces in the brain; and although he sometimes gives the name of ideas to these traces, he does not think it necessary that they should be perfectly like the things which they represent, any more than that words and signs should resemble the things which they signify.\n\nAccording to this system it would appear, that we perceive not external objects directly by means of our senses; but that these objects, operating either immediately or immediately upon the organs of sense, and they again upon our nerves and brain, excite in the mind certain sensations; whence we infer the existence of external objects from our sensations of which they are the cause. Perception of external objects, therefore, according to Des Cartes, is not one simple original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of the mind, but may be resolved into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of reasoning from effects to causes.\n\nThe doctrines of Malebranche, Locke, and Hartley, respecting perception, differ not essentially from that of Des Cartes. Malebranche, indeed, supposes, that external objects are not themselves the causes of perceptions; but that the Deity, being always present to our minds more intimately than any other being, does, upon occasion of the impressions made upon our organs of sense, discover to us, as far as he thinks proper, and according to fixed laws, his own ideas of the object: and thus, according to him, we see all things in God, or in the divine ideas. He agrees, however, with Des Cartes and the ancient philosophers, in considering it as a truth which it is impossible to refute, that we perceive not the objects without us, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, and stars, &c. because it is not likely that the soul sallies out of the body, and takes a walk, as it were, through the heavens to contemplate these objects. She sees them not therefore by themselves; and the immediate object of the mind, when it sees the sun, is not the sun itself, but something which is intimately united to the mind, and is that which he calls an idea.\n\nLocke, speaking of the reality of our knowledge, says: \"It is evident the mind knows not things immediately, but only by the intervention of the ideas it has of them. Our knowledge, therefore, according to him, is real only so far as there is a conformity between our ideas and the things which they represent.\" The manner of our perceiving external objects he illustrates by the following similitude: \"Methinks the understanding is not much unlike a closet wholly shut from light, with only some little opening left, to let in external visible resemblances or ideas of things without. Would the pictures coming into such a dark room but stay there, and lie so orderly as to be found upon occasion, it would very much resemble the understanding of a man in reference to all objects of sight, and the ideas of them.*\" He has elsewhere defined an idea thus: \"Whatsoever the mind perceives in itself, or is the immediate object of perception, thought, or understanding, that I call an idea; and the power to produce any idea in our mind, I call standing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the subject wherein the power is.\" He likewise thinks it \"easy to draw this observation, that the ideas of what he calls primary qualities of bodies, viz. extension, solidity, figure, mobility, &c. are resemblances of these qualities as they really exist in the bodies themselves.\n\nThis unguarded expression, which affirms that ideas in the mind are the resemblances of external things, has brought upon Mr Locke much undeserved ridicule. That on this and other occasions he uses the word idea with too great latitude, and that he often confounds ideas with sensations, and even with the causes of sensation, must be admitted by his warmest admirers: but we believe, that by an attentive reader, who peruses his whole work, and compares such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> as are obscure with those which are clearer, his meaning may always be discovered, and with respect to sensation and perception will generally be found just. That by calling the ideas of primary qualities resemblances of the qualities themselves, he meant nothing more than that bodies in all possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a> impress the senses, nerves, and brain, in such a manner as to produce in the mind certain sensations, between which and those impressions there is an inseparable, though unknown, connection, is evident from the account which he gives of the manner of perception. \"Our senses (says he), conversant about particular sensible objects, do convey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things according to those various ways in which these objects affect them: and thus we come by those ideas we have of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, white, heat, cold, soft, hard, bitter, sweet, and all those which we call sensible qualities; which when I say the senses convey into the mind, I mean, they from external objects convey into the mind what produces those perceptions.\" And as bodies can act only by impulse, he adds, that \"those perceptions can be produced only by an impression made upon the senses, and some motion thence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> by our nerves to the brain or seat of perception.\"\n\nDr Hartley was the pupil of Locke and Newton; and has, in a more satisfactory manner than all who had preceded or have since followed him, explained the material part of the process of perception. His principles we shall have occasion, during the course of the article, to develop pretty fully. For our present purpose it is sufficient to say, that all his observations and arguments evidently suppose, that nothing distant from the mind can be perceived in the immediate act of sensation; but that the apparently immediate perception of external objects is an instance of early and deep-rooted association.\n\nIn this sentiment Mr Hume agrees with his predecessors; but he obscures his philosophy, and misleads his reader, by confounding sensations with the impressions from which they proceed. \"Every one (says he) will allow, that there is a considerable difference between the perceptions of the mind, when a man feels the pain of excessive heat, or the pleasure of moderate warmth, and when he afterwards recalls to his memory this sensation, or anticipates it by his imagination.\"\nThe less forcible and lively of these perceptions he with great propriety calls ideas; but it is either through wilful perverseness, or confusion of intellect, that he chooses to call the others impressions. Sensation and perception are caused by impressions; but they are no more impressions themselves, than the pain occasioned by the stroke of a bludgeon is the stroke itself, or the bludgeon with which it was struck. But more of this afterwards.\n\nThus far, then, that we perceive not external objects directly, but infer their existence from certain sensations excited in our minds by the operation of these objects upon our senses, nerves, and brain, seems to have been the opinion of every philosopher from Pythagoras\u2020 to Mr Hume. For an opinion so universal, and at the same time so contrary to the persuasion of the multitude, some cogent reason must have been assigned. That reason has been given by many philosophers, but by none with greater perspicuity than Dr Porterfield, in his Essay concerning the Motion of the Eyes. \"How body acts upon the mind, or mind upon body (says he), I know not; but this I am very certain of, that nothing can act, or be acted upon, where it is not: and therefore our mind can never perceive anything but its own proper modifications, and the various states of the sensorium to which it is present. So that it is not the external sun and moon, which are in the heavens, that our mind perceives, but only their image or representation impressed on the sensorium. How the soul of a seeing man sees those images, or how it receives those ideas from such agitations in the sensorium, I know not; but I am sure it can never perceive the external bodies themselves to which it is not present.\"\n\nThis reasoning appears to have force; and, perhaps, the unanimous agreement of thinking men in all ages has still greater force; yet the doctrine which prevailed so long, and which to Locke appeared so evident as to need no proof, has been since called in question by some eminent philosophers in our own country; who, though they allow that we cannot perceive external objects but by means of the senses, yet affirm that they are the objects themselves which we perceive directly; and that in perception there is no association which can be resolved into a process of reasoning from sensations the effects, to external objects the causes. Dr Reid, who was perhaps the first, and is unquestionably the ablest of this class of philosophers, had expressed himself on the subject of Perception as follows:\n\n\"If we attend to the act of our mind, which we call the perception of an external object of sense, we shall find in it these three things: First, Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> or notion of the object perceived. Secondly, A strong and irresistible conviction and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of its present existence. And, Thirdly, That this conviction and belief are immediate, and not the effect of reasoning.\" To the first and second of these propositions, we are persuaded that Des Cartes and Locke would readily have assented; nor do we imagine that they would have denied the third, had the author allowed that this strong and irresistible conviction is the consequence of an early and deep-rooted association resolvable into a process of reasoning. This, however, the learned professor does not allow; for he repeatedly affirms, that it is instinctive and original, and that \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of our power of perception determines us to hold the existence of what we distinctly perceive as a first principle, from which other truths may be deduced, but it is deduced from none.\" With this view of the matter, he could with no propriety attempt to support his own opinion by argument; but to the reasonings of Dr Porterfield and others in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the Cartesian theory, he replies in the following words: \"That nothing can act immediately where it is not, I think must be admitted (D); for I agree with Sir Isaac Newton, that power without substance is inconceivable. It is a consequence of this, that nothing can be acted upon immediately where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> is not present; let this, therefore, be granted. To make the reasoning conclusive, it is farther necessary, that when we perceive objects, either they act upon us, or we act upon them. This does not appear self-evident, nor have I ever met with any proof of it.\"\n\nOf the profundity of Dr Reid's understanding, we have the most firm conviction; nor is there any metaphysical physician, ancient or modern, from whom we differ with greater reluctance: but we cannot help thinking this a very rash assertion, as his own works appear to us to afford complete proofs that, in perception, the mind both acts and is acted upon. Let us attend, however, to the reasons which, on this occasion, indu-\n\n(D) One of the most celebrated of Dr Reid's followers thinks otherwise. \"That no distant subject can act upon the mind, is a proposition (says Lord Kames) which undoubtedly requires evidence; for it is not instinctively certain: And, therefore, till the proposition be demonstrated, every man may without scruple rely upon the conviction of his senses, that he hears and sees things at a distance.\" But his Lordship ought to have known, that Locke and Berkeley, the two philosophers whom he was combating, have nowhere called in question the conviction of their senses. They do not, indeed, admit, that the external organs are themselves percipient, or that by means of them the mind can immediately perceive distant objects; but they have no where denied, that through the medium of them the mind comes to the knowledge of external existence. And the reasons which they assign for this twofold opinion are, that in perception they experience <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> or the effects of action, which is not their own; and that it is an intuitive truth, that nothing can act where it is not present. \"But admitting (says his Lordship) that no being can act but where it is, is there any thing more simple or more common, than the acting upon subjects at a distance by intermediate means?\" This holds in fact with respect both to seeing and hearing. It certainly does, and with respect to the other senses likewise; but it is the very thing for which Locke and Berkeley would have contended, had any man in their days presumed to call it in question. It is the very foundation of their system; and if it be granted, nothing can be more evident, than that external existence is not the immediate object of perception. See Appendix to Elements of Criticism.\nOf Perception: either of the object on the mind or of the mind on the object.\n\n\"When we say, that one being acts upon another, we mean, that some power or force is exerted by the agent which produces, or has a tendency to produce, a change in the thing acted upon. If this be the meaning of the phrase, as I conceive it is, there appears no reason for asserting, that in perception, either the object acts upon the mind or the mind upon the object. An object, in being perceived, does not act at all. I perceive the walls of the room where I sit; but they are perfectly inactive, and therefore act not upon the mind. To be perceived, is what logicians call an external denomination, which implies neither action nor quality in the object perceived.\"\n\nThis last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> we pretend not to understand. Substance without qualities is to us inconceivable, and certainly is no object of perception; for Dr Reid himself has told us, and told us truly, that \"the objects of perception are the various qualities of bodies.\" That an object in being perceived does not act at all, is directly contrary to what the ingenious author has taught us, both in his Inquiry and in his Essays, viz. that \"it is a law of our nature that we perceive not external objects, unless certain impressions be made by the object upon the organ, and by means of the organ upon the nerve and brain;\" for if the external object in being perceived make impressions, it is certainly not true that it acts not at all. It is indeed readily acknowledged, that when one perceives the walls of the room where he sits, these walls do not act immediately upon the organs of sight; but it does not, therefore, follow, that they are perfectly inactive; for it is known to all mankind, that from every point of the wall which is seen, rays of light are reflected to the eye; that those rays make upon the retina an impression, which is conveyed by the optic nerve to the brain; and that this impression on the brain is one of the immediate causes of vision.\n\nIn what particular manner it causes vision, we shall never be able to discover, till we know more of the laws which unite mind and body, and by which one of these is qualified to act upon the other; but because we know not the manner of this operation, to affirm that there is no operation at all seems to be as absurd as it would be to affirm, because we perceive no necessary connexion between a stroke and the sensation of sound, that the sound of a musical string is not caused by the stroke of a plectrum. That God might have given us powers of perception of a different kind from those which we possess, there can be no doubt; but with what we might have been, we have no concern. As we are, we know perfectly that the eye is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of vision, because without it nothing can be seen: we know also that the retina and optic nerves are equally necessary; because if they be disordered, vision is still wanting; we know likewise, that the brain is necessary to all perception; because, when it is disordered, thinking either entirely ceases, or is proportionably disturbed. And, lastly, We are not more certain of our own existence, than that actual perception takes place but when the object makes an impression upon some organ of sense; for when no rays of light fall upon the eye, we see nothing; when no sapid body is applied to the tongue and palate, we taste nothing; and if we could be removed from every thing solid, we would feel nothing. These are conclusions which cannot be controverted. They are admitted equally by the philosopher and by the plain mittered man of common sense; nor are they rendered one whit less certain by our not being able to go a step farther, so as to discover in what manner the brain or the affections of it can be the immediate instrument of sensation and perception. For (as Dr Reid, in the spirit of true philosophy, observes), in the operation of mind, as well as in those of bodies, we must often be satisfied with knowing that certain things are connected and invariably follow one another, without being able to discover the chain that goes between them. It is to such connexions that we give the name of laws of nature; and when we say that one thing produces another by a law of nature, this signifies no more than that one thing which we call in popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> the cause, is constantly and invariably followed by another which we call the effect; and that we know not how they are connected.\n\nIn the preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> we have observed, that in sensation the mind exerts some energy; and therefore, as on every hypothesis perception is a consequence of sensation, it follows, that in perception the mind cannot be wholly inactive. Dr Reid, in his Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man, seems to affirm that it is. \"I see no reason (says he) to believe, that in perception, the mind acts upon the object. To perceive an object is one thing, to act upon it is another: Nor is the last at all included in the first. To say that I act upon the wall by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> at it, is an abuse of language, and has no meaning.\" This is indeed true; it would be a great abuse of language to say, that by looking at the wall a man acts upon it: but we do not believe that any man ever said or supposed such a thing. The philosophers, whose opinion he is combating, might argue in this manner. We are conscious that in perception the mind is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>; nothing can act immediately where it is not; the mind cannot act immediately upon external existence: external existence therefore is not the immediate object of that energy which is exerted in perception. As Dr Reid affirms that external existence is the immediate object of perception, he must deny the first proposition in this argument; for if it be granted, as we have just seen that in his reply to Dr Porterfield he admits the second, the laws of reasoning will compel him to admit the third. To say, that in perception the mind acts not upon external objects, is a truth in which all mankind are agreed; and it is the very principle from which his antagonists infer, that the conviction of the present existence of external objects is not an original and instinctive consequence of sensation, but an early and deep-rooted association which may be resolved into a process of reasoning. His meaning, therefore, must be, that in perception the mind acts not at all: but this is directly contrary to his definition of perception, which he calls an act of the mind: it is likewise contrary to his theory of perception, as it is detailed in the Inquiry into the Human Mind on the principles of Common Sense. We are there taught, with equal elegance and perspicuity, \"that an impression made by an external object upon the organ, nerves, and brain,\"\nobjects are perceived by means of images of them in the mind or the brain; nor do we think that Descartes or Locke has anywhere affirmed that they are, otherwise than by an expression obviously figurative, denoting not that the actual shapes of things are delineated in the brain or upon the mind, but only that impressions of some kind or other are conveyed to the brain by means of the organs of sense and their corresponding nerves; and that between these impressions and the sensations excited in the mind, there is a real, and in our present state a necessary, though unknown, connexion.\n\nUpon the whole, we think that there is good evidence for believing, that in perception the process of nature is as follows: First, If the object be not in contact with the organ of sense, there must be some medium which passes between them; as, in vision, the rays of light; in hearing, the vibrations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> air; and in smelling, the effluvia of the body smelled; otherwise we have neither sensation nor perception. Secondly, There must be some action or impression upon the organ of sense, either by the immediate application of the object, as in the two senses of touch and taste; or by the medium that goes between them, as in the other three senses. Thirdly, The nerves which go from the brain to the organ, must receive some impression by means of that which was made upon the organ; and by means of these nerves that impression must be carried to the brain. Fourthly, The impression made upon the organs, nerves, and brain, rouses the dormant energy of the mind; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> action of the mind and the object produces a sensation. And, lastly, As we know by experience that the mind alone cannot, by any exertion of its own, produce one sensation, and are intuitively certain that nothing can begin to exist without a cause, we infer from the existence of any new sensation the existence of some other cause than the internal energy of the mind from which that sensation proceeds; and this cause experience teaches us to be the external object. This process is carried on so rapidly, and the several parts of it, by being continually repeated, are so closely associated, that except by a reflex act of the mind we distinguish them not from one another, and therefore we denominate the whole perception.\n\nIt is with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> diffidence that we advance a doctrine which Dr Reid has controverted; but he differs from us only in the last stage of the process, where he supposes sensation and perception to be two simple and independent acts of the mind. Yet he sometimes expresses himself, as if he thought, as we do, that in perception the belief of the present existence of external objects is rather the result of experience, than an instinctive persuasion. Thus, speaking of the perception which we have in smelling a rose, he says, \"Perception has always an external object, and the object of my perception in this case is that quality in the rose which I discern by the sense of smell. Observing that the agreeable sensation is raised when the rose is near, and ceases when it is removed, I am led chap. 15, by my nature [we think by experience would have been more proper] to conclude some quality to be in the rose, which is the cause of this sensation. This quality in the rose is the object perceived; and that act of my mind, by which I have the conviction and belief...\"\nObjects of lie of this quality, is what in this case I call perception. Again (he says) that \"three of our senses, viz., the five Senses, smell, taste, and hearing, originally gives us only certain sensations, and a conviction that these sensations are occasioned by some external object. We give a name to that quality of the object by which it is fitted to produce such a sensation, and connect that quality with the object and with its other qualities. Thus we learn, that a certain sensation of smell is produced by a rose; and that quality in the rose by which it is fitted to produce this sensation we call the smell of the rose. Here it is evident that the sensation is original. The perception that the rose has that quality which we call its smell, is acquired.\"\n\nTo this doctrine no Cartesian could possibly object; for it is the very account which Des Cartes himself would have given of perception by the organ of smell, as it resolves such a perception into an early association between a certain sensation and that external quality from which we know by experience that the sensation proceeds. Indeed this excellent author repeatedly affirms, that every different perception is conjoined with a sensation which is proper to it; and that the one is the sign, and the other the thing signified. He likewise doubts*, whether children, from the time that they begin to use their senses, make a distinction between things which are only conceived or imagined, and things which really exist. But if the conviction of the present existence of external objects were in perception instinctive, we cannot see how there could be room for such a doubt; for the mere senses of children are as perfect as those of full grown men; and they know well the difference between actually sucking their nurses and only thinking of that operation, though they be not capable of expressing that difference in language.\n\nBut if in perception our conviction of the present existence of external objects be not instinctive, what, it may be asked, is the evidence that such objects really exist? This question we shall partly answer in the following section, and more completely when we come to examine Berkeley's theory of the non-existence of matter: but from what has been said already, it is sufficiently evident, that every sensation compels us to believe in the present existence of something different from ourselves, as well as from our sensations.\n\nSect. III. Of the Objects of each Sense respectively.\n\nHitherto we have considered sensation and perception in general, and shown that it is not by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a> that we perceive the existence of external objects. This will appear more clearly, if we can ascertain the precise nature of that information which each sense affords us: and in order to this, we shall begin with the sense of touch, not only because it is that which is certainly first exercised, but also because there is a meaning in which all the others may be resolved into it.\n\nBy means of touch we perceive many things, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> are, heat and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, extension, figure, solidity, and motion. Of these perceptions, some are of heat immediate; and others, as we are persuaded, early associations, which may be resolved into a process of reasoning. The perceptions of heat and cold are immediate. When a person for the first time in his life approaches the fire, he feels heat; and when he is first exposed to the frost, he feels cold. What are heat and cold, and where do they reside? They are obviously the reverse of each other; but are they external objects, or mere sensations in the mind? They are undoubtedly sensations which have no existence but when they are felt. To every man not altogether a stranger to these speculations, this proposition is self-evident; but to the bulk of the people it appears an extravagant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a>. To make it plain, however, to the meanest capacity, it is sufficient to observe, that at a certain distance the fire has no perceptible influence upon any person; if that distance be lessened, we feel an agreeable warmth; approach a little nearer, and the warmth becomes disagreeable; and still nearer, it will rise to pain. No man supposes the pain inflicted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> to exist in the sword, or anywhere else but in a sentient being. It is equally absurd to suppose pain to exist in fire, or anywhere else but in a sentient being. But that which at one distance is pain, at another is only agreeable warmth; and since warmth and pain are only different degrees of the same feeling, it is equally absurd to suppose the one as the other in the fire. What then is the object of sense when we feel heat? There is obviously no object beyond the present sensation.\n\nBut has the sensation of heat no cause independent of itself? Undoubtedly it has, and experience teaches us that the cause is in the fire. We know that we cannot produce the sensation of heat in ourselves by any mental energy of our own; and we are intuitively certain, that nothing can begin to exist without some cause. A man on the top of a mountain covered with snow, may imagine or remember what he felt when in the neighbourhood of fire, and thus have in his mind what is called an idea of heat; but that idea will not warm him (E) like the actual sensation, which no exertion of his own can in such circumstances produce. When he leaves the mountain, however, and approaches the fire, he feels the sensation actually produced, and produced as often as he makes the experiment. He is, therefore, under the necessity of inferring, that in the fire there is some power or quality which, acting either immediately or immediately upon his sense of touch, excites the feeling which is called heat. What that power is, we shall perhaps never be able to discover; but it is self-evident, that it is neither heat nor the resemblance of\n\n---\n\n* Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man.\n\n---\n\n(e) \u2014 Who can hold a fire in his hand,\n   By thinking on the frosty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAUCASUS\">Caucasus</a>?\n   Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite,\n   By bare imagination of a feast?\n\nOr wallow naked in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>'s snow,\n   By thinking on fantastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>'s heat?\n   Oh no! the apprehension of the good\n   Gives but the greater feeling to the worse.\n\nK. Richard II.\nThe same reasoning holds good with respect to cold. There is at certain times, and in certain countries, some power in the air which congeals <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> and causes cold; but that power is as different from the sensation of cold, as the power of fire is different from the sensation of heat, or the point of a sword from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> wound.\n\nBy the sense of touch we perceive extension, figure, solidity, &c., but we do not perceive them immediately as we perceive heat and cold; for extension, figure, and solidity, are not sensations. Those perceptions then must be acquired; and more clearly to ascertain the manner in which we acquire them, let us suppose a man from his birth destitute of the sense of sight and the power of local motion, but possessed of intellect and every other faculty which we enjoy.\u2014Such a person, it is obvious, would be capable of every sensation and perception which is original to us, except the perception of colours; but we doubt whether it would be possible to give him perceptions of extension, figure, and solidity. Let us try; and as he cannot move a single limb or member of himself, let us suppose a solid substance of small dimensions to be gently pressed against any part of his body; what would such pressure communicate to him? We think it could communicate nothing but a new sensation, to which, as it is neither pleasing nor painful, no name has hitherto been given, except the general one of feeling. This sensation he would not know whether to refer to an external or internal cause; or rather he could have no notion whatever of an external cause, though he would at the same time be conscious that the new sensation was not excited by any energy of his own will. Were the pressure to be gradually increased till it rose to pain, our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> man would still be conscious of nothing but a sensation, which could not lead him to the notion of extension, figure, or solidity, because mere sensations cannot be conceived as either solid or extended. Let us next suppose the pressure to be applied successively to different parts of his body; he would now indeed be conscious of successive sensations, but he could not assign to them either extension or place: for it has been already shown that the external parts of the body are not themselves sentient; and it shall be shown afterwards, that to a man who has never perceived motion, place is absolutely inconceivable.\n\nLastly, let us suppose the dimensions of the pressing substance to be greatly enlarged: what would then follow? nothing, we apprehend, but an increase of pain: for though his whole body were pressed ab extra, the pressure could affect the individual being which is sentient, not more extensively, but only more violently. It appears, therefore, that a man blind from his birth, and destitute of the power of local motion, could never be made to perceive extension, figure, or solidity.\n\nLet us now suppose this man to receive by a miracle the use of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, and to be suddenly prompted, by some instinctive impulse, to arise and walk. So long as he met with no obstacle in his way, he would not, we apprehend, acquire by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> any correct notions of extension or figure; but were a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> or log of wood of considerable dimensions to be laid across his usual walk, the case would soon be altered. He would feel himself interrupted in his course, and he the respective senses would at the same instant recognize his wonted sensations of touch. After being twice or thrice thus interrupted, he would learn from experience that the interruption or resistance proceeded from the same cause which in this instance communicated to him the sensation of feeling; and were he to run his hand along the surface of the log or stone, he would perceive the resistance and the sensation continued. As every effect must have an adequate cause, this continued resistance would compel him to believe the continuity of something external in every direction in which he felt his hand resisted; but such continuity of being is all that is meant by the word extension. At the very same time, and by the very same means, he would gradually acquire the perception of figure; for by running his hand in every direction over the surface of the obstacle which opposed him, he would soon perceive it on all sides limited; but the limits of extension is a phrase of precisely the same import with figure. It appears, therefore, that without the power of local motion, men could never, by the sense of touch, acquire the notions of extension and figure; and the same will be found to be the case with respect to hardness and softness.\n\nWhen we press our hand gently against a stock or stone, we feel a sensation which is neither painful and soft nor pleasing. When we press it more violently, the sensation becomes painful, and we experience in the object a resistance which we have not power to overcome. When we press <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> or pomatum very gently, we have a sensation in all respects similar to that which we felt when we gently touched the stock or the stone. But when we press the butter with violence, we feel no pain, and experience little resistance; for the parts of which it is composed give way before the hand, though the parts of the stock or the stone remained fixed and immoveable. That the parts of one body should thus resist a pressure to which the parts of another so readily yield, must proceed from some difference in the texture of the two bodies: for by the sense of touch we perceive the effects to be different; and are therefore certain that they must proceed either from different causes, or from the same cause operating with different degrees of force. That particular texture which makes the parts of a stone resist the pressure of touch, we call hardness; and the texture which makes the parts of butter or pomatum give way to touch, we call softness. But what hardness and softness are in themselves, touch cannot inform us; for they are neither sensations, nor similar to sensations. We acquire, however, by experience, so complete notions of hardness and softness, that every one who understands the English language perfectly knows the meaning of these words as soon as he hears them; and when he is told that one body is hard and another soft, he knows with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> certainty that the meaning of the assertion is, that the parts of the body which is said to be hard are held together by some unknown cause operating forcibly, and that the parts of the other are held together by the same or a similar cause operating with less force.\n\nWe acquire the notions of roughness and smoothness in the very same way and by the very same means that we\nObjects of we acquire ideas of extension and figure. To describe the process at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> would certainly be superfluous; for if what we have said concerning our perceptions of extension and figure be just and intelligible, every one will, without farther assistance, discover for himself how he perceives roughness and smoothness. Motion shall be considered among the adjuncts of body; but in order to understand what body itself is, it will be necessary, before we dismiss the sense of touch, to inquire how we come by the notion of solidity.\n\nSolidity is one of those notions, or, in the language of Locke, one of those ideas, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> said to be acquired by the sense of touch. That touch gives the first hint towards our notion of solidity, is certainly true; but that hint must be afterwards improved by the intellect, or we never could have an adequate knowledge of what is meant when any thing is said to be absolutely solid. We know by experience, that we can at pleasure open and shut our empty hand without meeting with any resistance. We know likewise, that when we grasp an ivory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> of three or four inches diameter, no force which we can exert will bring together the several parts of the hand, which were easily brought together when we grasped nothing. In this way do we acquire our first notion of solidity; for the word denotes nothing more in this instance than the power or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the ball, by which our fingers are excluded from the place which it occupies. Solidity differs from lardness in this respect, that hardness results from the strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> of the parts of a hard body, which renders it difficult to change the places of those parts, as they respect one another; whereas solidity respects the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, and is as essential a quality of water as of adamant. A drop of water, indeed, placed between two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> surfaces of marble, will not like adamant preclude their contact; because the parts of a drop of water, cohering but loosely to one another, give way to the pressure, and escape in every lateral direction. But if a drop of water be confined on all sides, as in a globe of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, we know from experience that no force will bring the sides of the globe together without forcing the water through the pores of the metal; and hence we infer solidity to be essential to every corporeal substance.\n\nThus then it appears that of the objects perceived by touch not one is immediately perceived except heat, cold, and other sensations. The sensations, as they are not excited by any internal energy of our own, lead us indeed to something external as their cause; and by comparing the different sensations with each other, and observing what effects their external causes have upon our own motions, we are naturally led to conceive these causes as extended, figured, solid, hard or soft, rough or smooth, &c.; but it is obvious that this conception is the result of experience, and a process of mental reasoning.\n\nOn the senses of taste, smell, and hearing, it is needless to say much. The immediate objects of these are confessedly sensations which have no existence but when they are perceived; though experience teaches us to refer them all to external objects as their respective causes. With respect to smell, this has been made sufficiently evident in the preceding section, and it is not less evident with respect to taste and hearing,\n\nCertain bodies applied to the tongue and palate, and moistened with the saliva, excite certain sensations which we call tastes. These sensations, however, are the result not in the bodies; nor can they have any existence but in a sentient being. They are produced in consequence of impulses on the nerves of the tongue and palate, exciting certain agitations in the brain; but the sensation itself is neither impulse nor agitation. Some substances excite tastes which are agreeable, and others such as are disagreeable; and there are not a few which excite no taste at all. Bodies, which applied to the tongue and palate of one man produce tastes that are agreeable, applied to the same organs of another man give him tastes which are disagreeable; and we have all experienced, that the same substance, which, when the organs are sound, excites a sweet or pleasant taste, has, when the organs were disordered, excited a taste which was bitter or unpleasant. These facts, which cannot be controverted, afford the fullest evidence, if evidence were wanted, that taste, as we feel it, is no quality of bodies, nor has any existence out of the mind.\n\nThe organ of hearing is the ear, and its object is hearing sound. It is well known, that sound is produced by certain vibrations of the air striking the tympanum of the ear, and that these vibrations are caused by the sonorous body. Sound, however, is not vibration, nor the idea of sound the idea of vibration. Sound considered by itself is a mere sensation, which can have no existence but in a sentient being. We know by experience, that it is caused by something external; but we know likewise that the effect has no resemblance to the cause. Previous to experience we could not refer sound to any external cause; far less could we discern whether it proceeded from an object above us or below us, on our right hand or on our left. It appears to us self-evident, that if a man born deaf were suddenly made to hear, he would consider his first sensation of sound as originating wholly within himself. Between that sensation and the sensations of touch, taste, smell, and sight, there is no resemblance; nor are there any relations among them, which, previous to experience, could induce him to trace them all to external objects as their several causes. Our deaf man might have learned to refer all his other sensations to their true causes, in some such way as we have described under the sense of touch; but sound would be something so new to him, and so totally different from touch, taste, and smell, that he could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> it to nothing external.\n\nExperience, however, would soon teach him that it is by the ear its organ, and the sonorous body its cause; and he would in time learn to distinguish one sound, that of a trumpet for instance, from another, suppose different the sound of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>; and to attribute each to its proper cause, even when neither the trumpet nor the bell bodies was perceived by his other senses. With respect to the sounds which we have been accustomed to hear, this sound is done so instantaneously, that some philosophers have imagined it to be the effect of an instinctive principle in our nature, totally different from experience, and independent of reason. But the fact is not so. Long before we are capable of making sensation and perception objects of reflection, we have heard the sound produced by the ringing of a bell, and seen the object which produced the sound so often, that, when we hear a similar sound\nof sound again, we instantly refer it to a bell, though we \nrespect\u2014see not the bell from which it proceeds: but this is the \neffect of habit, and not of instinct. Had we never per-\nceived a bell while ringing by either of our senses of \nsight or touch, we could not by the sense of hearing \nacquire any notion of the figure or texture of the body \nfrom which the cause of the sound proceeds, though \nwe had heard that sound every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of our lives. It is, \nindeed, by experience only that we learn to distinguish \nby the ear whether a sonorous body be before or be-\nhind us, on our right hand or on our left; for we find \nit always difficult to say from what precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> \na strange sound proceeds; and this difficulty would be \nheightened to impossibility, had not all sounds some-\nthing in common. Dr Sparrman relates, that when he \nfirst heard the roaring of a lion, he did not know on \nwhat side of him to apprehend danger, as the sound \nseemed to proceed from the ground and to enclose a \ncircle of which he and his companions stood in the cen-\ntre. The same thing has happened to every man, when \nthe sound was such as he had never heard before; even \nthough it was neither so loud nor so terrific as the \nroaring of a lion in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> wilderness: but with re-\nspect to sounds which we are daily hearing on each \nside of us, we soon learn to distinguish with tolerable \naccuracy whether they be before or behind us, above \nor below, on our right hand or on our left. All this, \nhowever, is the effect, not of instinct, but of experience \nimproved into habit.\n\nSight is justly considered as the noblest and most \ncomprehensive of all our senses. The reason is obvi-\nous: for when a full grown man opens his eyes, he \nperceives houses, trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, the earth, sun, and moon, \n&c. and to each of these objects belong figure, exten-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SION\">sion</a>, colour, &c. which are all perceived instantly by \nmeans of this sense. Yet it is certain, that the sense \nof sight does not originally communicate to us so many \nperceptions; and there is abundant evidence, that \nan infant cannot at first, or for some weeks after its \nbirth, distinguish by vision one object from another. \nColour is the proper object of sight, and for some time \nits only object; but colour as perceived by us is a mere \nsensation, which can have no existence but in a sentient \nbeing. If this proposition stood in need of proof, \nwe might observe that there are men, and even whole \nfamilies, who possess the sense of sight in a degree of \nperfection sufficient for all the purposes of life, and yet \ncannot distinguish certain colours from each other: \nblue, for instance, from green, or perhaps from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>: \nand there is no man who can distinguish between some \nparticular shades of blue and green by the feeble light \nof a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>. Were colours the real qualities of body, \nthis mistake of one for another could never be experi-\nenced. No man who possesses the sense of touch ever \nconfounded hardness with softness, a sphere with a \n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>, or an ell with an inch. The reason is, that \nhardness and softness, figure and extension, are the \nqualities of things external; whereas colour being a \nmere sensation, is nothing but an affection or modifi-\ncation of the sentient being. But it is obvious, that \nsentient beings, according as they differ from one an-\nother, may be differently affected by the same exter-\nnal cause; so that one man may perceive that to be \ngreen which all other men perceive to be blue. The \nimmediate external cause of the sensation of colour, is \nthe rays of light reflected from the body, which in \nObjects of \ncommon language is said to be coloured. These rays \nfalling upon the pupil of the eye, are refracted differ-\nently, according as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a> is more or less \noblique, into points on the retina, where they form \na <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the external object; and from the pic-\nture, by means of the optic nerve, is communicated to \nthe brain some impulse or agitation, which produces \nvision or the perception of colour. As rays of light \nare corporeal substances, it is obvious that they can act \nupon body only by impulse; but between impulse and \nthe various sensations of red, green, blue, &c., there is \nno resemblance. For the laws of reflection and refrac-\ntion, and for the structure of the eye, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">OPTICS</a> and \nANATOMY. That which we have to inquire into at \npresent is, how we learn, by means of the sense of sight, \nto perceive the figure, magnitude, motion, and distance \nof external objects, or indeed to distinguish one object \nfrom another.\n\nA ray of light proceeding, as all rays do, in a straight \nline, must, however great its length, affect the eye, \nretina, and optic nerve, as if it were a single point. \nFrom this obvious and undeniable fact, Bishop Berkeley \npredicted *, that a man born blind, who should be sud-\ndenly made to see, would at first perceive nothing* \nwithout him, would distinguish neither the distance, \nsize, figure, nor situation, of external objects; that he \nwould only see in his eyes themselves, or, to speak \nmore properly, would only experience new modifica-\ntions in his mind, until joining touch to sight, he form-\ned thus a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the external world, \nand learned, by the simultaneous exercise of the two \nsenses, that natural language in which the visible is the \nsign of the tangible. This truth, which was discov-\nered by the bishop merely by contemplating in his own \nmind the nature of sensation, and the known laws of \noptics, after having been laughed at for more than 20 \nyears as one of the many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> of a visionary genius, \nwas completely confirmed by the case of the famous \npatient whom Cheselden cured of a cataract; and that \ntoo, though the cataract does not produce total blind-\nness: which makes it evident, that the first visual per-\nceptions of the patient after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> could not be \nwholly new and unmixed. It may indeed be confirm-\ned at any time by a simple experiment made upon an \ninfant. For several weeks after birth, a child shuts \nnot its eyes upon the sudden approach of an object \nto them, nor shows the least symptom of distinguishing \none distance from another; and it is easy by a \nlittle attention to observe, how it gradually learns to \ndistinguish objects at greater and greater distances. \nIndeed colour, or the immediate object of sight, be-\ning a mere sensation or affection of the mind, can \nhave no natural relation whatever to any thing ex-\nternal.\n\nIt is plain, therefore, that distance is in its own na-\nture imperceptible to the eye, and yet it is often per-\nceived by sight. How is this done? We think, in \nthe following manner. Distance is one mode of ex-\ntension, which, we have already seen, is perceived by \nmeans of touch. Of short distances, our first ideas are \ndoubtless acquired by the stretching out and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> \nback of our arms; and those ideas are soon so connect-\ned with certain sensations which we have in actual \nvision, that the latter instantly suggests the former.\nThus, it is a fact known by experience, that when we look at a near object with both eyes, according as it approaches or recedes from us, we alter the disposition of our eyes, by lessening or widening the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between the pupils. This disposition or turn of the eye, is attended with a sensation of which every man is conscious at the time of vision; and this sensation seems to us to be that which in this case suggests the idea of greater or less distance to the mind. Not that there is any natural or necessary connexion between the sensation of which we are conscious, and greater or less distance: for the sensation is wholly internal, and the distance is external. But because the mind has, by constant experience, found the different sensations occasioned by different dispositions of the eyes to correspond to different degrees of distance in the object, there has grown a habitual or customary connexion between those sensations and the notions of greater or less distance. So that the mind no sooner perceives the sensation arising from the different turn it gives the eyes in order to bring the pupils nearer or farther asunder, than it is instantly impressed with a certain notion of the distance which was wont to be connected with that sensation. Again, An object placed at a certain distance from the eye, to which the breadth of the pupil bears a sensible proportion, being made to approach nearer, is seen more confusedly; and the nearer it is brought, the confusion is always the greater. The reason of all this is known to every optician: but it being constantly experienced by those who never dived into optics, there arises in the mind of every man a habitual connexion between the several degrees of confusion and distance, the greater confusion still implying the less distance, and the less confusion the greater distance. It is of no avail to say, that between confused vision and distance, great or small, there is no necessary connection: for there is as little connexion between a blush in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> and the mental feeling of shame; and yet no sooner does a man of observation perceive that particular colour in the face of another, than it suggests to him the notion of that feeling or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> with which he has constantly observed it accompanied.\n\nIn these ways, however, we perceive only small distances. Of distances more remote our judgment is formed from other data; and happily these data are not far to seek. It is a fact known to every man who is not totally ignorant of the science of optics, that a greater number of rays fall upon the eye when reflected from a body near at hand, than can fall from the same body at a distance; and as those rays operate by impulse, it is self-evident that the impression must be stronger, and of course the sensation or colour more vivid, when the body is near than when it is distant. Now having acquired the notion of the true distance of objects by motion and the sense of touch, and finding by uniform experience, that as they are near or far off, the sensation or colour which they excite in the mind through the organ of vision is more or less vivid, those degrees of sensation come to be so closely associated with the respective distances of the object, that the one instantly suggests the other.\n\nIt is just so that we perceive figure by sight. Having experienced by the sense of touch that one surface is a square and another a circle, that one body is a cube and another a sphere; and finding our sense of sight differently affected by the square and the circle, the respect by the cube and the sphere; these different affections come to be so closely connected in our minds with the figures of the respective bodies, that long before we are capable of reasoning on the subject the one is never present to us without suggesting the other. Nay, so complete in this case is the connexion or association, that we cannot even in idea abstract the colour from the figure; though it is certain that colour is a mere sensation, and figure an external quality; that colour alone is immediately perceivable by the eye, and the notion of figure suggested by the colour. We are aware that it has been affirmed, and affirmed with great vehemence, that figures of two dimensions are immediately perceived by the eye, and perceived with greater accuracy than by the sense of touch. But they who insist upon this doctrine affirm likewise, contrary to experience and the clearest reasoning, that the immediate objects of sight are external, and that colour is a quality of bodies. In the arguments too by which they support their hypothesis, they seem to confound sight as an affection of the mind, with the picture on the bottom of the eye, as if the retina were the sentient being; whereas the retina and picture are no more than instruments of sensation. It is indeed a fact, that the picture has the same figure nearly with the plane of the object which is presented to the eye; as when the object is a sphere, the picture is a circle variously shaded in colour. It is likewise a fact, that the picture is enlarged in proportion as the object is brought near, and diminished as it is carried to a distance. But these facts are known only to persons skilled in optics; and therefore it is evident, that though calculations may be raised from them by mathematicians to determine the distance and figure of external objects, they cannot possibly be the data from which distance and figure are inferred by the vulgar, who know not that such pictures on the retina exist. Besides all this, it is universally known, that a painter, by laying on his colours properly, can make a plain square surface appear to the eye in certain positions as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> or as a cube, and a plain circular surface as a concave or a convex hemisphere. But not one of these things could possibly be done, were figure, or indeed anything else than colour, the immediate object of vision.\n\nAs we see distance and figure, so we see magnitude; and we see both in the same way that we see shame or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> in the looks of a man. The impression made upon the bottom of the eye by rays reflected from a large magnitude, must necessarily be different from the impression made by rays reflected from a magnitude that is less. This is self-evident; and since the impression ab extra is in some way or other the cause of that sensation, which is all of which we are originally conscious in vision, it is obvious that the sensation, like every other effect, must correspond to the cause from which it proceeds. Being therefore conscious of different sensations; and having, at an earlier period than we distinctly remember, learned by experience to refer them to different magnitudes; no sooner is each sensation excited than it suggests the notion, or, if you please, the perception, of that magnitude with which it is connected. So completely is this association fixed in the mind, that when we look at a known object, its real\nof real magnitude appears to be as instantly observed as its colour, whilst we hardly attend at all to the particularity of the sensation by which the magnitude is suggested. It is, indeed, customary with writers on optics to distinguish between tangible and visible magnitude, as if any kind of magnitude were the immediate object of vision; but this is not so: for magnitude is something external, whereas the immediate object of vision is a mere sensation. What has introduced into science this mode of speaking is the following fact, that as we approach a distant object it appears to the eye larger and larger every step, and less and less as we recede from it; whereas the tangible magnitude of an object is always the same. The reason of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> change of magnitude to the eye, according to the distance at which any particular object is viewed, is, that from a near object rays of light fall in greater numbers and more diverging than from the same object viewed at a distance. This of course alters the nature of the visible sensation: each common sensation is in the mind closely linked with a particular notion of magnitude; and by the exercise of sight and touch we have learned from experience, that the particular sensation caused by diverging rays must be referred to a larger magnitude than that which is caused by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> rays proceeding from the same distance.\n\nUpon the whole, then, we think ourselves entitled to conclude, that the proper and original objects of vision constitute an universal language of the Author of Nature, by which we are instructed how to regulate our actions, in order to attain those things that are necessary to the preservation and well-being of our bodies, as also to avoid whatever may be hurtful or destructive to them. It is principally by the information of this language that we are guided in all the transactions and concerns of life: And the manner in which it signifies and marks to us the objects which are at a distance, is similar to that of languages and signs of human appointment, which do not suggest the things signified by any likeness or identity of nature, but only by a habitual connection, which experience has made us to observe, between them. This language of the eye, like the language of the tongue, suggests by one sensation what may be resolved into a variety of perceptions. A tree is composed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>, branches, leaves; it has colour, figure, size; and all these things are at once suggested to the mind by the two words spreading oak. Just so it is with respect to vision: the sensation received by the eye suggests at once the trunk, branches, leaves, colour, figure, and size of the oak, and suggests them all as the qualities of one object.\n\n**Chap. II. Of Retention and Ideas.**\n\nFrom the experiment with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> coal mentioned in No. 31, it is apparent, the sensations excited through the eye, together with their corresponding perceptions, remain in the mind for a short time after the external exciting cause is removed. The same thing appears from another experiment which was first made by Sir Isaac Newton, and which every man may repeat for his own satisfaction. It is universally known*, that a proper mixture of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> original colours, red, yellow, green, blue, &c., constitutes that uniform appearance which we call white. But when these colours are made to pass in a rapid consecution before the eye, they excite the very same perception as when they are properly mixed, which is a satisfactory proof that the impression made by each separate colour remains in the brain until a revolution of all the colours be completed; for nothing but the impression of all the colours at once can produce the sensation and perception of white. Indeed no person capable of paying the proper attention to these things, can keep his eye fixed upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> object, and afterwards shut it, without experiencing that the sensation and perception remain for some time after the external object is shut out, and that they go off gradually till they leave behind them the mental appearance, which is properly called an idea of the object.\n\nThe same continuance of the sensation after the removal of its cause is equally observable in the sense of hearing; for every sound which we hear is reflected by the neighbouring bodies; and therefore consists in reality of a variety of sounds succeeding each other at different distances of time, according to the distances of the several reflecting bodies. Yet this causes no confusion or apparent complexity of sound, unless when the distance of the reflecting bodies is very considerable, as in spacious buildings.\n\nWith respect to the continuance of the sensation of touch, doubts have been started: but for these there is as little room as for doubting the continuance of the sensations of seeing and hearing. The continuance of heat after the heating body is removed, and of the smart of a wound after the instant of infliction, are proofs that every sensation of touch does not vanish with its cause. A man unused to the motion of a ship or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COACH\">coach</a>, after having been a day at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> or on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, feels or imagines he feels the rolling of the ship or the jolting of the coach after he is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> and actually at rest. Of these facts we know not what other account can be given, than that the agitation in the brain, which is the immediate cause of the sensation of touch, remains for some time after the external cause of the agitation is removed.\n\nAs to the senses of taste and smell, Dr Hartley seems to think that there is no clear and direct evidence for the continuance of their sensations after their proper objects are removed; but in this instance the ingenious author does not do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to his own theory. Let any man cat onions, garlic, or any other thing of a very pungent taste, and immediately wash his mouth with fresh water, so that he may be sure no part of the sapid body remains on his tongue or palate. According to this doctrine, the taste of the onion or garlic should instantly vanish with its object; but the fact is otherwise. Whoever shall make the experiment, will find the sensation to remain a considerable time: not indeed in its original force, but weakened no more than what it must necessarily be by the introduction of a new sensation excited by the water. It is more difficult to ascertain the permanency of smell: but analogy inclines us to believe, that in this particular it resembles the other senses, though we know not how to direct the reader to an experiment which will give him absolute conviction.\n\nWhether the cause of these continued sensations, after the removal of their objects, be in the brain alone,\nRetention in the mind alone considered as an immaterial being, and Ideas, or in both together, is of very little importance; because, taking the mind and its internal organs as one metaphysical whole*, it matters not to our present inquiry, where this retentive power resides, as long as it can be proved to exist within us: for it seems evident, that what has the faculty of retaining a sensation when no longer acted upon by the object which excited it, must also have a power to preserve the vestiges of that sensation even after the sensation itself shall be entirely obliterated. This is in fact the case with the mind. When an object which we have once perceived is most remote from our thoughts, we are certain that there is within us a capacity, disposition, tendency, or power, by which a representation of that object may be at any time revived and presented to the intellect. Thus the same inherent power of the mind and its internal organs, which retains a sensation and perception in the absence of the object by which they were excited, can also reproduce that perception, or bring into the view of the intellect something exactly similar to it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-REPRODUCTION\">reproduction</a> will not indeed be so lively as the original perception when accompanied with its corresponding sensation, because sensation and actual perception are affected by a double cause, the action of the external object upon the organ, nerves, and brain, and the corresponding energy of the mind or sentient principle; whereas, in the reproduction, the mind seems to act solely by its own power, and certainly without the assistance of external objects. This reproductive power is commonly called memory.\n\nBy many of the ancient philosophers, and by M. Schwab, with one or two others among the moderns, it is called imagination. We do not choose either to revive antiquated modes of expression, or to introduce innovations of our own; but as we cannot disapprove of the ancient phraseology, after the definitions which the reader will by and by find of imagination, memory, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>, as given by Mr Harris, we have prefixed to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of retention, which comprehends them all.\n\nWhen one recalls an object of sight by the power of memory, it appears to him precisely the same as in the original survey, only less distinct, and with a conviction (which is perhaps the result of experience) that the real object is not immediately before him. How is an object recalled by the power of memory? Does the man endeavour to form in his mind a picture or representative image of the object? Let us listen to the answers given by different philosophers to this question.\n\nThe sentiments of the Peripatetics, as expressed by Alexander Aphrodisiensis, one of the earliest commentators on Aristotle, are thus translated by Mr Harris in his Hermes.\u2014\"Now, what fancy or imagination is, we may explain as follows: We may conceive to be formed within us, from the operation of the senses about sensible objects, some impression (as it were), or picture in our original sensorium, being a relict of Retent that motion caused within us by the external object; and ide a relict which, when the external object is no longer present, remains, and is still preserved, being as it were its image; and which, by being thus preserved, becomes the cause of our having memory. Now such a sort of relief, (and as it were) impression, they call fancy or imagination (x).\" A passage from Alcinos of the doctrines of Plato, as rendered into English by Dr Reidt, shows that, in this theory, as in that of perception, the Platonists agreed with the Peripatetics. \"When the form or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a> of things is imprinted on the mind by the organs of the senses, and so imprinted as not to be deleted by time, but preserved firm and lasting, its preservation is called memory.\"\n\nMr Harris, who was deeply read in the ancient philosophy, and who considered the authority of Aristotle and Plato as superseding all reasoning and all inquiry, after justly observing, that if the soul had no other faculties than the senses, it could never acquire the least idea of time, thus expresses himself on the subject before us: \"But, happily for us, we are not deserted here. We have, in the first place, a faculty called imagination or fancy; which, however as to its energies it may be subsequent to sense, yet is truly prior to it both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and use. This it is which retains the fleeting forms of things, when things themselves are gone, and all sensation is at an end. That this faculty, however connected with sense, is still perfectly different, may be seen from hence. We have an imagination of things that are gone and extinct; but no such things can be made objects of sensation. We have an easy command over the objects of our imagination, and can call them forth in almost what manner we please; but our sensations are necessary when their objects are present, nor can we control them but by removing either the objects or ourselves. As wax would not be adequate to its business of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIGNATURE\">signature</a>, had it not a power to retain, as well as receive; the same holds of the soul, with respect to sense and imagination. Sense is its receptive power: imagination its retentive. Had it sense without imagination, it would not be as wax but as water; where, though all impressions may be instantly made, yet as soon as made they are entirely lost. Thus then, from a view of the two powers taken together, we may call sense (if we please), a kind of transient imagination; and imagination, on the contrary, a kind of permanent sense.\"\n\nGreat part of the office which is here given to imagination, is in common English attributed to memory; but between these two faculties, as well as between them and recollection, the author accurately distinguishes thus:\u2014\"When we view some relief of the memory sensation reposed within us, without thinking of its rise, or referring it to any sensible object, this is fancy or imagination. When we view some such relief, and refer it without to that sensible object which in time past was its\n\n(*): The original is as follows: \u03a4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u1f22 \u03a6\u03ac\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd, \u03b5\u1f30\u03c3\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03c9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ce\u03c0\u03c9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5, \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae\u03c4\u03c9, \u1f41 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03af\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd, \u03a6\u03b1\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2. Alex. Aphrod. de Anima, p. 135. Edit. Ald.\nOf this theory we shall only remark, that if we could understand the words picture and form in a metaphorical sense, as candour obliges us to understand Locke's images in the mind, the doctrine of Alexander Aphrodites would be very little wide of the truth. Experience teaches us that memory as well as perception depends upon the state of the brain; and as it is undeniable, that when a man to-day contemplates an object which he perceived yesterday, or at any former period, he has a view of it in all respects similar to the original perception, only fainter and less distinct, it is extremely probable, that an impression ab extra, which produces a sensation and perception, leaves behind it some tendency in the brain, to vibrate as in the actual sensation, and that this tendency is carried into effect by the internal energy of the mind itself. But in the Peripatetic philosophy, pictures and forms in the sensorium were considered as real things, and by no means as metaphorical expressions. This is evident from their being constantly compared to the impression of a seal upon wax, and from their converting the materia prima from something, which can neither be seen nor felt, into visible and tangible body, of which we shall treat afterwards. Now it being certain that on a being immaterial, no corporeal form can be impressed, and repeated dissections having shown that no such forms are in fact impressed on the brain, this whole theory is at once overturned.\n\nModern philosophers having denied that there are real images or forms in the mind during the immediate act of perception, cannot consistently with themselves admit such images in the act of retention, or when those things which were formerly objects of perception are recalled to the mind by the power of memory. Mr Locke's doctrine is, \"that the mind retains these simple ideas which it first received from sensation or reflection, two ways: first, by keeping the idea, which is brought into it, for some time actually in view, which is called contemplation: and secondly, by the power which we have to revive again in our minds those ideas, which, after imprinting, have disappeared, or have been, as it were, laid out of sight; as when we conceive heat or light, yellow or sweet, the object being removed. This (he says) is memory; which is, as it were, the storehouse of our ideas.\"\n\nTo explain this more fully, he immediately adds the following observation:\u2014\"But our ideas being nothing but actual perceptions in the mind, which cease to be anything where there is no perception of them, this laying up of our ideas in the repository of the memory, signifies no more than this, that the mind has a power in many cases, to revive perceptions which it has once had, with this additional perception annexed to them, that it has had them before. And in this sense it is, that our ideas are said to be in our memories, when indeed they are actually nowhere; but only there is an ability, in the mind, when it will, to revive them again, and, as it were, paint them anew on itself, though some with more some with less difficulty, some more lively and others more obscurely. And thus it is, by the assistance of this Retention faculty, that we are said to have all those ideas in our understandings, which, though we do not actually contemplate them, yet we can bring in sight, and make appear again, and be the objects of our thoughts, without the help of those sensible qualities which first imprinted them there.\"\n\nTo attempt a defence of the accuracy of this language would be vain; but as the author's meaning is sufficiently obvious, his expressions may be easily and certainly corrected. Had Locke said\u2014\"But our ideas being nothing but scenes or appearances in the mind, which cease to be anything when there is no perception of them, thus laying up of our ideas in the repository of the memory signifies no more but this, that the mind has a power, in many cases, to revive scenes which it has once viewed, with this additional perception annexed to them, that it has viewed them before?\" there would have been no room for the many petulant remarks which have been made upon the passage.\n\nBut against this account of memory, a much heavier objection to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> has been brought than that which regards the propriety of the language. It has been said, that the additional perception, which according to Locke, attends the revival of our ideas by the power of memory, \"would be a fallacious perception, if it led us to believe that we had them before, since they cannot have two beginnings of existence: nor can we believe them to have two beginnings of existence; we can only believe that we had formerly ideas or perceptions very like to them, though not identically the same.\" Let us examine this question somewhat narrowly: for if it be really true, that in the sense in which the word same is here used, we cannot twice contemplate the same idea, all confidence in memory would seem to be at an end.\n\nSuppose a man to stand on some of the rising grounds about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, the Caltonhill for instance, and from that eminence to view the glorious prospect of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Fife, the ocean, the frith of Forth, and the little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> scattered in the frith. Let him go away, and return next day to the same place and look the same way: we would ask whether he has the same view or perception which he had the day before? The man must surely be very captious who would say that he has not: and yet it is certain that the energy of mind by which he perceives on one day cannot be identically the same with that by which he perceived on another; nor are the rays of light which fall upon his eyes on the second day, identically the same with those which fell upon his eyes and occasioned vision on the first day. Let the same man now shut his eyes, and contemplate the various objects at which he had been just looking. They will appear to him in all respects the same as when viewed by means of his organs of sight, only fainter and less distinct, with this additional conviction, that the immediate objects of his present contemplation are not real external things, but ideas or mental representations of those things which had so lately been the objects of his sight. Let him think no more about the matter for some days, and then exert his powers of memory. We have no hesitation to say, that in the sense of the word same, as used by Mr Locke, the very same ideas will recur.\nRetention recur and be present to his intellect which were pre-\nand Ideas, sent to it at the former contemplation. The second\nenergy of memory or imagination, or whatever it may\nbe called, is not indeed identically the same with the\nfirst; nor is that agitation or motion, or whatever\nother affection of the brain is necessary to memory,\nidentically the same at the second time as at the first:\nbut the mind exerting itself in the very same manner\nat the one time as at the other, produces the same\nkind of agitation in the brain, and is itself affected in\nthe very same way at the second as at the first exer-\ntion. Whence it follows, that the second ideal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>\nwill be as much the same with the first, as the second\nactual perception is the same with the first, and the two\nideal scenes, and the two actual perceptions, are re-\nspectively said to be the same with each other, only\nbecause they impress the mind with a conviction that\nthey were occasioned by the same external objects.\n\nBut though we think Locke's doctrine, with re-\nspect to memory, may be thus easily vindicated from\nthe charge of fallaciousness, we must acknowledge that\nto us it appears not to be of much value. It teaches\nnothing, but that the mind has a power to retain ideas\nof those objects which it formerly perceived, and in\nmany instances to recall them as occasion may require.\nBut these are truths known to all mankind, to the\nclown as well as to the philosopher.\n\nPhilosophers in general have paid less regard to the\nretentive faculties of the mind than to its original\npowers of perception. Perhaps they imagined, that\nas memory depends upon perception, and in some\nrespects appears to resemble it, a competent knowledge\nof the nature of the former faculty would lead to that\nof the second. Be this as it may, Mr Hume, who was\nat some pains to detail his notions of perception, has\nin his Philosophical Essays only dropt concerning me-\nmory and imagination a few hints, so loosely thrown\ntogether, that, if he had not elsewhere expressed him-\nself with more precision, it would have been difficult\nto discover his real meaning. According to him, that\nwhich is commonly called the perception of an external\nobject, is nothing but a strong impression upon the\nmind; and that which is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of a\npast object, is nothing but a present impression or idea\nweaker than the former. Imagination is an idea weaker\nthan the idea or impression which he calls memory.\nThis seems to be a wonderful abuse of language. Im-\npressions are not perceptions; and, if possible, they can\nstill less be called ideas, which are but secondary per-\nceptions. It is likewise far from being true, that an\nidea of imagination has necessarily less vivacity than\nan idea of memory. We have seen Mr Hume, and\nhave at the present moment an idea of his form and\ndress: we can likewise imagine to ourselves a centaur;\nand though a centaur was never seen, and therefore\ncannot be an impression repeated by memory, our idea\nof the monster is much more lively and distinct than\nthat of the philosopher.\n\nDr Reid having observed of memory *, that it is by Dr\nit we have an immediate knowledge of things past; Reid\nthat it must have an object; that in this respect it a.*\nagrees with perception, but differs from sensation, which\nhas no object but the feeling itself; and that every man\ncan distinguish the thing remembered from the\nremembrance of it\u2014proceeds to inquire what memory\nis. And, \"First (says he), I think it appears that\nmemory is an original faculty given us by the Author\nof our being, of which we can give no account but\nthat we are so made. The knowledge, (continues he)\nwhich I have of things past by my memory, seems to\nme as unaccountable as an immediate knowledge would\nbe of things to come (x); and I can give no reason\nwhy I should have the one and not the other, but that\nsuch is the will of my Maker. I find in my mind a\ndistinct conception and a firm belief of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of past\nevents; but how this is produced I know not. I call\nit memory; but this is only giving a name to it; it is\nnot an account of its cause. I believe most firmly what\nI distinctly remember; but I can give no reason of this\nbelief. It is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a> of the Almighty which\ngives me this understanding. When I believe the truth\nof a mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a> or of a mathematical propo-\nsition, I see that it must be so: every man who has the\nsame conception of it sees the same. There is a ne-\ncessary and an evident connection between the subject\nand the predicate of the proposition; and I have all\nthe evidence to support my belief which I can possibly\nconceive. When I believe that I washed my hands and\nface this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, there appears no necessity in the\ntruth of the proposition. It might be or it might not\nbe. A man may distinctly conceive it without be-\nlieving it at all. How then do I come to believe it?\nI remember it distinctly. This is all I can say. This\nremembrance is an act of my mind. Is it impossible\nthat this act should be, if the event had not happened?\nI confess I do not see any necessary connexion, be-\ntween the one and the other. If any man can show\nsuch a necessary connexion, then I think that belief\nwhich we have of what we remember will be fairly ac-\ncounted for: but if this cannot be done, that belief is\nunaccountable; and we can say no more than that it is\nthe result of our constitution. Our original faculties\nare all unaccountable: Of these memory is one. He\nonly who made them comprehends fully how they are\nmade, and how they produce in us not only a concep-\ntion, but a firm belief and assurance, of things which\nit concerns us to know.\"\n\nOn this account of memory we shall make no re-\nmarks. There is a certain sense of the words, in which\nevery thing which the author has said on the subject is\nundoubtedly\n\n(f) If memory depends upon the state of the brain as it has been affected in past perceptions, this appears\nto us a strange position. Perhaps the excellent author means nothing more, than that it is as unaccount-\nable to us, that impressions on the brain should cause perception, and the vestiges of those impressions should\ncause remembrance, as how the mind might not perceive things to come without the intervention of impres-\nsions on the brain. If this be the meaning, no man will controvert it: for it is impossible to discover the nature\nof that relation which subsists between an impression and perception; but that there is such a relation, we know\nfrom experience.\nand it would be very uncandid to take his words in any other sense. But though memory, as it is the result of that constitution which was given us by God, and not the offspring of habit or human contrivance, is unquestionably an original faculty; and though it is therefore impossible to account for it so fully as to silence every inquiry which may be made, yet we could wish that Dr Reid had bestowed a little more pains upon it, in order to discover if possible in what respects it resembles or differs from perception. He has well observed, that there are laws of nature by which the operations of the mind are regulated, as well as laws of nature which govern the material system. As the latter are the ultimate conclusions which the human faculties can reach in the philosophy of bodies, so the former are the ultimate conclusions which we can reach in the philosophy of minds. The more general that these laws are in both cases, the more useful they are and the more satisfactory: for as they are themselves inexplicable, the fewer they are in number, and the more comprehensive each, the fewer will those phenomena be for which we can give no account. Thus, as we know not what makes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a> tend to the centre of the sun, or heavy bodies tend to the centre of the earth, we can give no other account of these phenomena, but that, as they appear to be of the same kind, it is reasonable to conclude that they proceed from similar causes. What the cause is of this tendency of bodies towards each other, we know not. We call it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>, and employ it to account for all phenomena of the same kind. In like manner it is universally allowed, that as we know not how mind and matter operate upon each other, there is something in perception wholly unaccountable. That perception follows sensation; and that there is no sensation which is not occasioned by some affection of the brain, proceeding from some impression ab extra; we have the evidence of experience: but how a particular affection of the brain should excite a sensation in the mind, we know not; though we may here, as in the corporeal system, attribute similar effects to the same or similar causes. Thus, if when we exert an act of memory we have the same appearance of things as in the original act of perception, the rules of philosophizing authorize us to refer both phenomena to the same general law; just as they authorize us to refer the motion of the planets and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTILES\">projectiles</a> to the same general law. On the other hand, if we perceive no similarity between memory and perception, we have made no progress in the philosophy of mind; for in that case we have discovered two phenomena proceeding from two causes totally different from each other, and both inexplicable. Although we scarcely hope to throw any light upon a subject which Dr Reid has not attempted to illustrate, we shall state a few facts respecting the memory, and submit to the reader the conclusions to which we think these facts lead.\n\n1. Objects once perceived by the senses, when recalled to the mind by the power of memory, appear precisely the same as in the original perception, only less distinct*. For example, having seen yesterday a sensible object spreading oak growing on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of a river, and when having heard a shepherd play, and handled a square stone, we endeavour to recall to our mind these objects of memory, which are now absent. How is this operation performed? Do we endeavour to form in our minds pictures or representative images? or, does our intellect survey the types or forms which, according to Aristotle, those objects left in the imagination when originally perceived? Neither of these things is done. We conceive ourselves as standing in the same place where we stood yesterday; upon which we have perceptions of the objects similar in all respects to the perceptions which we had when we employed our eyes, our ears, and our hands. The tree appears, as it were, before us; faint indeed, but attended with all the objects which we observed around it yesterday: we seem to hear the sound of the pipe confusedly, and at a distance; to move our hands over the stone, and to feel the same surfaces and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> which we felt in the original perception. In this recollection we are not conscious of pictures or images more than in the original survey. The perceptions seem to be of the tree and river themselves, of the sound itself, and of the stone itself, exactly as at the first; and yet we are satisfied that in the act of remembrance we perceive no such object as a real tree, pipe, or stone. That these are facts, every man must be convinced who attends to the energies of his own mind when exerting the powers of retention: and therefore it is, in our opinion, with no impropriety that Mr Harris says, we may call sense, if we please, a kind of transient imagination; and imagination, on the contrary, a kind of permanent sense; for if these two faculties, as far as the mind or intellect is concerned, be not the same, they seem to resemble each other much.\n\n2. The primary perception of a visible object is more complete, lively, and distinct, and remains longer in remain the sensorium than that of any other object. We longest in know likewise by experience, that an idea or secondary the perception of a visible object is as much more complete, lively, and distinct, than the idea of any other object, as was the primary perception; and that we remember things which we have seen for a longer time than sounds which we have heard, or than tangible objects which we have only handled. Yet there seems to be a constant decay of all our ideas, even of those which are struck (G) deepest and in minds the most retentive; so that if they be not frequently renewed by repeated exercise of the senses, or by reflection on those objects which at first occasioned them, the print (G) wears out,\n\n---\n\n(c) These expressions, which mention ideas as things which are deep struck, and as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a> which wear out, are the expressions of Locke. We hope it is needless to warn our readers, that they are used by us, as they were by him, in a metaphorical sense. On these subjects it is impossible to write without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHOR\">metaphor</a>; which, while the meaning is obvious, no man will condemn, who reflects that the words of language were not invented by metaphysicians, and are for the most part literally significant only of sensible objects.\nRetention out, and at last there remains nothing to be seen, and ideas. Concerning ideas, it is easy to remark, that those remain longest and clearest in the memory which are derived from two or more senses, especially if the sense of sight be one of the number, or which are oftenest refreshed by a return of the objects which produced them. Hence a man has a longer and more distinct remembrance of what he has seen than of what he has only heard, of what he has both seen and felt than of what he has only seen; and the ideas which we have of heat and cold, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> and thirst, and of all those things which most frequently affect our senses, are extremely clear, and are never quite lost whilst the mind retains any ideas at all.\n\nMemory appears to be a kind of habit, which is not always in exercise with regard to things we remember, but is ready to suggest them when there is occasion. The most perfect degree of this habit is, when the thing presents itself to our remembrance spontaneously, and without labour, as often as there is occasion. A second degree is, when the thing is forgotten for a longer or shorter time, even when there is occasion to remember it, and yet at last some incident, such as a violent passion*, which agitates the whole mind and sensorium, tumbles the idea, as it were, out of its dark corner, and brings it into view without any search. A third degree is, when we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> about and search for what we would remember, and after some labour find it out. This searching faculty of the soul is by Aristotle called *anamnesis*, by Dr Reid and others *reminiscentia*, and by Mr Harris *recollection*. Should it be said, that what we will to remember we must already conceive, as we can will nothing of which we have not a conception; and that, therefore, a will to remember a thing, seems to imply that we remember it already\u2014we answer, with Dr Reid, that when we will to remember a thing, we must indeed remember something relating to it; but we may have no positive idea or conception of the thing itself, but only of the relation which it bears to that other thing which we do remember. Thus, one remembers that a friend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> him with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> to be executed at such a place, but he has forgotten what the commission was. He applies himself to discover it; and recollects that it was given by such a person, upon such an occasion, in consequence of such a conversation: and thus by a train of thought he is led to the very thing which he had forgotten and wished to remember. To this operation it is not always necessary that the relations between the various ideas which the mind turns over be very close, or have their foundation in nature; for a casual connexion is often sufficient. Thus, from seeing a garment, we think of its owner; thence of his habitation; thence of woods; thence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>; thence of ships; thence of admirals; thence of cannons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, furnaces, and forges,* &c.\n\nThat, in the process of recollection, one idea should suggest another, may be easily accounted for. When, in perception, our minds are exposed to the influence of external objects, all the parts and properties, and even the accidental variable adjuncts of these objects, are perceived by full-grown men at the same time; so that the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> makes but one impression upon our organs of sense, and consequently upon the mind. By these means all the parts of the simultaneous impression*, and consequently of the perception occasioned by that impression, are so intimately associated or linked together, that the idea of any one of them recurring at any future period, generally introduces the ideas of all the rest. But as the necessary parts and properties of any thing are more closely linked together, and occur more frequently than any particular variable adjuncts, it is obvious, that by the idea of any one of those properties, the idea of the rest, and of the object itself, will be more readily introduced than by the idea of any variable adjunct. It seems, however, to be certain, that we have no power of calling up any idea at pleasure, but only such as have a connexion, either in nature or by means of former associations, with those that are at any time present to the mind. Thus the sight, or the idea, of any particular person, generally enables us to recollect his name, because his name and his person have been constantly associated together. If that fail to introduce the name, we are at a loss and cannot recollect it at all till some other associated circumstance help us. In naming a number of words in a sentence, or lines in a poem, the end of each preceding word or line being connected with the beginning of the word or line which succeeds it, we can easily repeat them in that order; but we are not able to repeat them backwards with any ease, nor at all till after many fruitless efforts. By frequent trials, however, we acquire at last a facility in doing it, as may be found by making the experiment on the names of number from one to twenty. It is indeed, probable, that in the wildest flights of fancy, no single idea occurs to us but such as had a connexion with some other idea, perception, or notion, previously existing in the mind, as shall be shown more fully in a subsequent chapter.\n\nMemory appears to depend entirely or chiefly memory upon the state of the brain\u2020. For diseases, concussions depend of the brain, spirituous liquors, and some poisons, impair or destroy it; and it generally returns again with the return of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, from the use of proper medicines and methods. It is observable, too, that in recovering from concussions and other disorders of the brain, it is usual for the person to recover the power of remembering the then present common incidents for minutes, hours, and days, by degrees; also the power of recalling the events of his life preceding his illness. At length he recovers this last power perfectly; and at the same time forgets almost all that past in his illness, even those things which at first he remembered for a day or two. Now the reason of this seems to be, that upon a perfect recovery the brain recovers its natural state, and all its former affections and tendencies; but that such affections or tendencies as took place during the preternatural state, i.e., during the patient's illness, are obliterated by the return of the natural state.* All this we are induced to believe; because, though it is a fact incontrovertible, that in certain diseases the memory is impaired, and recovers its vigour with the return of health, it is not conceivable that the mind itself should suffer any change by diseases, concussions, or spirituous liquors, &c.\n\nFrom these facts we are strongly inclined to conclude,\ntheir brain is too moist and soft to retain impressions made upon it; and that he was likewise in the right, and ideas when he imputed the defect of memory in old men to the hardness and rigidity of the brain, which hinders it from receiving any durable impression.\n\nAnother argument to prove, that in remembrance the mind acts upon something left in the brain by the impressions of sense, is this, that nothing can act but where it is present. The truth of this axiom is acknowledged by Dr Reid, and we believe by all mankind except Dr Priestley and one or two others, whose paradoxes we shall consider afterwards. Now it is confessed, that in recollection at least the mind is active; and therefore it must act, not upon an object which has now perhaps no existence, and certainly no immediate existence, but upon something left by that object in the brain or sensorium, to which the mind is intimately present.\n\nBut if this be so, we may be asked how it comes by what pass that men never confound memory with perception, nor fancy that they perceive things which they only remember? If perception be an inference drawn from certain sensations excited by an impression on the brain, and if remembrance result from the mind's operating upon relics of those impressions, one would think it natural to suppose, that in both cases we have actual perceptions, though in the one case the perception must be more vivid and distinct than in the other. To this we answer, That previous to all experience, perception and memory are very probably confounded; and that we believe a man brought into the world with all his faculties in their full natural perfection, would not instantly be able to distinguish what he remembered from what he perceived. This we know to be the case with respect to imagination, a faculty which strongly resembles memory; for in dreams, and sometimes even in waking reveries, we fancy actually that we perceive things which it is certain we can only imagine. A very short experience, however, would enable this newly created man to make the proper distinction between remembrance and perception. For let us suppose him to be brought into a dark room, and soon afterwards a candle to be introduced. The candle would give him a visible sensation, though not at first the perception of an external object. Let the candle after some time be carried out: the man would retain a visible idea, which he might confound with the actual sensation. But if, whilst this idea remained in his mind, the candle were brought back, he would instantly feel a difference between the real sensation and the idea, when both were together present in his mind. And having, in some such manner as we have already described, acquired the power of perceiving external objects by means of his senses, he would soon discover, without any effort of his own, the difference between actual perceptions and the ideas treasured up in his memory.\n\n(h) Through the whole of this and the preceding chapters, we have taken it for granted, that the sentient principle in man is not material. This is the common, and, as shall be shown afterwards, the most probable opinion: but whether it be absolutely certain or not, makes no difference on the theories of sensation and perception. These are obviously neither figure nor motion, and therefore not subject to the laws which govern the material world.\nThe only remaining difficulty which seems to encumber this theory of remembrance, is, to account for the order of succession in which objects recur to the memory, and to which we give the name of time.\u2014But this difficulty will vanish when we have ascertained what time is. At present it is sufficient to observe, that our perceptions of external objects remain a certain space of time in the mind; that this time is different, according to the strength and other circumstances of the impression which occasioned the perception; and that traces of those perceptions, i.e. ideas, may be recalled after the intervention of other trains of ideas, and at very different intervals. If one look upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and then shut his eyes, the impression which it made upon his mind will not instantly vanish: he can contemplate the house almost as long as he pleases; and, by the help of various associated circumstances, he may recall the idea several years afterwards, and refer it to the original perception.\n\nBefore we dismiss the subject of retention, it may not be improper to take notice of the retentive powers of inferior animals. Aristotle, Locke, Dr Reid, and almost every philosopher of eminence both among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> and moderns, have maintained, that inferior animals have memory as well as men; and indeed we do not perceive how the fact can be denied of the more perfect animals, and those with whose operations we are best acquainted. A dog knows his master again after a long absence; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> will trace back a road which he has but once travelled, often with more accuracy than his rider; and it is well known that many species of singing birds have a capacity to learn tunes from the human voice, and that they repeat the notes again and again, approaching nearer and nearer to perfection, till at last they sing the tune correctly. These phenomena can be accounted for only by supposing, that in the brains of the several animals traces are left by perception, of the same kind with those which perception leaves in the brain of man, and which are the cause or occasion of his remembrance. With respect to this point, the learned author of Ancient Metaphysics differs from his master Aristotle. He allows that brutes have imagination, but denies that they have memory: for (says he) \"memory necessarily implies a sense of time, and what is first and last; but brutes have no idea of time, or of first and last; and it is certain that they have not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> or reflection, by which only they could review their own operations. At the same time he admits, that imagination in the brute serves the purpose of memory in us; for whenever he sees the object that is painted on his phantasia, he knows it again, but without any perception of the time when he first saw it.\" But that a brute, when he sees the object which is painted on his phantasia, should know it again without referring it to a former perception, is plainly impossible. The recognition of any thing consists in a consciousness of its having been perceived before; and nothing more than such recognition is essential to memory. The author's mistake seems to lie in supposing that memory necessarily implies a sense of some determinate portion of past time; but we surely remember many things of which we can only say that we have formerly perceived them, without being able to ascertain the precise period at which we had such perceptions.\n\nA child has the use of memory sooner than he acquires the faculty of speech; but he must have spoken and reasoned before he can have an accurate notion of time, which, as shall be shown afterwards, arises from comparing the fleeting succession of our own ideas with the permanence of ourselves and other objects. The author's distinction between memory and imagination seems to be on all accounts improper. Aristotle has said, and said truly, that there is memory of ideas as well as of sensible objects; meaning by ideas general conceptions or propositions: but this reviver of his philosophy is inclined to say, \"that memory is only of ideas, consequently belongs only to man: and that imagination is only of sensible objects, and consequently belongs both to man and brute.\"\u2014But surely man remembers what he has seen and felt as well as what he has conceived or thought; and if imagination and memory be properly distinguished by Mr Harris, the reverse of this writer's doctrine must be true, viz. that imagination belongs only to man, and memory of sensible objects both to man and brute.\u2014We can contemplate in imagination the idea of a centaur or of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> mountain; but we cannot be said to remember them, for they were never perceived. That a dog can contemplate in his imagination the idea of a centaur or of a golden mountain, we have not the least reason to suppose; but were he not capable of viewing relicts of sense reposed with him, and referring them to their original causes, he could not possibly recognise his master after a day's absence.\n\nDr Reid and the same author agree with Aristotle, in thinking it probable that brutes have not reminiscence, or the power of recollection; but there are many well-attested facts which seem to prove the contrary. We shall mention one which fell under our own observation. One of the persons concerned in this work was, when a young man, absent for five months from the house of his father. Upon his return, a dog of that species which is commonly called the shepherd's cur, and which had been in the possession of his father only a few months before his departure, gazed at him for a few minutes as at any other stranger. The animal then began to walk round him with looks which soon attracted his notice. This made him call the dog by the name which he bore in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and stretch out his hand to caress him, when the creature instantly leaped upon him with all that appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> which these animals so commonly exhibit upon the return of their master after a few days absence. If this was not recollection, we should be glad to know what it was, for we cannot distinguish it from recollection in men. Indeed, if dogs and some other animals possess, as Aristotle, Locke, and others, allow them to possess, the power of memory, and something of ratiocination; and if, as Dr Reid expressly says*, \"they expect events in the same order and succession in which they happened before; it is not conceivable that they can be wholly destitute of reminiscence, or the power of recollection.\n\nThat memory is a faculty of the first importance, cannot be denied; since it is obvious, that, without the power of retaining the ideas and notions which we receive by the senses and other faculties, we never could make any progress in the acquisition of knowledge, but should begin every day, nay every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, in the same\nsimple state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> in which we are born. That it is a faculty capable of improvement by exercise, and that there are some methods of exercise better adapted for this purpose than others, has been shown elsewhere.\n\nSee MEMORY.\n\nCHAP. III. Of Simple Apprehension and Conception.\n\nThe ideas received into the mind by the senses, and treasured up in the memory and imagination, are the original materials of human knowledge. It is by comparing those ideas with one another, or by analyzing them into their first principles, that we acquire all our knowledge in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> and philosophy, and indeed all the knowledge which regulates our conduct through life. It must, therefore, be of importance to trace the progress of the mind in her various operations upon these materials; beginning, as she certainly begins, with that which is most simple, and proceeding regularly to those which are more complex and difficult.\n\nNow the first operation of the mind about her ideas appears plainly to be that which logicians term simple apprehension. Having yesterday observed a tree or any other object, if we contemplate the idea of that tree today as it remains in the imagination, without comparing it with any other idea, or referring it to any external object, we perform the operation which is called simple apprehension. We consider simple apprehension as an operation, because the mind in the apprehension of her own ideas is certainly active; she turns them, as it were, round and round, and views them on every side.\n\nSimple apprehension is a phrase which is commonly taken to be of the same import with the word conception; and in the ordinary affairs of life no confusion can arise from an indiscriminate use of the two words; but in this article we think it expedient to employ the phrase simple apprehension, to denote the view or contemplation of those ideas only which the mind by sensation has actually received from external objects; and the word conception to denote the view, not only of those ideas, but also of such as the mind fabricates to herself. Thus, a man may conceive a centaur, but we would not choose to say that he may apprehend a centaur: not that there is any impropriety, perhaps, in this last expression; but as there is certainly a difference between apprehending the idea of what has been seen or felt, and conceiving that which never existed, perspicuity requires that these different operations be expressed by different names.\n\nWe have said, that the mind may conceive what never existed; and every man may easily satisfy himself that what we have said is true; but though this has been frequently called the creative power of the mind, it has in fact no resemblance to creation. The materials of all our most complex and fantastic conceptions are furnished to our hands by sensation and reflection; nor can we form one simple idea which was not originally received by some of our senses from external objects, or, as shall be shown afterwards, one intellectual notion which was not acquired by reflecting on the operations of our own minds. To explain the process of fantastic conception, it is to be observed, that in every sensible object we perceive at once several things, such as colour, figure, extension and motion or rest, &c. These are the objects of different senses: but they are not, at least by full-grown men, perceived in succession, but all at once; whence it comes to pass that the memory, or the imagination, retains not several distinct and disjointed ideas, but the idea of one coloured, figured, and extended object. But when we compare various objects, or the ideas of various objects, together, we find that in some respects they agree and in others disagree; i.e. that several objects affect some of our senses in the same way, and other senses differently. Thus one globe is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, and another white; one black substance is circular and hard, and another square and soft. In the first instance, the two globes affect our sense of touch in the same way, and our sense of seeing differently; in the second, the two black substances affect our sense of sight in the same way, and our sense of touch differently.\n\nOne Im. has been disputed. That he admitted no proper crea-\nmility of time, may be confidently inferred from Plutarch; who,\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> upon the <a class=\"xref\"

parts of nature, particularly the heavenly souls, are gods. The human soul, according to him, is derived by emanation from God; through the intervention of this soul of the world; and receding farther from the first intelligence, it is inferior in perfection to the soul of the world, though even that soul is debased by some material admixture. To account more fully for the origin and present state of human souls, Plato supposes*, that \"when God formed the universe, he separated from the soul of the world inferior souls, equal in number to the stars, and assigned to each its proper celestial abode; but that those souls, (by what means, or for what reason, does not appear), were sent down to the earth into human bodies, as into sepulchres or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISONS\">prisons</a>.\" He ascribes to this cause the depravity and misery to which human nature is liable; and maintains, that it \"is only by disengaging itself from all animal passions, and rising above sensible objects, to the contemplation of the world of intelligence, that the soul of man can be prepared to return to its original state.\" Not inconsistently with this doctrine, our philosopher frequently speaks of the soul of man as consisting of three parts: or rather he seems to have thought that man has three souls; the first the principle of intelligence, the second of passion, and the third of appetite (m); and to each he assigns its proper place in the human body. But it was only the intellectual soul that he considered as immortal.\n\nAristotle taught, in terms equally express, that the human soul is a part of God, and of course that its substance is of eternal and necessary existence. Some of his followers, indeed, although they acknowledged two first principles, the active and the passive, yet held, with the Stoics, but one substance in the universe; and to reconcile these two contradictory propositions, they were obliged to suppose matter to be both active and passive. Their doctrine on this subject is thus delivered by Cicero: \"De natura ita dicebant, ut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAM\">cam</a> dividere non possent, ut altera esset efficiens, altera autem quasi huius praebens, ea quae efficere tur aliquid. In eo,\n\n(m) \"Plato triplicem finxit animam; cujus principatum, id est, rationem, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITE\">capite</a>, sicut in arce, posuit: et duas partes separare voluit, iram et cupiditatem, quas locis discloisit; iram in pectore, cupiditatem subter praecordia locavit.\" Ciceronis Tusc. Quest. lib. i. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 10.\n\nThis hypothesis has been adopted by the learned author of Ancient Metaphysics: but it cannot be proved by argument, and is in direct opposition to consciousness. Were there three distinct minds in each man\u2014the principles of intelligence, of passion, and of appetite, it is obvious that each man would be three persons, and that none of these persons could know any thing of the powers and properties of the other two. The intelligent person could not reason about passion or appetite: nor could the persons who know nothing but passion and appetite reason about intelligence, or indeed about any thing else. The very question at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, therefore, furnishes the most complete proof possible, that the same individual which each man calls himself, is the principle of intelligence, of passion, and of appetite; for if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATONIC\">Platonic</a> hypothesis were true, that question could never have been started, as no one individual of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> could have understood all its terms. It may be just worth while to mention, that the author of Ancient Metaphysics, attributing all motion, and even the coherence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> particles of body, to the immediate agency of mind, of course furnishes every human body with at least four minds. This fourth mind differs not from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PLASTIC_NATURE\"><a class=\"xref</a>\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTIC\">plastic</a> nature of Cudworth, and is likewise a Platonic notion apparently better founded. That there are in our bodies motions perpetually carried on by the agency of something which is not the principle of either our intelligence, our passions, or our appetites, is a fact which cannot be denied; but if those motions proceed immediately from mind, it must either be from the supreme mind, or from some subordinate mind, acting under the supreme, but wholly distinct from and independent of that which each man calls himself.\n\n(n) \"Non cum illis componi prorsus potest ARISTOTELES, qui bina rerum separataque statuunt principia, Deum\nBut when the ancients attributed a proper eternity to the soul, we must not suppose that they understood it to be eternal in its distinct and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> existence. They believed that it proceeded or was discerpted in time from the substance of God, and would in time be again resolved into that substance. This they explained by a close vessel filled with sea water, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> a while upon the ocean, does, on the vessel's breaking, flow in again, and mingle with the common mass. They only differed about the time of this reunion; the mortality of the greater part holding it to be at death; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGOREANS\">Pythagoreans</a> not till after many transmigrations. The Platonists went between these two opinions; and rejoined pure and unpolluted souls immediately to the Universal Spirit; but those which had contracted much defilement, were sent into a succession of other bodies, to be purged and purified, before they returned to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> substance.*\n\nA doctrine similar to this of Plato has been held from time immemorial by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRAMINS\">Bramins</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, whose doctrine saered books teach, \"That intellect is a portion of the great soul of the universe, breathed into all creatures, to animate them for a certain time; that after death it animates other bodies, or returns like a drop into that unbounded ocean from which it first arose; that the souls of men are distinguished from those of other animals, by being endowed with reason and with a consciousness of right and wrong; and that the soul of him who adheres to right as far as his powers extend, is at death absorbed into that divine essence, never more to re-animate flesh. On the other hand, the souls of those who do evil, are not at death disengaged from all the elements; but are immediately clothed with a body of fire, air, and akash (a kind of celestial element, through which the planets move, and which makes no resistance) in which they are for a time punished in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HELL\">hell</a>. After the season of their grief is over, they reanimate other bodies; and when they arrive through these transmigrations at a state of purity, they are absorbed into God, where all passions are utterly unknown, and where consciousness is lost in bliss.\"\n\nWhether the Greeks derived their notions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> and transmigration of souls from the east, or in what manner both they and the Bramins brought the same doctrine at different periods from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, it is foreign from the purpose of this article to inquire. Certain it is, that the philosophers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and India argued and punished in the very same manner, and upon the very same premises, and principles, for the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a> of the soul; and that the immortality which they taught was wholly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with God's moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the world, and with a future state of rewards and punishments. That this is true of the doctrine of the Bramins, is evident from the last-quoted sentence: for if the soul when absorbed into the Divine essence, loses all consciousness of what it did and suffered in the body, it cannot possibly be rewarded for its virtues practised upon earth. That the philosophers of Greece taught the same cessation of consciousness, might be inferred with the utmost certainty, even though we had not Aristotle's express <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> to that purpose: For as they all believed their souls to have existed before they were infused into their bodies, and as each must have been conscious that he remembered nothing of his former state (o), it was impossible to avoid concluding,\n\n---\n\nDeum et materiam. Arctissime enim utrumque hoc initium conjunxit Stagyrita, atque ipsa naturae necessitate Deum cohaerere cum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a> hac corporea putavit.\" Cudworth's Intellectual System, Book i. Chap. iv. Sect. 6.\n\n(o) This is expressly acknowledged by Cicero, though he held with his Greek masters the eternity of the soul.\nOf the including, that in the future state of his soul as little would mortality be remembered of the present. Accordingly Aristotle teaches, that \"the agent intellect only is immortal and eternal, but the passive corruptible.\"\u2014\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\n\n* De Ani. \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u1f76 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2. * Gudworth thinks this a very doubtful and obscure passage; but Warburton, whose natural acuteness often discovered the sense of ancient authors when it had escaped the sagacity of abler scholars, has completely proved, that by the agent intellect is meant the substance of the soul, and by the passive its particular perceptions. It appears therefore that the Stagyrite, from the common principle of the soul's being a part of the Divine substance, draws a conclusion against a future state of rewards and punishments; which though all the philosophers (except <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>) embraced, yet all were not so forward to avow.\n\nThat the hypothesis of the soul's being a part of the Divine substance is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> absurdity, we surely need not spend time in proving. The argument long ago urged against it by St Austin must ere now have occurred to every reader. In the days of that learned father of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, it was not wholly given up by the philosophers; and in his excellent work of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">City</a> of God, he thus exposes its extravagance and impiety: \"Quid infelicius credi potest, quam Dei partem vapulare, cum puer vapulat? Jam vero partem Dei fieri lascivas, iniqyas, impias, atque omnino damnabiles, quis ferre potest nisi qui prosum insanit?\"\n\nBut though this hypothesis be in the highest degree absurd and wholly untenable, we apprehend it to be the only principle from which the natural or essential immortality of the soul can possibly be inferred. If the soul had a beginning it may have an end; for nothing can be more evident than that the being which had not existence of itself, cannot of itself have perpetuity of existence. Human works, indeed, continue in being after the power of the workman is withdrawn from them; but between human works and the Divine there is this immense difference, that the former receive from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> nothing but their form; whereas the latter receive from the Creator both their form and their substance. Forms are nothing but modifications of substance; and as substances depend upon God and not upon man, human works are continued in being by that fiat of the Creator, which made the substances of which they are composed susceptible of different forms, and of such a nature as to retain for a time whatever form may be impressed upon them. Human works therefore are continued in being by a power different from that by which they are finished; but the works of God depend wholly upon that power by which they were originally brought into existence; and were the Creator to withdraw his supporting energy, the whole creation would sink into nothing.\n\nSelf-evident as this truth certainly is, some eminent philosophers seem to have questioned it. \"No substance or being (says Mr Baxter*) can have a natural tendency to annihilation, or to become nothing. That of a being which once exists should cease to exist is a mortality real effect, and must be produced by a real cause: the Soul. But this cause could not be planted in the nature of any substance or being to become a tendency of its nature; for it could not be a free cause, otherwise it must be a being itself, the subject of the attribute freedom, and therefore not the property of another being; nor a necessary cause, for such a cause is only the effect of something imposing that necessity, and so no cause at all.\"\n\nThat the author's meaning in this argument is good, Inconceivability cannot, we think, be controverted; but he has not expressed himself with his usual accuracy. He seems to confound causes with the absence of causes, and the effects of the former with the consequences of the latter. The visible world was brought into existence by the actual energy of the power of God; and as the visible world had nothing of itself, it can remain in existence only by a continuance of the same energy. This energy therefore is at the present moment as real a cause as it was six thousand years ago, or at any period when it may have been first exerted; and the visible world is its real and permanent effect. But would the ceasing of this energy be likewise a cause? It would certainly be followed with the annihilation of the visible world, just as the withdrawing of the sun-beams would be followed with darkness on the earth. Yet as no one has ever supposed that darkness, a nonentity, is a positive effect of the sun or of his beams, but only a mere negative consequence of their absence; so, we think, no one who believes in creation can consider that destruction which would inevitably follow the withdrawing of the energy by which all things are supplied, as the positive effect of a contrary energy, or as anything more than a negative consequence of the ceasing of that volition or energy of power by which God at first brought things into existence. For where the foundation of existence lies wholly in the power of an infinite Being producing, the ground of the continuance of that existence must be wholly in the same power conserving; which, has therefore, with as much truth as frequency, been styled a continued creation (p).\"\n\nThe force of this reasoning Mr Baxter certainly saw, and when he said, that \"a tendency to persevere in the feet gives the same state of nature, and a tendency to change it, are up by his contradictories, and impossible to be planted in the same subject at once: or, not to urge the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>, if the last prevailed, the remaining in the same state for any given time would be impossible. We forget the true cause of all these tendencies, the will of God, which it is absurd to suppose contrary to itself. The tendency in matter to persevere in the same state of rest or motion, is nothing but the will of the Creator, who preserves all things in their existence and manner of existence: nor can we have recourse to any other cause.\n\nIn answer to some very foolish assertions concerning the evil of death, he says, \"Ita, qui nondum nati sunt, miseram jam sunt, quia non sunt: et nos ipsi, si <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> mortem miseri futuri sumus, miseri fuimus antequam nati. Ego Soul, vol. i. autem non commemini, antequam sum natus, me miserum. Tuscul. lib. i. cap. 6.\n\n(p) See Stillingfleet's Origines Sacrae, where this question is treated in a very masterly manner by one of the ablest metaphysicians of the 17th century. See also our article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">PROVIDENCE</a>.\ncause for the preservation of immaterial substance in totality of its existence. Therefore these tendencies are to be ascribed to the will of God, and it is absurd to suppose them contrary.\"\n\nAll this is unquestionably true. The existence or nonexistence of matter and of created spirits depends wholly upon the will of God; and we cannot suppose him to be willing today the reverse of what he willed yesterday, because we know that all his volitions are directed by unerring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>. We have likewise the evidence of experience, that nothing is ever suffered to perish but particular systems, which perish only as systems by a decomposition of their parts. A being, which like the soul has no parts, can suffer no decomposition; and therefore, if it perish, it must perish by annihilation. But of annihilation there has not hitherto been a single instance; nor can we look for a single instance without supposing the volitions of God to partake of that unsteadiness which is characteristic of man. Corporeal systems, when they have served their purpose, are indeed resolved into their component parts; but the matter of which they were composed so far from being lost, becomes the matter of other systems in endless succession. Analogy, therefore, leads us to conclude, that when the human body is dissolved, the immaterial principle by which it was animated continues to think and act, either in a state of separation from all body, or in some material vehicle to which it is intimately united, and which goes off with it at death; or else that it is preserved by the Father of spirits, for the purpose of animating a body in some future state. When we consider the different states through which that living and thinking individual, which each man calls himself, goes, from the moment that it first animates an embryo in the womb, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of the man of fourscore; and when we reflect likewise on the wisdom and immutability of God, together with the various dissolutions of corporeal systems, in which we know that a single atom of matter has never been lost; the presumption is certainly strong, that the soul shall subsist after the dissolution of the body. But when we take into the consideration the moral attributes of God\u2014his justice and goodness, together with the unequal distribution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> and misery in the present world; this presumption from analogy amounts to a complete moral proof that there shall be a future state of rewards and punishments (q) (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Moral Philosophy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">Religion</a>); and if we estimate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the rewards by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> of Him by whom they are to be conferred, we cannot imagine them shorter than eternity.\n\n**Chap. V. Of Necessity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBERTY\">Liberty</a>.**\n\nIn the preceding chapter we have adverted to that great moral proof for a future state, and the immortality of the soul, arising from the relation in which man, as cessary and being accountable for his conduct, stands to a God of almighty power, infinite wisdom, and perfect justice. But the circumstance of accountabilityness implies freedom of agency; for it is contrary to all our notions of right and wrong (see Moral Philosophy), that a man should be either rewarded or punished for actions which he was necessitated or compelled to perform.\n\nHuman actions are of three kinds: one, where we act by instinct, without any view to consequences; one, where we act by will, in order to obtain some end; and one, where we act against will. It is the second kind of actions only which confers upon the agent merit or demerit. With respect to the first, he acts blindly (see Instinct), without deliberation or choice; and the external act follows from the instinctive impulse, no less necessarily than a stone by its gravity falls to the ground. With respect to the last, he is rather an instrument than an agent; and it is universally allowed, that were a strong man to put a sword into the hand of one who is weaker, and then to force it through the body of a third person, he who held the sword would be as guiltless of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> as the sword itself. To be entitled to rewards, or liable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, a man must act voluntarily; or in other words, his actions must proceed from that energy of mind which is termed volition; and, we believe, it has never been denied, that all men have power to do whatsoever they will, both with respect to the operations of their minds and the motions of their bodies, uncontrolled by any foreign principle or cause. \"Every man (says Priestley) is at liberty to turn his thoughts to whatever subject he pleases, to consider the reasons for or against any scheme or proposition, and to reflect upon them as long as he shall think proper; as well as to walk wherever he pleases, and to do whatever his hands and other limbs are capable of doing.\" Without such liberty as this, morality is inconceivable.\n\nBut though philosophers have in general agreed with respect to the power which a man has to perform such actions as he wills, they have differed widely in opinion respecting the nature of his volitions. That these are the result of motives, has seldom if ever been questioned; but whether that result be necessary volition, so as that the agent has no self-determining power to decide between different motives, has been warmly disputed by men equally candid, impartial, and intelligent. The principal writers on the side of necessity are, Hobbes, Collins, Hume, Leibnitz, Lord Kames, Hartley, Edwards, Priestley, and perhaps Locke. On the other side are Clarke, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>, Law, Reid, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>, Price, Bryant, Wollaston, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSLEY\">Horsley</a>, Beattie, and Gregory.\n\n(q) It was by such arguments that Socrates reasoned himself into the belief of a future state of rewards and punishments. He was singular, as we have already observed, in this belief; and he was as singular in confining himself to the study of morality. \"What could be the cause of this belief, but this restraint, of which his belief was a natural consequence? For having confined himself to morals, he had nothing to mislead him; whereas the rest of the philosophers, applying themselves with a kind of fanaticism to physics and metaphysics, had drawn a number of absurd, though subtle, conclusions, which directly opposed the consequences of those moral arguments.\"\n\n*Warburton's Div. Leg.* vol. ii.\nTo give a short view of this celebrated question, is all that our limits will permit; and as we do not think ourselves competent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> the dispute, it were perhaps a thing desirable to give the opposite reasonings in the words of those eminent authors themselves. It must, however, be obvious to the reader, that the style and manner of so many different writers are extremely various, and that to introduce them all into our abstract, would make the whole a mass of confusion. We shall, therefore, select one writer to plead the cause of necessity, supplying his defects from those who, though inferior to him on the whole, may yet have argued more ably on some particular points which the question involves; and to this combined reasoning we shall subjoin such answers as to us appear most conclusive. Hartley, Hume, and Priestley, are perhaps the most profound reasoners on the side of necessity; but there is so much more perspicuity in the arguments of Lord Kames, that we cannot help preferring them, as being on the whole better calculated to give the ordinary reader a fair view of the subject.\n\n\"Into actions done with a view to an end (says his lordship*), desire and will enter: desire to accomplish the end goes first; the will to act, in order to accomplish the end, is next; and the external act follows of course. It is the will then, that governs every external act done as a mean to accomplish an end; and it is desire to accomplish the end that puts the will in motion; desire, in this view, being commonly termed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> to act. But what is it that raises desire? The answer is ready: It is the prospect of attaining some agreeable end, or of evading one that is disagreeable. And if it be inquired, what makes an object agreeable or disagreeable? the answer is equally ready: It is our nature that makes it so. Certain visible objects are agreeable; certain sounds, and certain smells: other objects of these senses are disagreeable. But there we must stop; for we are far from being so intimately acquainted with our own nature as to assign the causes.\n\n\"With respect to instinctive actions, no person, I presume, thinks that there is any freedom. With respect to voluntary actions, done in order to produce some effect, the necessity is the same, though less apparent at first view. The external action is determined by the will: the will is determined by desire; and desire by what is agreeable or disagreeable. Here is a chain of causes and effects, not one link of which is arbitrary, or under command of the agent: he cannot will but according to his desire; he cannot desire, but according to what is agreeable or disagreeable in the objects perceived: nor do these qualities depend on his inclination or fancy; he has no power to make a beautiful woman ugly, nor to make a rotten carcase smell sweetly.\n\n\"Many good men, apprehending danger to morality from holding our actions to be necessary, endeavour to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the chain of causes and effects above mentioned; maintaining, that whatever influence desire or motives may have, it is the agent himself who is the cause of every action; that desire may advise, but cannot command; and, therefore, that a man is still free to act in contradiction to desire and to the strongest motives.\n\n\"That a being may exist which in every case acts blindly and arbitrarily, without having any end in view, I can make a shift to conceive; but it is difficult for me even to imagine a thinking and rational being, that has affections and passions, that has a desirable end in view, that can easily accomplish this end; and yet after all can fly off or remain at rest, without any cause, reason, or motive, to sway it. If such a whimsical being can possibly exist, I am certain that man is not that being. There is not, perhaps, a person above the condition of a changeling, but can say why he did so and so, what moved him, what he intended. Nor is a single fact stated to make us believe that ever a man acted against his own will or desire, who was not compelled by external force.\u2014On the contrary, constant and universal experience proves, that human actions are governed by certain inflexible laws; and that a man cannot exert his self-motive power but in pursuance of some desire or motive.\n\n\"Had a motive always the same influence, actions proceeding from it would appear no less necessary than the actions of matter. The various degrees of influence that motives have on different men at the same time, and on the same man at different times, occasion a doubt, by suggesting a notion of chance. Some motives, however, have such influence as to leave no doubt: a timid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> has a physical power to throw herself into the mouth of a lion roaring for food; but she is withheld by terror no less effectually than by cords: if she should rush upon a lion, would not every one conclude that she was frantic? A man, though in a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, retains a physical power to act, but he cannot exert it. A man, though desperately in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, retains a physical power to refuse the hand of his mistress; but he cannot exert that power in contradiction to his own ardent desire, more than if he were fast asleep. Now, if a strong motive have a necessary influence, there is no reason for doubting, but that a weak motive must also have its influence, the same in kind, though not in degree. Some actions indeed are strangely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>; but let the wildest actions be scrutinized, there will always be discovered some motive or desire, which, however, whimsical or capricious, was what influenced the person to act. Of two contending motives, is it not natural to expect that the stronger will prevail, however little its excess may be? If there be any doubt, it must arise from a supposition, that a weak motive may be resisted arbitrarily. Where then are we to fix the boundary between a weak and a strong motive? If a weak motive can be resisted, why not one a little stronger, and why not the strongest? Between two motives opposing each other, however nearly balanced, a man has not an arbitrary choice, but must yield to the stronger. The mind, indeed, fluctuates for some time, and finds itself in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> loose: at last, however, it is determined by the more powerful motive, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> is by the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> after many vibrations.\n\n\"Such, then, are the laws that govern our voluntary actions. A man is absolutely free to act according to his own will; greater freedom than which is not conceivable. At the same time, as man is made accountable for his conduct to his Maker, to his fellow\nOf low creatures, and to himself, he is not left to act arbitrarily; for at that rate he would be altogether unaccountable: his will is regulated by desire; and desire by what pleases or displeases him.\u2014Thus, with regard to human conduct, there is a chain of laws established by nature; no one link of which is left arbitrary. By that wise system, man is made accountable; by it he is made a fit subject for divine and human government: by it persons of sagacity foresee the conduct of others; and by it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESCIENCE\">prescience</a> of the Deity with respect to human actions is clearly established.\n\nOf the doctrine of necessity, a more perspicuous or plausible view than this is not to be found in any work with which we are acquainted. It is indeed defective, perhaps, as his lordship only hints at the nature of that relation which subsists between motive and action; but from his comparing the fluctuations of the mind between two contending motives, to the vibrations of a balance with different weights in the opposite scales, there is no room to doubt but that he agreed exactly in opinion with Mr Hume and Dr Priestley. Now, both these writers hold, that the relation of motives to volition and action, is the very same with that which subsists between cause and effect in physics, as far as they are both known to us.\n\n\"It is universally allowed (says Mr Hume*), that matter, in all its operations, is actuated by a necessary force; and that every natural effect is so precisely determined by the energy of its cause, that no other effect, in such particular circumstances, could possibly have resulted from it. The degree and direction of every motion is, by the laws of nature, prescribed with such exactness, that a living creature may as soon arise from the shock of two bodies, as motion in any other degree or direction than what is actually produced by it. Would we, therefore, form a just and precise idea of necessity, we must consider whence that idea arises, when we apply it to the operation of bodies. But our idea of this kind of necessity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAUSATION\">causation</a> arises entirely from the uniformity observable in the operations of nature, where similar objects are constantly conjoined together, and the mind is determined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> to infer the one from the appearance of the other. These two circumstances form the whole of that necessity which we ascribe to matter. Beyond the constant conjunction of similar objects, and the consequent inference from one to the other, we have no notion of any necessity or connexion.\" He then gives a pretty long detail to prove a great uniformity among the actions of men in all nations and ages; and concludes that part of his argument with affirming, \"not only that the conjunction between motives and voluntary actions is as regular and uniform as that between the cause and effect in any part of nature; but also, that this regular conjunction has been universally acknowledged among mankind, and has never been the subject of dispute either in philosophy or common life.\" He afterwards observes, \"That men begin at the wrong end of this question concerning liberty and necessity, when they enter upon it by examining the faculties of the soul, the influence of the understanding, and the operations of the will. Let them first discuss a more simple question, namely, the operations of body, and of brute unintelligent matter, and try whether they can there form any idea of causation and necessity, except that of a constant conjunction of objects, and subsequent inference of the mind from one to another. If these circumstances form in reality the whole of that necessity which we conceive in matter, and if these circumstances be also universally acknowledged to take place in the operations of the mind, the dispute is at an end; at least must be owned to be thenceforth merely verbal. When we consider how aptly natural and moral evidence link together, and form only one chain of argument, we shall make no scruple to allow that they are of the same nature, and derived from the same principles.\u2014Between a connected chain of natural causes and voluntary actions, the mind feels no difference in passing from one link to another; nor is less certain of a future event which depends upon motives and volitions, than if it were connected with the objects present to the memory and senses by a train of causes, cemented together by what we are pleased to call a physical necessity. The same experienced union has the same effect on the mind, whether the united objects be motives, volition and action, or figure and motion. We may change the names of things, but their nature and their operation on the understanding never change.\"\n\nDr Priestley, in words a little different, teaches the very same doctrine which was taught by Mr Hume.\u2014\"In every determination of the mind (says he*), all the previous circumstances to be considered are the state of mind (including every thing belonging to the will itself), and the views of things presented to it; the latter of which is generally called the motive, though under this term some writers comprehend them both. To distinguish the manner in which events depending upon will and choice are produced, from those in which no volition is concerned, the former are said to be produced voluntarily, and the latter mechanically. But the same general maxims apply to them both. We may not be able to determine a priori how a man will act in any particular case; but it is because we are not particularly acquainted with his disposition of mind, precise situation, and views of things. But neither can we tell in which way the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> will blow to-morrow, though the air is certainly subject to no other than necessary laws of motion.\n\n\"It is universally acknowledged, that there can be no effect without an adequate cause. This is even the foundation on which the only proper argument for the being of a God rests. And the necessarian asserts, that if, in any given state of mind, with respect both to disposition and motives, two different determinations or volitions be possible, it can be so on no other principle, than that one of them shall come under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of an effect without a cause; just as the beam of a balance might incline either way, though loaded with equal weights. It is acknowledged, that the mechanism of the balance is of one kind, and that of the mind of another; and, therefore, it may be convenient to denominate them by different words; as, for instance, that of the balance may be termed a physical, and that of the mind a moral mechanism. But still, if there be a real mechanism in both cases, so that there can be only one result...\"\nresult from the same previous circumstances, there will be a real necessity, enforcing an absolute certainty in the event. For it must be understood, that all that is ever meant by necessity in a cause, is that which produces certainty in the effect.\"\n\nSuch is the nature of human volitions, according to every necessarian of eminence who has written on the subject since the days of Hobbes: and if this theory be just, if there be a constant and inseparable conjunction of motives and actions similar to that of cause and effect in physics, it is obvious, that in volition the mind is as inert as body is in motion.\n\nThis consequence is indeed avowed and insisted upon by Hume, Priestley, and their adherents; whilst the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for human liberty, on the other hand, contend for an absolute exemption of the will from all internal necessity, arising from its own frame and constitution, the impulse of superior beings, or the operations of objects, reasons, or motives, &c. By this they do not mean, that between motives and volitions there is no relations whatever, or that a man can ever choose evil as evil, or refuse good as good. Such an assertion would be contrary to consciousness and universal experience. But what they endeavour to prove is, that the conjunction of motive and volition is not inseparable, like that of cause and effect in physics; that a man may in most cases choose according to any one of two or more motives presented to his view; that by choosing any thing, he may make it in some measure agreeable by his own act, or, to speak more properly, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> his desire to it; that in volition, the mind is not inert; and that, therefore, we are under no necessity to act in a particular manner in any given case whatever.\n\nThat the conjunction of motive and action is not constant like that of cause and effect in physics, and that by consequence the mind in forming volitions is not inert,' has been evinced by Dr Gregory with the force and precision of mathematical demonstration.\u2014Former writers on the side of liberty had often observed, that upon the supposition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INERTIA\">inertia</a> of mind, a man, with equal and opposite motives presented at once to his view, would, during their continuance, remain perfectly at rest, like a balance equally loaded in both scales. The observation is admitted to be just by all the advocates for necessity; but they contrive to evade its consequences, by denying that in any given case a man can be at once assailed by two equal and opposite motives. Thus, when it is said that a porter, standing with his face due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, must remain in that position at perfect rest, as long as equal motives shall at once be offered to him for travelling eastward and westward, the necessarians admit the force of the argument; but when it is added that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUINEA\">guinea</a>, offered for every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> that he should travel in each of these opposite directions, ought therefore to fix him at rest till one of the offers be withdrawn, they deny that the desire of gaining the guineas is the whole of the motives which operate upon his mind. He may have, say they, some secret reason which we cannot discern for preferring the one direction to the other; and that reason, added to the guinea, will make him go eastward or westward, just as an ounce thrown into either scale of a balance poised by equal weights will make that scale preponderate. Though we think that this solution of the difficulty can satisfy no man who is not already biased to the necessarian system; and though, even were it to be admitted, it seems to militate against the constant conjunction of motives and actions, unless it can be proved that the porter must travel the road which he has been necessitated to choose with reluctance and a heavy heart; yet as it may admit of endless quibbling upon ambiguous words, the philosophical world is much indebted to Dr Gregory for an argument which, in our opinion can neither be overturned nor evaded, and which demonstrates that the conjunction of motive and action cannot be constant and inseparable, like that of cause and effect in physics.\n\nHis reasoning is to this purpose: Suppose a porter to be offered a guinea for every mile that he shall travel directly eastward. If there be no physical cause or moral motive to keep him at rest, or to induce him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a> to move in another direction, there cannot be a doubt, upon either hypothesis, but he will gladly embrace the proposal, and travel in the direction pointed out to him, till he shall have gained as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> as to satisfy his most avaricious desires. The same thing would have happened, if a guinea had been offered for every mile that he should travel due south. In these two cases taken separately, the relation between the man's motions and his actions would be strikingly analogous to that between a single impulse and motion in physics. Let us now suppose the two offers to be made at the same instant, and the man to be assured that if he travel eastward he can have no part of the reward promised for his travelling to the south, and that if he travel southward he can have no part of the reward promised for his travelling to the east. What is he to do in this case? If his mind be inert in volition, and if the two motives operate upon him with the same necessity that causes operate in physics, it is obvious that the man could travel neither towards the east nor towards the south, but in a diagonal direction from north-west to south-east; and this he must do willingly, although perfectly satisfied that he could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> nothing by his journey. As this inference is contrary to fact and universal experience, the doctor very justly concludes that the premises, from which it is deduced by mathematical reasoning, must be false and absurd; or, in other words, that the relation between motive and action cannot be that of constant conjunction, like the relation between cause and effect in physics.\n\nHe uses many arguments of the same kind, and equally convincing, to prove the absurdity of supposing the inertness of mind, and only an occasional conjunction of motives and actions; but we forbear to quote them, both because we wish his book to be read, and because we think the single argument which we have borrowed from him sufficient to demolish the theory of Priestley and Hume, which rests wholly upon the hypothesis of the constant conjunction of motive and action.\n\nBut is it then not really true, that the external action is determined by the will, the will by desire, and desire by what is agreeable or disagreeable? That the external action is universally determined by the will, is certainly true; but that the will is necessitated and universally determined by the desire is as certainly false. If\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POTIPHAR\">Potiphar</a>'s wife was handsome, and made her proposals to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> with any degree of female <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>; and if his constitution was like that of other young men; there cannot be a doubt but that he felt a desire to do what she requested of him: yet we know that he willed to do otherwise, and in direct opposition to his desire fled from the room. Perhaps it may be said, that his volition to flee was the effect of a contrary and stronger desire not to sin against God; but this is confounding the reader, by calling two energies of mind, between which there is little or no similarity, by the same name. He perceived, or knew, that to comply with his mistress's request would be to sin against God; he knew that he ought not to sin against God, and therefore he chose or determined himself not to do it. We can easily conceive how the presence, attitudes, and address, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> might be agreeable to him, and excite desire. There may very possibly be more than one of our readers, who, during the course of their lives, have experienced something of the same kind: but could abstract truth be in the same way agreeable, so as to excite in his mind a desire of virtue sufficient to annihilate or banish the desire of the woman? As well may it be said that one sensation can annihilate another, that the beautiful colours of the rainbow can remove the sensation of stench from the mind of him who is plunged into the midst of a dunghill, or that the smell of a rose can make a man insensible to the pain of a stroke inflicted by a bludgeon. Sensitive desire, and the perception of duty, are things so totally different, that to consider them as operating against each other, like different weights in the opposite scales of a balance, is as absurd as to suppose that sound can operate against colour, or colour against smell. A man may prefer sound to colour, or colour to smell, and act accordingly; but the determination must be wholly his own, unless these two sensations be themselves either agents or physical causes of the same kind, like the weights in the opposite scales of the balance.\n\nThe advocates for liberty do not pretend, that in matters of importance a man ever acts without some motive or reason for his conduct. All that they insist upon is, that between two or more motives of different kinds he has a liberty of choice, and that he does not always determine himself by that which he knows to be the greatest. Without such freedom, they think men might be often brought into situations where they could not act at all, and where inaction would at the same time be in the highest degree absurd. Thus, were two bags of gold containing each a thousand or ten thousand guineas, to be placed on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, before a man whose family is perishing for want, and were the man to be told that he might take either of them, but not both, is it conceivable that he would be held in perpetual suspense between the two? No; he would instantly and with alacrity take up one of them, without feeling the least regret for the want of the other. This action would, indeed, be the consequence of a very powerful motive, the desire to obtain honestly that wealth of which he and his family stood so much in need. That motive, however, being general, would draw him equally to both bags; and it remains with the necessarians to say by what else than a self-determining power he could take either the one or the other. When it is affirmed, that such self-determination would be an effect without a cause, the advocates for liberty cannot help thinking that their antagonists are guilty of advancing as an argument a petitio principii; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> is true, only if the mind in volition be inert, and the inertia of the mind is the sole question at issue. If the mind be not inert, it is plain, that in consequence of a man's self-determination, no effect would be produced without a sufficient cause. At any rate, motives cannot be causes. In the proper sense of the word, a cause is that which produces an effect; but the production of an effect requires active power; and power being a quality, must be the quality of some being by whom it may be exerted. Power may be dormant, and therefore power without will produces no effect. Are motives, then, real beings endowed with power and will? No; they are only views of things or mental conceptions, which in the strictest sense of the word are passive; and between two motives the mind determines itself, without receiving an impulse from either.\n\nNor is it only between motives of equal force that men have the power of determining themselves. Whoever believes in a future state of rewards and punishments, and yet acts in a manner which he knows to be offensive to Him who is to be the future and final judge, unquestionably prefers to the strongest of all motives, another which even to himself appears to have comparatively but very little strength. Whether there be men who occasionally act in this manner, is a question which can be decided only by an appeal to every one's consciousness. That there are, we can have no doubt; for we never met with a single individual, not biased by system, who was not ready to acknowledge, that during the course of his life he had done many things, which at the time of action he clearly perceived to be contrary to his true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. Without a self-determining power in the mind, this could never be the case. Did motives operate with the necessity of physical causes, it is obvious that in every possible situation the strongest must constantly prevail; and that he who in certain circumstances had in time past done any particular thing, would on a return of the same circumstances do the very same thing in every time future. Dr Priestley, indeed, wishes to persuade his readers that this is actually the case. \"In every determination of the mind (says he), or in cases where volition and choice are concerned, all the previous circumstances to be considered are the state of mind (including every thing belonging to the will itself), and the various views of things presented to it;\" and he affirms, that \"whenever the same precise circumstances occur twice, the very same determination or choice will certainly be made the second time that was made the first.\" This is an assertion of which no man can controvert the truth; for it is an identical proposition. If in the circumstances previous to the determination of the mind, every thing belonging to the will itself must be included, it is self-evident that he who in any given circumstances has acted a particular part, will on a return of these circumstances act the same part a second time; for this is only saying, that he who on two different occasions shall exert volitions of the same tendency, will not on these occasions exert volitions of which the tendencies are different. But the question\nto be decided is, Whether a man, in the same general necessity and state of mind, possessed of the same degree of health, and conscious of the same appetites, must, in external circumstances perfectly alike, necessarily exert at all times the same volitions. That the human mind is under no such necessity, we think every man's consciousness and experience may abundantly satisfy him; for there are, perhaps, but very few who have not at one time resisted temptations, to which at another they have chosen to yield.\n\nThat there is a relation between motives and actions, must be confessed; but that relation is neither necessity, nor constant conjunction. If it were, all actions would be perfectly rational; and folly, as well as merit and demerit, would be banished from the conduct of men. What is the particular nature of that relation which subsists between the voluntary actions of men, and the motives from which they proceed, can be known to every individual only by an attentive and unbiassed reflection on the operations of his own mind. Without this reflection, no man can be made to understand it by the reasonings of philosophers, and with it no man can need the aid of those reasonings. That a self-determining power, such as that for which we plead, contributes to the sum of human happiness, has been shown by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a> King and his ingenious translator; who have proved, with the force of demonstration, that the mind can take pleasure in the object of its choice, though that object be in itself neither agreeable nor disagreeable to our natural appetites; and that if it could not, it would be in vain in such a world as ours to hope for any portion of felicity. Into that detail our limits will not permit us to enter: but to the reader who wishes for further information, we beg leave to recommend the last edition of King's Origin of Evil, by Dr Law late bishop of Carlisle; without, however, vouching for the truth of all the opinions advanced by either of those learned writers.\n\nBefore we conclude this chapter, it may be proper to observe, that it is only in volition that we are conscious of any original active power in ourselves, and that without such consciousness we could never have acquired the notion of active power. In our desires and appetites, we neither are active nor suppose ourselves active. Lord Kames, and most necessarians, confound desire with volition; but that they are perfectly distinct is plain from this circumstance, that we daily desire many things which we know to be wholly out of our own power, whereas no man ever willed what he did not believe to be in his own power. We all desire or wish that our children may be virtuous, wise, and happy; and though we are conscious that it is not in our power to make them so, we cannot banish the desire from our breasts. But madmen only have ever willed virtue, wisdom, and happiness, to any person; and if there was ever a man so extravagantly mad as to exert such a volition as this, he has at the time fancied himself a divinity, and therefore believed that the object of his volition depended upon himself. When the astronomer, whose character is so admirably drawn by our great master of moral wisdom, fancied himself the regulator of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> and the distributor of the seasons, he might will either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> or sunshine as he thought proper, because he considered the object of his volition as depending upon a power imparted to him from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>; but though being and might desire he could not will, the rising or the falling of winds, for these he confessed were not subjected to his authority. In a word, without freedom in volition power is inconceivable; and therefore it is as certain that we are free agents, as that we have any notion of active powers.\n\nCHAP. VI. Of the Being and Attributes of God.\n\nIt has been already observed, that as of bodies there are various kinds, endowed with various properties; so the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> is, that of minds endowed with different powers, or different degrees of power, the variety may be as great, or perhaps greater. The existence and powers of our own minds are made known to us by consciousness and reflection; and from our dependent state, and the mutability of the objects around us, we are necessarily led to infer the existence of another mind, which is independent, unchangeable, eternal, and the cause of all things which have a beginning of existence. Between that mind and our own, we can hardly avoid believing that there are many orders of \"thrones, dominations, principalities, virtues, powers;\" but as we have no intuitive knowledge of such intermediate beings, and cannot from anything which we perceive discern the necessity of their existence, they are not properly the object of science. The existence however, and many of the attributes, of One First Cause, are capable of the strictest demonstration; \"for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things which are made.\"\n\nOf this great truth, the most important by far which can occupy the mind of man, many demonstrations have been given both by divines and by philosophers. We shall lay before our readers such a one as to us appears perfectly conclusive, being founded on the intuitive knowledge which we have of our own existence, and therefore independent of all theories about the nature and reality of the material world.\n\nEvery man, whether he adopt the common theory or that of Berkeley respecting matter, is conscious that he himself exists, and must therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> that something now exists. But, if any thing exists now, then must something have always existed; otherwise that thing which now exists, must either have been created by nothing, i.e. have been caused by no cause, or else it must have created itself, acting before it existed. Both these suppositions are so palpably absurd, that no atheist has avowed them, either among the ancients or the moderns. We must therefore admit, either that there is some one independent being, which now exists, and always has existed; or that the things which we know to exist at present (every man's self, for instance), were produced by something which had its existence from something else, which also depended upon some other cause, and so on in an infinite series of caused or successive beings. But this last supposition, though it has been often made, is as grossly absurd as either of the two former. For of this infinite series, either some one part has not been successive to any other,\nthe Be- or else all the several parts of it have been successive, and At- If some one part of it was not successive, then it had a first part; which destroys the supposition of its infinity (R). If all the several parts of it have been successive, then they have all once been future; but if they have all been future, a time may be conceived when none of them had existence: and if so, then it follows, either that all the parts, and consequently the whole of this infinite series, must have arisen from nothing, which is absurd; or else that there must be something in the whole besides what is contained in all the parts, which is also absurd.\n\nAs the possibility or impossibility of an infinite series of dependent beings is the main question at issue between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ATHEISTS\">atheists</a> and us, we shall state the preceding reasoning in a manner somewhat different. For this purpose, let us suppose some one to affirm, that the course of generation has had no beginning, and consequently that the number of successive births has been infinite. We would ask such a person, Whether before the birth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a>, for example *, there had past an infinite series of generations or not? If not, the course of generation must have had a beginning, which is the conclusion for which we contend. But if the series past was infinite, then at the birth of Joseph the great-grandson of Abraham, it is evident, that more generations were past, and that the number then was greater than that which was supposed to be infinite; so that upon this supposition we have a number that is both infinite and not infinite, which is a manifest contradiction. Should it be said that the number of generations was infinite, as well at the birth of Abraham as at the birth of Joseph; it will then follow, that one infinite may be greater than another of the very same kind; and consequently that an infinite may be bounded, i.e., be finite. But should it be alleged, that the number of births at Abraham's was finite, and became infinite when it reached to Joseph's, it will then follow, that one finite number added to another may make an infinite number, which is directly contrary to every possible notion of infinity. We might argue in the same manner against an infinite series of every kind, the very supposition of which involves the most palpable contradictions. See Chap. Of Infinity and Eternity.\n\nFrom the impossibility of an infinite series it necessarily follows, that there exists, and must have existed from eternity, some one independent being, whose duration cannot be commensurate with succession, and to whom the relation of time is not applicable. Here will some atheists presently imagine, that by the same mode of reasoning they may disprove the existence of God: for do not they who thus destroy the eternity of the world, destroy at the same time the eternity of the Creator? If time itself be not eternal, how can the Deity or anything else be so?\n\nIn urging these questions, it must be taken for granted that time is essential to all existence, and that God cannot be eternal otherwise than by a successive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a> of infinite time. But it has been already shown (N\u00b0 224.), that successive duration is not essential to existence; that we can even conceive existence without succession; and it may here be added, that if we suppose a perfect Being alone in nature, we shall find it impossible to imagine any succession of ideas, any flux of moments, or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> or increase whatever in his knowledge and essence. Such duration as we are acquainted with can have no relation to an immutable Being, while supposed to exist alone; but as soon as he determined to exercise his several attributes in the production of something distinct from himself, then, and not till then, have we reason to think that time, succession, and increase, began. These atheistical questions, therefore, instead of containing an objection to the existence of a Deity, afford a plain demonstration of it: for since it is not more evident that something now exists than that something must have existed from eternity; and since it has been shown, that neither the world in its present state, nor time, nor anything capable of change or succession, can possibly be eternal; it follows, that there must necessarily be some Being who, in the order of nature, is before time, and who, in the stability and immutable perfection of his own intelligence, comprehends at once his yesterday, today, and forever. \"The atheists (says the excellent Cudworth *) can here only smile, or make wry faces, and show their little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> in quibbling upon munce-stans, or a true standing now of eternity; as if that standing eternity of them, book i. the Deity (which with so much reason hath been contended for by the ancient genuine theists) were nothing but a pitiful small moment of time standing still, and as if the duration of all beings whatsoever must needs be like our own: whereas the duration of every thing must of necessity be agreeable to its nature; and therefore, as that whose imperfect nature is ever flowing like a river, and consists in continual motion and changes one after another, must needs have accordingly a successive and flowing duration sliding perpetually from present into past, and always hasting on towards the future, expecting something of itself which is not yet in being; so must that whose perfect nature is essentially immutable have permanent and unchanging duration, never losing anything of itself once present, nor yet running forward to meet something of itself which is not yet in being.\"\n\nFrom the eternity of the Supreme Being we necessarily infer his independence or self-existence; for that existent, which never had a beginning of existence cannot possibly have any cause of that existence, or in any manner depend upon any other being, but must exist of itself, or be self-existent.\n\nEternity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AD\">ad</a> partem post, or necessary existence, or the cannot impossibility of ever ceasing to be, follows from inde- cease to be- pendence: For to the nature of that which exists without any cause, existence must be essential. But a being whose existence is of itself and essential to its nature, cannot be indifferent to existence or nonexistence, but must exist necessarily. And here it may be proper to observe, that the word necessity, when applied to existence, may be taken in two acceptations very different from each other\u2020; either as it arises from the relation which the existence of that being, of which it is affirmed, has to the existence of other things; or from the relation which the actual existence of that thing has to the manner of its own existence.\n\n(R) \u1f08\u03c0\u1f78 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c3\u1f76\u03bd \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, Arist. Phys. lib. viii. cap. 5, sect. 4.\nIn the former sense, when necessity of existence has relation to the existence of other things, it denotes that the supposition of the non-existence of that thing of which necessity is affirmed, implies the non-existence of things which we know to exist. Thus, some independent being does necessarily exist; because, to suppose no independent being, implies that there are no dependent beings; the contrary of which we know to be true.\n\nIn the second sense, when the necessity of existence arises from the relation which the actual existence of any thing has to the manner of its own existence, necessity means, that the thing, of which it is affirmed, exists after such a manner as that it never could in time past have been nonexistent, or can in time future cease to be. Thus, every independent being, as it exists without a cause, is necessarily existing; because existence is essential to such a being; so that it never could begin to exist, and never can cease to be: For to suppose a being to begin to exist, or to lose its existence, is to suppose a change from nonentity to entity, or vice versa; and to suppose such a change is to suppose a cause upon which that being depends. Every being, therefore, which is independent, i.e. which had no cause of its existence, must exist necessarily, and cannot possibly have begun to exist in time past, or cease to be in time future.\n\nThese two kinds of necessity as applied to existence, though they have been often confounded, are in themselves perfectly distinct: For though a being cannot be necessarily existent in the former sense without being so in the latter also; yet may it be necessarily existent in the latter sense without being so in the former. For any thing that we know to the contrary, there may be two or more beings existing necessarily in the latter sense of the word necessity, i.e. with regard to independence and the manner of their own existence: but in the former sense of the word, i.e. in relation to this system, there can be but one necessarily existent being; for it is obvious that no more are necessary to account for the production of the dependent beings which we know to exist. To suppose the non-existence of all independent beings, implies the non-existence of all dependent beings, ourselves, and every thing else; but to suppose the non-existence of all independent beings except one, involves in the supposition no such absurdity.\n\nThus the phenomena of nature lead us, by the strictest reasoning, to one first cause, which is sufficient for their production; and therefore none but one first cause can in this sense of the word be necessary: And though several more independent beings might possibly exist, yet they would be no gods to us: they would have no relation to us demonstrable by reason, nor any thing to do with them. For if the supposition of their existence were not requisite to the production of this system, which it obviously would not be, we could perceive no necessity for it at all; we could never discover it by our own faculties, and therefore it could be nothing to us. And though two or three such beings should exist, and act in the formation and government of their respective systems, or agree in one; yet till their existence and operations were made known to us, and a natural relation discovered, nothing would be due from us to them. They would have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> or moral relations to us; and we should have of the one no reason to call more than one of them our creator, ing and preserver and governor, which is the proper sense of the word God.\n\nTo show in this manner that there is only one eternal self-existent Being which bears the relation of God to us, seems to be going as far as is necessary, or as impossible natural light will lead us. Those who endeavour to demonstrate that there cannot possibly be more than one self-existent Being, either reason in a circle, or proceed but on principles which their antagonists cannot be self-compelled to grant. When they deduce the Divine unity from independence or omnipotence, they evidently presuppose it in their definition of these attributes: and when they infer it from the nature of space and duration, which they consider as modes of the self-existent Being, they take it for granted, that space and duration have a real existence, independent of us and our thoughts; and that the one is infinite and the other eternal, contrary to what has been already proved, we think, with the force of demonstration. The celebrated Dr Clarke made much use of space and duration in his attempt to demonstrate that there can be but one self-existent Being; but he argues for the same thing from the nature of necessity as applied to existence.\n\n\"Necessity (says he*), absolute in itself, is simple and uniform and universal, without any possible difference, or diversity, or variety, whatsoever; and all variety or difference of existence must needs arise from some external cause, and be dependent upon it, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the efficiency of that cause, whatsoever it be. Absolute necessity, in which there can be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in any kind or degree, cannot be the ground of existence of a God, number of beings, however similar and agreeing: be-cause, without any other difference, even number is itself a manifest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a> or inequality (if I may so speak) of efficiency or causality.\"\n\nSuch is this great man's first argument from necessity, to prove that there cannot be more than one self-existent Being. But what is this necessity which proves so conclusively? It is the ground of existence (he says) of that which exists of itself; and if so, it must, in the order of nature, and in our conceptions, be antecedent to that being of whose existence it is the ground. Concerning such a principle, there are but three suppositions which can possibly be made; and all of them may be shown to be absurd and contradictory. We may suppose either the substance itself, some property of that substance, or something <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRINSIC\">extrinsic</a> to both, to be this antecedent ground of existence prior in the order of nature to the first cause.\n\nOne would think, from the turn of the argument which here represents this antecedent necessity as efficient and causal, that it were considered as something extrinsic to the first cause+. Indeed if the words have any meaning in them at all, or any force of argument, a priori, they must be so understood, just as we understand them added to any external cause producing its effect. But as an extrinsic principle is absurd in itself, and is besides rejected by Dr Clarke, who says expressly, that \"of the Space, thing which derives not its being from any other thing, Time, In this necessity or ground of existence must be in the thing itself,\" we need not say a word more of the last of these suppositions.\nLet us then consider the first; let us take the substance itself, and try whether it can be conceived as prior or antecedent to itself in our conceptions or in the order of nature. Surely we need not observe that nothing can be more absurd or contradictory than such a supposition. Dr Clarke himself repeatedly affirms, and it would be strange indeed if he did not affirm, that no being, no thing whatever, can be conceived as in any respect prior to the first cause.\n\nThe only remaining supposition is, that some attribute or property of the self-existent Being may be conceived as in the order of nature antecedent to that being. But this, if possible, is more absurd than either of the two preceding suppositions. An attribute is attributed to its subject as its ground or support, and not the subject to its attribute. A property, in the very notion of it, is proper to the substance to which it belongs, and subsequent to it both in our conceptions and in the order of nature. An antecedent attribute, or antecedent property, is a solecism as great, and a contradiction as flat, as an antecedent subsequent or subsequent antecedent, understood in the same sense and in the same syllogism. Every property or attribute, as such, presupposes its subject; and cannot otherwise be understood. This is a truth so obvious and so forcible, that it sometimes extorts the assent even of those who upon other occasions labour to obscure it. It is confessed by Dr Clarke*, that \"the scholastic way of proving the existence of the self-existent Being from the absolute perfection of his nature, is \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2. For all or any perfections (says he) presuppose existence; which is a petitio principii.\" If therefore properties, modes, or attributes in God, be considered as perfections (and it is impossible to consider them as anything else), then, by this confession of the great author himself, they must all or any of them presuppose existence. It is indeed immediately added in the same place, \"that bare necessity of existence does not presuppose, but infer existence;\" which is true only if such necessity be supposed to be a principle extrinsic, the absurdity of which has been already shown, and is indeed universally confessed. If it be a mode or a property, it must presuppose the existence of its subject, as certainly and as evidently as it is a mode or a property. It might perhaps a posteriori infer the existence of its subject, as effects may infer a cause; but that it should infer in the other way a priori is altogether as impossible as that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> should be a square, or a globe a parallelogram.\n\nDoubtful, as it would seem, of the force of his first argument, which even those who pretend to be convinced by it acknowledge to be obscure, the doctor gives a second, which we must confess appears to us to be still more obscure, and if possible less conclusive. \"To suppose two or more distinct beings existing of themselves necessarily and independent of each other, implies (he says) this contradiction, that each of them being independent from the other, they may either of them be supposed to exist alone; so that it will be no contradiction to suppose the other not to exist; and consequently neither of them will be necessarily existing. Whosoever therefore exists necessarily is the one simple essence of the self-existent Being; and whatsoever differs from that is not necessarily existing, because in absolute necessity there can be no difference or diversity of existence.\n\n\"Necessity is used here in two different senses*. Of the two beings can exist without the other, i.e. without supposing the other to exist also, since that is equally necessary. In the latter, either of them may exist alone, i.e. as without the help of the other, or without the supposition of the other as requisite to its own existence. The consequence, therefore, that either of them may exist alone, and so neither of them is necessary, is a mere equivocation on necessity, using it both in examined, an absolute and relative sense at the same time.\" But as this is a question of the highest importance, and as the author was a man of great worth, we shall consider his argument upon the supposition that the word necessity has from the beginning to the end of it the same invariable meaning.\n\nIt has been already observed, that there are only two senses in which that word can be applied to the existence of any being; and whether it be here used in the one or the other of these senses, the reasoning, if resolved into a syllogism, will appear to be inconclusive. If the word be taken in that sense of necessity which arises from the relation that dependent beings which we know to exist bear to some one independent Being, the argument will stand thus:\n\nFrom a known effect no more causes can be necessarily inferred than what are sufficient to account for that effect; but One self-existent and independent Being is sufficient to account for all the phenomena of nature; therefore, from the phenomena, &c. No more than one such Being can be necessarily inferred to exist.\n\nBut though no more than one independent being can in this sense of the word necessarily exist, it by no means follows from this syllogism, that two or more such beings may not possibly exist. It is, indeed, a plain contradiction to say, that two or more self-existent beings are in this sense necessary; but surely there is no contradiction in saying, that two or twenty such beings are possible. We could not, therefore, by this argument convict a person of absurdity, who should affirm that two or more independent beings actually exist. We might, indeed, deny the existence of them all but one, because one is sufficient to account for those phenomena, from which alone we know that any independent being exists; but because one of them might be supposed to exist alone, so that it would be no contradiction to suppose the other not to exist; we know not how the doctor came to affirm, in direct opposition to his own demonstration, that not one of them would be necessarily existing.\n\n\"Necessity, as applied to existence, in the other sense of the word, arises, as we have seen, from the relation which the actual existence of the being, of which it may be affirmed, has to the manner of that being's existence. It is the same necessity, we are told*, with that which is the cause of the unalterable proportion between two and four; and it is considered as the formal cause or ground of the existence of an independent being. Were it not for the strange expressions formal cause and ground of existence, we should have no objection to this account of that necessity by which a being independent undoubtedly exists: but this kind\nOf the Bc. of necessity is a principle which will not support the ing and At. superstructure which the learned author labours to raise upon it. The same necessity which is the cause of the unalterable proportion between two and four, is likewise the cause of the unalterable proportion between three and six, between four and eight, and between five and ten, &c. But if it can be the cause of so many different proportions of the same kind, why may it not be the formal cause or ground of existence to as many independent beings of the same kind as well as to one? The following syllogism, we apprehend, to be legitimate both in mode and figure, and its conclusion is directly contrary to the proposition which the doctor deduces from the same notion of necessity.\n\nIf necessity, considered as a formal cause or ground of existence, be in one instance of its causality the formal cause or ground of existence to many things of the same kind, it may likewise in every other instance of its causality, be the formal cause or ground of existence to many things of the same kind.\n\nBut such necessity, in that instance of its causality where it is the formal cause or ground of existence to the unalterable proportion between two and four, is the formal cause or ground of existence to many proportions of the same kind.\n\nTherefore, the same necessity in that other instance of its causality, where it is said to be the formal cause or ground of existence to one independent being, undoubtedly may be the formal cause or ground of existence to many independent beings of the same kind.\n\nThus it appears, that necessity, in any sense in which it can be properly affirmed of existence, cannot be the foundation of any argument to prove the impossibility of more than one self-existent being. It is indeed a principle from which we apprehend that no positive conclusion whatever can be deduced by reasoning \u00e0 priori. That necessity of existence may be predicated of a being which is independent and uncreated, is self-evident; because to the nature of such a being, existence is essential. But whilst that nature itself remains wholly incomprehensible by us, it is impossible that we should discover, by our own unassisted reason, whether it can be the nature of only one, or of more than one, independent being. To argue from necessity, as if it were the cause or ground of existence to such a being, is certainly absurd, if it be not impious; for if that of the Bo. to which existence is essential, does not exist without ing and At. any cause efficient or formal, we shall be obliged to inquire after a cause or ground of this cause, and thus be involved in all the absurdities and contradictions of an infinite series. We have insisted the longer on this point, because necessity, as the foundation of the argument \u00e0 priori, has sometimes been employed to very bad purposes. Attempts have been made from the notion of necessary existence, to prove that the Supreme Being cannot be a free agent, and to set the first principles of the religion of nature at variance with those which are revealed in the Scriptures.\n\nBut though we are firmly persuaded that the divine unity cannot be demonstrated \u00e0 priori, we are far from God from thinking it incapable of any proof. On the contrary, the common arguments \u00e0 posteriori, drawn from the order and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> of the world, have always satisfied us, and in our opinion must satisfy every person capable of proportioning his assent to evidence, that the Creator and Preserver of such a system has but one will and one intelligence, and therefore is himself but one being. But proof is one thing, and demonstration is, in the proper sense of the word, another (c). And if we cannot arrive at absolute certainty concerning this important truth by the light of nature, we ought to be the more thankful for that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>, which has put the unity of God past dispute to all who believe the holy Scriptures.\n\nThe being which is self-existent and independent must be also omnipotent. That such a being has active power in some degree, is shown at the same time and by the same medium that we prove his existence; and since he depends upon no cause for his existence or his power, he cannot depend upon any for the exertion of that power, and consequently no limits can be applied to it. Limitation is an effect of some superior cause, which in the present instance there cannot be; consequently to suppose limits where there can be no limit, is to suppose an effect without a cause. For a being to be limited or deficient in any respect*, is to be dependent in that respect on some other being which gave it just so much and no more; consequently that being which in no respect depends upon any other is in no respect limited or deficient. In all beings capable of increase or diminution, and consequently incapable of perfection or absolute infinity, limitation or defect is indeed a necessary consequence of existence, and\n\n(c) John Gerhard and John Vossius both cite Gabriel Biel as acknowledging the unity of God to be incapable of rigid demonstration; and with the sentiments of that schoolman, those two learned divines profess their own to agree.\n\nSed Biel (1 Sant.

Without the actual exertion of power, it is indeed most certain that nothing could be brought into existence; but it is so far from being clear that pre-existent matter, or, as Aristotle chose to express himself, a material cause, must be supposed for infinite power to operate upon, that, we think, every man may find complete evidence of the contrary in himself. That sensation, intelligence, consciousness, and volition, are not the result of any modifications of figure and motion, is a truth as evident as that consciousness is not swift, nor volition square. If then these be the powers or properties of a being distinct from matter, which we think capable of the completest proof, every man who does not believe that his mind has existed and been conscious from eternity, must be convinced that the power of creation has been exerted in himself. If it be denied that there is any immaterial substance in man, still it must be confessed, that, as matter is not essentially conscious, and cannot be made so by any particular organization, there is some real thing or entity, call it what you please, which has either existed and been conscious from eternity, or been in time brought from non-entity into existence by an exertion of infinite power.\n\nTo this perhaps some one may object, that upon our own supposition of the inability of the human mind to exert its faculties but in union with some material and organized system, the mind of every man may have existed from eternity without being conscious of its own existence; and that, therefore, we have in ourselves no evidence of creation, but only of the union of two self-existent substances, which, in their prior state, had been distinct and separate from each other. But such an objection as this, we beg leave to reply, can arise from nothing but misapprehension of our hypothesis, and of the reasons by which we think it supported. We suppose, that to the exertion of the human faculties, a body of some kind or other may be necessary as an instrument, not merely from what we observe of the dependence of perception.\n\n(\u0397) \u03a4\u03bf \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u03b5\u1f50\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u1f22 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4. ad Locomach. lib. vi. cap. 2.\nOf the relation and memory on the state of the brain, but being and At-cause we cannot conceive a Creator of infinite wisdom and goodness to immerse in systems of matter, minds to which he knows that such systems must be always useless and often hurtful. We believe, therefore, that our souls and bodies were created and formed for each other; but as our present adversaries admit not of a Creator, we must ask them, How their self-existent souls have been disposed of from eternity, and by what power they have all in due succession been united each to its proper body? As before the union they were not conscious, they could not unite themselves; and to suppose them united by some superior intelligence, is to suppose them in some respects dependent on that intelligence, which seems not to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> with their self-existence. Whatever is self-existent and eternal must be independent; and if possessed of any power, cannot be conceived to have that power limited.\u2014We repeat, therefore, that every man has in himself sufficient evidence that creation is possible; for if infinite power can create an immaterial and percipient being, it may surely be supposed capable of creating dead and unintelligent matter.\n\nBut the creation of the material system may be shown to be in the highest degree probable by other arguments. The same reasoning which proves the impossibility of an infinite series and of eternal time, proves that the universe cannot have existed from eternity in its present state. But if it has not existed from eternity in its present state, it belongs to the opponents of creation to say what was its former. We talk indeed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAOS\">chaos</a>; but such language, when a Creator is not admitted, is most unphilosophical trifling. It appears from the most accurate inquiries that have been made into the substance and essence of body*, that the atoms of which each mass is composed are held together by a foreign force. If by chaos be meant matter, when this force is supposed to be removed, we must beg leave to say, that of such a substance we have neither idea nor notion, and cannot distinguish it from nonentity. The original atoms of matter, we believe indeed to require no other agency to keep each entire than that fiat by which it was created; but still, as those atoms are conceived to be solid and extended, they must be capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> by infinite power; and if that fiat or influence which makes them solid and extended were removed, they would lose solidity and extension, and of course become nothing. So far is it, therefore, from being true, that the creation of matter appears to be impossible, that we are compelled by every thing that ing and A we know of it to believe that matter cannot possibly be self-existent.\n\n\"Because it is undeniably certain, concerning ourselves (says Cudworth\u2020), and all imperfect beings,\u2020 Intellec- that none of these can create any new substance, mon tual Syste are apt to measure all things by their own scantling, Book i. and to suppose it universally impossible for any power whatever thus to create. But since it is certain, that imperfect beings can themselves produce some things out of nothing pre-existing, as new cogitations, new local motion, and new modifications of things corporeal, it is surely reasonable to think that an absolutely perfect Being can do something more, i.e., create new substances, or give them their whole being. And it may well be thought as easy for God or an Omnipotent Being, to make a whole world, matter and all, \u03b5\u03be \u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u1fc6\u03c2, as it is for us to create a thought or to move a finger, or for the sun to send out rays, or a candle light; or lastly, for an opaque body to produce an image of itself in a glass or water, or to project a shadow: all these imperfect things being but the energies, rays, images, or shadows, of the Deity. For a substance to be made out of nothing by God, or a Being infinitely perfect, is not for it to be made out of nothing in the impossible sense, because it comes from him who is all. Nor can it be said to be impossible for any thing whatever to be made by that which hath not only infinitely greater perfection, but also infinite active power. It is indeed true, that infinite power itself cannot do things in their own nature impossible; and, therefore, those who deny creation, ought to prove, that it is absolutely impossible for a substance, though not for an accident or modification, to be brought from non-existence into being. But nothing is in itself impossible, which does not imply a contradiction: and though it be a contradiction for a thing to be and not to be at the same time, there is surely no contradiction in conceiving an imperfect being, which before was not, afterwards to be.\" To call in question the possibility of creation, because we have no adequate conception how a thing can be brought into existence, would be in the highest degree absurd; for it may be doubted, whether we have adequate conceptions of any thing except our own ideas and their various relations (1).\n\nThat Being which is self-existent, omnipotent, and God a free omniscient, is not a necessary, but a free agent; for ac-\n\n---\n\n(1) \"Ridicula foret et inepta ejus temeritas, qui corporum ideo creationem sibi duceret negandum esse, quod ejus creationis claram et perspicuam notionem effingere cogitatiunc nobis haud licet.

Syst.\nThe Be- tive power implies freedom, and infinite power infinite and At- freedom. What, therefore, hath no bounds set to its power, what can have no opposition made to its will, nor restraint laid on its actions, must both will and act freely. \"If the Supreme Cause were not a being endowed with liberty and choice, but a mere necessary agent, then would it follow, as Dr Clarke well observes *, that nothing which is not, could possibly have been; and that nothing which is, could possibly not have been; and that no mode or circumstance of the existence of any thing could possibly have been in any respect otherwise than it now actually is. All which being evidently most false and absurd; it follows, on the contrary, that the Supreme Cause is not a mere necessary agent, but a Being endued with liberty and choice.\"\n\nTo this reasoning it has been lately replied \u2020, that \"Clarke must have known, that all those who contend against the free agency of the Deity, do of course acknowledge, that nothing could have happened, or does happen, or will happen, but what actually has happened, or doth happen, or will happen; and that it is most false and absurd to deny it.\" It is, therefore, according to the necessarians, absolutely impossible, that at present there could exist upon this earth more or fewer persons than are now actually alive; that the earth could move in any other direction than from west to east; or that there could be more or fewer planets in the solar system. Yet is it most certain, that there have been fewer persons on the earth than there are now; that there is not a cultivated country in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> which could not contain more people than now inhabit it; that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a> move in very different directions from that of west to east; and that as, till very lately, we conceived only six primary planets in the system, it is evidently possible that the system might contain no more. Upon the supposition, therefore, that the Supreme Being acts under a physical necessity, the same things are possible and not possible at the same time, which is the grossest of all absurdities. It might have been objected with much more plausibility, that the First Cause cannot possibly be free, because he must needs do always what is best in the whole; but it will be seen by and by, that among different created systems, there is no reason for supposing any one absolutely best.\n\nBut though this Being be free, and as such the author of change in other beings, yet he must himself be unchangeable; for all changes have a beginning, and consequently are effects of some prior causes. But there can be nothing prior to the existence of this Being, as he is eternal; neither any cause of it, as he is independent; nor consequently any change in it, except we could suppose him to change himself, which is the same absurdity as to produce himself, i.e. to be at the same time both effect and cause.\n\nOmniscience, as well as some of the foregoing attributes of the Supreme Being, may perhaps be more easily deduced thus \u2020. We find in ourselves such qualities as thought and intelligence, power and freedom, &c., for which we have the evidence of consciousness as much as for our own existence. Indeed it is only by our consciousness of these that our existence is known to ourselves. We know likewise that these are perfections, and that to have them is better than to be without them. We find also that they have not been in us from eternity. They must, therefore, have had a beginning, and consequently some cause, for the very same reason that a being beginning to exist in time requires a cause. Now this cause, as it must be superior to its effect, must have those perfections in a superior degree; and if it be the first cause, it must have them in an infinite or unlimited degree, since bounds, or limitation without a limiter, would, as we have already shown, be an effect without a cause.\n\nIt is indeed obvious, that the omniscience of the Supreme Being is implied in his very existence. \"For all things being not only present to him, but also entirely depending upon him, and having received both their being itself and all their powers and faculties from him, it is manifest that as he knows all things that are, and penetrates every part of their substance with his all-seeing eye, so must he likewise know all possibilities of things, that is, all effects that can be. For, being alone self-existent, and having alone given to all things all the powers and faculties with which they are endued, it is evident that he must of necessity know perfectly what all and each of these powers and faculties, which are derived wholly from himself, can possibly produce. And seeing at one boundless view, or more properly in his own ideas, all the possible compositions and divisions, variations and changes, circumstances and dependencies of things, all their possible relations one to another, and their dispositions or fitnesses to certain and respective ends, he must without possibility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> know exactly what is best and properest in every one of the numberless possible cases, or methods of disposing things; and understand perfectly how to order and direct the respective means to bring about what he so knows to be in its kind, or on the whole, the best and fittest in the end. This is what is meant by infinite wisdom, or omniscience *; and it has been readily admitted by every man who has believed in the existence of a God, as the creator and preserver of all things.\n\nDoubts, however, have been entertained by theists, God fore- and pious theists, whether omniscience itself can certainly foreknow what are called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINGENT\">contingent</a> events, such as the actions of free agents; and some few there are professing to be even Christians, who have boldly pronounced such knowledge to be impossible. That we have no adequate notion how events, which are called contingent, can be certainly foreknown, must indeed be granted; but we are not, therefore, authorized to say that such knowledge is impossible, unless it can be clearly shown to imply a contradiction. They who suppose that it implies a contradiction, must likewise suppose, that, where there is not a chain of necessary causes, there can be no certainty of any future event; but this is evidently a mistake. \"For let us suppose that there is in man a power of beginning motion, and of acting with what has been of late called philosophical freedom; and let us suppose farther that the actions of such a man cannot possibly be foreknown; will there not yet be in the nature of things, notwithstanding this supposition, the same certainty of event in every one of the man's actions, as if they were ever so fatal and necessary? For instance, suppose the man, by an internal principle of motion, and an absolute freedom of mind, to do some particular action to-day, and suppose it was\nOf the Be- was not possible that this action should have been foreseen and At-seen yesterday, was there not nevertheless the same tribute of God.\n\nThe manner of his omniscience, for instance, has been the subject of much disputation among those who ought and At have reflected that they know not how their own minds were present to their own bodies.\u2014The celebrated Dr Clarke and his adherents, who considered space as the sine qua non of all other things, insisted, that God must be infinitely extended; and that, as wherever his substance is, there his attributes must be, it is thus that his knowledge and power are present with every creature. But this notion labours under insuperable difficulties.\n\nFor \"if the Divine substance be infinitely extended, then will there be part of it in this place and part in another that. It must be commensurate with all particular divine omnipresence beings, so that some will occupy more and some less of its dimensions. By this account it will be very comprehensible and philosophical to say, that God is not in heaven, but only a part of him: and that an elephant or a mountain, a whale or a wicked giant, have more of the essence or presence of God with them, than the holiest or best man in the world, unless he be of equal size: all which, as has been well observed*, are at least harsh* and grating expressions. As the attributes of the Divine Being must be considered in the same manner with his substance, we shall likewise, upon this notion of omnipresence, have a part of his knowledge and power in this place, and a part of them in that; and of these Time, Imparts the one must be greater or less than the other, according to the dimensions of the place with which it is commensurate; which is a supposition that appears to us harsher, if possible, than even the former.\n\n\"Should it be said that the divine attributes are not to be considered as having parts (though we see not how they can be considered otherwise than as their subject), they must then exist completely in every point of this immense expansion. Be it so; and what follows? Why, every point of this infinitely expanded being will be omniscient and omnipotent by himself; an inch of it will have as much wisdom and power as a yard, a mile, or the whole; and, instead of one infinite wisdom and power, we shall have millions: For as these parts of the substance are conceived distinctly, and one individual part is not another, so must the attributes be likewise conceived, and the individual power and knowledge of one part be distinct from that of another.\" And if so, it follows, that one point of this expanded being has equal power and intelligence with the whole; so that the notion of extension being necessary to God's presence with every creature, involves in it the most palpable contradiction. That God is at all times and in all places so present with every creature as to have an absolute knowledge of and power over it, is indeed capable of the strictest demonstration; but we think it great presumption to assign the particular mode of his presence, especially such a one as is neither agreeable to the nature of an absolutely perfect Being, nor in the least necessary to the exercise of any one perfection which he can be proved to possess. Philosophers and divines have offered several names for the manner in which God is present with his works; but we choose rather to confess, that the manner of his presence is to us, and probably to every creature, wholly incomprehensible. Nor need we be surprised or staggered at this, when we reflect that the manner in which our own minds are present.\nThe moral attributes of God may be deduced from his natural ones, and are immediate consequences of them when exercised on other beings. They may be termed his secondary relative attributes, as they seem to be the perfection of his external acts rather than any new internal perfections. And though the existence of any moral quality or action is not capable of strict demonstration, because every moral action or quality, as such, depends upon the will of the agent, which must be absolutely free; yet we have as great assurance that there are moral qualities in God, and that he will always act according to these qualities, as the nature of the thing admits; and may be as well satisfied of it, as if it were capable of the most rigid demonstration.\n\nThis important point, however, cannot be so clearly or so firmly established by abstract reasoning as by taking a scientific view of the works of creation, which evince the goodness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a>, and justice of their Author, as well as his perfect wisdom and infinite power. The consideration, therefore, of the moral attributes of God, together with his providence, and the duties thence incumbent on man, is the proper business of other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> (see Religion, Theology, and Moral Philosophy).\n\nAt present we shall only observe, that by reasoning a priori from his existence and his natural perfections, we must necessarily infer that his actions are the result of unmixed benevolence. Every wise agent has some end in view in all his actions; it being the very essence of folly to act for no end; but there cannot be an end of action which is not either selfish or benevolent. Selfishness is the offspring of want and imperfection, and is therefore the source of most human actions; because men are weak and imperfect beings, capable of daily additions to their happiness. When the thief plunders a house at midnight, when the highwayman robs a traveller on the road, and even when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSASSIN\">assassin</a> murders the man who never injured him; it will be found that their actions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> not from an innate desire to inflict misery upon others, but from a prospect of reaping advantage to themselves. The object of the thief and the robber is obvious: it is to gain money, which is the mean of procuring the comforts of life. Even the assassin has always the same selfish end in view: either he is bribed to commit the murder, or he fancies that his horrid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a> will remove an obstacle from the way to his own happiness. But they are not vicious men only who act from selfish considerations: much of human virtue, when traced to its source, will be found to have its origin in the desire of happiness. When a man gives his money to feed the hungry and to clothe the naked, he believes that he is acting agreeably to the will of Him to whom he looks for a future and eternal reward. By continuing the practice, he soon acquires the habit of benevolence; after which, indeed, he looks for no further reward, when performing particular actions, than the immediate pleasure of doing good. This selfishness of man is the necessary consequence of his progressive state. But the Being who is independent, omnipotent, omniscient, and, in a word, possessed of every possible perfection, is incapable of progression, or of having any accession whatever made to his happiness. He is immutable; and must of necessity have been as happy from eternity, when existing alone, as after the creation of ten thousand worlds. When, therefore, he willed the existence of other beings, he could have nothing in view but to communicate some resemblance of his own perfections and happiness. That he had some end in view, follows undeniably from his infinite wisdom. That he could not have a selfish end, follows with equal certainty from his own infinite perfections; and as there is no medium, in the actions of a wise Being, between selfishness and benevolence, we must necessarily conclude, that the creation was the result of unmixed benevolence or perfect goodness. The other moral attributes of the Deity, his justice, mercy and truth, ought therefore only to be considered as so many different views of the same goodness in the Creator, and various sources of happiness to the creature. These are always subordinate to and regulated by this one principal perfection and brightest ray of the Divinity.\n\nThus we conceive his justice to be exerted on any being no farther than his goodness necessarily requires, in order to make that being, or others, sensible of the heinous nature and pernicious effects of sin*, and thereby bring them to as great a degree of happiness as King on their several natures are capable of. His holiness hates Evil, and abhors all wickedness, only as its necessary consequences are absolute and unavoidable misery; and his veracity or faithfulness seems to be concerned for truth, only because it is connected with and productive of the happiness of all rational beings; to provide the properest means for attaining which great end, is the exercise of his wisdom.\" Such is the view of God's moral attributes, which the abstract contemplation of his natural perfections necessarily gives; and whether this way of conceiving them be not attended with less difficulty than the common manner of treating them under the notion of two infinites diametrically opposite, must be left to the judgment of the reader.\n\nBut if the Creator and supreme Governor of all things be a Being of infinite power, perfect wisdom, of evil, and pure benevolence, how came evil into the works of creation? This is a question which has employed the speculative mind from the first dawning of philosophy, and will continue to employ it till our faculties be enlarged in a future state, when philosophy shall give place to more perfect knowledge. To these meditations, as has been well observed\u2020, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> is not equal. Volumes have been written on the subject; but we believe that the following extract from Dr. Johnson's Origin of Evil...\nOf the Be. Dr Clarke contains all that can be advanced with cer-\nting, and At- tainty, and all that is necessary to vindicate the ways of\ntributes of God.\n\n\" All that we call evil (says that able reasoner), is either an evil of imperfection, as the want of certain\nfaculties and excellencies which other creatures have; or natural evil, as pain, death, and the like; or moral\nevil, as all kinds of vice. The first of these is not properly an evil: for every power, faculty, or per-\nfection, which any creature enjoys, being the free gift of God, which he was no more obliged to bestow than\nhe was to confer being or existence itself, it is plain, that the want of any certain faculty or perfection\nin any kind of creatures, which never belonged to their nature, is no more an evil to them, than their\nnever having been created or brought into being at all could properly be called an evil.\" To this we may\nadd, that as no created being can be self-existent and independent, imperfection is unavoidable in the crea-\ntion, so that the evil of defect (as it is most absurdly called) must have been admitted, or nothing could\never have existed but God. \"The second kind of evil,\nwhich we call natural evil, is either a necessary conse-\nquence of the former, as death to a creature on whose\nnature immortality was never conferred; and then it is\nno more properly an evil than the former: Or else it is\ncounterpoised in the whole with as great or greater\ngood, as the afflictions and sufferings of good men:\nand then also it is properly no evil. Or else it is a punish-\nment; and then it is a necessary consequence of the\nthird and last sort of evil, viz. moral evil. And this\narises wholly from the abuse of liberty, which God gave\nto his creatures for other purposes, and which it was\nreasonable and fit to give them for the perfection and\norder of the whole creation: only they, contrary to\nGod's intention and command, have abused what was\nnecessary for the perfection of the whole, to the cor-\nruption and depravation of themselves. And thus have\nall sorts of evils entered into the world, without any\ndiminution to the infinite goodness of its Creator and\nGovernor.\"\n\nBut though evil could not be totally excluded from\nthe present universe, are we not authorized to infer, from the\ninfinite power, wisdom, and goodness of the Creator,\nthat the present system is upon the whole the very best\nsystem possible? Undoubtedly we are, if of possible\nsystems there can be a best: but this is so far from be-\ning evident, that we think it implies a contradiction.\nA best of beings there is, viz. God, who is possess-\ned of infinite perfections; but there cannot be a best of\ncreatures or of created systems. To prove this, we\nneed only reflect, that wherever creation stops, it\nmust stop infinitely short of infinity; and that how\nperfect soever we conceive any creature or system\nof creatures to be, yet the distance between that\nand God is not lessened but continues infinite. Hence\nit follows that the nature of God and his omnipo-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENCE\">tence</a> is such, that whatever number of creatures he\nhas made, he may still add to that number; and\nthat however good or perfect the system may be on\nthe whole, he might still make others equally good and\nperfect.\n\nThe dispute, whether a being of infinite power,\nwisdom, and benevolence, must be supposed to have\ncreated the best possible system, and the embarrassment of\nmen's understandings about it, seem to have arisen from\ntheir taking the words good, better, and best, for abso-\nlute qualities inherent in the nature of things, whereas\nin truth they are only relations arising from certain ap-\npetites. They have indeed a foundation, as all rela-\ntions have, in something absolute, and denote the thing\nin which they are founded; but yet they themselves\nimply nothing more than a relation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONGRUITY\">congruity</a> between\nsome appetite and its objects. This is evident; be-\ncause the same object, when applied to an appetite to\nwhich it has a congruity, is good; and bad, when ap-\nplied to an appetite to which it has no congruity. Thus,\nthe earth and air to terrestrial animals are good elements,\nand necessary to their preservation: to those animals\nthe water is bad, which yet affords the best recep-\ntacle to fishes. Good, therefore, being relative to\nappetite, that must be reckoned the best creature by\nus which has the strongest appetites, and the surest\nmeans of satisfying them all, and securing its own per-\nmanent happiness. And though the substance of crea-\ntures is chiefly to be regarded as contributing to their\nperfection, yet we have no way of measuring the per-\nfection of different substances but by their qualities,\ni.e. by their appetites by which they are sensible of\ngood and evil, and by their powers to procure those ob-\njects from which they receive that sense of things which\nmakes them happy.\n\nIt is plain, therefore, that whatever system we sup-\npose in nature, God might have made another equal\nabsolutely to it; his infinite wisdom and power being able to\nmake other creatures equal in every respect to any\nthat we know or can conceive, and to give them equal\nor stronger appetites, and as certain or more certain\nways of satisfying them. We see in many cases, that\nvery different means will answer the same end. A cer-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAIN\">tain</a> number of regular pyramids will fill a space; and\nirregular ones will do it as well, if what we take\nfrom the one be added to another; and the same thing\nmay be done by bodies of the most irregular and dif-\nferent figures in the same manner: and therefore we\nmay very well conceive, that the answering of appe-\ntites, which is all the natural good that is in the world,\nmay as well be obtained in another system as in this;\nprovided we suppose, that where the appetites of the\nsentient beings are changed, the objects are also suited\nto them, and an equal congruity among the parts of the\nwhole introduced. This is so easily conceived, that in\nan indefinite number of possible worlds, we do not see\nwhy it may not be done in numberless ways by infinite\npower and wisdom.\n\nIf then it be plain, that there might have been many\nother worlds, or even but one, equal to this in all\nrespects as to goodness, there could be no necessity\nfor creating one rather than the other; because nothing could\nmake the one better, or to him more agreeable, than\nthe other, but his own free choice. Either, there-\nfore, God must be possessed of absolute freedom, or,\namong a number of possibilities equally perfect, he\ncould not have made a choice, and so nothing would\never have been created. It is not, then, as Leibnitz\nand others argue, the natural and necessary goodness of\nsome particular things, represented by the divine ideas,\nwhich determines God to prefer them to all others, if\nunderstood of his first act of producing them; but it is\nthe Be. is his own free choice which, among many equal po-\ntential goods, makes some things actually good, and de-\ntermines them into existence. When those are once\nsupposed to exist, every thing or action becomes good\nwhich tends to their happiness and preservation; and\nto suppose their all-perfect Author to have any other\nend in view than their preservation and happiness,\nis the same absurdity as to suppose that knowledge\nmay produce ignorance; power, weakness; or wisdom\nfolly.\n\nWe have now finished what we proposed under the\narticle Metaphysics.

The parching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> is never felt; the thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> of trees, and thousands of crystal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> which everywhere arise and form themselves into unnumbered rivulets, joined to the refreshing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> breeze, the constant corrective and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> of noontide heat, qualify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and render the year a never-ending May. The houses are constructed in such a manner as to have the best view of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> beauties. Each is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> tower neatly built of hewn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as to overtop the trees, and to command a view of the sea and neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>. The lower stories are granaries and storehouses; and the habitable apartments are all at the top, to which you ascend by a stone stair, built for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> on the outside, and surrounding the tower; so that from the apartment the trees are overlooked, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is seen; while the habitations themselves, which are very numerous, peering above the groves, add <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and variety to the enchanting prospect, and give an air of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> to these woodlands, which might otherwise be supposed the region of Dryads, of Naiads, and of Satyrs.\"\n\nThe most remarkable thing, however, in this island is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> by which the women have here openly usurped those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of sovereignty which in other countries\ncountries are supposed to belong essentially to the men.\n\n\"Contrary (says his lordship) to the usage of all other countries, the eldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> here inherits; and the sons, like daughters everywhere else, are portioned off with small dowers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a>, which is still worse, turned out pennyless to seek their fortune. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> have two daughters, the eldest, at her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, is entitled to all her mother's possessions, which are by far the greater part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> estate, as the mother, keeping up her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a>, never parts with the power over any portion of what she has brought into the family, until she is forced into it by the marriage of her daughter; and the father also is compelled to ruin himself by adding whatever he may have scraped together by his industry. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> daughter inherits nothing, and is condemned to perpetual celibacy. She is styled a calogria, which signifies properly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> woman or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUN\">nun</a>, and is in effect a menial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> to her sister, being employed by her in any office she may think fit to impose, frequently serving her as waitingmaid, as cook, and often in employments still more degrading. She wears a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> peculiar to her situation, which she can never change; a sort of monastic dress, coarse, and of a dark <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>. One advantage, however, she enjoys over her sister, that whereas the elder, before marriage, is never allowed to go abroad, or to see any man, her nearest relations only excepted, the calogria, except when employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> toil, is in this respect at perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. But when the sister is married, the situation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> calogria becomes desperate indeed, and is rendered still more humiliating by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between her condition and that of her happy mistress. The married sister enjoys every sort of liberty; the whole family fortune is hers, and she spends it as she pleases; her husband is her obsequious servant, her father and mother are dependent upon her, she dresses in a most magnificent manner, covered all over, according to the fashion of the island, with pearls and with pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> sequins; thus continually carrying about her the enviable marks of affluence and superiority, while the wretched calogria follows her as a servant, arrayed in simple homespun brown, and without the most distant hope of ever changing her condition. Such a disparity may seem intolerable, but what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not custom reconcile? Neither are the misfortunes of the family yet at an end. The father and mother, with what little is left them, contrive by their industry to accumulate a second little fortune; and this, if they should have a third daughter, they are obliged to give to her upon her marriage; and the fourth, if there should be one, becomes her calogria, and so on through all the daughters alternately. Whenever the daughter is marriageable, she can by custom compel the father to procure her a husband; and the mother, such is the power of habit, is foolish enough to join her in teasing him into an immediate compliance, though its consequences must be equally fatal and ruinous to both of them. From hence it happens, that nothing is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> than to see the old father and mother reduced to the utmost indigence, and even begging about the streets, while their unnatural daughters are in affluence; and we ourselves have frequently been shown the eldest daughter parading it through the town in the greatest splendour, while her mother and sister followed her as servants, and made a melancholy part of her attendant train.\n\n\"The sons, as soon as they are of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> a livelihood, are turned out of the family, sometimes with a small present or portion, but more frequently without any thing to support them; and thus reduced, they either endeavour to live by their labour, or, which is more usual, go on board some trading vessel as sailors or as servants, remaining abroad till they have got together some competency, and then return home to marry and to be henpecked. Some few there are who, taking advantage of the Turkish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> through this whimsical custom, who marry their calogrias, and retain to themselves a competent provision: but these are accounted men of a singular and even criminal disposition, and are hated and despised as conformists to Turkish manners, and deserters of their native customs; so that we may suppose they are few indeed who have the boldness to depart from the manners of their country to adopt the customs of their detested masters, and to brave the contempt, the derision, and the hatred, of their neighbours and fellow-citizens.\n\n\"Of all these extraordinary particulars I was informed by the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>, a man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> and of indisputable veracity, who had resided in this island for several years, and who solemnly assured me that every circumstance was true: but indeed our own observation left us without the least room for doubt, and the singular appearance and deportment of the ladies fully evinced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of our friend's relation. In walking through the town, it is easy to perceive, from the whimsical manners of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> passengers, that the women, according to the vulgar phrase, wear the breeches. They frequently stopped us in the streets, examined our dress, interrogated us with a bold and manly air, laughed at our foreign garb and appearance; and showed so little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to that decent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> which is or ought to be the true characteristic of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, that there is every reason to suppose they would, in spite of their haughtiness, be the kindest ladies upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, if they were not strictly watched by the Turks, who are here very numerous, and would be ready to punish any transgression of their ungallant laws with arbitrary fines. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and native manners will often baffle the efforts even of tyranny. In all their customs these manly ladies seem to have changed sexes with the men. The woman rides astride, the man sits sideways upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>; nay, I have been assured that the husband's distinguishing appellation is his wife's family name. The women have town and country houses, in the management of which the husband never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DARES\">dares</a> interfere. Their gardens, their servants, are all their own; and the husband, from every circumstance of his behaviour, appears to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other than his wife's first domestic, perpetually bound to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, and slave to her caprice. Hence it is that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> obtains in the country, that this island was formerly inhabited by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMAZONS\">Amazons</a>; a tradition, however, founded upon no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> that I know of. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAPPHO\">Sappho</a> indeed, the most renowned female that this island has ever produced, is said to have had manly inclinations; in which, as Lucian informs us, she did but conform with the singular manners of her countrywomen: but I do not find that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which she\nshe chose to show these inclinations is imitated by the present female inhabitants, who seem perfectly content with the dear prerogative of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> sway, without endeavouring in any other particular to change the course of nature; yet will this circumstance serve to show, that the women of Lesbos had always something peculiar, and even peculiarly masculine, in their manners and propensities. But be this as it may, it is certain that no country whatsoever can afford a more perfect idea of an Amazonian commonwealth, or better serve to render probable those ancient relations which our manners would induce us to esteem incredible, than this island of Metelin. These lordly ladies are for the most part very handsome in spite of their dress, which is singular and disadvantageous. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">Down</a> to the girdle, which as in the old Grecian garb is raised far above what we usually call the waist, they wear nothing but a shift of thin and transparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUZE\">gauze</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, green, or brown, through which every thing is visible, their breasts only excepted, which they cover with a sort of handkerchief; and this, as we are informed, the Turks have obliged them to wear, while they look upon it as an encumbrance, and as no inconsiderable portion of Turkish tyranny. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">Long</a> sleeves of the same thin material perfectly show their arms even to the shoulder. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> ornaments are chains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a>, to which they hang small pieces of gold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>. Their eyes are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and fine; and the nose, which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Grecian, usually prevails among them, as it does indeed among the women of all these islands. Their complexions are naturally fine; but they spoil them by paint, of which they make abundant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>; and they disfigure their pretty faces by shaving the hinder part of the eyebrow, and replacing it with a straight line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> neatly applied with some sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, the brow being thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in a straight and narrow line till it joins the hair on each side of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>. They are well made, of the middle size, and for the most part plump; but they are distinguished by nothing so much and so universally as by a haughty, disdainful, and supercilious air, with which they seem to look down upon all mankind as creatures of an inferior nature, born for their service, and doomed to be their slaves; neither does this peculiarity of countenance in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> diminish their natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, but rather adds to it that sort of bewitching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> which the French call piquant.\"\n\nHis lordship has been at great pains to investigate the origin of such a singular custom; but is unable to find any other example in history than that of the Lycians, who called themselves by the names of their mothers, and not of their fathers. When asked by their neighbours who they were? they described themselves by their maternal genealogy. If a gentlewoman should marry a slave, the children by that marriage were accounted noble; but should the first man among them marry a foreign woman, the children would be accounted ignoble. This custom is mentioned by several ancient authors. A difficulty of no little magnitude occurs, however, in accounting for the derivation of the inhabitants of Lesbos from the Lycians. This is solved in the following manner: In times of the most remote antiquity, the island of Lesbos was peopled by the Pelasgi, who, under their leader Xanthus, the son of Triopas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARGOS\">Argos</a>, first inhabited Lesbos: previous to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> they had dwelt in a certain part of Lycia which they had conquered; and in this country we may suppose they had learned the custom in question.","sp":736,"ep":738},{"h":"METELLUS","t":"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of the Caecilii at Rome, the most known of whom were\u2014A general who defeated the Achaeans, took Thebes and invaded Macedonnia, &c.\u2014Q.

For those people wondering how a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> should be so much taken with men of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, he palliated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, by saying, that the soul of Euphorbus, i.e., his genius, disposition, and inclinations, were revived in him. And this gave occasion to the report, that Euphorbus's soul, who perished in the Trojan war, had transmigrated into Pythagoras.\n\nFicinus asserts, that what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> speaks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIGRATION\">migration</a> of a human soul into a brute, is intended allegorically, and is to be understood only of the manners, affections, and habits, degenerated into a beastly nature by vice. Serranus, though he allows some force to this interpretation, yet inclines rather to understand the metempsychosis of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a>.\n\nPythagoras is said to have borrowed the notion of a metempsychosis from the Egyptians; others say, from the ancient Brahmans. It is still retained among the Banians and other idolaters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>; and makes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> foundation of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. So extremely are they bigotted to it, that they not only forbear eating any thing that has life, but many of them even refuse to defend themselves from wild beasts. They burn no wood, lest some little animalcule should be in it; and are so very charitable, that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> redeem from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of strangers any animals that they find ready to be killed. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGOREANS\">Pythagoreans</a>.\n\nMetempsychosis (from \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>, and \u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9, cado, \"I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>,\") a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a>, expressing the solar equation, necessary to prevent the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> from happening a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> too late. By which it stands contradistinguished from proempsis, which signifies the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> equation, necessary to prevent the new moon from happening a day too soon.\n\nThe new moons running a little backwards, that is, coming a day too soon at the end of 312 years and a half; by the proempsis, a day is added every 300 years, and another every 2400 years; on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, by the metempsis, a bissextile is suppressed each 134 years; that is, three times in 400 years. These alterations are never made but at the end of each century; that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> being very remarkable, and rendering the practice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a> easy.\n\nThere are three rules for making this addition or suppression of the bissextile day, and, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, for changing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> of the epacts. 1. When there is a metempsis without a proempsis, the next following or lower index must be taken. 2. When there is a proempsis without a metempsis, the next preceding or superior index is to be taken. 3. When there are both a metempsis and a proempsis, or when there is neither the one nor the other, the same index is preserved. Thus, in 1600, we had D; in 1700, by reason of the metempsis, C was taken; in 1800, there was both a proempsis, and a metempsis; so the same index was retained. In 1900, there will be a metempsis again, when B will be taken: which will be preserved in 2000, because there will then be neither the one nor the other. This is as far as we need compute for it: But Clavius has calculated a cycle of 301,800 years; at the end of which period, the same indices return in the same order. See Epact.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METEOR\">Meteor</a>, (by the Greeks called \u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, q.d. sublima or \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> raised;\" by the Latins impressiones, as making signs or impressions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a>), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> denotes any bodies in the air that are of a transitory nature. Hence it is extended to the phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, snow, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>, &c.; but is most commonly confined to those unusual and fiery appearances named falling stars, ignes futui, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">aurora</a> boreales, &c. Sec <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">Meteorology</a>.\n\nMeteorite. This term is derived from the Greek meteoros, a meteor, and \u1f00\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>; and denotes a stony substance, exhibiting peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, and whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> is usually accompanied by the appearance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a> of a fire-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">Luminous</a> meteors have, in all ages, been observed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. It is also well known that their disappearance has frequently been attended with a loud noise; but that they should moreover terminate in the fall of one or more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> bodies to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\">earth's</a> surface, is a position so repugnant to our ordinary conceptions of the tenor of physical events, that we cannot admit it as a fact on slight or scanty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>. With due deference, however, to some philosophers of name, we are not prepared to assert, that it implies impossibility. For who has explored the higher regions of the atmosphere? or who knows what may take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> beyond its precincts? If a solid result from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of two aciform substances, as muriatic acid and ammoniacal gases; if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a>, the properties of which are most familiar to us in the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>, can undergo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIXATION\">fixation</a>, and if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLINE\">crystalline</a> forms, is it too bold to presume, that the same, or similar processes, effected in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABORATORY\">laboratory</a> of the atmosphere, may be within the range of possible occurrences? At all events, the same Being who called into existence those sublime and countless masses of matter which revolve in space, may, to serve purposes unknown to us, create bodies of dimensions infinitely smaller, and destined to impinge on some planetary orb. The reasoning of an angel may not convince us, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> is greater than the whole, or that the value of two and two is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to six; but a very ordinary logician may prove to our satisfaction, that the contact of particles of matter in portions of space which lie beyond our globe, is no chimerical supposition. Every thing around us proclaims, that matter is subject to incessant change. New forms and new modifications are ever springing into being; and can we doubt, that the same particles, as they may happen to be affected or influenced by various circumstances, may exist in the state of gas, of aqueous vapour, or of a concrete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>?\nAgain, it surely will not be seriously maintained, that, from the rarity of a phenomenon, we are warranted to infer its non-existence. The appearance of a comet is a rare, but not a fictitious, occurrence. Nay, we may safely advance a step farther, and assert, without fear of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a>, that the existence of a phenomenon, if otherwise well attested, cannot be disproved by our inability to explain it. How multiplied, in fact, are the subjects, even of our daily and hourly observation, which we cannot satisfactorily expound? We cannot say why a small seed should gradually unfold into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> tree, why <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> should produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, why the hand should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in immediate subervience to the will, or why a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTUSION\">contusion</a> of the brain should induce stupor, alienation of mind, or death. It is one thing to prove a fact, and it is another to account for it.\n\nFrom these premises it follows in course, that we are not entitled to reject the existence of meteoric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, provided it be established by valid testimony. Should the historical evidence, on a fair and dispassionate review, be deemed conclusive, we may afterwards examine the theories which have been proposed for the solution of the appearance.\n\nFrom the Scriptures of the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> we are not aware that any passage can be cited in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> corroboration of the descent of stones from the atmosphere. The ingenious and fanciful Mr Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>, indeed, in his \"Remarks concerning stones said to have fallen from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, both in these days, and in ancient times,\" adverts to the 13th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> of the 18th Psalm\u2014\u201cThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> also thundered out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, and the Highest gave his thunder: hail-stones and coals of fire.\u201d This last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> has, no doubt, been conjectured to denote real hard bodies, in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNITION\">ignition</a>; and the term ant\u0113kais, employed by the cautious Seventy, rather favours such an interpretation. The same expression, however, occurs in the preceding verse, without admitting this interpretation; and the phrase seems to be only a figurative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of describing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>. In the sober latitudes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, and even in colloquial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, we talk of balls of fire and thunderbolts, without any reference to solid matter. Mr King likewise quotes the 11th verse of the 10th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of Joshua\u2014\u201cAnd it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to Beth-horon, that the Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: there were more which died with hail-stones, than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.\u201d Here, the expression, great stones is less equivocal than coals of fire; yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEXT\">context</a> hardly allows us to doubt, that the great stones were really hail-stones, or rather, perhaps, lumps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, consolidated in the atmosphere, such as occasionally fall in hot countries, and such as alarmed the whole of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> and its neighbourhood in 1788. At any rate, the slaughter of the Canaanites is represented as resulting from the special interposition of divine power; and the consideration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> is irrelevant to our present purpose.\n\nIf from sacred, we turn to the early period of profane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, we shall find the annals of public events very copiously interspersed with notices of strange appearances, many of which may be safely ascribed to the ascendancy which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> obtained over the human mind. The scepticism of the learned is, however, sometimes not less injudicious and indiscriminate than the credulity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a>; and he who should resolve every extraordinary event, which is recorded by the writers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome, into a \u201ccunningly devised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>,\u201d would not be less reprehensible for want of candour, than the untutored rustic, who yields his assent to every alleged miracle, is to be taxed with want of discernment.\n\nAlthough these general positions can scarcely admit of dispute, it becomes extremely difficult, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of many ages, and in the collation of marvellous records, to separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> from falsehood. In our attempts to prosecute this analytical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, we may sometimes advance a certain length with perfect security, without being able to trace uniformly the precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of demarcation. Thus, in regard to the topic of our present discussion, we know, that in various periods of the world the vulgar have ascribed a celestial origin to stones of a peculiar configuration, as to certain modifications of pyrites, to telemmites, orthoceratites, &c. which the subsequent observations of naturalists have proved to be of mineral formation, and to the heads of arrows and sharpened flints, which have been fashioned by the hand of man, and which, accordingly, we are authorized to exclude from the ex-terrestrial catalogue. But when substances dissimilar from these, and coinciding in any one character or circumstance with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> specimens of atmospheric stone, are reported by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> to have fallen from the clouds, the distance of ages and the lameness of the documents may powerfully affect our appreciation of the reputed evidence.\n\nWhen, therefore, we shortly touch on a few of the many instances which might be quoted from the annals of antiquity, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> not to vouch for the truth even of these particular instances; but merely to admit their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> which the mention of them may be considered to add to that of subsequent and recent narrations.\n\nThrough the midst of fable which envelopes the history of the betuli, we discern some characters which correspond with those of meteorolites. Thus, in the \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b6\u03b1, a poem falsely ascribed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORPHEUS\">Orpheus</a>, the \u03c3\u03bf\u03b4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd, which M. Falconet properly classes with the betuli, is said to be rough, heavy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>. Damascus, in an extract of his life of Isidorus, preserved by Photius, relates that the betuli fell on Mount Libanus, in a globe of fire. A fragment of Sanchoniathon, preserved in Eusebius, (Prepar. Evangel. i. 10.), moreover informs us, that these stones were fabricated by the god <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-URANUS\">Uranus</a> (or Heaven), one of whose four sons was named Betul. May not this mythological genealogy be regarded as merely emblematical of their descent from the upper regions of the atmosphere? In the same chapter we are told that Astarte found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STAR\">star</a> which had fallen from heaven, and honoured it with consecration in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a>. The stone denominated \u201cthe mother of the gods,\u201d if we can believe Appian, Herodian, and Marcellinus, fell from heaven. Aristodemus, cited by the Greek scholiast on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PINDAR\">Pindar</a>, asserts that it fell encircled by fire, on a hill, at the feet of the Theban bard. It is said to have been of a black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> shape. Herodian (lib. v.) expressly declares, that the Phoenicians had no statue of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, polished by the hand; but only a certain stone, circular below, and terminated\nterminated acutely above, in the form of a cone, of a black colour, and that, according to report, it fell from heaven, and was regarded as the image of the sun.\n\nAmong various instances which might be selected from Livy, is that of a shower of stones on Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBA\">Alba</a>, in the reign of Tullus Hostilius, or about six hundred and fifty-two years before the birth of Christ. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> were told, that it had rained stones, they doubted the fact, and deputed commissioners to inquire into the particulars. They were then assured, that stones had really fallen, haud aliter quam quum grandinem venti glomeratam in terras agitat. On this occasion, the historian mentions, that similar events were celebrated by a festival of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> days. Mansit solenne, ut quondamcunque idem prodigium nuntiaretur, feriae per novem dies agerentur.\n\nBut one of the most remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> which occurs in the records of antiquity, is that which is mentioned in the 58th chapter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> book of Pliny's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> History, of a large stone which fell near \u00c9gospotamos, in Thrace, in the second year of the seventy-eighth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIAD\">Olympiad</a>, or, according to our chronology, about four hundred and sixty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years before the Christian era. Pliny assures us, that this extraordinary mass was still shown in his day; and that it was as large as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a>, and of a burnt colour. The Greeks pretended that it had fallen from the sun, and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANAXAGORAS\">Anaxagoras</a> had predicted the day of its arrival on the earth's surface. According to Plutarch, in the life of Lysander, the inhabitants of the Chersonesus held the Thracian stone in great veneration, and exhibited it as a public show. His account of its first appearance is chiefly extracted from the relation of Daimachus of Plat\u00e6a, and may be thus translated. \"During seventy-five successive days before the stone fell, a large fiery body, like a cloud of flame, was observed in the heavens, not fixed to one point, but wandering about with a broken irregular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. By its violent agitation, several fiery fragments were forced from it, impelled in various directions, and darted with the velocity and brightness of so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> stars. After this body had fallen on the Chersonesus, and the people had assembled to examine it, they could find no inflammable matter; nor the slightest trace of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a>, but a real stone, which, though large, by no means corresponded to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a> of the flaming globe which they had seen in the sky, but seemed to be only a piece detached from it.\" Daimachus, it is true, may, on this occasion, have given way to his reputed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of the marvellous; and we can easily believe that the seventy-five continuous days are either an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of the copyist, or an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> exaggeration; yet, from the marked coincidence of some of the circumstances with those more fully detailed in the sequel, there arises the presumption that a meteorolite really fell at the place and period above assigned.\n\nFrom this period till near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the fifteenth century, any historical notices which we have been enabled to collect, are so vague and scanty, that, in this abridged view of the subject, we may pass them over in silence.\n\nProfessor Bantenschoen, of the central school of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLMAR\">Colmar</a>, first directed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of naturalists to some of the old chronicles, which commemorate with much naivet\u00e9, and in the true spirit of the times, the fall of the celebrated stone of Ensisheim. The following account accompanied this very singular mass, when it was suspended in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>.\n\n\"In the year of the Lord 1492, on Wednesday, which was Martinmas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVE\">eve</a>, the 7th of November, there happened a singular miracle: for, between eleven o'clock and noon, there was a loud peal of thunder, and a prolonged confused noise, which was heard to a great distance, and a stone fell from the air, in the jurisdiction of Ensisheim, which weighed 265 pounds, and the confused noise was, moreover, much louder than here. There a child <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it strike on a field, situated in the upper jurisdiction, towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a> and Inn, near the district of Gisgard, which was sown with wheat, and did it no harm, except that it made a hole there; and then they conveyed it from that spot; and many pieces were broken from it, which the landvoigt forbade. They, therefore, caused it to be placed in the church, with the intention of suspending it as a miracle; and many people came hither to see this stone. So there were remarkable conversations about this stone: but the learned said, that they knew not what it was; for it was beyond the ordinary course of nature, that such a large mass should smite the earth from the height of the air; but that it was really a miracle of God; for, before that time, never any thing was heard like it, nor seen, nor described. When the people found that stone, it had entered into the earth, to the depth of a man's stature, which every body explained to be the will of God, that it should be found, and the noise of it was heard at Lucerne, at Villing, and in many other places, so loud, that it was believed that houses had been overturned: And as the king (Maximilian) was here, the Monday after St Catherine's day, of the same year, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> excellence ordered the stone which had fallen to be brought to the castle, and after having conversed a long time about it with the noblemen, he said the people of Ensisheim should take it, and order it to be hung up in the church, and not allow any body to take any thing from it. However, his excellency took two pieces of it, of which he kept one, and sent the other to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> Sigismund of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>; and they spoke a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> about this stone, which they suspended in the choir, where it still is; and a great many people came to see it.\"\n\nTrithemius, in his Hirsauensian Annals, employs language to this effect.\u2014\"In the same year, on the 7th day of November, in the village of Suntgaw, near the townlet of Ensisheim, not far from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a>, a city of Germany, a stone, called a thunder-stone, of a prodigious size, for we know from eye-witnesses that it weighed 255 pounds, fell from the heavens. Its fall was so violent, that it broke into two pieces. The most considerable is still exhibited at the door of the church of Ensisheim, suspended by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> chain, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the fact which we have mentioned, and to preserve it in the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>.\"\u2014We learn also from Paul Lang that there arose a furious storm on the 7th of November 1492, and that while the thunder roared, and the heavens appeared all on fire, a stone of enormous size fell near Ensisheim. Its form was that of the Greek delta, with a triangular point. They still show it at Ensisheim as an astonishing phenomenon.\"\n\nIt is worthy of observation, that these chroniclers lived at the period which they assign to the descent of\nthe stone; and that, though their names are hastening to oblivion, Trithemius yielded to few of his contemporaries in labour and learning; while Lang, a German Benedictine as he was, travelled in search of historical monuments, arraigned the license of the catholic clergy, and applauded the independence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a> and Melancthon.\n\nOf the Ensisheim stone, which has been transported to the national library at Colmar, and which, notwithstanding various dilapidations, stills weighs 150 pounds, some interesting specimens may now be seen in the cabinets of the curious. Robert Ferguson, Esq. younger of Raith, has, in the most polite and obliging manner, gratified us with the sight of a small fragment, which belongs to his valuable collection of minerals at Raith <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIFESHIRE\">Fifeshire</a>, Scotland.\n\nWe are fully aware, that M. Barthold has laboured to convince his readers (Journal de Physique, Ventose, year 8.) that the far-famed mass of Ensisheim is merely argillo-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FERRUGINOUS\">ferruginous</a>, of secondary formation, detached from an adjacent mountain, and conveyed to the spot on which it was found by some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>. In this opinion, we might partially acquiesce, did not the artlessness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> and concurring records militate against it, and had not the more accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of Vauquelin detected the same constituent parts as in the other stone and metalline substances denominated meteoric. \"It is certainly composed of silica,\" observes this celebrated chemist, \"of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a>, of iron, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICKEL\">nickel</a>, of sulphur, and of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of lime.\u2014Particular trials have convinced me of the presence of sulphur and nickel in the grains of malleable iron, and in the pyrites, though in different proportions. This stone, then, in every respect, resembles others which have fallen from the atmosphere.\"\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMENTARY\">Commentary</a> of Surius, a Carthusian monk of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOGNE\">Cologne</a>, mention is made of a shower of large stones in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOMBARDY\">Lombardy</a>, in 1510. These stones were harder than flint, and smelled of sulphur. The heaviest weighed 120 pounds. The same event is more particularly related by Cardan, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> intitled de Rerum Varieitate (lib. xiv. c. 72.). According to this author, near the river Adda, not far from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>, and at five o'clock in the evening, about 1120 stones fell from the air, one of them weighing 120 pounds and another 60 pounds. Many were presented to the French governor, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a>. At three o'clock P.M. the sky appeared as if in a general blaze; and the passage, though somewhat ambiguous, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to infer, that the meteor was visible for two hours. Like many of the learned and unlearned of his day, Cardan instantly connects the extraordinary appearance with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> transactions of his district.\n\nWe next pass to an interesting extract from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Jehangire, written in Persian, by himself, and translated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Kirkpatrick.\n\n\"A.H. 1030, or 16th year of the reign.\u2014The following is among the extraordinary occurrences of this period.\n\n\"Early on the 30th of Furverdeen of the present Metronyear (1629), and in the eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the heavens, there arose in one of the villages of the purgunnah of Jalindher, such a great and tremendous noise, as had nearly, by its dreadfull nature, deprived the inhabitants of the place of their senses. During this noise, a luminous body was observed to fall from above, on the earth, suggesting to the beholders the idea that the firmament was raining fire. In a short time, the noise having subsided, and the inhabitants having recovered from their alarm, a courier was dispatched to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAHOMMED\">Mahommed</a> Syced, the amul of the aforesaid purgunnah, to advertise him of this event. The amul, instantly mounting his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, proceeded to the spot. Here he perceived the earth, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of a dozen of yards in length and breadth, to be burned to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that not the least trace of verdure, or a blade of grass remained; nor had the heat yet subsided entirely.\n\n\"Mahommed Syced hereupon directed the aforesaid space of ground to be dug up; when the deeper it was dug, the greater was the heat of it found to be. At length a lump of iron made its appearance, the heat of which was so violent, that one might have supposed it to have been taken from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>. After some time it became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>: when the amul conveyed it to his own habitation, from whence he afterwards dispatched it in a sealed bag to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>.\n\n\"Here I had this substance weighed in my presence. Its weight was 160 tolahs (A). I committed it to a skilful artisan, with orders to make of it a sabre, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, and a dagger. The workman reported, that the substance was not malleable, but shivered into pieces under the hammer.\n\n\"Upon this I ordered it to be mixed with other iron. Conformably to my orders, three parts of the iron of lightning (B) were mixed with one part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> iron; and from the mixture were made two sabres, one knife, and one dagger.\"\n\nOur limits will not permit us to give the whole of the extract, nor the remarks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">Right</a> Hon. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Greville and Colonel Kirkpatrick, which were read before the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, on the 27th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, 1803. We feel, however, no hesitation in attaching to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCUMENT\">document</a> something very nearly approaching to direct evidence of the fact in question.\n\nThe celebrated Gassendi relates, that, on the 27th of November, 1627, about 10 o'clock A.M. during a very clear sky, he saw a flaming stone, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> diameter of four feet, fall on Mount Vaison, an eminence situated between the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> of Perie and Guillaumes, in Provence. This stone was surrounded by a luminous circle of different colours, nearly resembling the rainbow, and its fall was accompanied with a noise like the discharge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>. It weighed 59 pounds; and its specific gravity was to that of common marble as 14 to 11. It was of a dark metallic colour, and extremely hard. Though it was not subjected to chemical analysis, and is not now to be found, the circumstances which have been stated by the philosopher are sufficiently\n\n(A) A tolah is about 180 grains, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TROY_WEIGHT\"><a class=\"x</a>ref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a> weight.\n(B) This expression is equivalent to our term thunder-bolt.\nsufficiently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> to operate on the conviction of those who are willing to be convinced.\n\nFrom a curious book printed at Paris in 1672, and now become very scarce, entitled Conversations tir\u00e9es de l'Acad\u00e9mie de M. l'Abb\u00e9 Bourdelot, contenant diverses recherches et observations physiques, par le Sieur Legallons, we make the ensuing extract.\n\n\"A member presents a fragment of two stones which fell near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERONA\">Verona</a>, one of which weighed 300, and the other 200 pounds. These stones,\" says he, \"fell during the night, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> was perfectly mild and serene. They seemed to be all on fire, and came from above, but in a slanting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, and with a tremendous noise. This prodigy terribly alarmed 300 or 400 eye-witnesses, who were at a loss what to think of it. These stones fell with such rapidity, that they formed a ditch, in which, after the noise had ceased, the spectators ventured to approach them, and examine them more closely. They then sent them to Verona, where they were deposited in the Academy, and that learned body sent fragments of them to different places.\"\n\nThat which accompanied the above intimation was of a yellowish hue, very easily pulverised, and smelled of sulphur.\u2014In the course of examining one of these stones, M. Laugier, professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHARMACY\">pharmacy</a> at Paris, has recently detected the presence of chrome, by means of the caustic alkali.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of the Verona phenomenon, if we have been correctly informed, is 1663.\n\nIn the Borian collection there is a substance which is designated Ferrum retractorium, granulis nitentibus matrice virescenti immixtis (Ferrum vires Lin.), cujus fragmenta <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> unius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AD\">ad</a> viginti usque librarum pondus, cortice nigro scoriaco circumdata, ad Placan, prope Tabor, circuiti Belchimensis Bohemiae, possim repertur. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> is subjoined: (Quae fragmenta 3 Juli anni 1753, inter tonitrua, \u00e8 celo pluisse creduliores quidam assurunt). The expression creduliores quidam, it may be alleged, at once destroys the evidence of this memorandum. It deserves, however, to be noted, that, in regard to our present subject, what was formerly accounted the credulity of the vulgar, may now, on several occasions, be construed into probability, if not into matter of fact; and that Mr Greville has found the identical fragment to have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> with other meteoric stones. Hence, we are compelled either to admit its extra-terrestrial origin, or the existence of a substance, originally belonging to the earth, and yet agreeing in character with those deemed atmospheric. The former part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> is perfectly consonant with well-authenticated facts; whereas of the latter, we are not warranted to pronounce, that a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> has hitherto been established to the satisfaction of any chemist or mineralogist.\n\nBut we have now to turn our attention to a report of M. de la Lande, inserted in the Historical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALMANACK\">Almanack</a> of Bresse, for 1756.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of September 1753, about one o'clock P.M. when the weather was very hot, and very serene, without the least appearance of a cloud, a very loud noise, like the discharge of two or three cannons, was heard within the circumference of six leagues, but was of very short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. This noise was loudest in the neighbourhood of Pont-de-Vesle; and at Liponas, a village three leagues from the last-mentioned place, it was even accompanied with a hissing, like that of a Meteocracker. On the same evening there were found at Lipeonas and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">Pin</a>, two blackish masses, of a form nearly circular, but very uneven, which had fallen on ploughed ground, and sunk, by their own weight, to half a foot below the surface. One of them weighed about twenty pounds; and a fragment of one of them weighing 114 lb. was preserved in the cabinet of M. Varenne de Becon, at Dijon. The basis of these masses resembled a grayish whinstone, and was very refractory; and some ferruginous particles were disseminated in grains, filaments, or minute masses, through the substance of the stone, especially in its fissures. This iron, when subjected to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> heat, became obedient to the magnet. The black coating on the surface, M. de la Lande attributes to fusion, induced by violent heat. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>'s acknowledged respectability and accuracy of observation, combined with the circumstances which he has adduced, circumstances, too, which, if misstated, lay so open to public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, powerfully plead in favour of his testimony.\n\nOn the 15th of September 1760, according to the abb\u00e9 Bachelay, about half past four o'clock P.M. there appeared near the chateau de Chevabrie, in the neighbourhood of Luce, a small town of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAINE\">Maine</a>, a stormy cloud, from which proceeded a loud peal of thunder, like the discharge of cannon, and followed by a noise which was mistaken by several people for the lowing of oxen. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> was heard over a space of about two leagues and a half, but unaccompanied by any perceptible flame. The reapers in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIGUEUX\">Perigueux</a>, about three leagues from Luce, on hearing the same noise, looked up, and saw an opake body, which described a curve, and fell on soft turf, on the high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> from Mons, near which they were at work. They all quickly ran up to it, and found a sort of stone, nearly half of which was buried in the earth, and the whole so hot that it could not be touched. At first they ran away in a panic; but on returning to the spot some time after, they found the stone precisely in the same situation, and sufficiently cooled to admit of being handled, and narrowly examined. It weighed seven ounces and a half, and was of a triangular form, presenting, as it were, three rounded horns, one of which, at the moment of the fall, had entered into the ground, and was of a gray or ash colour, while the rest, which was exposed to the air, was very black. When the abb\u00e9 presented this stone to the academy, that body appointed three of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, namely, Messieurs Lavosier, Fougeroux, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADET\">Cadet</a>, to examine and analyse it. This task they performed with more care and accuracy than M. de la Lande had done on the preceding occasion; but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> was confined to an integral part of the whole, considered as a homogeneous substance, in place of being repeated on each of the constituent parts. The substance was of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> cinereous hue, speckled with an infinite number of small and shining metallic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, visible through a magnifying glass. That part of the outer surface which remained above ground was incrustated with a thin black coating, which seemed to have undergone fusion, and which gave a few sparks when struck with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>. The specific gravity of the mass was 3535.\u2014Two other stones, nearly of the same characters, the one reported to have fallen at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIRE\">Aire</a>, in Artois, and the\nthe other in the Cotentin, in Normandy, were presented to the academy in the course of the same year by M. Gurson de Boyaval, honorary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>-general of the bailiwick of Aire, and the younger M. Morand. According to the academical report, these three stones, when compared, presented no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> to the eye, were of the same colour, and nearly of the same grain, exhibiting metallic and pyritous particles, and covered with a black and ferruginous incrustation. Although the coincidence of facts and circumstances, in three places so remote from one another, did not convince the academy that these stones had been conveyed to the earth by lightning, yet it induced them to invite naturalists to prosecute the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the subject.\n\nOn the 29th of November 1768, a stone fell at Mauerkirchen near the Inn, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>, that weighed 38lb. was of a triangular form, and only eight inches in thickness. Its fall was accompanied by a hissing noise, and great darkness in the atmosphere. This meteorite penetrated two feet and a half into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. Part of it is in the cabinet of the right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> Charles Greville, which is now in the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>; and a fragment may be seen in Mr Ferguson's collection quoted above.\n\nThe next remarkable case on record occurred on the 20th of August 1789, at Barbotan, near Roquefort, in the Landes of Bordeaux, and is thus related by Citizen Lomet, who was known to several members of the Institute, and happened to be at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGEN\">Agen</a> when the meteor appeared.\n\n\"It was a very bright fire-ball, luminous as the sun, of the size of an ordinary balloon, and, after inspiring the inhabitants with consternation, burst and disappeared. A few days after, some peasants brought stones, which they said fell from the meteor; but the philosophers to whom they offered them laughed at their assertions as fabulous. The peasants would have now more reason to laugh at the philosophers.\"\u2014One of these stones broke through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of a cottage, and killed a herdsman and some cattle. Vauquelin, who received a proces-verbal of the circumstances, also examined one of the specimens. The fragment procured by Mr Ferguson has visibly all the characters of a genuine meteorite.\n\nA much more remarkable phenomenon, however, of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, occurred near Agen, on the 24th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1790. An inhabitant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ST_SEVER\">St Sever</a> communicates the following particulars to M. Darcey the chemist, who was then resident at Paris.\n\n\"Our towns-people were yesterday very much alarmed. About a quarter past nine o'clock, in the evening, there suddenly appeared in the air a fire-ball, dragging a long train, which diffused a very vivid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> over the horizon. This meteor soon disappeared, and seemed to fall at one hundred paces from us. It was quickly followed by an explosion louder than that of a cannon or of thunder. Every body dreaded being buried under the ruins of his house, which seemed to give way from the concussion. The same phenomenon was seen, and the report heard, in the neighbouring towns, as Mont de Marsan, Tartas, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAX\">Dax</a>. The weather in other respects was very calm, without a breath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> or a cloud, and the moon shone in all her brightness.\"\n\nM. Darcey's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, a clergyman in that part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, sent him a small stone, which was picked up on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> after the explosion, and the history of which he was scrupulously anxious to investigate. Being satisfied with respect to all the particulars, he at length dispatched it to Paris, accompanied with some curious remarks. \"When these stones fell,\" says he, \"they had not their present degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>. Some of them fell on straw, bits of which stuck to the stones, and incorporated with them. I have seen one in this predicament. It is at present at La Bastide; but I cannot persuade the owner to part with it***. Those which fell on the houses produced a noise, not like that of stones, but rather of a substance which had not yet acquired compactness.\"\n\nWe subjoin the proces-verbal\u2014a simple but authentic document.\n\n\"In the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety, and the 30th day of the month of August, we, the Sieur Jean Duby, mayor, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> Mauillon, procurator of the commune of the municipality of La Grange de Juillae, and Jean Darmite, resident in the parish of La Grange de Juillac, certify in truth and verity, that, on Saturday the 24th of July last, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, there passed a great fire, and after it we heard in the air a very loud and extraordinary noise; and, about two minutes after, there fell stones from heaven, but fortunately there fell only a very few, and they fell about ten paces from one another in some places, and in others nearer, and finally, in some other places, farther, and falling, most of them, of the weight of about half a quarter of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> each; some of about half a pound, like that found in our parish of La Grange; and on the borders of the parish of Creon, they were found of a pound weight; and in falling they seemed not to be inflamed, but very hard and black without, and within of the colour of steel; and, thank God, they occasioned no harm to the people, nor the trees, but only to some trees which were broken on the houses; and most of them fell gently, and others fell quickly, with a hissing noise; and some were found which had entered into the earth, but very few. In witness whereof we have written and signed these presents.\n\n(Signed) Duby, Mayor\u2014Darmite.\"\n\nMonsieur Baudin mentions, that, as M. Carr\u00e9 of Barbotan and he were walking in the court of the castle of Mornes about half past nine o'clock, in the evening of the 24th of July 1790, when the air was perfectly calm, and the sky cloudless, they found themselves suddenly surrounded by a pale clear light, which obscured that of the moon, though the latter was nearly full. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> up, they observed, almost in their zenith, a fireball of a larger apparent diameter than that of the moon, dragging a tail, which seemed to be five or six times longer than the diameter of its body, and which gradually tapered to a point, the latter approaching to blood-red, though the rest of the meteor was of a pale <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>. This luminous body proceeded with great velocity from south to north, and in two seconds split into portions of considerable size, like the fragments of a bursting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOMB\">bomb</a>. These fragments became extinguished in the air, and some of them, as they fell, assumed that deep red colour, which had been observed at the point of the tail. Two or three minutes after M. Baudin and his friend heard a dreadful explosion, like the simultaneous firing of several pieces of ordnance; but they were not sensible of any tremulous motion under their feet, though the concus-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SION\">sion</a> of the atmosphere shook the windows in their frames, and threw down <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> utensils from their shelves. When these gentlemen removed to the garden, the noise still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, and seemed to be directly over their heads. Some time after it had ceased, they heard a hollow sound rolling, in echoes, for fifty miles, along the chain of the Pyrenees, and at the end of about four minutes gradually dying away in distance.\n\nAt the same time, a strong sulphureous odour was diffused in the atmosphere. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> which occurred between the disruption of the meteor, and the loud report, induced M. Baudin to conjecture, that this fireball must have been at least eight miles from the earth's surface, and that it fell about four miles from Mormes.\n\n\"The latter part of my conjecture, says he, was soon confirmed by an account which we received of a great many stones having fallen from the atmosphere at Juillac and in the neighbourhood of Barbotan.\" It appears, indeed, from the concurring testimony of intelligent persons worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, that the meteor really exploded at a little distance from Juillac, and that its fragments were found lying in an almost circular space, of nearly two miles in diameter. Some of them weighed eighteen or twenty, and a few, it is alleged, even fifty pounds. M. de Carris procured one of 18 lbs., which he transmitted to the Parisian Academy of Sciences. That examined by M. Baudin was small, but heavy in proportion to its size, black on the outside, grayish within, and interspersed with many minute, shining, metallic particles. These last circumstances perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> with the fragment of a Barbotan stone preserved in Mr Ferguson's collection.\n\nIn one of his letters to Professor St Amand, M. Goyon d'Arzas remarks, that these stones, though generally smooth on the outside, presented some longitudinal cracks, or fissures, while their interior parts exhibited symptoms of metallic veins, especially of a ferruginous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>. When yet red hot, and scattered in various directions, they formed that magnificent fire-work, that shower of flame, which enlightened the horizon over a large tract of country; for this extraordinary meteor was seen at Bayonne, Auch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PAU\">Pau</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TARBES\">Tarbes</a>, and even at Bordeaux and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOULOUSE\">Toulouse</a>. At the last-mentioned place it excited little attention, on account of its great distance, and its appearing only a little brighter than a shooting star. It, moreover, deserves to be noted, that the meteorites in question were found on a bare moor, of an extremely thin soil, on which no such stones, or indeed stones of any description, had been observed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of man. They who are solicitous of additional information on this part of our subject, may consult No. 23 and 24 of the Journal des Sciences Utiles of Montpelier, for 1790, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECADE\">Decade</a> Philosophique for February 1796.\n\nWhen all the circumstances of the case are duly considered, we need not be surprised, that they should produce conviction on the minds of many men of science, who, till then, possessed \"an evil heart of unbelief.\" M. de St Amand ingenuously confessed to M. Picot of Geneva, that he had treated this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVEL\">novel</a> topic with unmerited contempt, and that the evidence deduced from the similar characters of the stones should not be rashly rejected. The learned and the unlearned of the district in which the phenomenon is stated to have occurred, attest its existence; the professor of natural history in the central school of Agen renounces his former scepticism; Vauquelin analyses a specimen, and finds it to contain the same chemical substances as other meteorites, and in nearly the same proportions; and shall we be so unreasonable as to withhold our assent, merely because we have not ocular demonstration of the alleged particulars?\n\nOur chronological <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of cases has now brought us to the fall of several meteorites near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIENNA\">Sienna</a>, the particulars of which, as reported by the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a> and Sir William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, are recorded in the first part of the Philosophical Transactions for 1795 (page 103). Mr King, likewise in the tract which we have already quoted, communicates some interesting circumstances relative to this phenomenon, chiefly extracted from an account of it published by Professor Soldani. While we refer our readers to these details, we cannot omit mentioning that, in regard to aspect and composition, the Sienna stones are perfectly analogous to others already noticed, and very different from any that occur in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a>. As the meteor from which they were discharged appeared on the morning after a violent eruption of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESUVIUS\">Vesuvius</a>, they were at first supposed to be volcanic, till cool reflection and examination betrayed the extravagance of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>. The precise number of stones which were collected on this occasion is not specified, but many of them were small, weighing from a quarter of an ounce to two ounces. A pretty entire specimen occurs in Mr Ferguson's collection.\u2014The date of the Sienna meteor is the 16th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, 1794.\n\nOn the 13th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> of the following year, about three o'clock in the afternoon, another of these singular stones, weighing 56 pounds, fell near the country house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Topham, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>. The captain's report, which is inserted in the Gentleman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> for 1796, is distinct and satisfactory; while the chemical examination of the mass, detailed in Mr Howard's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1822, affords a still more decisive proof of its atmospheric origin. M. de Dr\u00e9e, also found it to correspond exactly in aspect and character, with fragments of meteor stones from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENARES\">Benares</a> and Ville-franche. The original mass is in the possession of Mr Sowerby author of English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a>, &c. It is larger than a man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>.\n\nMr Southey, in his letters from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, transcribes the authenticated relation of another instance of the descent of a stone from the clouds on the 19th of February 1796. But we pass to some of the most important details relative to the stone which is affirmed to have fallen near Ville-franche, in the department of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RHONE\">Rhone</a>, on the 12th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, 1798. When it was transmitted to Professor Sage, member of the National Institute, he considered it at first, as only a pyritous and magnetical ore of iron, although it bore no resemblance to any known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of ore of that metal, since it contained nickel, silica, magnesia, and native iron, which shone like steel when polished. \"It is of an ash gray colour, says M. Sage, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a> and speckled with gray, shining, and pyritous metallic points. One of its surfaces is covered with a dingy black enamel, about the third of a line in thickness. This stone acts very powerfully on the magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>. When the senator Chasset transmitted it to me, it\nwas accompanied with an historical notice of similar import with that of M. Delievre, of Ville-franche, who saw and described the phenomenon on the spot.\"\n\nAt six o'clock in the evening, a round body, which diffused the most vivid light, was observed in the vicinity of Ville-franche, moving westward, and producing a hissing, like that of a bomb which traverses the air. This luminous body, which was seen at the same time at Lyons and on Mont-Cenis, marked its path by a red track of fire, and exploded, about 200 toises from the earth with a tremendous report and concussion. One of the flaming fragments fell on the vineyard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Crepier, an inhabitant of Sales. On the spot where this portion of the meteor was seen to fall, and in a fresh opening of about 25 inches in depth, and 18 in width, was found a black mass, 15 inches in diameter, and rounded on one side.\n\nAn account of the same meteor was published in the Journal de Physique, for Floreal, year 11, by M. de Dv\u00e9e. From his minute and deliberate investigation, it appears that the fire-ball had scarcely fixed the attention of the inhabitants of Sales and the adjacent villages, when its rapid approach, accompanied by a terrible whizzing noise, like that of an irregular hollow body, traversing the air with unusual velocity, inspired the whole commune with alarm, especially when they observed it passing over their heads, at an inconsiderable elevation. It left behind a long train of light, and emitted, with an almost unceasing craekling, small vivid flames, like little stars. Its fall was remarked, at the distance of only 50 paces, by three labourers, one of whom, named Montillard, let fall his coat and bundle of sticks that he might run the faster, while the other two, Chardon and Lapoces, fled with equal precipitation to Sales, where the alarm had become general.\u2014These three witnesses attest the astonishing rapidity of the meteor's motion, and the hissing which proceeded from the spot where it fell. So terrified was Crepier at the explosion, that he locked himself up with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, first in his cellar, and then in his private apartment, nor ventured abroad till next morning, when, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of M. Blandel, Chardon, Lapoces, and many others, he repaired to the opening which had been made by the fire ball. At the bottom of this opening, which was 18 inches deep, including the entire thickness of the mould, they found a large black mass, of an irregularly ovoid form, having a fanciful resemblance to a calf's head. Though no longer hot, it smelled of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-powder and was cracked in several places. When the observers broke it, and discovered nothing but stone, indifference succeeded to curiosity, and they coolly ascribed its appearance to causes more or less whimsical and supernatural.\n\nThe original weight of this stone was about twenty pounds. Its black vitrified surface gave fire with steel. Its interior was hard, earthy, ash-coloured, of a granular texture, presenting different substances scattered through it, namely, iron in grains, from the smallest size to a line or even more in diameter, somewhat malleable, but harder and whiter than forged iron; white pyrites, both lamellated and granular, and in colour approaching to nickel; some gray globules, which seemed to present the characters of trapp, and a very few and small particles of steatites, inclining to an olive hue. On account of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> composition, its specific gravity could not be easily ascertained. One hundred parts of the mass gave, according to Vauquelin, 46 of silica, 38 oxide of iron, 15 magnesia, 2 nickel, and 2 lime. The excess of this result was ascribed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of oxygen by the native iron during the process. A small specimen of this mass belongs to Mr. Ferguson's collection.\n\nOn the 19th of December 1798, about eight o'clock in the evening, the inhabitants of Benares and its neighbourhood observed in the heavens a very luminous meteor, in the form of a large ball of fire, which exploded with a loud noise, and from which a number of stones were precipitated near Krakhut, a village about fourteen miles from the city of Benares. Mr Davis, the judge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> of the district affirmed that its brilliancy equalled the brightest moonlight. Both he and Mr Erskine, the assistant collector, were induced to send persons in whom they could confide to the spot where this shower of stones was asserted to have taken place, and thus obtained additional evidence of the phenomenon, and several of the stones, which had penetrated about six inches into fields recently watered. Mr Maclane, a gentleman who resided near Krakhut, presented Mr Howard with part of a stone, which had been brought to him the morning after its descent, by the watchman who was on duty at his house, and through the roof of whose hut it had passed, and buried itself several inches in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, which was of consolidated earth. Before it was broken, it must have weighed upwards of two pounds.\n\nAt the time that this meteor appeared, the sky was perfectly serene; not the smallest vestige of a cloud had been seen since the 11th of the month, nor was any observed for many days after.\n\n\"Of these stones (says Mr Howard), I have seen eight nearly perfect, besides parts of several others, which had been broken by the possessors, to distribute among their friends. The form of the more perfect ones appeared to be that of an irregular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>, rounded off at the edges; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> were to be observed on most of them. They were of various sizes, from about three to upwards of four inches in their largest diameter; one of them, measuring four inches and a quarter, weighed two pounds twelve ounces. In appearance they were exactly similar; externally they were covered with a hard black coat, or incrustation, which in some parts had the appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> or bitumen; and on most of them were fractures, which, from their being covered with a matter similar to that of the coat, seemed to have been made in the fall, by the stones striking against each other, and to have passed through some medium, probably an intense heat, previous to their reaching the earth. Internally they consisted of a number of small spherical bodies, of a slate colour, imbedded in a whitish gritty substance, interspersed with bright shining spiculae, of a metallic or pyritical nature. The spherical bodies were much harder than the rest of the stone: the white gritty part readily crumbled, on being rubbed with a hard body; and on being broken, a quantity attached itself to the magnet, but more particularly the outside coat or crust, which appeared almost wholly attractable by it.\"\n\nHere we are furnished with another circumstantial and authenticated narrative, by individuals above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>\nrank of suspicion, and who were prompted solely by motives of curiosity, to examine with due deliberation the particulars which they have reported.\n\nThe history of the extraordinary shower of stones which fell near l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIGLE\">Aigle</a>, in Normandy, on the 26th of April 1823, first appeared in the ensuing artless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, addressed by M. Marais, an inhabitant of the place, to his friend in Paris.\n\n\"At l'Aigle, the 13th Flor\u00e9al, 11.\n\n\"An astonishing miracle has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> occurred in our district. Here it is, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>, addition, or diminution. It is certain, that it is the truth itself.\n\n\"On Friday last, 6th Flor\u00e9al (26th April), between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, we were roused by a murmuring noise like thunder. On going out we were surprised to see the sky pretty clear, with the exception of some small clouds. We took it for the noise of a carriage, or of fire in the neighbourhood. We were then in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a>, to examine whence the noise proceeded, when we observed all the inhabitants of the Pont de Pierre at their windows, and in gardens, inquiring concerning a cloud, which passed in the direction of from south to north, and from whence the noise issued, although that cloud presented nothing extraordinary in its appearance. But great was our astonishment when we learned, that many and large stones had fallen from it, some of them weighing ten, eleven, and even seventeen pounds, in the space between the house of the Buat family (half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> to the north-north-east of l'Aigle) and Glos, passing by St Nicolas, St Pierre, &c. which struck us at first as a fable, but which was afterwards found to be true.\n\n\"The following is the explanation given of this extraordinary event by all who witnessed it.\n\n\"They heard a noise like that of a cannon, then a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> report still louder than the preceding, followed by a rumbling noise, which lasted about ten minutes, the same which we also heard, accompanied with hisings, caused by these stones, which were counteracted in their fall by the different currents of air, which is very natural in the case of such a sudden expansion. Nothing more was heard; but it is remarkable, that previously to the explosion, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> fowls were alarmed, and the cows bellowed in an unusual manner. All the country-folks were much dismayed, especially the women, who believed that the end of the world was at hand. A labourer at la Sap\u00e9e fell prostrate on the ground, exclaiming, 'Good God! is it possible that thou canst make me perish thus? <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARDON\">Pardon</a>, I beseech thee, all the faults I have committed,' &c. The most trifling objects in fact, might create alarm, for it is not improbable, that history offers no example of such a shower of stones as this. The piece which I send was detached from a large one, weighing eleven pounds, which was found between the house of the Buats and le Fertey. It is said, that a collector of curiosities purchased one of seventeen pounds weight, that he might send it to Paris. Every body in this part of the country is desirous of possessing a whole stone, or a fragment of one, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of curiosity. The largest were darted with such violence that they entered at least a foot into the earth. They are black on the outside, and grayish, as you see, within, seeming to contain some species of metal and nitre. If you know before us of what ingredients they are composed, you will inform us. One fell near M. Bois de la Ville, who lives near Glos. He was much afraid, and took shelter under a tree. He has found a great number of them of different sizes, in his court-yard, his wheat field, &c. without reckoning all those which the peasants have found elsewhere. Numberless stories, more or less absurd, have been circulated among the people. You know that our country is fertile in such tales. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUSIN\">Cousin</a> Moutardier sends one of these stones to Mademoiselle H\u00e9bert; and he is not less eager than we are, to know how these substances can be compressed and petrified in the air. Do try to explain the process.\n\n\"The person who gave me the largest stone which I send to you, went to take it at the moment that it fell, but it was so hot that it burned him. Several of his neighbours shared the same fate in attempting to lift it.\n\n\"The elder Buat has just arrived, and desires us to add, that a fire-ball was observed to hover over the meadow. Perhaps it was wild-fire.\"\n\nAt the sitting of the Institute, on the 9th of May, Fourcroy read a letter, addressed from l'Aigle to Vauquelin, and which sufficiently corroborates the preceding statements. But we pass to the substance of M. Biot's letter, addressed to the minister of the interior, and published in the Journal des D\u00e9bats, (14th Thermidor, year 11.). The writer who is advantageously known for his scientific attainments, was deputed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> to repair to the spot, and collect all the authentic facts. The contents of his letter have been since expanded into the form of a memoir, which manifests the caution and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> which guided his inquiries, and which we are surprised to learn, has not appeared in an English translation.\n\nM. Biot left Paris on the 25th of June, and in place of proceeding directly to l'Aigle, went first to Alen\u00e7on, which lies fifteen leagues to the west-south-west of it. He was informed on his way, that a globe of fire had been observed moving towards the north, and that its appearance was followed by a violent explosion. From Alen\u00e7on he journeyed through various villages to l'Aigle, being directed in his progress by the accounts of the inhabitants, who had all heard the explosion on the day and at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> specified. Almost all the inhabitants of twenty hamlets, scattered over an extent of upwards of two leagues <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> affirmed that they were eye-witnesses of a dreadful shower of stones which was darted from the meteor. The following is his summary of the whole evidence.\n\n\"On Tuesday, 6th Flor\u00e9al, year 11, about one o'clock P.M. the weather being serene, there was observed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAEN\">Caen</a>, Pont d'Audemer, and the environs of Alen\u00e7on, Falaise, and Verneuil, a fiery globe, of a very brilliant splendour, and which moved in the atmosphere with great rapidity. Some moments after, there was heard at l'Aigle, and in the environs of that town, in the extent of more than thirty leagues in every direction, a violent explosion, which lasted five or six minutes. At first there were three or four reports, like those of cannon, followed by a kind of discharge which resembled the firing of musketry; after which there was heard a dreadful rumbling like\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> of a drum. The air was calm, and the sky serene, except a few clouds, such as are frequently observed.\n\n\"This noise proceeded from a small cloud which had a rectangular form, the largest side being in a direction from east to west. It appeared motionless all the time that the phenomenon lasted; but the vapours of which it was composed, were projected momentarily from different sides, by the effect of the successive explosions. This cloud was about half a league to the north-north-west of the town of l'Aigle. It was at a great elevation in the atmosphere, for the inhabitants of two hamlets, a league distant from each other, saw it at the same time above their heads. In the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">canton</a> over which this cloud was suspended, there was heard a hissing noise like that of a stone discharged from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLING\">sling</a>, and a great many mineral masses exactly similar to those distinguished by the name of meteor-stones were seen to fall.\n\n\"The district in which these masses were projected, forms an elliptical extent of about two leagues and a half in length, and nearly one in breadth, the greatest dimension being in a direction from south-east to north-west, forming a declination of about 22 degrees. This direction, which the meteor must have followed, is exactly that of the magnetic meridian, which is a remarkable result. The greatest of these stones fell at the south-eastern extremity of the large axis of the ellipse, the middle-sized in the centre, and the smaller at the other extremity. Hence it appears that the largest fell first, as might naturally be supposed. The largest of all those that fell weighs seventeen pounds and a half. The smallest which I have seen weighs about two gros (a thousandth part of the last). The number of all those which fell is certainly above two or three thousand.\"\n\nAs we cannot make room for an analysis of M. Biot's more extended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>, we shall be contented to select only two facts.\n\nThe cur\u00e9 of St Michael declared, that he observed one of the stones fall, with a hissing noise, at the feet of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a>, in the court-yard of his parsonage, and that it rebounded upwards of a foot from the pavement. He instantly requested his niece to fetch it to him; but as she was too much alarmed, a woman who happened also to be on the spot, took it up; and it was found in every respect to resemble the others.\n\nAs one Pichet, a wire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a> belonging to the village of Arm\u00e9es, was working with his men in the open air, a stone grazed his arm, and fell at his feet; but it was so hot, that, on attempting to take it up, he instantly let it fall again.\n\nHe who compares the various accounts of the l'Aigle meteor, with a critical eye, may detect some apparent contradictions, which, however, on reflection, are found to be strictly conformable to truth. Thus, according to some, the meteor had a rapid motion, others believed it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>; some saw a very luminous ball of fire, others only an ordinary cloud. Spectators, in fact, viewed it in different positions with respect to its direction. They who happened to be in its line of march, would see it stationary, for the same reason, that we fancy a ship under full sail to be motionless, when we are placed in its wake, or when we view it from the harbour to which it is approaching in a straight line.\n\nThey, on the other hand, who had a side view of the meteorite, would reckon its progress the more rapid, in proportion as their position approached to a right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> with its line of passage. They, again, who saw it from behind, as the inhabitants of l'Aigle, would perceive only the cloud of vapour, which it left in its train, and which, in the dark, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> like a blazing tail, in the same manner as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> of a volcano appears black during the day and red at night. Lastly, they who were placed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the meteor, would reckon it stationary, but brilliant and cloudless.\n\nIt deserves to be remarked, that the l'Aigle stones were very friable for some days after their descent, that they gradually acquired hardness, and that after they had lost the sulphureous odour on their surface, they still retained it in their substances, as was found by breaking them. Professor Sage submitted them to several comparative trials with those of Ville-franche; and, though the l'Aigle specimens present some globules of the size of a small coriander seed, of a darker gray than the mass, and not attractable by the magnet, yet, in respect of granular texture and general aspect, the coincidence was so striking as to lead one to suppose that they were all parts of the same mass.\n\nThe l'Aigle stones, according to Fourcroy, are generally irregular, polygonal, often cuboid, sometimes sub-cuciform, and exceedingly various in their diameter and weight. All are covered with a black gravelly crust, consisting of a fused matter, and filled with small agglutinated grains of iron. The greater part of them are broken at the corners, either by their shock against each other, or by falling on hard bodies. The internal parts resemble those of all the stones analyzed by Messrs Howard and Vauquelin, being gray, a little varied in their shades, granulated, and as it were scaly, split in many parts, and filled with brilliant metallic points, exactly of the same aspect as those of other stones of a like description. The proportions of their constituent materials are stated as nearly, 54 silex, 36 oxidated iron, 9 magnesia, 3 nickel, 2 sulphur, and 1 lime, the five per cent. of increase, arising from the oxidation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> produced by the analysis.\n\nOf the two specimens which M. Biot presented to the celebrated Patrin, one was less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, and of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> gray than the other, and likewise presented small patches of a rust colour. When immersed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, it gave a hissing sound, like the humming of a fly, which is held by one wing. As it began to dry, it was observed to be marked by curvilinear and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> layers. The more compact specimens, when moistened, presented no such appearances, but assumed the aspect of a gray porphyry, with a base of trap, mottled with small white spots, and speckled with metallic points.\n\nTwo fine specimens of the l'Aigle stone, one of them nearly entire, may be seen in Mr Ferguson's collection, which we have already repeatedly quoted.\n\nPreviously to the explosion of the 26th of April 1803, no meteorites had been found by the inhabitants of the l'Aigle district, nor in the mineralogical collections of the department; nor the slightest mention of them made in the geological documents of this portion of Normandy: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>, foundries, and forges, had produced nothing similar, in the form of dross or ore, nor had the country exhibited any trace of volcanoes.\nThe meteor at once appears, and a multitude of stones of the peculiar character noted above are seen scattered on a determined space of ground, in a manner, and accompanied with circumstances, which could not formerly have escaped observation. Let us likewise reflect, that the young and the old, simple peasants dwelling at a distance from one another, sagacious and rational workmen, respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>, young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> devoid of timidity, individuals, in short, of various manners, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>, and opinions, united by no common ties, all agree in attesting a fact, which contributed neither directly nor indirectly to promote their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, and they all assign the manifestation of this fact to the same day and hour. They, moreover, point to existing vestiges of the descent of solid substances, and they declare, in terms unsusceptible of misconception or ambiguity, that they saw the masses in question roll down on roofs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> branches of trees, rebound from the pavement, and produce smoke where they fell. These recitals, and these vestiges, are limited to a tract of territory which has been accurately defined; while beyond the precincts of this tract, not a single particle of a meteorite has been found, nor a single individual who pretends that he saw a stone fall.\n\nHaving now, we presume, advanced ample and satisfactory evidence of the existence of meteorites, we shall forbear to enlarge this article by dwelling on instances of inferior notoriety to those which we have recounted, and shall merely note the dates of subsequent examples.\n\nOn the 4th of July 1803, a fire-ball struck the White Bull Inn at East-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTON\">Norton</a>, and left behind it several meteoric fragments.\u2014On the 13th of December of the same year, a similar phenomenon occurred at the village of St Nicholas, in Bavaria.\u2014At Possil, near Glasgow in Scotland, a meteor-stone fell, with a loud and hissing noise, on the 5th April 1804.\u2014The next instance which we have to mention occurred near Apt, in the department of Vaucluse, on the 6th of October of the same year; and the last which has come to our knowledge happened at half past five o'clock in the evening of the 15th March 1806, near Alais in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUEDOC\">Languedoc</a>.\n\nIt seems reasonable, however, to suppose, that the fall of meteoric substances takes place more frequently than is commonly supposed, since several foreign collections of fossils contain specimens of reputed celestial origin, and exhibiting the genuine atmospheric physiognomy. It is likewise worthy of remark, that many relations of the phenomenon may have sunk into oblivion, from the contempt with which they were heard by the learned, and that on a fair computation of chances, meteors may have sometimes exploded on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> tracts of land, and still more frequently over the pathless expanse of the water.\n\nThat some of the relations to which we have alluded are vague and unsatisfactory, cannot be denied, but the circumstantial testimony conveyed by others is more pointed and positive; and the whole mass of historical proof, especially when combined with the argument deduced from the identity of the physical and chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the stones, appears to us to be altogether irresistible.\n\nIn the course of our inquiry into this novel and interesting subject, we have ascertained a variety of circumstances which render it highly probable, if not indubitable, that those detached masses of native iron, whose history has so often staggered and perplexed the geologist, are only modifications of meteoric depositions. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>, for example, ascribe the descent of the Siberian mass described by Chladni, Pallas, Patrin, &c., to a period that is lost in the remoteness of antiquity; and while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> thus favours our hypothesis, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> which is obviously observable in point of texture and chemical characters with those of other solid bodies, whose fall is no longer questioned, strengthens tradition. According to the discoveries of Proust and Klaproth, native iron, reputed meteoric, differs from that which occurs in a fossil state by the presence of nickel. The former of these celebrated analysts obtained 50 grains of sulphate of nickel from 100 of the South American mass, and his results are corroborated by Mr Howard and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> de Bonnon.\n\nOf the two pieces of Siberian iron possessed by Mr Greville, one, which was transmitted by Dr Pallas, weighs several pounds; and another presents a cellular and ramified texture, analogous to that of some very light and porous volcanic scoriae. When attentively examined, there may be perceived in it not only empty cells, but also impressions or cavities of greater or less depth, and in some of which there remains a transparent substance, of a yellowish green colour. The iron itself is very malleable; and may be easily cut with a knife, or flattened under the hammer. The specific gravity is 6487, which is obviously inferior to that of unforged iron that has undergone fusion, and maybe partly owing to the oxidization of the surface of the iron, and partly to the many minute cavities in its substance, which have often rendered visible by fracture, and which have their surface also oxidized. The fracture is shining and silvery, like that of white cast iron; but its grain is much smoother and finer; and it is much more malleable when cold. The heavier specimen is more solid and compact, exhibiting no cavities or pores, though its surface is ramified and cellular. So blended and incorporated is its compact part with the yellowish-green substance mentioned above, that if the whole of the latter could be subtracted, the remainder would consist of iron in the metallic state, and would display the same cellular appearance as the preceding specimen, or as the superficial portion of that now described. This stony part of the composition usually assumes the appearance of small nodules, generally of an irregular shape, but sometimes nearly globular, with a smooth, shining, and glassy surface. This substance, which is always more or less transparent, is hard enough to cut glass, but makes no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTZ\">quartz</a>. It becomes electric by friction, is very refractory, and varies in specific gravity from 3263 to 3300. Of all substances hitherto known, it approaches most to the peridot, or Wernerian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRYSOLITE\">chrysolite</a>, which yielded to Klaproth nearly the same results which this substance did to Howard. In the mass of iron, it is liable to decomposition, changing to an opake white, and crumbling into a gritty dry powder, when lightly pressed or squeezed between the fingers.\u2014\"I cannot help observing (says the count de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOURBON\">Bourbon</a>), that there appears to exist a very interesting analogy between these transparent nodules and the globules I described as making part of the stones said...\"\nto have fallen on the earth. This analogy, though not a very strong one, may lead us to suppose, that the two substances are similar in their nature, but that the globules are less pure, and contain a greater quantity of iron.\n\nThe native iron from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a> is compact, like the large specimen from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, in Mr Greville's collection, and like it contains nodules, but not so numerous. They are besides quite opake, and very much resemble the globules in atmospheric stones. This iron contains nearly five per cent. of nickel. Between five and six per cent. of the same metal seems to exist in a piece of native iron brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENEGAL\">Senegal</a>.\n\nThough our limits will not permit us to dwell with minuteness on the physical and chemical characters of meteorolites, we shall shortly state those which the count de Bournon found to pertain to the specimens from Benares, and which may serve as no unfair standard of the aspect and composition of the others.\n\nLike all of the same origin which were subjected to the count's examination, the Benares stones are covered over the whole extent of their surface, with a thin crust, of a deep black colour, sprinkled over with small asperities, which make it feel somewhat like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHAGREEN\">shagreen</a> or fish skin. Their fracture exhibits a grayish colour, and a granulated texture, like that of coarse grit-stone. By help of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENS\">lens</a>, they are perceived to be composed of four different substances. One of these occurs in great abundance, in the form of small bodies, some of which are perfectly globular, others rather elongated or elliptical, and all, of various sizes, from that of a small pin's head to that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEA\">pea</a>, or nearly so. These small globules are usually gray, sometimes inclining much to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, and always opake; they are easily broken in any direction, have a conchoidal fracture, and a fine, smooth, compact grain, with a slight degree of lustre, approaching to enamel; lastly, they can destroy the polish of glass without being able to cut it, and sparkle faintly when struck with steel. Another of these substances is martial pyrites, of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> form, and reddish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> colour, slightly verging to the nickel tint, or to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> pyrites; of a somewhat loosely granulated texture, and irregularly distinguished in the mass, being black when reduced to powder, and not attractable by the magnet. The third of these substances consists of small particles of iron, in a perfectly metallic state, so that they may be easily flattened or extended under the hammer. Though in a much smaller proportion than the pyrites just mentioned, they impart the magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> to the stone. When a piece of the latter was pulverized, and the particles of iron separated from it as accurately as possible, by means of a magnet, they appeared to compose about 200 parts of the weight of the stone. These three substances are united by means of a fourth, which is nearly of an earthy consistency, and of a whitish gray colour.\u2014The black crust, or outward coating, though of very inconsiderable thickness, emits bright sparks when struck with steel, may be broken by the hammer, and seems to possess the same properties with the black oxide of iron, though, like the substance of the stone, it is occasionally intermixed with small particles of iron in the metallic state. These are easily distinguished, by passing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILE\">file</a> over the crust, which reveals their lustre. The specific gravity of the Benares stones is 3.52.\n\nNone of them, when breathed on, emit the argillaceous odour.\n\nIn consequence of various experiments, M. Sage, infers that meteorolites are composed of native iron, sulphuret of nickel, quartz or silica, alumina, and magnesia; that the proportions of iron and nickel vary; that the quartz seems to form at least the half of the stone, the alumina and magnesia the sixth, and the sulphur the 30th part. These general results pretty nearly accord with the more special reports of Howard and Vauquelin, except that the latter makes no mention of alumina, the existence of which in atmospheric stones is by no means distinctly ascertained.\n\nWe shall only beg leave to add, on this part of our subject, that Laugier, an ingenious chemist, by employing the caustic alkali, has detected a small portion of chrome. The results of his experiments, which are stated in the 58th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Annales de Chimie, arc 1st, That the five stones from Verona, Barbotan, Ensisheim, PAigle, and the neighbourhood of Apt, besides the principles already recognized, contain about one per cent. of chrome. 2dly, That it is very probable that all meteorolites contain this principle, since they all resemble one another in their physical and chemical properties, and have all, apparently, the same origin; and, 3dly, That in many cases, the perfection of chemical analysis requires, that the same substance should be treated both by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a>, since <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> has shown, that a principle which eluded the former method, has been revealed by the latter.\n\nHaving now, as we apprehend, sufficiently established the existence and nature of meteorolites, we hope our readers will excuse us from enlarging on the various causes which have been assigned for their origin, as these seem to lie beyond the reach of our present state of knowledge. After a candid and patient review of the principal theories, we conceive that they are at best gratuitous, and that most of them are open to many and formidable objections.\n\nThe terrestrial hypotheses, we believe, begin already to be generally abandoned, as untenable. Until the phenomenon of exploding meteors had been distinctly observed and recorded, Lemery and others could maintain, with some degree of plausibility, that lightning might tear up the ground, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> soil into a compact mass. But the appearances of a thunder storm and of a fire-ball are now ascertained to differ in various important respects. Spectators worthy of credit have seen the latter terminate in the fall of solid bodies; and the composition of these solid bodies has been found to differ from that of all the known fossil substances on the surface of the globe. It is vain, then, to allege, that they are formed on the ground by common lightning, which has often produced very extraordinary effects, but which never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> thousands of stones in fine calm weather. The supposition, that such stones have been projected from some of our volcanoes, is hardly less conceivable. The ashes which accompany a violent eruption of \u00c6tna or Vesuvius have, from their levity, been carried to a very considerable distance; but we are totally unacquainted with any projectile force which could dart solid masses many hundred miles, through such a dense medium as the atmosphere. The compact lavas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> are never found\nfound remote from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of their formation, and none of them present the characters and aspect of the stones which we have described. M. Bory de St Vincent, indeed, in his Voyage dans les quatre Principales Isles des Mers d'Afrique, very pompously expounds a doctrine, which, in our opinion, carries its confusion along with it. According to this writer, meteorites were projected from immense depths, in an early stage of the earth's existence, when igneous mountains were endowed with propelling forces sufficient to drive masses of matter into the regions of space, where they were constrained to obey, for ages, the combined laws of impulse and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>, until, in the progress of time, their spiral revolutions at length terminated on the surface of their native earth. Before we can adopt such an extravagant hypothesis, we must be convinced, that at one period of the history of our globe, the agency of subterraneous fire was adequate to communicate planetary motion to splinters of rock, without heaving up the rocks themselves, and that the rotatory movement, though once established, must gradually diminish and cease. The demonstration of these positions is surely not less arduous than the explanation of the phenomenon which they are intended to solve.\n\nOf those who contend for the atmospherical formation of meteorites, scarcely any two agree in regard to the manner by which such formation is effected. Patrin, who is solicitous to extend and illustrate his darling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of volcanoes, labours at great length to maintain the existence of a regular circulation of gaseous fluids between the primitive schistose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of the globe, and its surrounding atmosphere, and, from this fancied circulation, which he flatters himself he has demonstrated, he deduces, quite at his ease, the occasional ignition and concretion of portions of these fluids in the higher regions of the air. This ingenious mineralogist and geologist is so extremely tenacious of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> that we shall not attempt to disturb his self-complacency; but he will excuse us if we refuse to assent to results which rest on imaginary foundations. The celebrated Muschenbroeck, in one part of his writings, ascribes the descent of stones from the air to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, an opinion which later observations have disproved. In other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, however, he seems to incline to a modification of the atmospherical hypothesis, and endeavours to trace the origin of shooting stars to an accumulation of the volatile matters which are suspended in the air. It is extremely probable, that shooting stars and fiery meteors have an intimate relation to one another, if they are not identical appearances; but it is certain that the former move at a much greater distance from our earth than fireballs, and only occasion a transient luminous appearance in their passage through the upper regions of the atmosphere. Perhaps they are analogous to those telescopie sparks of light which were observed by M. Schr\u00f6ter. Muschenbroeck, however, adopts the vulgar notion of their falling to the earth, and seems to confound their residue with tremella nostoc. M. Salverte has given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> to the theory of formation from vapours, by having recourse to the agency of hydrogen gas. According to him, in consequence of the decomposition of water, which is constantly going on at the surface of the earth, immense quantities of hydrogen gas are continually rising into the atmosphere, and ascending to its higher regions. As this gas is capable of dissolving metals, it carries along with it a portion of iron and nickel. During thunder-storms this gas is kindled by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>; the metals are deposited, reduced, melted, and vitrified; in other words, meteors are produced and stones formed. This hypothesis is scarcely more satisfactory than the others. It does not account for the presence of magnesia and silicea, nor does it explain why the stones are always composed of the same materials. Besides, the existence of hydrogen gas in the atmosphere has not been proved, far less that it forms a separate atmosphere, which is contrary to all experience; and it is well known, that a little hydrogen, mixed with a large portion of atmospheric air, cannot be fired by electricity. In general, we may observe, that if the origin of meteorites be really atmospherical, the matters of which they are composed must have existed in one of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, namely, in very attenuated particles or concretions of the matters themselves volatilized and held in solution in the air, or only in the elements of these matters. In the first case, when abandoned by their menstruum to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> tendencies, they would unite by aggregation only; in the second, by chemical combination. Now, we can hardly suppose that disengagement of light and violent detonation should result from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> of aggregation, whereas they are strictly symptomatic of the affinity of composition. This, and various other considerations which might be stated, if we could make room for them, induce us to regard the doctrine of combination as the most plausible. M. Izarn, who has published a treatise on Atmospheric Lithology, has entered into a tedious and somewhat obscure exposition of his own theory, founded on this principle. We shall give the summary, as nearly as we can, in his own words.\n\n\"Gaseous substances, arranged in spherical masses in the upper regions of the air, being admitted, the various agitations of the atmosphere should naturally waft some of these masses from their insulating medium into one capable of combining with them. If the combination begins, the disengagement of light is explained. In proportion as the combination advances, the specific gravities are changed; and, consequently, a change of place will commence, and that in the quarter which presents least resistance, or where the medium is most rarefied, in course rather towards the south than the north. Hence, most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIRE_BALLS\">fire-balls</a> are observed to move from north to south, or from north-east to south-west. Motion being once impressed, the mass traverses other media, capable of supplying new principles, which still increasing the weight, determine the curve; and when at length the principles which are at work, and which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> in all directions, have attained the requisite proportion for extinguishing the elements in the birth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>, the grand operation is announced by the explosion, and the product takes its place among the solids.\"\u2014That the stones in question are produced by chemical combination in the higher regions of the atmosphere, and that they are thus formed from their own elements, are suppositions fully as probable as any that have been advanced on the subject; but whether the union of their parts be effected in the manner detailed by M. Izarn, we are unable to determine, both because we are uncertain if we perfectly comprehend his\nhis meaning, and because our range of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> is as yet too circumscribed, to warrant any specific or decisive conclusions.\n\nA much bolder theory has been suggested, and its possibility demonstrated by the celebrated French astronomer, La Place, who shews, that meteorites may be the products of lunar volcanoes. As this romantic view of the subject has obtained the suffrages of some men of science, and has excited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> of others, we shall present the reasoning on which it is founded in the popular and perspicuous language of Dr Hutton of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOLWICH\">Woolwich</a>.\n\n\"As the attraction of gravitation extends through the whole planetary system, a body placed at the surface of the moon is affected chiefly by two forces, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> it toward the centre of the earth, and another drawing it toward that of the moon. The latter of these forces, however, near the moon's surface is incomparably the greater. But as we recede from the moon, and approach toward the earth, this force decreases while the other augments; till at last a point of station is found between the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, where these forces are exactly equal, so that a body placed there must remain at rest; but if it be removed still nearer to the earth, then this planet would have the superior attraction, and the body must fall towards it. If a body then be projected from the moon towards the earth, with a force sufficient to carry it beyond the point of equal attraction, it must necessarily fall on the earth. Such then is the idea of the manner in which the bodies must be made to pass from the moon to the earth, if that can be done, the possibility of which is now necessary to be considered.\n\n\"Now, supposing a mass to be projected from the moon, in a direct line towards the earth, by a volcano, or by the production of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> by subterranean heat; and supposing for the present these two planets to remain at rest; then it has been demonstrated, on the Newtonian estimation of the moon's mass, that a force projecting the body with a velocity of 12,000 feet in a second, would be sufficient to carry it beyond the point of equal attraction. But this estimate of the moon's mass is now allowed to be much above the truth; and on M. la Place's calculation, it appears that a force of little more than half the above power would be sufficient to produce the effect, that is, a force capable of projecting a body with a velocity of less than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> and a half per second. But we have known cannon balls projected by the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, with a velocity of 2500 feet per second or upwards, that is, about half a mile. It follows, therefore, that a projectile force, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> a velocity about three times that of a cannon ball, would be sufficient to throw the body from the moon beyond the point of equal attraction, and cause it to reach the earth. Now there can be little doubt that a force equal to that is exerted by volcanoes on the earth, as well as by the production of steam by subterranean heat; when we consider the huge masses of rock, so many times larger than cannon balls, thrown on such occasions to heights also so much greater. We may easily imagine, too, such cause of motion to exist in the moon as well as in the earth, and that in a superior degree, if we may judge from the supposed symptoms of volcanoes recently observed in the moon by the powerful tubes of Dr Herschel; and still more, if we consider that all projections from the earth suffer an enormous resistance and diminution, by the dense atmosphere of this planet; while it has been rendered probable, from optical considerations, that the motion has little or no atmosphere at all, to give any such resistance to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTILES\">projectiles</a>.\n\n\"Thus then we are fully authorized in concluding, that the case of possibility is completely made out; that a known power exists in nature, capable of producing the foregoing effect, of detaching a mass of matter from the moon, and transferring it to the earth in the form of a flaming meteor, or burning stone: at the same time we are utterly ignorant of any other process in nature by which the same phenomenon can be produced. Having thus discovered a way in which it is possible to produce those appearances, we shall now endeavour to show, from all the concomitant circumstances, that these accord exceedingly well with the natural effects of the supposed cause, and thence give it a very high degree of probability.\n\n\"This important desideratum will perhaps be best attained, by examining the consequences of a substance supposed to be projected by a volcano from the moon into the sphere of the earth's superior attraction; and then comparing those with the known and visible phenomena of the blazing meteors or burning stones that fall through the air on the earth. And if in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> a striking coincidence or resemblance shall always or mostly be found, it will be difficult for the human mind to resist the persuasion that the assumed cause involves a degree of probability but little short of certainty itself. Now the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> phenomena attending these blazing meteors or burning stones, are these:\n\n1. That they appear or blaze out suddenly.\n2. That they move with a surprising rapid motion, nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a>, but a little inclined downwards.\n3. That they move in several different directions with respect to the points of the compass.\n4. That in their flight they yield a loud whizzing sound.\n5. That they commonly burst with a violent explosion and report.\n6. That they fall on the earth with great force in a sloping direction.\n7. That they are very hot at first, remain hot a considerable time, and exhibit visible tokens of fusion on their surface.\n8. That the fallen stony masses have all the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> appearance and contexture, as well as internally the same nature and composition.\n9. That they are totally different from all our terrestrial bodies, both natural and artificial.\n\n\"Now these phenomena will naturally compare with the circumstances of a substance projected by a lunar volcano, and in the order in which they are here enumerated. And first, with respect to the leading circumstance, that of a sudden blazing meteoric appearance, which is not that of a small bright spark, first seen at an immense distance, and then gradually increasing with the diminution of its distance. And this circumstance appears very naturally to result from the assumed cause. For, the body being projected from a lunar volcano, may well be supposed in an ignited state, like inflamed matter thrown upon by our terrestrial volcanoes, which passing through the comparatively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a>, in the space between the moon and the earth's sensible atmosphere, it will probably enter the superior parts of this atmosphere with but little diminution of its original...\"\nnal heat; from which circumstance, united with that of its violent motion, this being 10 or 12 times that of a cannon ball, and through a part of the atmosphere probably consisting chiefly of the inflammable gas rising from the earth to the top of the atmosphere, the body may well be supposed to be suddenly inflamed, as the natural effect of these circumstances; indeed it would be surprising if it did not. From whence it appears, that the sudden inflammation of the body, on entering the earth's atmosphere, is exactly what might be expected to happen.\n\n\"2. To trace the body through the earth's atmosphere; we are to observe that it enters the top of it with the great velocity acquired by descending from the point of equal attraction, which is such as would carry the body to the earth's surface in a very few additional seconds of time if it met with no obstruction. But as it enters deeper in the atmosphere, it meets with still more and more resistance from the increasing density of the air, by which the great velocity of six miles per second must soon be greatly reduced to one that will be uniform, and only a small part of its former great velocity. This remaining part of its motion will be various in different bodies, being more or less as the body is larger or smaller; and as it is more or less specifically heavy; but, for a particular instance, if the body were a globe of 12 inches diameter, and of the same gravity as the atmospheric stones, the motion would decrease so as to be little more than a quarter of a mile per second of perpendicular descent. Now while the body is thus descending, the earth itself is affected by a twofold motion, both the diurnal and the annual one, with both of which the descent of the body is to be compounded. The earth's motion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> at the equator is about 17 miles in a minute, or two-sevenths of a mile in a second; but in the middle latitudes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> little more than the half of that, or little above half a quarter of a mile in a second; and if we compound this motion with that of the descending body, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, this may cause the body to appear to descend obliquely, though but a little, the motion being nearer the perpendicular than the horizontal direction. But the other motion of the earth, or that in its annual course, is about 20 miles in a second, which is 80 times greater than the perpendicular descent in the instance above mentioned; so that, if this motion be compounded with the descending one of the body, it must necessarily give it the appearance of a very rapid motion, in a direction nearly parallel to the horizon, but a little declining downwards. A circumstance which exactly agrees with the appearances of these meteoric bodies, as stated in the second article of the enumerated phenomena.\n\n\"3. Again, with regard to the apparent direction of the body; this will evidently be various, being that compounded of the body's descent and the direction of the earth's annual motion at the time of the fall, which is itself various in the different seasons of the year, according to the direction of the several points of the ecliptic to the earth's meridian or axis. Usually, however, from the great excess of the earth's motion above that of the falling body, the direction of this must appear to be nearly opposite to that of the former. And in fact this exactly agrees with a remark made by Dr Halley, in his account of the meteors in his paper above given, where he says that the direction of the meteor's motion was exactly opposite to that of the earth in her orbit. And if this shall generally be found to be the case, it will prove a powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of this theory of the lunar substances. Unfortunately, however, the observations on this point are very few, and mostly inaccurate; the angle or direction of the fallen stones has not been recorded; and that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> meteor commonly mistaken, all the various observers giving it a different course, some even directly the reverse of others. In future, it will be very advisable that the observers of fallen stones, observe and record the direction or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> of the perforation made by the body in the earth, which will give us perhaps the course of the path nearer than any other observation.\n\n\"4. In the flight of these meteoric stones, it is commonly observed, that they yield a loud whizzing sound. Indeed it would be surprising if they did not. For if the like sound be given by the smooth and regularly formed cannon ball, and heard at a considerable distance, how exceedingly great must be that of a body so much larger, which is of an irregular form and surface too, and striking the air with 50 or 100 times the velocity.\n\n\"5. That they commonly burst and fly in pieces in their rapid flight, is a circumstance exceedingly likely to happen, both from the violent state of fusion on their surface, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> rapidity of their motion through the air. If a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> stone, from its quick rotation, be sometimes burst and fly in pieces, and if the same thing happen to cannon balls when made of stone and discharged with considerable velocity, merely by the friction and resistance of the air; how much more is the same to be expected to happen to the atmospheric stones, moving with more than 50 times the velocity, and when their surface may well be supposed to be partly loosened or dissolved by the extremity of the heat there.\n\n\"6. That the stones strike the ground with a great force, and penetrate to a considerable depth, as is usually observed, is a circumstance only to be expected from the extreme rapidity of their motion, and their great weight, when we consider that a cannon ball, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> shell, will often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> itself many inches, or even some feet in the earth.\n\n\"7. That these stones, when soon sought after and found, are hot, and exhibit the marks of recent fusion, are also the natural consequences of the extreme degree of inflammation in which their surface had been put during their flight through the air.\n\n\"8. That these stony masses have all the same external appearance and conture, as well as internally the same nature and composition, are circumstances that strongly point out an identity of origin, whatever may be the cause to which they owe so generally uniform a conformation. And when it is considered,\n\n\"9. That in those respects they differ totally from all terrestrial compositions hitherto known or discovered, they lead the mind strongly to ascribe them to some other origin than the earth we inhabit; and none so likely as coming from our neighbouring planet.\n\n\"Upon the whole then (continues Dr Hutton), it appears...\"\nappears highly probable, that the flaming meteors, and the burning stones, that fall on the earth, are one and the same thing. It also appears impossible, or in the extremest degree improbable, to ascribe these either to a formation in the superior parts of the atmosphere, or to the eruptions of terrestrial volcanoes, or to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> by lightning striking the earth. But, on the other hand, that it is possible for such masses to be projected from the moon so as to reach the earth; and that all the phenomena of these meteors or falling stones, having a surprising conformity with the circumstances of masses that may be expelled from the moon by natural causes, unite in forming a body of strong evidence, that this is in all probability and actually the case.\n\nM. Poisson, an ingenious French mathematician, has shown by an algebraical calculation, the possibility of a projectile reaching our planet from the moon. His calculation, however, which may be found in the work of Izarn, quoted above, (p. 238, et seq.) proceeds on the supposition that our satellite has no atmosphere, or next to none. There are, no doubt, appearances which seem to favour this supposition, but they do not amount to positive proof of the fact. Even could the latter be established, the combustion of a volcano, without the presence of atmospheric air, would remain to be explained. But, granting this difficulty too to be surmounted, there are other circumstances which we cannot easily reconcile to the lunar hypothesis. The occasional arrival of fragments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a> on the earth's surface, would argue, on a fair computation of chances, such a copious discharge of volcanic matters, that the moon, by this time, would consist of hardly any thing else. Again, if we may be allowed to reason from analogy, the volcanic productions of the moon should exhibit varieties of aspect and composition like those with which we are acquainted, and not a definite and precise number of the same ingredients. We may also remark, that the soft and incoherent state of several of the recent specimens of meteorolites can ill accord with their supposed passage through any considerable portion of space; and that the P'Agile phenomenon, which is so distinctly recorded, evidently suggests the notion of instantaneous formation in the atmosphere. And, though this view of the subject may be regarded by some as inexplicable, we cannot conceive that it is more so than the doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>, or than many of the results of chemical combination, whose existence it is impossible to deny. These and other arguments may, we apprehend, be fairly urged against any theory which attempts to explain the history of meteors by the agency of lunar volcanoes.\n\nThe hypothesis of Dr Chladni, which likewise boasts of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a>, though still more extravagant than the preceding, deserves to be stated. As earthly, metallic, and other particles form the principal component parts of our planet, among which iron is the prevailing part, other planetary bodies, he affirms, may consist of similar, or, perhaps, the same component parts, though combined and modified in a very different manner. There may also be dense matters accumulated in smaller masses, without being in immediate connexion with the larger planetary bodies, dispersed throughout infinite space, and which, being impelled either by some projecting power or attraction, continue to move until they approach the earth, or some other body; when, being overcome by attractive force, they immediately fall down. By their exceeding great velocity, still increased by the attraction of the earth and the violent friction in the atmosphere, a strong electricity and heat must necessarily be excited, by which means they are reduced to a flaming and melted condition, and great quantities of vapour and different kinds of gases are thus disengaged, which distend the liquid mass to a monstrous size, till, by a still farther expansion of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluids, they must at length disipate. That portions of cosmical matter are allowed to revolve in space, and to terminate their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> on the surface of a planet, is a position too gratuitous and vague, to be readily admitted, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of which involves no principle of atheism or impiety, as some of Dr Chladni's antagonists have very unhandsomely insinuated. If worlds disappear and others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> into existence, a sportive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> may be permitted to indulge in the innocent supposition, that fragments of their materials are detached from their fractured masses, and obey those laws of attraction which seem to extend their influence to the remotest corners of the universe.\n\nSuch of our readers as are solicitous of obtaining more ample information on the subject of this article, may consult Izarn's Lithologie Atmospherique; Biot's Relation d'un Voyage fait dans le departement de l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORNE\">Orne</a>, pour constater la realite d'un Meteor observe a P'Agile; B\u00f6ttiger's Observations on the Accounts given by ancient authors of Stones said to have fallen from the Clouds; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FULDA\">Fulda</a>'s Memoir on Fire-balls; Cavallio's Elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Natural Philosophy</a>; Klaproth on Meteoric Stones; Solandt's Account of the Tuscan Meteor; Chladni's Treatise on the Siberian Mass of Iron; Mr Edward King's Remarks concerning Stones said to have fallen from the Clouds; and several of the more recent transactions of learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> and periodical scientific communications, as those of the Royal Society of London, of the Institute at Paris, the Journal de Physique, Annales de Chimie, Biblioth\u00e8que Britannique, D\u00e9cade Philosophique, Journal des Mines, Philosophical Magazine, Nicholson's Journal, &c. &c.","sp":738,"ep":754},{"h":"METEOROLOGICAL","t":"something belonging to meteors.\n\nMETEOROLOGICAL Journal, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> recording the daily state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, exhibited by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a>, thermometer, hygrometer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANEMOMETER\">anemometer</a>, and other meteorological instruments.

That the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is sometimes hotter and sometimes colder than usual; that it is at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> much rarefied, and at another greatly condensed; now uncommonly dry, and now surcharged with moisture\u2014are circumstances that daily meet the senses of the most casual observer, as they are circumstances that powerfully, and often unpleasantly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. That these changes are the result of decompositions and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> that are continually going on in the atmosphere, and of new modifications of its component principles, is manifest to him who is acquainted merely with the first elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> chemistry.\n\nIndeed to modern chemistry this science is indebted for the progress it has made within the last 50 years; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> which may be considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> epoch of meteorology. In fact, this science is still in its infancy; but from the ardour with which it is now cultivated, from the abilities of the philosophers who are engaged in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, and from the progress that is daily making in the kindred sciences, we may reasonably look forward to a period, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great distance, when it shall please the great Author of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> to unveil many of those wonders which are now involved in darkness and obscurity, and permit us to control the jarring elements, as he has allowed us to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> dominion over the beasts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>.\n\nA late ingenious writer on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> has suggested some useful hints for the improvement of meteorology, which we shall here extract. \"With this view, our first step must be that recommended by Mr Kirwan and others, to establish corresponding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> in different parts of the world; these societies must be furnished with similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, equally adjusted, and graduated in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, for making observations on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. In our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be necessary to procure registers, carefully kept, from the different parts of the sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, and from those parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> situated in the interior. The various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a>, thermometer, hygrometer, and electroscope, should be carefully noted; with the variations and the degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, as well as the diurnal and nocturnal aspect of the heavens discriminatedly marked; the appearance of the sky; and in familiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, such as might be understood by the respective and distant observers; for instance, whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> is totally or partially obscured by vapour;\u2014whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> are mottled, or fleaky;\u2014whether they assume the appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> streaks, or appear in radii apparently from a centre\u2014or in masses of dense vapour\u2014or loose and fleecy\u2014or those familiarly known by the name of mare-tail clouds\u2014with any other new or accustomed phenomena. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> terms fair, cloudy, or wet, are insufficient for forming a judgment of the weather; as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> fair is generally at present expressed only in opposition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, without distinguishing whether the atmosphere is obscure, dull, or bright. The appearance of the stratum of air on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\">earth's</a> surface, that is, the space between the clouds and the earth, should be always accurately described. Is there a blue haze, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIST\">mist</a>, and dense fog? or is the air transparent? which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> when distant objects appear more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> distinct and near to the eye of the observer: the temperature of the ocean at full tide should be frequently ascertained, as it will be found to have considerable influence in these respects on an insular country. By the remarks of observers, stationed in various parts of our coasts, we should soon be enabled to discover when vapour is wafted in from the sea, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the aqueous and vegetable surface of our island. During a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west wind, which is frequently attended with storms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a> and rain, and usually experienced in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, an observer stationed on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLIGO\">Sligo</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, or Denbighshire in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, might ascertain whether the disposition of the atmosphere to storm and cloud came in with the air from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic ocean</a>, or was generated by the vapours of our own island. It would be desirable also again, that the temperature and blue hazy appearance of the atmosphere during the north-east winds, so common in May and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, should be noticed by observers on the north-east coast, in the counties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>; and by others, on the opposite western coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a>, Devon, and Cornwall, so as to determine what changes in temperature this wind undergoes in its passage over the island; and whether or not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of haze increases or diminishes by its progress from either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>; and whether the vapour is more or less disposed to produce storms?\n\nBy such comparative observations on the coast, conjoined with those made by others in the central parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, we might rapidly proceed in meteorological science, or, as it is commonly called, a knowledge of the weather. The observations made in the interior of the country would enable us at all times to trace the origin and progress of storms: in situations where tillage or pasturage is most attended to, the effects of spring frosts and blights should be particularly noticed, as well as the first appearance of the aphis and coccus, the caterpillar and larvae of other insects; on fruit trees, and particularly those peculiar to the hop plantations. The first opening of the vernal foliage on trees and hedges in the spring, should likewise be remarked, and compared with the starting up grass on the...\nhighly manured pastures in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, and on those also assisted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>, as well as the natural herbage on the commons and wastes. Some attention should be paid to the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> storms, in destroying the aphids and other destructive insects, the pest of fruit and hop plantations; and the first appearance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILDEW\">mildew</a> or rust on wheat should be particularly observed, and remarks made to ascertain, whether or not the moisture, which occasions the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> in its commencement was attended with wind and rain, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> damp state of the air. The different kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, where the crops, from the disease, suffered most, should be noticed, and the situation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> for ventilation, with the height of the fences, size of inclosures, and vicinity to coppices, trees, or hedge-rows.*\n\nThe importance of the study of meteorology requires little elucidation. In climates where the succession of seasons is nearly stated and regular, where the periods of parching drought or deluging torrents, of the tempestuous hurricane or the refreshing breeze, are fixed and ascertained, mankind has little to do, but expect the dreaded changes, and provide against their devastations; but in countries like our own, where all the vicissitudes of seasons may take place in the course of a few hours, it is of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to investigate the nature of the change, and the circumstances that precede or accompany it. To the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a>, the mariner, the traveller, the physician, meteorology is in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> a study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>; to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> it is a study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> and delight; and to the observer of nature it affords objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> and sublimity not to be found in any other department of his favourite science. Surely nothing can contribute more to elevate the mind of man, to raise it \"from nature up to nature's God,\" than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of the sweeping whirlwind, the dazzling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, or the awful thunder.\n\nOur limits will not admit of our entering into a historical detail of the progress of meteorology; but it may be proper in this place to enumerate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> writers on this science both in our own country and on the continent.\n\nIn this country, we may reckon Dr Kirwan, (in his \"Estimate of the Temperature of different Climates\"), his \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Variations of the Atmosphere,\" and in the Irish Transactions,\" Mr John Dalton (chiefly in the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a>\"), Col. Capper (in his Introduction \"Observations on the Winds and Monsoons\"), Mr Williams (in his \"Climate of Great Britain\"), and Mr Linke Howard (in the Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>), Writers on the principal cultivators of meteorological knowledge; and on the continent, the names of Cottle (\"Traite de Meteorologie,\" and Journal de Physique), Saussure (\"Essai sur l'Hygrometrie,\" and Voyage aux Alpes\"), De Luc (A) (\"Recherches sur les Modifications de l'Atmosphere,\" \"Idees sur la Meteorologie,\" and other works), and Lamarck (see Journ. de Phys. passim) stand most conspicuous in this branch of natural science. The names of some of the more recent writers are mentioned in the article Meteorology, Supplement, which see.\n\nIn considering the subject of meteorology, we may properly divide it into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> general heads: 1. Of the changes which take place in the gravity of the air; 2. Of the changes of the temperature of the air; 3. Of the changes produced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> and rain; 4. Of the changes produced by winds; 5. Of atmospherical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>; 6. Of meteors, or those visible phenomena accompanied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, which take place in the atmosphere or near the surface of the earth; and, 7. The application of the principles of meteorology to the useful purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Of these heads, the fifth has been already fully considered under Electricity, and much of the sixth has been exhausted under Meteorolite. The remaining circumstances will form the subjects of the following chapters.\n\nChap. I. Of the Changes which take place in the Gravity of the Air.\n\nMany of the facts relating to this part of our subject have been already anticipated under the article Barometer, and several circumstances <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to be considered more properly under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">Pneumatics</a> than in this place. We shall here confine ourselves to a general view of the changes in the gravity of the atmosphere, as indicated by the barometer, in various situations on or near the surface of the earth, and briefly examine the conclusions that may be drawn from them.\n\nThe most general fact indicated by the barometer is, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a> that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> shows us the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of stands air highest at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the sea.\n\n(A) In again mentioning the name of a philosopher so respectable as M. de Luc, we embrace the first opportunity of doing him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and of vindicating his character against an unfortunate misconception of the late Professor Robison, a mistake which we have inadvertently contributed to disseminate, by quoting Dr Robison's statement in our account of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>, where M. de Luc is accused of having arrogated to himself Dr Black's discovery of latent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>.\n\nM. de Luc's vindication of himself (as printed in the 12th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Review) is before the public. We owe it to candour and justice to acknowledge our conviction that Dr Robison was too hasty in his assertion, and that M. de Luc, so far from arrogating to himself the doctrine of latent heat, has, in various parts of his numerous writings, expressly mentioned Dr Black as the author of that doctrine. This will appear from the following citations. In his \"Introduction \u00e0 la Physique terrestre,\" p. 102, M. de Luc thus expresses himself. \"Ne connoissant point le feu latent, dans la vapeur \u00e0 toute temp\u00e9rature, dont la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9couverte est due au Dr Black, &c. Again, p. 232, of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. \"Ce qui d\u00e9veloppait l'id\u00e9e de chaleur latente par laquelle le Dr Black avait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne\"\u2014and at p. 385, \"Le Dr Black ayant d\u00e9couvert qu'une certaine quantit\u00e9 de chaleur dispara\u00eet quand la vapeur de l'eau bouillante se forme, nomma ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne chaleur latente dans la vapeur.\"\n\nWe trust that these quotations, with M. de Luc's own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a> of himself above referred to, will be sufficient to exculpate him from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of literary felony so warmly brought against him by Professor Robison; and we have no doubt the Professor himself, were he still alive, would under such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> retract his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a>.\nGravity of air whose base is equal to the diameter of the mercury in the tube, and whose height is equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the atmosphere above the place of observation. As the height of this column must vary in different situations, and must, ceteris paribus, be greatest at the level of the sea, the mercury in the tube will, under the same circumstances, stand highest in such a situation. The medium height of the barometer at the level of the sea is 30 inches, as has been found by observations in the British channel, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> sea, at the temperatures of 55\u00b0 and 60\u00b0; on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a> at the temperature of 84\u00b0, and in latitude 80\u00b0.\n\nAs we ascend above the surface of the earth, the medium height of the mercury diminishes; and some late observations made in balloons at a considerable distance above the tops of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, have shewn that in the higher regions of the air, the column of mercury is very considerably shortened. This fact, as we have seen (see Barometer), has been usefully applied to the measuring of heights and depths that cannot be ascertained by the usual geometrical methods. As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> gravity of the atmosphere is constantly varying even in the same place, the column of air pressing on the surface of the mercury without the tube, must press with more or less force, in proportion as these changes are greater; and hence the barometer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out these variations, falling when the atmosphere is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a>, and rising when it is heavier than usual.\n\nFor an account of the observations that were made on the rise and fall of the barometer by the earlier philosophers, and the attempts which were made by them to explain these phenomena, see Barometer.\n\nIt will be of advantage here to consider the variations of the barometer, as they take place in different situations, in order, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> possible, to point out the cause by which these variations are produced, as this cause must have considerable influence on the changes of the weather.\n\nIt is found, that between the tropics the variations of the barometer are exceedingly small, and it is remarkable, that in that part of the world it does not descend above half as much for every 200 feet of elevation as it does beyond the tropics*. In the torrid zone, too, the barometer is elevated about \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of a line twice every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; and this elevation happens at the same time with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> of the sea\u2020.\n\nAs the latitude advances towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>, the range of the barometer gradually increases, till at last it amounts to two or three inches. This gradual increase will appear from the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>.\n\n| Latitude | Places       | Range of the Barometer |\n|----------|--------------|------------------------|\n| 0\u00b0       | Peru         | Greatest: 0.20 *       |\n|          |              | Annual:                |\n| 22\u00b0      | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>     | Greatest: 0.77 \u2020       |\n|          |              | Annual:                |\n| 49\u00b0      | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>       | Greatest: 1.00 \u2021       |\n|          |              | Annual:                |\n| 51\u00b0      | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a>        | Greatest: 2.47 \u00a7       |\n|          |              | Annual: 1.80           |\n| 53\u00b0      | Middlewick   | Greatest: 3.00 \u2021       |\n|          |              | Annual: 1.94           |\n| 53\u00b0      | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>    | Greatest: 2.89 ||      |\n|          |              | Annual: 1.96           |\n| 59\u00b0      | Pittsburgh   | Greatest: 3.45 **      |\n|          |              | Annual: 2.77           |\n\nThere is, however, some exception to this general rule, as in North <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> the range of the barometer is much less than in the corresponding European latitudes.\n\nThe range of the barometer is greater at the level of the sea than on mountains, and in the same degree of latitude the extent of the range is in the inverse ratio of the height of the place above the level of the sea.\n\nIt appears probable that the barometer has a tendency to rise during the day from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> to evening, and that this tendency is greatest between 2 and 9 P.M., the greatest elevation being at this last period. The elevation at 2 differs from that at 9 by \\( \\frac{4}{15} \\), while that at 2 differs from the morning elevation only by \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\); and that in certain climates the greatest elevation takes place at 2 o'clock*.\n\nThe range of the barometer is greater in winter than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, as appears from some observations made at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENDAL\">Kendal</a> during five years; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> range from October to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> being 7.982, and that from April to September being only 5.447\u2020.\n\nWhen the atmosphere is serene and settled the mercury is generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>; and in calm weather, when it is inclined to rain, the mercury is low. On the approach of high winds it sinks, as it does with a southerly wind, but rises very high on the approach of easterly and northerly winds. It is found, however, that at Calcutta the mercury is highest with north-westerly and northerly, and lowest with south-easterly winds.\n\nThe mercury suddenly falls on the approach of tempests, and during their continuance undergoes great oscillations.\n\nTo these general facts that have been observed on the rise and fall of the barometer, we shall annex the following axioms by M. Cotte.\n\n1. The greatest changes of the barometer commonly take place during clear weather, with a north wind; and the small risings during cloudy, rainy, or windy weather, with a south, or nearly south wind.\n\n2. The state of the mercury changes more in the winter than in the summer months; so that its greatest rising and falling takes place in winter; but its mean elevation is greater in summer than in winter.\n\n3. The changes of the state of the barometer are nearly null at the equator, and become greater the more one removes from it towards the poles.\n\n4. They are more considerable in valleys than on mountains.\n\n5. The more variable the wind, the more changeable the state of the barometer.\n\n6. It is lower at midnight and noon than at other periods of the day; its greatest daily height is towards evening.\n\n7. Between 10 at night and 2 in the morning, and also in the day, the rising and falling of the mercury are less; the contrary is the case between 6 and 10 in the morning and evening.\n\n8. Between 2 and 6 in the morning and evening it rises as often as it falls; but in such a manner that it oftener rises about that time in the winter months, and falls oftener in the summer months.\n\n9. The oscillations are less in summer, greater in winter, and very great at the equinoxes.\nThey are greater also in the daytime than during the night.\n\n11. The higher the sun rises above the horizon, the less are the oscillations; they increase as he approaches the western side of the horizon, and are exceedingly great when he comes opposite to the eastern part of the horizon.\n\n12. They are, to a certain degree, independent of the changes of temperature.\n\n13. The mercury generally rises between the new and the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, and falls between the latter and the new moon.\n\n14. It rises more in the apogee than the perigee; it usually rises between the northern lunistice and the southern, and falls between the southern lunistice and the northern.\n\n15. In general, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the variations of the mercury with the positions of the moon gives nothing certain; the results of No. 13. and 14. are the most constant.\n\n16. In the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> the barometer never continues 24 hours without changing.\n\n17. The barometers in the western districts rise and fall sooner than those in the more eastern.\n\n18. When the sun passes the meridian, the mercury, if falling, continues to fall, and its fall is often hastened.\n\n19. When the mercury at the same period is rising, it falls, remains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, or rises more slowly.\n\n20. When the mercury, under the same circumstances, is stationary, it falls, unless, before or after it becomes stationary, it has been in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of rising.\n\n21. The above changes commonly take place between 11 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon, but oftener before than after noon.\n\n22. Before high tides there is almost always a great fall of the mercury; this takes place oftener at the full than the new moon.\n\nSuch is a general view of the variations in the gravity of the air, as far as they have been observed by the barometer; and we shall now endeavour to give some plausible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of them.\n\nIt is evident that the density of the atmosphere is least at the equator, and greatest at the poles; for at the equator the centrifugal force, the distance from the centre of the earth, and the heat (all of which tend to diminish the density of the air), are at their maximum, while at the poles they are at their minimum. The mean height of the barometer at the level of the sea, all over the globe, is 30 inches; the weight of the atmosphere, therefore, is the same all over the globe. This weight depends on the density and height of the air; where the density is greatest, its height must be least; and on the contrary, where its density is least, its height must be greatest. The height of the atmosphere, therefore, must be greatest at the equator, and least at the poles; and it must decrease gradually between the equator and the poles, so that its upper surface will resemble two inclined planes, meeting above the equator their highest parts.\n\nDuring summer, when the sun is in our hemisphere, the mean heat between the equator and the pole does not differ so much as in winter. Hence the rarity of the atmosphere at the pole, and consequently its height, will be increased. The upper surface of the atmosphere, therefore, in the northern hemisphere, will be less inclined; while that of the southern hemisphere, from contrary causes, will be much more inclined. The reverse will take place during our winter.\n\nThe density of the atmosphere depends in a great measure on the pressure of the superincumbent column, and therefore decreases according to the height, as the pressure of the superincumbent column constantly decreases. But the density of the atmosphere in the torrid zone will not decrease so fast as in the temperate and frigid zones, because its column is larger, and because there is a greater proportion of air in the higher part of this column. This accounts for the observation of Mr Casson, that the barometer sinks only half as much for every 200 feet of elevation in the torrid as in the temperate zones. The density of the atmosphere at the equator, therefore, though at the surface of the earth it is less, must at a certain height equal, and at a still greater must exceed, the density of the atmosphere in the temperate zones and at the poles.\n\nWe shall presently endeavour to prove, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of air is constantly ascending at the equator, and that part of it at least reaches and continues in the higher parts of the atmosphere. From the fluidity of northern air it is evident that it cannot accumulate above the equator, but must roll <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> which the upper surface of the atmosphere assumes towards the poles. As the surface of the atmosphere of the northern hemisphere is more inclined during our winter than that of the southern hemisphere, a greater quantity of the equatorial current of air must flow over upon the northern than upon the southern hemisphere; so that the quantity of our atmosphere will be greater during winter than that of the southern hemisphere; but during summer the reverse will take place. Hence the greatest mercurial heights take place during winter, and the range of the barometer is less in summer than in winter.\n\nThe density of the atmosphere is in a great measure regulated by the heat of the place; wherever the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> is greatest, there the density of the atmosphere will be greatest, and its column shortest. High countries, and ranges of lofty mountains, the tops of which are covered with snow the greatest part of the year, must be much colder than other places situated in the same degree of latitude, and consequently the column of air over them much shorter. The current of superior air will linger and accumulate over these places in its passage towards the poles, and thus occasion an irregularity in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, which will produce a similar irregularity in the barometer. Such accumulations will be formed over the north-western parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, and over North America; hence the barometer usually stands higher, and varies less there, than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. Accumulations also are formed upon the Pyrenees, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>, the mountains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a> in Europe, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIBET\">Tibet</a>. When these accumulations have gone on for some time, the density of the air becomes too great to be balanced by the surrounding atmosphere; it rushes down on the neighbouring countries, and produces cold winds which raise the barometer. Hence the rise of the barometer which generally attends north-east winds in Europe, as they proceed from accumulations in the north-west of Asia, or about the pole; hence, too, the north-west wind from the mountains of Tibet raises the barometer at Calcutta.\nWe shall presently endeavour to shew, that considerable quantities of air are occasionally destroyed in the north polar regions. When this happens, the atmosphere to the south rushes in to supply the deficiency. Hence south-west winds take place, and the barometer falls.\n\nAs the mean heat of our hemisphere differs in different years, the density of the atmosphere, and consequently the quantity of equatorial air which flows towards the poles, must also be variable. Does this range correspond to the mean annual heat; that is to say, Is the range greatest when the heat is least, and least when the heat is greatest? In some years greater accumulations than usual take place in the mountainous parts of the south of Europe and Asia, owing, perhaps, to earlier falls of snow or to the rays of the sun having been excluded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> fogs. When this takes place, the atmosphere in the polar regions will be proportionally lighter. Hence the prevalence of southerly winds during some winters more than others.\n\nAs the heat in the torrid zone never differs much, the density, and consequently the height, of the atmosphere, will not vary much. Hence the range of the barometer within the tropics is comparatively small; and it increases gradually as we approach the poles, because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of the temperature, and consequently of the density, of the atmosphere, increases with the latitude.\n\nThe diurnal elevation of the barometer in the torrid zone corresponding to the tides, observed by Mr Casson and others, must be owing to the influence of the moon on the atmosphere. This influence, notwithstanding the ingenious attempts of D'Alembert and several other philosophers, seem altogether inadequate to account for the various phenomena of the winds. It is not so easy to account for the tendency which the barometer has to rise as the day advances. Perhaps it may be accounted for by the additional quantity of vapour added to the atmosphere, which by increasing the quantity of the atmosphere, may possibly be adequate to produce the effect.\n\nThe falls of the barometer which precede, and the oscillations which accompany, violent storms and hurricanes, shew us that these phenomena are produced by very great rarefactions, or perhaps destructions of air, in particular parts of the atmosphere. The falls of the barometer, too, that accompany winds, proceed from the same cause. The observation made by Mr Copeland, that a high barometer is accompanied by a temperature above the mean, will be easily accounted for by every one acquainted with Dr Black's theory of latent heat. The higher the mercury stands, the denser the atmosphere must be; and the denser it becomes, the more latent heat it must give out. It is well known that air evolves heat when condensed artificially. The falling of the barometer, which generally precedes rain, remains still to be accounted for; but we know too little about the causes by which rain is produced, to be able to account for it in a satisfactory manner.\n\nIt has been for some time suspected that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the barometer is affected by the changes of the moon. The theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> influence has been discussed on the continent chiefly by Lamarek and Cotte, (see Journal de Physique, passim); and in this country by Mr Luke Howard. Mr Howard's suspicions of this influence on the barometer were first conceived, in consequence of the printed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARTS\">charts</a>, of which he made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in keeping a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> of the barometer, having the phases of the moon marked on them, and of his observing a remarkable coincidence between these and certain states of the mercury. This coincidence consists in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> of the barometrical line on the approach of the new and full moon, and its elevation on that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>. In above 30 out of the 50 lunar weeks in the year 1798, the barometer was found to have changed its general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> once in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, in such a manner as to be either rising or at its maximum, for the week preceding and following, about the time of each quarter; and to be either falling or at its minimum, for the two weeks, about the new and full. It is remarkable, that the point of greatest depression during the year, viz. to 28.67, was found about 12 hours after the new moon on the 8th of November; and, that at its greatest and extraordinary elevation to 30.89, on the 7th of February, at the time of the last quarter. Moreover, this coincidence appeared to take place most regularly in fair and moderate weather; and, in general, when the barometer fell, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between the new or full moon and the quarters, an evident perturbation in the atmosphere accompanied; of which may be instanced February 15. to 23. when the barometer, after an uncommon rise, continued to fall rapidly after the new moon, with severe cold, which ended suddenly in stormy and wet weather: again, June 13. to 20. when two weeks of fair weather ended in a thunder storm. In the greater part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> the usual coincidence disappeared, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> took place; the barometer being low at the quarter and high at the full, amidst continual alternations of rain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>, and snow, and, for part of the time, high winds. On the two days preceding the last quarter, the barometer rose rapidly, and rain followed.\n\nOn the whole, Mr Howard thought there appeared sufficient ground, on the evidence of the year 1798, to suppose that the gravity of our atmosphere, as indicated by the barometer, may be subject to certain periodical changes, effected by a cause more steady and regular than either change of temperature, currents, or solution and precipitation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, to which he believes the whole variation has been hitherto attributed.\n\nThe mean of the register at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> appeared to be 29.89, whence it appears that the depression at the new and full moon either amounted to more, on the whole, than the elevations at the quarters, or that they fell out nearer to the time. He was quite satisfied, in passing through this register, that if he had allowed himself to choose the higher rotations about the quarters, and the lower about the new and full, with a latitude of 24 or 36 hours, it would have made the results as much more favourable to his conclusions as in the former case.\n\nNow, to omit the consideration of other proofs for the present, it appeared to him evident, that the atmosphere is subject to a periodical change of gravity, whereby the barometer, on a mean of ten years, is depressed at least one-tenth of an inch while the moon is passing from the quarters to the full and new; and elevated, in the same proportion, during the return to the quarter. To what causes shall we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> this periodical change, other than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the sun and moon for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> composing the atmosphere?\n\nThe atmosphere is a gravitating fluid, differing, in a physical\nTemperature of the Air\n\nPhysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, from the water, chiefly in possessing less gravity; and it is demonstrated *a priori* on the principles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEWTONIAN_PHILOSOPHY\">Newtonian philosophy</a>, that it ought to have its tides as well as the ocean, although in a degree as much less perceptible as is its gravity.\n\nHe supposes, therefore, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> attractions of the sun and moon at the new moon, and the attraction of the moon predominating over the sun's weaker attraction at the full, tend to depress the barometer, by taking off from the gravity of the atmosphere, as they produce a high tide in the waters, by taking off from their gravity; and, again, that the attraction of the moon being diminished by that of the sun at her quarters, this diminution tends to make a high barometer, together with a low tide, by permitting each fluid to press with additional gravity upon the earth.*\n\n**CHAP. II. Of the Changes which take place in the Temperature of the Air.**\n\nIt is obvious to the most careless observer, that the temperature of the air varies considerably even in the same place, and at the same season. This constant variation must be attributed to the reflected rays of the sun, which communicate heat from the surface of the earth to the surrounding atmosphere. As from this cause the heat of those places which are so situated as to be most warmed by the sun's rays is always greatest, and as this temperature varies in every place with the season of the year, and diminishes according to the height of the air above the surface; and as the earth at the equator is exposed to the most perpendicular rays of the sun, the earth is there hottest, and its heat diminishes gradually from the equator to the poles. Of course, the temperature of the air must vary in the same manner, being hottest over the equator, and diminishing in temperature towards the poles, where it is coldest. Though it is hottest at the equator, its heat, as in all other situations, gradually diminishes there, as we ascend above the surface of the earth.\n\nThough there is a considerable difference in every part of the world between the temperature of the atmosphere in summer and in winter; though in the same season the temperature of almost every day, and even every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, differs from that which precedes and follows it; though the heat varies continually in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and seemingly capricious manner\u2014still there is a certain mean temperature in every climate, which the atmosphere has always a tendency to observe, and which it neither exceeds nor comes short of beyond a certain number of degrees. What this temperature is, may be known by taking the mean of tables of observations kept for a number of years; and our knowledge of it must be the more accurate the greater the number of observations is.\n\nThe mean annual temperature is greatest at the equator (or at least a degree or two on the north side of it), and it diminishes gradually towards the poles, where it is least. This diminution takes place in arithmetical progression, or, to speak more properly, the annual temperatures of all the latitudes are arithmetical means between the mean annual temperature of the equator and that of the pole. This was first ascertained by Mr Meyer; and Dr Kirwan, improving on Meyer's hint, has calculated in the following table the mean annual temperature of every latitude between the equator and the pole. It must be remarked, however, that this table is calculated only for a particular part of the earth's surface, viz. that part of the Atlantic ocean which lies between the 80\u00b0 of northern, and the 45\u00b0 of southern latitude, extending westward as far as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a> stream, and to within a few leagues of the coast of America, and for all that part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific ocean</a> that reaches from 45\u00b0 of north latitude to 40\u00b0 of south latitude, and extending between the 20th and 27th degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> east from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. This part of the ocean is called by Dr Kirwan the standard, and was best suited to his purpose, as the rest of the ocean is subject to irregularities, which will be noticed presently (D).

Let the mean annual heat at the equator be $m$ and at the pole $m-n$; but $\\phi$ for any other latitude; the mean annual temperature of that latitude will be $m-n \\times \\sin \\phi^2$. If, therefore, the temperature of any two latitudes be known, the value of $m$ and $n$ may be found. Now, the temperature of north latitude 40\u00b0 has been found by the best observations to be 62.1\u00b0.\nDr Kirwan has also calculated in the following table the mean monthly temperature of the same standard (E).\n\n| Latit. | 80\u00b0 | 79\u00b0 | 78\u00b0 | 77\u00b0 | 76\u00b0 | 75\u00b0 | 74\u00b0 | 73\u00b0 | 72\u00b0 | 71\u00b0 | 70\u00b0 | 69\u00b0 | 68\u00b0 | 67\u00b0 | 66\u00b0 |

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the sine of 40\u00b0 is nearly 0.419, and the square of the sine of 50\u00b0 is nearly 0.586.

From this last equation the value of \\( n \\) is found to be nearly 53; and \\( m \\) is nearly equal to 84. The mean temperature of the equator, therefore, is 84\u00b0, and that of the pole 31\u00b0. To find the mean temperature for every other latitude we have only to find 88 arithmetical means between 84 and 31.\n\n(E) In calculating the table of mean monthly temperature, Dr Kirwan proceeded on the following principles. The mean temperature of April seems to approach very nearly to the mean temperature of the whole year, and as far as heat depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the solar rays, the mean heat of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> may be considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a>...\nIt appears from the above table that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> is the coldest month in every latitude; that July is the warmest month in all latitudes above 48\u00b0; that in lower latitudes August is generally the warmest month; that the difference between the hottest and coldest months increases according to the distance of the place from the equator. All habitable latitudes are found to enjoy a medium heat of 65\u00b0 for at least 2 months, which is a very favourable circumstance, as probably no corn could be produced under a lower medium temperature. The temperatures within 10\u00b0 of the poles differ very little, nor do they differ much within 10\u00b0 of the equator. Hence it was unnecessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> these latitudes in the table. The temperatures of different years vary but little near the equator, but this difference increases more and more as the latitudes approach the poles.\n\nIt is well known that the temperature of the atmosphere gradually diminishes according to the height of the place above the level of the sea. It was found by Dr Hutton of Edinburgh, that a thermometer kept on the top of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a>'s seat, a height of about 800 feet, usually stood 3\u00b0 lower than one kept at the foot of this hill; and Bouguer observed that on the top of Pinchincha, a height of about 15,564 feet, a thermometer stood 54\u00b0 lower than it did at the level of the sea in the same latitude.\n\nWe are indebted to Dr Kirwan for a very ingenious method of determining the rate of the diminution in the temperature in particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, having the temperature of the surface of the earth given. The temperature of the atmosphere constantly diminishing as we rise above the level of the sea, we must at a certain height arrive at a point where a perpetual congelation takes place. This point must vary in height according to the latitude, being highest at the equator, and coming gradually nearer the earth as we approach the poles; it must vary also with the season, being highest in summer, and lowest in winter. The cold on the top of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">Pin</a>-Tem of chincha was found by M. Bouguer to extend from 7\u00b0 perpetual to 9\u00b0 below the freezing point every morning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> before sunrise; hence he concluded that between the tropics the medium height of the term of congelation (where it freezes at some part of the day all the year round) should be fixed at 15,577 feet above the level of the sea; but in latitude 28\u00b0, and during the summer, at 13,440 feet. If we take the difference between the temperature at the equator, and the freezing point, this difference will bear the same proportion to the term of congelation at the equator, that the difference between the medium temperature at any other latitude and the freezing point bears to the term of congelation at that latitude. Suppose the medium heat at the equator to be 84\u00b0, the difference between which and 32\u00b0 is 52\u00b0; and suppose the medium heat of latitude 28\u00b0 to be 72\u00b0, the difference between which and 32\u00b0 is 40\u00b0. Then by the following proportion, \\( \\frac{52}{72} : \\frac{15,577}{13,440} = \\frac{1}{2} : \\frac{1}{2} \\), gives us the term of congelation at 28\u00b0.

The real mean heats of these months must be considered as an arithmetical mean between the astronomical and terrestrial heats. Thus, for latitude 51\u00b0, the astronomical heat of September being 44.6\u00b0, and the mean annual heat 52.4\u00b0, the real heat of September ought to be \\( \\frac{44.6 + 52.4}{2} = 48.5 \\). Dr Kirwan, however, after going through a tedious calculation, found the results to correspond so little with actual observation, that he drew up the table partly from calculating from principles, and partly from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of several sea journals.\nThis last height of 120 feet M. Bouger called the lower term of congelation. He also distinguished another term of congelation above which no visible vapour rises, and this he called the upper term of congelation. This line is considered by Kirwan as much less variable during the summer months than the lower line, and it has therefore been adopted by him to determine the rate of diminution in the temperature as we ascend into the atmosphere. He has calculated its height for every degree of north latitude in the following table.\n\n| N. Lat | Feet | N. Lat | Feet | N. Lat | Feet | N.

Part II.\n\nFrom the modes of estimating the diminution of temperature now given, which agree extremely well with observation, we find that the temperature diminishes in arithmetical progression, and hence we infer that the temperature of the air at a distance from the earth owing to the conducting power of the air, and not to the ascent of hot air from the surface of the earth.\n\nIt is however found that in winter the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of the air are often warmer than the lower; and this ducting superior heat, almost constantly observed in winter, is attributed by Dr Kirwan to a current of warm air from the equator, rolling towards the north pole during our winter.\n\nWe have now given the general method of finding the medium annual temperature all over the globe; but there are several exceptions to our general inferences which must be particularly mentioned.\n\nThat part of the Pacific ocean which lies between north latitude 52\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 is no broader at its northern extremity than 42 miles, and at its southern extremity its breadth scarcely exceeds 1300 miles: it is reasonable to suppose, therefore, that its temperature will be considerably influenced by the surrounding land, which consists of ranges of mountains, covered a great part of the year with snow; and there are besides a great many high, and consequently cold, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> scattered through it. For these reasons Dr Kirwan concludes, that its temperature is at least 4\u00b0 or 5\u00b0 below the standard. But we are not yet furnished with a sufficient number of observations to determine this with accuracy.\n\nIt is the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the southern hemisphere beyond the 45\u00b0 of latitude is considerably colder than the corresponding parts of the northern hemisphere. See AMERICA.\n\nSmall seas surrounded with land, at least in temperate and cold climates, are generally warmer in summer and colder in winter than the standard ocean, because they are much influenced by the temperature of the land. The gulf of Bothnia, for instance, is for the most part frozen in winter; but in summer it is sometimes heated to 70\u00b0, a degree of heat never to be found in the opposite part of the Atlantic. The German sea is above 3\u00b0 colder in winter, and 5\u00b0 warmer in summer, than the Atlantic. The Mediterranean sea is, for the greater part of its extent, warmer both in summer and winter than the Atlantic, which therefore flows into it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK_SEA\">Black sea</a> is colder than the Mediterranean, and flows into it.\n\nThe eastern parts of North America are much colder than the opposite coast of Europe, and fall short of the standard.\n\nDr Kirwan has given us the following rule for ascertaining the temperature at any required height, supposing we know the temperature of the surface of the earth.\n\nFor the temperature observed at the surface of the earth, put \\( m \\); for the given height \\( h \\), and \\( t \\) for the height of the upper term of congelation at the given latitude; then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m - 32}{t} = \\text{the diminution of temperature for every 100 feet of elevation}\n\\]\n\nor it is the common difference of the terms of the progression required. Let this common difference thus found be denoted by \\( c \\); then \\( c \\times \\frac{h}{100} \\) gives us the whole diminution of temperature from the surface of the earth to the given height. Let this diminution be denoted by \\( d \\), then \\( m - d \\) is obviously the\nstandard by about 1\u00b0 or 2\u00b0, as appears from American meteorological tables. The causes of this remarkable difference are many. The highest part of North America lies between 40\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 of latitude, and 100\u00b0 and 110\u00b0 of longitude west from London, for there the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> originate. The very height, therefore, makes this spot colder than it would otherwise be. It is covered with immense forests, and abounds with large swamps and morasses, which render it incapable of receiving any great degree of heat; so that the rigour of winter is much less tempered by the heat of the earth than in the old continent. To the east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> a number of very large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, and farther north, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUDSON_S_BAY\">Hudson's <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>; about 50 miles on the south of which there is a range of mountains which prevent its receiving any heat from that quarter. The bay is bounded on the east by the mountainous country of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABRADOR\">Labrador</a> and by a number of islands. Hence the coldness of the north-west winds and the lowness of the temperature. But as the cultivated parts of North America are now much warmer than formerly, there is reason to expect that the climate will become still milder when the country is better cleared of woods, though perhaps it will never equal the temperature of the old continent.\n\nIslands are warmer than continents in the same degree of latitude; and countries lying to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WINDWARD\">windward</a> of extensive mountains or forests are warmer than those lying to the leeward. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">Stones</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> have a less capacity for heat than earth has, which is always somewhat moist; they heat or cool, therefore, more rapidly and to a greater degree. Hence the violent heat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a> and Africa, and the intense cold of Terra del <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUEGO\">Fuego</a>. Living vegetables alter their temperature very slowly, but their evaporation is great; and if they be tall and close, as in forests, they exclude the sun's rays from the earth, and shelter the winter snow from the wind and the sun. Woody countries, therefore, are much colder than those which are cultivated.\n\nWe shall conclude this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of meteorological axioms respecting the temperature of the air, by M. Cotte.\n\n1. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> degrees of heat are almost everywhere the same; this, however, is not the case in regard to the extreme degrees of cold.\n\n2. The thermometer rises to its extreme height oftener in the temperate zones than in the torrid zone.\n\n3. It changes very little between the tropics; its variations, like those of the barometer, are greater the more one proceeds from the equator towards the poles.\n\n4. It rises higher in the plains than on mountains.\n\n5. It does not fall so much in the neighbourhood of the sea as in inland parts.\n\n6. The wind has no influence on its motions.\n\n7. Moisture has a peculiar influence on it, if followed by a wind which disperses it.\n\n8. The greatest heat, and the greatest cold, take place about six weeks after the northern or southern solstice.\n\n9. The thermometer changes more in summer than in winter.\n\n10. The coldest period of the day is before sunrise.\n\n11. The greatest heat in the sun and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> seldom takes place on the same day.\n\n12. The heat decreases with far more rapidity from September and October, than it increased from July to September.\n\n13. It is not true, that a very cold winter is the prognostic of a very hot summer.\n\nCHAP. III. Of the Changes which take place in the Air with respect to Evaporation and Rain.\n\nThere seems no reason to doubt that water exists in the atmosphere in an intermediate state between that of a fluid and that of absolute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>. This is the state of vapour, of the qualities of which it is proper that we should here take a general view.\n\nWe are indebted to the experiments of Saussure and de Luc for much of our knowledge of the qualities of vapour. It is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> invisible fluid like common air, but lighter; being to common air, according to Saussure, as 10 to 14, or, according to Kirwan, as 10 to 12; it cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> beyond a certain maximum of density, otherwise the particles of water which compose it unite together, and form small, hollow, visible vesicles, called vesicular vapour; which is of the same specific gravity with atmospherical air. It is of this vapour that clouds and fogs are composed. This maximum increases with the temperature; and at the heat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water is so great, that steam can resist the whole pressure of the air, and exist in the atmosphere in any quantity.\n\nAfter what has been stated under Chemistry with respect to the nature and properties of vapour, we have nothing here to add on that subject, except to give the result of observations that have been made on the state of vapour in the atmosphere.\n\nIt is found that the evaporation of water into the air is confined entirely to the surface, and hence it is always proportional to the surface exposed to the action of the air. Accordingly, observation shows that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> countries, and in marshy situations in the neighbourhood of lakes, rivers, &c., the evaporation is much greater than in inland countries and dry situations.\n\nIt is found that evaporation is greatest in hot weather; whence it must depend, in some degree, on the temperature of the air.\n\nthe temperature required. An example will make this rule sufficiently obvious. In latitude 56\u00b0 the heat below being 54\u00b0; required the temperature of the air at the height of 803 feet?\n\nHere \\( m = 54, t = 5533, \\frac{m - 32}{t} = \\frac{22}{54.33} = 0.404 = c \\), and \\( c \\times \\frac{h}{100} = 0.404 \\times 8.03 = 3.24 = d \\), and \\( m - d = 54 - 3.24 = 50.75 \\). Hence we see that the temperature of the air at the height of 803 feet above the surface is 50\u00b0.75.\nThe first column of the above table expresses the temperature; the second, the corresponding force of vapour; the other three columns give the number of grains of water that would be evaporated from a surface of six inches in diameter in the respective temperatures, on the supposition of there being previously no aqueous vapour in the atmosphere. These columns present the extremes and the mean of evaporation likely to be noticed, or nearly such, for the first is calculated upon the supposition of 35 grains loss per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> from the vessel of three inches and a quarter in diameter; the second 45, and the third 55 grains per minute.\n\nAs yet we have stated only the degree of evaporation that would take place under various circumstances, provided that the atmosphere were, at the time, entirely free from moisture; but as this can scarcely happen, it becomes necessary to ascertain the rate of evaporation when qualified by the vapour already existing in the atmosphere. This is readily done by first finding the force of the vapour already in the atmosphere, as above directed, and subtracting it from the force of vapour at the given temperature. The remainder is the actual force of evaporation, from which, by the last table, we find the required rate of evaporation.\nEvaporation. Suppose, for instance, it be required to know the rate of evaporation at the temperature of 59\u00b0. From the last table we see that the force of vapour at 59\u00b0 is about 0.5 or \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) its force at 212\u00b0. Now, suppose that by trials we find the force of the vapour which already exists in the atmosphere to be 0.25 or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). Subtracting the latter from the former, we have for a remainder 0.25 = the force of evaporation required, which is therefore just the half of what it would be if the atmosphere were entirely free from vapour.\n\nThe force of vapour existing in the atmosphere is scarcely ever equal to the force of vapour of the temperature of the atmosphere. Hence evaporation may, with a few exceptions, be considered as going on without intermission. Attempts have been made to ascertain the quantity of evaporation that takes place in the course of a year; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> is so difficult, that these attempts have succeeded only in obtaining approximations towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. Mr Dobson of Liverpool, from a course of experiments made in 1772, 1773, 1774, and 1775, concludes that the mean annual evaporation from the surface of water, amounted to 36.78 inches. The proportions for each month are as follows:\n\n| Inches | Inches |\n|--------|--------|\n| January | 1.50   |\n| February| 1.77   |\n| March   | 2.64   |\n| April   | 3.30   |\n| May     | 4.34   |\n| June    | 4.41   |\n| July    | 5.11   |\n| August  | 5.01   |\n| September| 3.18 |\n| October | 2.51   |\n| November| 1.51   |\n| December| 1.49   |\n\nThe experiments of Mr Dalton shew that the evaporation from the surface of water in a very dry and hot summer day, was rather more than two tenths of an inch.\n\nSeveral experiments have been made on the quantity of evaporation from land, especially by Mr Williams in America, and Dr Watson, Mr Dalton and Mr Hoyle in Britain.\n\nMr Williams's experiments appear to show that the evaporation from the surface of such land as is covered with trees and other vegetables is about one-third greater than the evaporation from the surface of water, though much reliance is not laid on these experiments.\n\nFrom an experiment made by Dr Watson during summer, when the earth had been parched by a month's drought, it appeared that 1600 gallons of water were evaporated from a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> in 12 hours*. Dr Watson's experiment, however, was of a nature that did not admit of great precision.\n\nThe experiments made by Mr Dalton and Mr Hoyle in the years 1796, 1797, and 1798, are the most exact that have been made on this subject, and we shall therefore consider them more at large. They were made with the following apparatus. Having procured a cylindrical vessel made of tin plate, three feet deep and ten inches in diameter, they inserted into it two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> directed downwards, so that water might pass through them into two bottles. One pipe was fixed near the bottom of the vessel, and the other about an inch from the top. The vessel was filled up for a few inches with gravel and sand, and all the rest with good fresh soil. It was then put into a hole in the ground, and the space around filled up with earth except on one side, for the convenience of putting bottles to the two pipes; then some water was poured on the earth to saturate it, and all that would drain off was suffered to escape. Hence the earth may be considered as saturated with moisture. The soil was kept for some weeks above the level of the upper pipe, but after that it was constantly allowed to be a little below it, thus preventing any water from running off through that pipe. The top of the soil for the first year was bare; but for the two last years it was covered with grass like other turf. The apparatus being thus prepared, a correct register was kept of the quantity of rain water which ran off from the surface of the earth by the upper pipe, as long as that was below the earth, and also of the quantity of water which passed through the three feet of earth, and ran off by the lower pipe; and a rain gauge of an equal diameter with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> was kept near it, for the purpose of measuring the quantity of rain which fell in any corresponding time. Then, by subtracting the quantity of water which passed through the pipes from that in the rain gauge, the remainder was considered as equal to the quantity evaporated from the surface of the earth in the cylinder. The mean annual result of these experiments is shown in the following table.\n\n| Water through the two pipes | Mean Rain | Mean Evap. |\n|---------------------------|-----------|------------|\n| 1796 | 1797 | 1798 | Inch. | Inch. | Inch. |\n| January | 1.897 | .680 | 1.774 | 1.450 | 2.458 |\n| February | 1.778 | .918 | 1.122 | 1.273 | 1.801 |\n| March | .431 | .070 | .335 | .279 | .902 |\n| April | .220 | .295 | .180 | .232 | 1.717 |\n| May | 2.027 | 2.443 | .010 | 1.493 | 4.177 |\n| June | .171 | .726 | \u2014 | .299 | 2.483 |\n| July | .153 | .025 | \u2014 | .059 | 4.154 |\n| August | \u2014 | \u2014 | .504 | .168 | 3.554 |\n| September | \u2014 | .976 | \u2014 | .325 | 3.279 |\n| October | \u2014 | .680 | \u2014 | .227 | 2.899 |\n| November | \u2014 | 1.044 | 1.594 | .879 | 2.934 |\n| December | .200 | 3.977 | 1.878 | 1.718 | 3.202 |\n| Rain | 6.877 | 10.934 | 7.379 | 8.402 | 33.560 |\n| Evap. | 23.725 | 27.857 | 23.862 |\nIt appears from these experiments, that at Manchester the mean annual evaporation of water is above 25 inches; and if we add to this with Mr Dalton's inches for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> which falls, the whole quantity evaporated in a year will be 30 inches. On the whole, we may perhaps estimate the mean annual evaporation from the whole surface of the globe at 35 inches from every square inch of surface, making the whole water annually evaporated over the whole globe equal to 94,450 cubic miles.\n\nWere this prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of water all to subsist in the atmosphere at once, it would increase its mass by about \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\), and raise the barometer nearly 3 inches. But this never happens; no day passes without rain in some part of the earth; so that part of the evaporated water is continually precipitated again. Indeed it would be impossible for the whole of the evaporated water to subsist in the atmosphere at once, at least in the state of vapour.\n\nThe higher regions of the atmosphere contain less vapour than the strata near the surface of the earth. This was observed both by M. de Saussure and M. de Lue.\n\nAt some height above the tops of mountains the atmosphere is probably still drier, for it was observed by Saussure, that on the tops of mountains the moisture of the air was rather less during the night than the day. And there can be little doubt that every stratum of air descends a little lower during the night than it was during the day, owing to the cooling and condensing of the stratum nearest the earth. Vapours, however, must ascend very high, for we see clouds forming far above the tops of the highest mountains.\n\nRain never begins to fall while the air is transparent; the invisible vapours first pass their maximum, and are changed into vesicular vapours; clouds are formed, and these clouds gradually dissolve in rain. Clouds, however, are not formed in all parts of the horizon at once; the formation begins in one particular spot, while the rest of the air remains clear as before; this cloud rapidly increases till it overspreads the whole horizon, and then the rain begins.\n\nIt is remarkable, that though the greatest quantity of vapour exists in the lower strata of the atmosphere, clouds never begin to form there, but always at some considerable height. It is remarkable, too, that the part of the atmosphere at which they form has not arrived at the point of extreme moisture, nor near that point, even a moment before their formation. They are not formed then because a greater quantity of vapour had got into the atmosphere than could remain there without passing its maximum. It is still more remarkable, that when clouds are formed, the temperature of the spot in which they are formed is not always lowered, though this may sometimes be the case. On the contrary, the heat of the clouds themselves is sometimes greater than that of the surrounding air*. Nor is the formation of clouds owing to the capacity of the air for combining with moisture being lessened by cold; so far from that, we often see clouds which had remained in the atmosphere during the heat of the day, disappear in the night, after the heat of the air was diminished.\n\nThe formation of clouds and rain cannot be accounted for by a single principle with which we are acquainted. It is neither owing to the saturation of the atmosphere, nor the diminution of the heat; nor the mixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRS\">airs</a> of different temperatures, as Dr Hutton supposes: for clouds are often formed without any wind at all either above or below them; and even if this mixture constantly took place, the precipitation, instead of accounting for rain, would be almost imperceptible.\n\nIt is a very remarkable fact, that evaporation often goes on for a month together in hot weather without any rain. This sometimes happens in this country; it happens every year in the torrid zone. Thus at Calcutta, during January 1785, it never rained at all; the mean of the thermometer for the whole month was 66\u00b0; there was no high wind, and indeed during great part of the month little wind at all.\n\nThe quantity of water evaporated during such a drought must be very great; yet the moisture of the air, instead of being increased, is constantly diminishing, and at last disappears almost entirely. For the dew, which is at first copious, diminishes every night; and if Dr Watson's experiment formerly mentioned be attended to, it will not be objected that the quantity of evaporation is also very much diminished. Of the very dry state to which the atmosphere is reduced during long droughts, the violent thunder-storms with which they often conclude is a very decisive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>. Now what becomes of all this moisture? It is not accumulated in the atmosphere above the country from which it was evaporated, otherwise the whole atmosphere would in a much less period than a month be perfectly saturated with moisture. If it be carried up daily through the different strata of the atmosphere, and wafted to other regions by superior currents of air, how is it possible to account for the different electrical state of the clouds situated between different strata, which often produces the most violent thunder-storms? They could not have remained in the lower strata of the atmosphere, and been daily carried off by winds to other countries; for there are often no winds at all during several days to perform this office; nor in that case would the dews diminish, nor could their presence fail to be indicated by the hygrometer.\n\nIt is impossible for us to account for this remarkable fact upon any principle with which we are acquainted. The water can neither remain in the atmosphere, nor pass through it in the state of vapour. It must therefore assume some other form; but what that form is, or how it assumes it, we know not. There are, therefore, two steps of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> which takes place between evaporation and rain, with which we are entirely unacquainted; first, the state of the vapour after it enters into the atmosphere, and second, the cause by which it is made to lay aside the new form which it assumed, return to its state of vapour, and descend in form of rain. Several theories have been contrived to account for this phenomenon, but they are all untenable on the present known laws of chemical action.\n\nThe mean annual quantity of rain is greatest at the equator, and decreases gradually as we approach the poles. Thus at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANADA\">Granada</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANTILLES\">Antilles</a>, 12\u00b0 N. Lat. it is 126 inches.\n\n| Location          | Quantity |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Fran\u00e7ois     | 19\u00b0 46'  |\n| St Domingo        | 120      |\n| Calcutta          | 22       |\n| Rome              | 23       |\n| England           | 41       |\n| Petersburgh       | 59       |\n\n*De Lue, Mete., vol. ii.\nOn the contrary, the number of rainy days is smallest at the equator, and increases in proportion to the distance from it. From N. Lat. 12\u00b0 to 43\u00b0 the mean number of rainy days is 78; from 43\u00b0 to 46\u00b0 the mean number is 103; from 46\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 it is 134; from 51\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, 161 days.\n\nThe number of rainy days is often greater in winter than in summer; but the quantity of rain is greater in summer than in winter. At Petersburgh, the number of rainy or snowy days during winter is 84, and the quantity which falls is only about 5 inches; during summer the number of rainy days is nearly the same, but the quantity which falls is about 11 inches.\n\nMore rain falls in mountainous countries than in plains. Among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANDES\">Andes</a> it is said to rain almost perpetually, while in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> it scarcely ever rains at all. If a rain-gauge be placed on the ground, and another at some height perpendicularly above it, more rain will be collected into the lower than into the higher; a proof that the quantity of rain increases as it descends, owing perhaps to the drops attracting vapour during their passage through the lower strata of the atmosphere where the greatest quantity resides. This, however, is not always the case, as Mr Copland of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUMFRIES\">Dumfries</a> discovered in the course of his experiments. He observed also, that when the quantity of rain collected in the lower gauge was greatest, the rain commonly continued for some time; and that the greatest quantity was collected in the higher gauge only either at the end of great rains, or during rains which did not last long. These observations are important, and may, if followed out, give us new knowledge of the causes of rain. They seem to show, that during rain the atmosphere is somehow or other brought into a state which induces it to part with its moisture; and that the rain continues as long as this state continues. Were a sufficient number of observations made on this subject in different places, and were the atmosphere carefully analysed during dry weather, during rain, and immediately after rain, we might soon perhaps discover the true theory of rain.\n\nRain falls in all seasons of the year, at all times of the day, and during the night as well as the day; though, according to M. Toaldo, a greater quantity falls during the day than the night. The cause of rain, then, whatever it may be, must be something which operates at all times and seasons. Rain falls also during the continuance of every wind, but oftentimes when the wind blows from the south. Falls of rain often happen likewise during perfect calms.\n\nIt appears from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> published by M. Cotte in the Journal de Physique for October 1791, containing the mean quantity of rain falling at 147 places, situated between N. Lat. 11\u00b0 and 65\u00b0, deduced from tables kept at these places, that the mean annual quantity of rain falling in all these places in 34.7 inches. Let us suppose then (which cannot be very far from the truth), that the mean annual quantity of rain for the whole is 34 inches. The superficies of the globe consists of $170,981,012$ square miles, or $686,401,498,471,475,200$ square inches. The quantity of rain, therefore, falling annually will amount to $23,337,650,812,030,156,800$ cubic inches, or somewhat more than $91,751$ cubic miles of water. This is $16,191$ cubic miles of water less than the quantity of water evaporated. It seems probable therefore, if the imperfection of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> warrant any conclusion, that some of the vapour is actually decomposed in the atmosphere, and converted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> and hydrogen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>.\n\nThe dry land amounts to $52,745,253$ square miles; the quantity of rain falling on it annually therefore will amount to $30,960$ cubic miles. The quantity of water running annually into the sea is $13,140$ cubic miles; a quantity of water equal to which must be supplied by evaporation from the sea, otherwise the land would soon be completely drained of its moisture.\n\nThe quantity of rain falling annually in Great Britain may be seen from the following table:\n\n| Years of observation | Places                  | Rain in Inches |\n|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------|\n| 3                    | Dover                   | 37.52        |\n| 5                    | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARE\">Ware</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HERTFORDSHIRE\">Hertfordshire</a>     | 23.6         |\n| 8                    | London                  | 17.5         |\n| 8                    | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KIMBOLTON\">Kimbolton</a>               | 23.9         |\n| 45                   | Lyndon                  | 22.21        |\n| 5                    | Chatsworth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DERBYSHIRE\">Derbyshire</a>  | 27.865       |\n| 8                    | Manchester              | 43.1         |\n| 18                   | Liverpool               | 34.41        |\n| 7                    | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a>               | 40.3         |\n| 5                    | Kendal                  | 61.223       |\n| 14                   | Dumfries                | 36.127       |\n| 10                   | Braxholm, 44 miles S.W. of Berwick | 31.26 |\n| 5                    | Langholm                | 36.73        |\n| 5                    | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DALKEITH\">Dalkeith</a>                | 25.124       |\n| 20                   | Glasgow                 | 31.1         |\n| 8                    | Hawkhill                | 28.966       |\n\nMean 32.532\n\nMr Dalton has estimated the quantity of rain that falls in England at 21 inches; but as no account is taken of what falls in Wales and Scotland, this estimate probably falls much short of the real annual quantity. In this country it generally rains less in March than in November, in the proportion at a medium of 7 to 12. It generally rains less in April than October, in the proportion of 1 to 2 nearly at a medium. It generally rains less in May than September; the chances that it does so are at least as 4 to 3; but when it rains plentifully in May, it generally rains but little in September; and when it rains one inch or less in May, it rains plentifully in September.\n\nThe degree of moisture that is present in the atmosphere at any given time, is measured by the hygrometer. Under the article Hygrometer we have amply described several of the most important instruments of that kind; but there is one hygrometer, viz. that of Mr Leslie, which remains to be described in this place. Figures of the instrument are given in Plate CCLXXVI, fig. 13, 14.\n\nThe principal part of the instrument is composed of Leslie's hygrometer, two glass tubes terminated by hollow balls, one transparent and the other opaque. The tubes are selected, as regular as possible, from 4 to 8 inches long, and about $\\frac{1}{10}$ of an inch thick, or as slender as those employed for\nfor thermometers, but with a much wider bore. This, in one tube, must be from $\\frac{1}{2}$ to the $\\frac{6}{5}$ of an inch in diameter, and an exact calibre, at least not differing by $\\frac{3}{5}$ between both its extremities. To the end of it a small piece of black enamel is attached, and blown into an opaque <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>, from 4 to $\\frac{7}{8}$ of an inch diameter. The corresponding tube may have its bore of the same, or rather a greater width, but its uniformity is not at all essential. Near the extremity it is swelled out into a thin cylinder, almost $\\frac{1}{8}$ of an inch wide, and from $\\frac{7}{8}$ to $\\frac{6}{5}$ long; the inner cavity only being enlarged, without altering the exterior regularity of the tube. The short bit of glass where this cylinder terminates, is now blown into a thin pellucid ball, as nearly of the size of the former as the eye can judge. The exact equality of the balls would be unattainable, and fortunately the theory of the instrument does not require it. When a dark and a bright <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> are viewed together, the latter, from an optical deception, appears always larger than the reality; and for this reason, says Mr Leslie, I prefer making the clear ball a slight degree smaller than the black one. In the mean time a coloured liquor is prepared by dissolving carmine in concentrated sulphuric acid, in a phial with a ground stopper, taking care to avoid heat, as by this the colouring-matter would be charred, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the liquor destroyed.\n\nThe tubes are now cut to nearly equal lengths, and the end of each swelled out a little, to facilitate their junction. Close to the black ball, the tube is bent by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> into a shoulder, such, that the root of the ball shall come into a line with the inner edge of the tube. This ball, being then warmed, the end of the tube is dipt into the acid liquor, and as much of it allowed to rise and flow into the cavity, as may be guessed sufficient to fill both tubes, excepting the cylinder. The two tubes are then, by the help of a blow-pipe, solidly joined together in one straight piece, without having any knot or protuberance. About half an inch from the joining, and nearer the cylinder, it is gently bent round by the flame of a candle, till the clear ball is brought to touch the tube $\\frac{4}{5}$ inch directly below the black one. The instrument is now to be graduated; and the scale chosen by Mr Leslie is that which corresponds to the centigrade thermometer. Mr Leslie thus describes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of graduating the instrument.\u2014The instrument is held in an oblique position, that the coloured liquor may collect at the bottom of the black ball, into which a few minute portions of air must, from time to time, be forced over, by heating the opposite ball with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. In this way, the interposed liquid will gradually be made to descend into the tube, and assume its proper place; and it should remain for a week or two in an inclined position, to let every particle drain out of the black ball. If any trace of fluid collects in rings within the bore, they are easily dispelled with a little dexterity and manipulation, which, though it would be difficult to describe, is most readily learnt and practised. The small cavity at the joining facilitates the rectification, by affording the means of sending a globule of air in either direction. In fixing the zero of the scale, Mr Leslie set the instrument in a remote corner of the room, or partly closed the window-shutters. When completely adjusted, the top of the coloured liquor, if held upright, should stand nearly opposite to the middle of the cylindrical reservoir.\n\nIn this state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, the instrument is ready for being graduated. The clear ball and the contiguous part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> tube are therefore covered with two or three folds of thin bibulous paper, moistened with pure water, to make it act as a hygrometer; and there is attached to the same tube a temporary scale, by means of a soft cement composed of bees-wax and rosin. A flat round piece of wood being provided with four or five pillars that screw into it, the instrument is fixed to one of them in an erect position, and on each side is disposed a fine corresponding thermometer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>, and at the same height, the one having its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> covered with wet bibulous paper. Then half a yard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> is dried as much as possible without singeing, before a good fire, and rolling it up like a sleeve, it is lapped loosely round the lower part of the pillars, and the whole is inclosed under a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>-glass. The flannel powerfully absorbs moisture from the confined air, and creates an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> dryness of 80 or 100 degrees. In the space of a quarter or half an hour, the full effect is produced, and the quantities being noted at two or three separate times, the mean results are adopted. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, measured by the temporary scale, being then augmented in the proportion of ten to the difference of the two thermometers, will give the length that corresponds to 100\u00b0. After the standard instrument is constructed, others are thence graduated with the utmost ease; the first being planted in the centre, and the rest, with their temporary scales, stuck to the encircling pillars. For greater accuracy, the observation should be made in a room without a fire, or a screen ought to be interposed between the fire and the apparatus.\n\nThe slips of ivory intended for the scales are divided into equal parts, and should contain from 100\u00b0 to 150\u00b0. The edges are filed down and chamfered, to fit easily between the parallel tubes; and they are secured in their place by a strong solution of isinglass. The lower ball and its annexed cylinder, are covered with thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> as the upper ball, and a few threads are likewise lapped about that part of the tube which it touches. The instrument is lastly cemented into a piece of wood, either end of which admits a cylindrical case that serves equally to protect or to hold it. On other occasions, the hygrometer is inserted into the socket of a round bottom-piece where it stands vertical.\n\nThe above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> refers particularly to fig. 14. Fig. 13 differs from this, only in having the balls of an equal height, and bended in opposite directions, which Mr Leslie considers as more convenient for some purposes to which the instrument is applied, to be mentioned hereafter, but which renders the instrument less portable.\n\nThe action of this hygrometer depends on the following principle; That the cold produced by evaporation will accurately denote the degree of dryness of the air, or its distance from the point of saturation. To discover the dryness or humidity of the air, therefore, we have only to find the change of temperature induced in a body of water insulated, or exposed on all sides to evaporation. The steps which led Mr Leslie from these simple\nsimple principles to the construction of the present ingenious instrument, are detailed by him in a paper published in Nicholson's Journal for January 1830, to which we must refer our readers for the particulars, contenting ourselves with the following summary view.\n\nIf two thermometers be filled with any expansible fluid, and having the bulb of the one wet and the other dry, they will, by their difference, denote the state of the air in respect to humidity. Mr Leslie's object was to combine two such instruments, so that they should indicate merely their difference of temperature; and this object he has completely attained by the present instrument. In ordinary cases, the intermediate liquor would continue stationary; for the air in both balls having the same temperature, and consequently the same elasticity, the opposite pressures would precisely counteract each other; but if, from the action of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air on the moistened surface, one ball became colder, it is manifest the liquor would be pushed towards it by the superior elasticity of the air included in the other ball, so as to mark, by the space of its approach, the depression of temperature induced by evaporation.\n\nThis instrument does not merely point out the dryness of the air; it enables us to determine the absolute quantity of moisture which it is capable of imbibing; for the conversion of water into steam is found to consume $524^\\circ$ of the centigrade <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>; and evaporation, analogous in its effects, may be presumed to occasion the same waste of heat. If, therefore, air had the same capacity as water, for each degree of the hygrometer it would deposit as much heat as it would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> by dissolving the $\\frac{7}{8}$ part of its weight of humidity. But the capacity of air is to that of water as 11 to six, and consequently it would require in that proportion a greater evaporation to produce the same effect. We may hence conclude, that for each hygrometric degree, the air would require $\\frac{11}{6} \\times \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{77}{48}$ or $\\frac{1}{6}$ part by weight of water to effect saturation.\n\nStrictly speaking, the degrees marked by this hygrometer do not measure the dryness of the air at its actual temperature, but only its state of dryness when cooled down to the standard of the wet ball. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, however, being known of the dissolving power of air as affected by heat, it is easy, from the disposition of the air with respect to humidity at one temperature to derive that at any other. It will suffice to mention the result of a number of careful experiments:\u2014Supposing air at the freezing point to be capable of holding 50 parts of moisture; at $10^\\circ$ centigrade, it will hold 100; at $20^\\circ$, 200; at $30^\\circ$, 400; thus doubling at each increase of $10^\\circ$. Hence a table may be constructed by which these conversions will be easily made.\n\nTo omit nothing that tends to elucidate the theory of the instrument, we must observe that the air in its contact with the humid surface is not absolutely cooled to the same temperature; the air and water really meet each other at an intermediate point determined by their compounded density and capacity. Consequently the indications of the hygrometer ought to be augmented by the $\\frac{1}{8}$ part, or $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{8}$. But this quantity is too small in any case to be regarded. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HYGROMETRY\">Hygrometry</a>, Supplement.\n\nIn considering the subject of winds, we shall first briefly detail their natural history, so far as it has not been already anticipated, and shall then endeavour to trace the laws by which they are regulated, or explain the manner in which their varieties are produced. As the direction of the winds is of the greatest consequence, especially in a commercial view, we shall first point out the direction of the most prevalent winds in various quarters of the world.\n\nBetween the tropics the winds are the most regular. Tradewinds lie nearest the equator, there is a regular wind during the whole year called the trade-wind. On the north side of the equator it blows from the north-east, varying frequently a point or two towards the north or east; and on the south side of it, from the south-east, changing sometimes in the same manner towards the south or east. The space included between the second and fifth degrees of north latitude is the internal limit of these two winds. There the winds can neither be said to blow from the north nor the south; calms and violent storms are frequent. This space varies a little in latitude as the sun approaches either of the tropics. In the Atlantic ocean the trade-winds extend farther north on the American than on the African coast; and as we advance westward, they become gradually more easterly, and decrease in strength. Their force diminishes likewise as we approach their utmost boundaries. It has been remarked also, that as the sun approaches the tropic of cancer, the south-east winds become gradually more southerly, and the north-west winds more easterly; exactly the contrary takes place when the sun is approaching the tropic of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPRICORN\">capricorn</a>.\n\nThe trade-wind blows constantly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> ocean from $10^\\circ$ south latitude to near $30^\\circ$; but to the northward of this the winds change every six months, and blow directly opposite to their former course. These regular winds are called monsoons, from the Malay word moossin, which signifies a season. When they shift their direction, variable winds and violent storms succeed, which last for a month, and frequently longer; and during that time it is dangerous for vessels to continue at sea.\n\nThe monsoons in the Indian ocean may be reduced to two; one on the north and another on the south side of the equator; which extend from Africa to the longitude of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-NEW_HOLLAND\">New <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> and the east coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, and which suffer partial changes in particular places from the situation and inflection of the neighbouring countries.\n\nBetween $3^\\circ$ and $10^\\circ$ of south latitude the south-east trade-wind continues from April to October; but during the rest of the year the wind blows from the north-west. Between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMATRA\">Sumatra</a> and New Holland this monsoon blows from the south during our summer months, approaching gradually to the south-east as we advance towards the coast of New Holland; it changes about the end of September, and continues in the opposite direction till April. Between Africa and Madagascar its direction is influenced by the coast; for it blows\nWinds blow from the north-east from October to April, and during the rest of the year from the south-west.\n\nOver all the Indian ocean to the northward of the third degree of south latitude, the north-east trade-wind blows from October to April, and a south-west wind from April to October. From <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BORNEO\">Borneo</a>, along the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALACCA\">Malacca</a> and as far as China, this monsoon in summer blows nearly from the south, and in winter from the north by east. Near the coast of Africa, between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOZAMBIQUE\">Mozambique</a> and Cape Guardafui, the winds are irregular during the whole year, owing to the different monsoons which surround that particular place.\u2014Monsoons are likewise regular in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RED_SEA\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> sea; between April and October they blow from the north-west, and during the other months from the south-east, keeping constantly parallel to the coast of Arabia.\n\nMonsoons are not altogether confined to the Indian ocean; on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a>, between Cape St Augustine and the island of St Catharine, the wind blows between September and April from the east or north-east, and between April and September from the south-west. The bay of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PANAMA\">Panama</a> is the only place on the west side of a great continent where the wind shifts regularly at different seasons: there it is easterly between September and March; but between March and September it blows chiefly from the south and south-west.\n\nSuch in general is the direction of the winds in the torrid zone all over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans; but they are subject to particular exceptions, which we shall now endeavour to enumerate. On the coast of Africa, from Cape Bayador to Cape Verde, the winds are generally north-west; from thence to the island of St Thomas near the equator they blow almost perpendicular to the shore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> gradually as we advance southwards, first to the west and then to the south-west. On the coast of New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> likewise, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALIFORNIA\">California</a> to the bay of Panama, the winds blow almost constantly from the west or south-west, except during May, June, and July, when land-winds prevail, called by the Spaniards Popogayos. On the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHILI\">Chili</a> and Peru, from 25\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 south latitude, to the equator, and on the parallel coast of Africa, the wind blows during the whole year from the south, varying according to the direction of the land towards which it inclines, and extending much farther out to sea on the American than the African coast. The trade-winds are also interrupted sometimes by westerly winds in the bay of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPEACHY\">Campeachy</a> and the bay of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONDURAS\">Honduras</a>.\n\nAs to the countries between the tropics, we are too little acquainted with them to be able to give a satisfactory history of their winds.\n\nIn all maritime countries between the tropics, of any extent, the wind blows during a certain number of hours every day from the sea, and during a certain number towards the sea from the land; these winds are called the sea and land breezes. The sea breeze generally sets in about 10 in the forenoon, and blows till six in the evening; at seven the land breeze begins and continues till eight in the morning, when it dies away. During summer the sea breeze is very perceptible on all the coasts of the Mediterranean sea, and even sometimes as far north as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>.\n\nVol. XIII.

The south-west winds are also most frequent at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>, and next to them are the north-east.\n\nThe following table of the winds at Lancaster has been drawn up from a register kept for seven years at winds at that place.\n\nWinds.

We learn from the Statistical Account of Scotland, that the south-west is by far the most frequent wind all over that kingdom, especially on the west coast. At Saltcoats in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AYRSHIRE\">Ayrshire</a>, for instance, it blows three-fourths of the year; and along the whole coast of Murray on the north-east side of Scotland, it blows for two-thirds of the year. East winds are common over all Great Britain during April and May; but their influence is felt most severely on the eastern coast.\n\nThe following table exhibits a view of the number of days during which the westerly and easterly winds blow in a year, at different parts of the island. Under the term westerly are included the north-west, west, south-west, and south; the term easterly is taken in the same latitude.\n\n| Years of observation | Places          | Wind |\n|---------------------|-----------------|------|\n|                     |                 | Westerly | Easterly |\n| 10                  | London          | 233    | 132     |\n| 7                   | Lancaster       | 216    | 149     |\n| 51                  | Liverpool       | 190    | 175     |\n| 9                   | Dumfries        | 227.5  | 137.5   |\n| 10                  | Braxholm        | 232    | 133     |\n| 7                   | Cambuslang      | 214    | 151     |\n| 8                   | Hawkhill near Edin. | 229.5 | 135.5   |\n| Medium              |                 | 220.3  | 144.7   |\n\nIn Ireland, the south-west and west are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> trade-winds, blowing most in summer, autumn, and winter, and least in spring. The north-east blows most in spring, and nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> to what it does in autumn and winter. The south-west and north-west are nearly equal, and are most frequent after the south-west and west.\n\nAt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a> the prevailing winds are the east and south-east; at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOCKHOLM\">Stockholm</a>, the west and north. In Russia, from an average of a register of 16 years, the winds blow from November to April in the following order:\n\nW. N.W. E. S.W. S. NE. N. SE.\nDays 45 26 23 22 20 19 14 12\n\nAnd during the other six months,\n\nW. N.W. E. S.W. S. N.E. N. S.E.\nDays 27 27 19 24 22 15 32 18\n\nThe west wind blows during the whole year 72 days; the north-west 53, the south-west and north 46 days each. During summer it is calm for 41 days, and during winter for 21. In Norway the most frequent winds are the south, and south-west and south-east. The wind at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERGEN\">Bergen</a> is seldom directly west, but generally south-west or south-east; a north-west, and especially a north-east wind, are but little known there.\n\nFrom the whole of these facts, it appears that the most frequent winds on the south coasts of Europe are the north, the north-east and north-west, and on the western coast the south-west; that in the interior parts which lie most contiguous to the Atlantic ocean, southwest winds are also most frequent; but that easterly winds prevail in Germany. Westerly winds are also most frequent on the north-east coast of Asia.\n\nIt is probable that the winds are more constant in the south temperate zone, which is in a great measure covered with water, than in the north temperate zones, where their direction must be frequently interrupted and altered by mountains and other causes.\n\nM. de la Bailie, who was sent thither by the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> to make astronomical observations, informs us, that at the Cape at the Cape of Good Hope the main winds are of Good south-east and north-west; that other winds seldom last longer than a few hours; and that the east and northeast winds blow very seldom. The south-east wind blows in most months of the year, but chiefly from October to April; the north-west prevails during the other six months, bringing along with it rain, and tempests, and hurricanes. Between the Cape of Good Hope and New Holland the winds are commonly westerly, and blow in the following order: north-west, south-west, west, north.\n\nIn the great South sea, from latitude 35\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 in the Pacific ocean, the south-east trade-winds blow most frequently, especially when the sun approaches the tropic of Capricorn; the wind next to it in frequency is the north-west, and next to that is the south-west.\n\nThus it appears that the trade-winds sometimes extend farther into the south temperate zone than their usual limits, particularly during summer; that beyond their influence the winds are commonly westerly, and that they blow in the following order: north-west, south-west, west.\n\nWe have now considered pretty much at large the Theory of direction of the winds in different parts of the earth's surface. Another very curious part of the history of the winds relates to their violence, and the effects with which they are attended, or to the history of hurricanes, whirlwinds, tornadoes, &c. Of some of these we have already treated under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> Hurricane and Harmattan; and the confined limits of this article oblige us to refer our readers for more particulars to Capper's Observations on the Winds and Monsoons.\n\nAs to the velocity of the wind, its variations are almost infinite, from the gentlest breeze, to the hurricane which tears up trees and blows down houses. Our most violent winds take place when neither the heat nor the cold is greatest; violent winds generally extend over a large tract of country, and they are accompanied with sudden and great falls in the mercury of the barometer. The wind is sometimes very violent at a distance from the earth, while it is quite calm at its surface. On one occasion Lunardi went at the rate of 70 miles an hour in his balloon, though it was quite calm at Edinburgh when he ascended, and continued so during his whole voyage.\nA pretty good idea of the velocity of the wind, under different circumstances, may be formed from the following table, which was drawn up by Mr Smeaton.\n\n| Miles per Hour | Feet per Second | Perpendicular force on one square foot, in Avoirdupois pounds and parts |\n|----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1              | 1.47            | .005 Hardly perceptible.                                               |\n| 2              | 2.93            | .020 Just perceptible.                                                |\n| 3              | 4.4             | .044 Gently pleasant.                                                 |\n| 4              | 5.87            | .079 Pleasant, brisk.                                                 |\n| 5              | 7.33            | .123 Very brisk.                                                      |\n| 10             | 14.67           | .492 High wind.                                                       |\n| 15             | 22.             | 1.107 Very high wind.                                                 |\n| 20             | 29.34           | 1.968 Storm or tempest.                                               |\n| 25             | 36.67           | 3.075 Great storm.                                                    |\n| 30             | 44.01           | 4.429 Hurricane.                                                      |\n| 35             | 51.34           | 6.027 Hurricane that tears up trees and carries buildings before it.   |\n| 40             | 58.68           | 7.873                                                               |\n| 45             | 66.01           | 9.963                                                               |\n| 50             | 73.35           | 12.300                                                               |\n| 60             | 88.02           | 17.715                                                               |\n| 80             | 117.36          | 31.490                                                               |\n| 100            | 146.7           | 49.200                                                               |","sp":754,"ep":774},{"h":"METEOROMANCY","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a> by meteors, principally by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>.

He early discovered a fondness for polite literature and the sciences; and went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a> with the son of Barneveldt, whom he accompanied in his travels. In 1610 he was made professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>, and afterwards Greek professor. In the following year, the magistrates of the United Provinces proved how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> was of his abilities, by fixing on him to write the history of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Meursius married in the year 1612. His wife, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNA\">Anna</a> Catharina Bilberbeccia, descended from a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in Angermund a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Pomerania, possessed many amiable qualities, and rendered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> remarkably happy, while he discharged the duties of his professorship with an assiduity equal to his abilities. At the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the republic of letters did not lose the advantages to be derived from his labours; for during the fourteen years of his residence at Leyden, the works which he published were more numerous than those which had been presented to the world by the whole body of professors from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> foundation of the university in 1575.\n\nMeursius's writings had now spread his reputation in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; nor was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of his diligence and talents as a professor less known. In so high a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, indeed, did he stand among his literary contemporaries, that Christian IV. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a> conferred on him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of historiographer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a>, and invited him to undertake the professorship of history and politics in the academy of Sora, which was founded by King Frederick II., although the revival of its honours and dignities may be dated from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, when it seemed to be again founded under the auspices of Christian IV. Meursius and his family left Leyden in the year 1635. On his arrival at Sora, he was received with the most friendly tokens of regard by his majesty and the Danish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, and more particularly by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a> Rosenkrantz, on whom he has bestowed very ample praises in one of his letters. Here he resided, equally beloved and admired, for above twelve years. His pupils were not very numerous, but his exertions never relaxed. Those hours likewise which were not devoted to the duties of his professorship, he employed in revising the works of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> and in philological disquisitions.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> did not suffer by the intenseness of application, till in the year 1638 he had a violent attack of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, from which disorder he had suffered severely. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Vossius he thus describes his melancholy condition: \"The state of my health during the whole of the last winter has been truly deplorable. My sufferings from the stone have been really dreadful. I have voided so many, that the repeated discharges brought on a wound which emitted...\"\nMaurusius' blood for above four months. I was next attacked by a tertian fever, which increased constantly, and produced an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> lassitude of body, a dejection of spirits, and a total loss of appetite. But, thank <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, I have now in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> recovered my strength, and gotten the better of these complaints.\" He recovered from this attack; but in the following year the disorder returned with redoubled violence, and brought on a consumption, which terminated his existence on the 29th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of September 1639. He left behind him a son who was named after him, and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>.\n\nSo mild were the dispositions of Maurusius, that in all his writings he constantly avoided literary disputes. He was sometimes unavoidably drawn into them; but constantly endeavoured to promote a reconciliation rather than widen any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a>, by his replies to the attacks of his adversaries. In his friendships he was firm and affectionate. Of his domestic life, whatever is known has been gathered from his letters. The same easy tranquillity seems to have attended him in every situation. In his family he was particularly fortunate. In his son, to whom he gave his own name, he seemed to behold his own youth renewed. The same application, the same eagerness in the pursuit of knowledge, marked the conduct of this promising young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; who did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> survive his father, but died soon after he had recommended himself to the notice of the learned world by his publications. They were only three in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>; but displayed so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> learning that they have been assigned to the father, John Maurusius, by l'Abb\u00e9 Beughem and others. This mistake was occasioned as much by the similitude of their names, as by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of their works, and their manner of treating philological subjects.\n\nHis works may be divided into four classes, of which each might form a separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were ever to be republished. Maurusius himself indeed, in one of his letters to Vossius, proposes such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>. From that epistle, and from another which the younger Maurusius sent to G. I. Vossius, who strongly advised him to republish the whole of his father's writings, and from the collections of his posthumous works which have appeared from Struvius, Groschupsius, Moller, and some others, a catalogue of his works might be formed. Some assistance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> also be derived from the indexes published in their respective works, by Hankins, Desselius, Wettenius, and Bartholinus. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> which Maurusius recommends for publishing his works, is to insert in the first volume all that he has written relative to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, his historical pieces; in the third his miscellaneous dissertations; and in the fourth, the various authors which he published, with his notes and corrections.\n\nA scandalous and indecent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, which is entitled *Maurusii elegantiae Latini sermonis*, and has *Aloisia Siggeae Satyrae Sataliceae* annexed to it, is very falsely attributed to Maurusius; nor indeed are the *Satires* with more reason assigned to Aloisia Siggea, who was a Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> eminent for her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>. The real author of these infamous productions was Westremius, an advocate at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>, who probably assumed the name of Maurusius, in order to shield himself from the disgrace which would naturally have attended the writer of such a performance.","sp":794,"ep":795},{"h":"MEVANIA","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>, a town of the Cisapennine Umbria; seated at the confluence of the Tina and Clitumnus, on the Via Flaminia, famous for its herds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> cattle brought up there for sacrifice; the white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> said to be owing to the waters of the Clitumnus (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>).

They were expelled, as we are told, from their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> (supposed by Clavigero to have been Tollan, to the northward of Mexico) in the year 472; and for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> led a wandering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. In whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> they determined to reside for any considerable time, they erected houses and cultivated the ground. Thus their migrations were extremely slow, and it was not till 104 years after they set out that they reached a place about 50 miles to the eastward of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Mexico, where they settled for 20 years, giving to their new place of residence the name of Tollanizinco. From thence they proceeded about 40 miles farther to the west, where they built a city called, from the name of their country, Tollan, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TULA\">Tula</a>.\n\nAfter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> settlement of the Toltecans, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> was changed into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>. Their first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> began his reign in 667, and their monarchy lasted 384 years, during which time they reckon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> eight princes. We are not, however, to imagine that each of their kings lived <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> enough to make up this space. It was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> among them that the name of the king should be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for 52 years, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer, from the time he ascended the throne. If he died within that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the government was carried on in his name by a regency; if he survived, he was obliged to resign his authority. During the four centuries that the Toltec monarchy continued, they had increased very considerably in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and had built many cities; but when in the height of prosperity, almost the whole...\nwhole nation was destroyed by a famine occasioned by drought; and a pestilence, probably the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the former. \"According to Torquemada (says our author), at a certain festival-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> made by the Toltecans, the sad-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a> appeared to them of a gigantic size, with immense arms, and in the midst of the entertainment he embraced and suffocated them; that then he appeared in the form of a child with a putrid head, and brought the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>; and, finally, at the persuasion of the same devil, they abandoned the country of Tula.\"\n\nThey were succeeded by the Chichemecas, a much more barbarous people, who came from an unknown country called Amaquemecan, where they had for a long time resided; but of which no traces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> can be found among any of the American nations known to Europeans; so that Clavigero supposes it must have been very far to the northward.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> which the Chichemecas had for leaving their own country is not known. They were eighteen months on their journey, and took possession of the desolate country of the Toltecs about a hundred years after the former had left it. They were much more uncivilized than the Toltecs; but, however, had a regular form of monarchical government, and in other respects were less disgusting in their manners than some of the neighbouring nations. The last king who reigned in Amaquemecan before the departure of the Chichemecas, had left his dominions between his two sons Auchcauhltli and Xolotl, and the latter conducted the new colony. Having proceeded from the ruins of Tula towards Chempoalla and Tepepolio, Xolotl sent his son to survey the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> crossed the borders of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> which surround the vale of Mexico; then ascending to the top of a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> one, he viewed the whole country, and took possession of it in the name of his father, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> four arrows to the four winds.\n\nXolotl being informed by his son of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the country, chose for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of his kingdom Tenayuca, about six miles to the northward of the city of Mexico, and distributed his people in the neighbouring territory; but as most of them went to the northward, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> obtained the name of the country of the Chichemecas, in distinction from the rest. Here a review of the people was taken, and their number, according to Torquemada, was more than a million.\n\nXolotl finding himself peacefully settled in his new dominion, sent one of his officers to explore the sources of some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> of the country. While performing this task he came to the habitations of some Toltecs, who it seems had still kept together, and were likely once more to become a nation. As these people were not inclined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and greatly esteemed for their knowledge and skill in the arts, the Chichemecas entered into a strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with them, and married a Toltec princess. The consequence of this alliance was the introduction of the arts and knowledge of the Toltecs among the Chichemecas. Till now the latter had subsisted entirely by hunting, and such fruits and roots as the earth spontaneously produced. They were clad in the skins of wild beasts, and, like these beasts, they are said to have sucked the blood of the animals they caught; but after their connection with the Toltecs they began to sow corn, to learn the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> and working <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, to cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, manufacture cotton, and, in every respect, to make great improvements.\n\nWhen Xolotl had reigned about eight years in his new territories, an embassy of six persons arrived from a distant country not far from Amaquemecan, expressing a desire of coming with their people to reside in the country of the Chichemecas. The king gave them a gracious reception, and assigned them a district; and, in a few years after, three other princes, with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of Acolhuans, who were likewise neighbours of Amaquemecan, made their appearance. The king was at that time at Tezcuco, to which place he had removed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>; and here he was accosted by the princes, who, in a submissive and flattering manner, requested him to allow them a place in his happy country, where the people enjoyed such an excellent government. Xolotl not only gave them a favourable reception, but offered them his two daughters in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, expressing his concern that he had no more, that none might have been excluded from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> alliance. On the third prince, however, he bestowed a noble virgin of Chalco, in whom the Toltec and Chichemecan blood were united. The nuptials were celebrated with extraordinary pomp; and the two nations, after the example of the sovereigns, continued to intermarry. As the Acolhuans were the more civilized nation of the two, the name of Chichemecas began to be appropriated to the more rude and barbarous part, who preferred hunting to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, or chose a life of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> in the mountains to the restraints of social laws. These barbarians associated with the Otomies, another savage nation who lived to the northward, occupying a tract of more than three hundred miles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; and by their descendants the Spaniards were harassed for many years after the conquest of Mexico.\n\nAs soon as the nuptial rejoicings were over, Xolotl divided his territories into three parts, assigning one the domain to each of the princes. Acolhuatzin, who had married his eldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>, had Azocopazalco, 18 miles to the westward of Tezcuco; Chiconquauhtli, who married the other, had a territory named Xaltocan; and Tzontecomatl, who married the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, had one named Coatlichan. The country continued for some time to flourish, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> increased greatly, and with it the civilization of the people; but as these advanced, the vices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> and ambition increased in proportion. Xolotl found himself obliged to treat his subjects with more severity than formerly, and even to put some of them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. This produced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> against him, which, however, he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to escape; but while he meditated a severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> on the conspirators, he was seized with the distemper of which he died, in the fortieth year of his reign, and in a very advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.\n\nXolotl was succeeded by his son Nopaltzin, who at the time of his accession is supposed to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> about sixty years of age. In his time, the tranquillity of the kingdom, which had begun to suffer disturbance under his father, underwent much more violent shocks, and civil wars took place. Acolhuatzin, the only one of the three princes who remained alive, thinking the territory he possessed too narrow, made war upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of a neighbouring province named Tapotzlan.\nAmong the Aztecas was a person of great authority, named Huiztilin, to whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> every one paid the utmost deference. He had conceived a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to persuade his countrymen to change their residence; and to effect this he fell upon the following stratagem. Having heard, while meditating on his scheme, a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> singing on the branches of a tree, the notes of which resembled the word Tikari, which in the Azteca <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> signified \"let us go,\" he took that opportunity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> of the people. With this view, he took along with him a respectable person, and made him attend to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> of the bird. \"What can it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> (says he), but that we must leave this country, and find ourselves another? Without doubt it is the warning of some secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> who watches over our welfare: let us obey, therefore, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, and not draw his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> upon us by a refusal.\" Tecpaltzin, for that was the name of his friend, readily agreed to the interpretation; and both of them being persons of great influence, their united persuasions soon gained over to their project the bulk of the nation, and they accordingly set out.\n\nThe Aztecas, when they left their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> habitations, were divided into six tribes; but at Culiacan the of the Mexicans were left with their god* by five of them, viz. the Xochimilcas, Tepanecas, Chalcece, Tlahuicas, and Tlascalans. The cause of this separation is not known, but it was probably occasioned by some disagreement among themselves; for the remaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> was divided into two violent factions, which persecuted one another: neither did they afterwards construct any more edifices. However, they always travelled together, in order to enjoy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of their imaginary god. At every place where they stopped an altar was erected to him; and at their departure they left behind them all their sick, and probably also some others to take care of them, or such as were not willing to endure the fatigue of farther journeys. They stopped in Tula <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years, and eleven more in the neighbouring parts. At last, in 1216, they arrived at Zumpanco, a considerable city in the vale of Mexico, where they were received in a very hospitable manner by the lord of that district. He not only assigned them proper habitations, but became very much attached to them; and even demanded from among them a wife for his son Illucicatli. This request was complied with; and from this marriage all the Mexican kings descended.\n\nThe Mexicans continued to migrate from one place to another along the lake of Tezcuco. Xolotl, who was then on the throne of the Acolhuans or Chichemecas, allowed them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in whatever places of his dominions they thought proper; but some of them finding themselves harassed by a neighbouring lord, were obliged in 1245, to retire to Chapultepec, a mountain on the western borders of the lake, scarcely cut, two miles distant from the site of Mexico. This took place in the reign of Nopaltzin, when disturbances began to take place in the Acolhuan dominions. The Mexicans, however, did not find themselves any more secure in their new place of residence than formerly: they were persecuted by the neighbouring lords, and obliged to take refuge in a number of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, named Avocolco, at the southern extremity of the lake of Mexico. Here for 52 years they lived in the most miserable\nmiserable manner, subsisting on fish, insects, roots, &c., and clothing themselves with the leaves of the amoxtli, which abounds in that lake.\n\nIn this miserable plight the Mexicans continued till the year 1314, when they were reduced to a state of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>. This was done by the king of a petty state named Colhuacan, who, it is said, being unwilling to allow the Mexicans to maintain themselves in his territories without paying tribute, made war upon them, subdued and enslaved them. Others affirm that, pretending compassion for their miserable situation, he offered them a more commodious place of residence. The Mexicans readily accepted the offer; but had scarcely set out to take possession of their new place of residence when they were attacked by the Colhuans, made prisoners, and carried off for slaves.\n\nAfter some years a war broke out betwixt the Colhuans and Xochimilcas, in which the latter gained such advantages, that they were obliged to employ their slaves to assist them. They accordingly ordered them to prepare for war, but without furnishing them with arms necessary for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> enterprise; so that the Mexicans were obliged to content themselves with long staves, having their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> hardened in the fire; they also made knives of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> itztli, and shields of reeds woven together. They agreed not to waste their time in making prisoners, but to content themselves with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> of their enemies, and then leaving them without farther injury. They adhered punctually to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>; and rushing furiously upon the Xochimilcas, cut off an ear from as many as they could, killing those who struggled to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> that they could not effect their purpose. In short, so well did the Mexicans acquit themselves in this engagement, that the Xochimilcas fled, and took refuge among the mountains. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, the Colhuan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> presented themselves before their general with the prisoners they had taken, by the number of which alone they judged of their valour. The Mexicans had taken only four, and these they kept concealed for the abominable purpose of sacrificing them. The Colhuans, therefore, seeing no trophies of their valour, began to reproach them with cowardice; but the Mexicans, producing their baskets of ears, desired them to judge from these how many prisoners they might have taken, had they not been unwilling to retard their victory by taking up time in binding them.\n\nNotwithstanding the valour displayed by the Mexicans in this engagement, it doth not appear that their haughty masters were in the least inclined to afford them easier terms than before. Having erected an altar to their god, they demanded of their lord something precious to offer in sacrifice to him; but he disdain sent them a dirty cloth, enclosing the filthy carcass of a vile bird. This was carried by Colhuan priests; and without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> laid upon the altar. The Mexicans, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> unconcern, removed this filthy offering, and put in its place a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> made of itztli, and an odoriferous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERB\">herb</a>. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of consecration, the Colhuan prince attended with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>; not with a view to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to the festival, but to make a mockery of the Mexicans. Their derision, however, was soon changed into horror, when the Mexicans, after a solemn dance, brought forth the four Xochimilcan prisoners they had taken; and, after having made them dance a little, cut open their breasts with the knife which lay on the altar, and plucking out their hearts, offered them, while yet palpitating with life, to their diabolical idol. This had such an effect upon the spectators, that both king and subjects desired the Mexicans immediately to quit their territories and go where they pleased. This order was instantly obeyed: the whole nation took their route towards the north, until they came to a place named Acatzitzintlan, situated betwixt two lakes, and afterwards named Mexicalizinco; but for some reason or other, being discontented with this situation, as indeed they seem very often to have been, they proceeded to Ixtocatco, still nearer to the site of Mexico. Here they formed the image of a little mountain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, and danced round it a whole night, singing their victory over the Xochimilcas, and reuniting thanks to their god for having freed them from the yoke of the Colhuans. Clavigero is of opinion, that by this mountain they represented Colhuacan, as in their pictures it was always represented by a hunch-backed mountain; and this is the literal signification of the name.\n\nThe city of Mexico was founded in the year 1325, the city in the most incommodious situation we can imagine, Mexico viz. on a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> named Tenochtitlan, in the middle of a great lake, without ground to cultivate for their subsistence, or even room sufficient to build their habitations. Their life was therefore as miserable here for some time as it had been when they were on the islands at the end of the lake, and they were reduced to the same shift to maintain themselves. To enlarge the boundaries of their island, they drove palisades into those parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> which were most shallow, terracing them with stones and turf, and uniting to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> island several other smaller ones which lay in the neighbourhood. To procure to themselves afterwards stones, wood, &c. for constructing their habitations, as well as clothing and other necessaries, they instituted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> with the people who dwelt on the borders of the lake, supplying them with fish, waterfowl, and other more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> inhabitants of the lake and marshes, which they contrived to render eatable; and in return for all this they received the necessaries above mentioned. The greatest effort of their industry, however, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of floating gardens, by means of bushes and the mud of the lake; and these they brought to such perfection that they produced maize, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, chia, French beans, and gourds.\n\nFor thirteen years that the Mexicans had to struggle with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> difficulty, they remained at peace; but no sooner did they begin to prosper and live comfortably, than the inveterate enmity betwixt the two factions broke out in all its fury. This produced a separation; and one of the parties took up their residence on a small island at a little distance to the northward, which, from a heap of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> found there, they at first named Xaltitlaco, but afterwards Tlatelolco, from a terrace constructed by themselves. This island was afterwards united to that of Tenochtitlan.\n\nAbout this time the Mexicans divided their city into four parts, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> which still subsists; each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> having now its tutelar saint, as it had formerly its tutelar god. In the midst of their city was the sanctuary of their great god Mexitli, whom they constantly preferred to all the rest. To him they daily performed acts\nacts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a>; but instead of making any progress in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, they seem to have daily improved in the most horrible barbarities, at least in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. The dreadful sacrifices made of their prisoners, could only be exceeded by that which we are now about to relate. Being now on a more respectable footing than formerly, they sent an embassy to the petty king of Colhuacan, requesting him to send them one of his daughters, that she might be consecrated the mother of their protecting god. The unsuspecting prince readily complied with their desire.\u2014The unfortunate princess was conducted in great triumph to Mexico; but no sooner was she arrived, than she was sacrificed in a shocking manner; and, to add to the horror of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>, the body was flayed, and one of the bravest young men of the nation dressed in her skin. Her father, ignorant of this dreadful transaction, was invited by the Mexicans to be present at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOTHEOSIS\">apotheosis</a> of his daughter, and went to see the solemnity, and to worship the new divinity. He was led into the sanctuary, where the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> stood clothed in the bloody skin of his daughter; but the darkness of the place prevented him from seeing what was before him. They gave him a censer in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPAL\">copal</a> to begin his worship; but having discovered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of the copal the horrible spectacle, he ran out in a distracted manner, calling upon his people to revenge the injury; but this they were not able to do at that time nor ever after.\n\nIn the year 1352 the Mexican government was changed from an aristocracy to a monarchy. At first they were governed by 20 lords, of whom one had an authority superior to the rest. This naturally suggested the idea of monarchy; and to this change they were also induced by the contemptible state in which their nation still continued, thinking that the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> would confer upon it a degree of splendour which otherwise it could not enjoy; and that by having one leader, they would be better able to oppose their enemies. Proceeding, therefore, to elect a king, the choice fell upon Acamapitzin, a man of great estimation among them, and descended from Opochli, a noble Aztecan, and a princess of the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Colhuacan. As he was yet a bachelor, they attempted to negotiate a marriage, first with the daughter of the lord of Tacuba, and then of the king of Azcapozalco; but these proposals being rejected with disdain, they applied to Acolmiztli lord of Coatlichan, and a descendant of one of the three Acolhua princes; who complied with their request, and the nuptials were celebrated with great rejoicings.\n\nIn the mean time, the Tlatelolcos, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> rivals of the Mexicans, resolved not to be behind them in anything which had the least appearance of augmenting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of their state. They likewise, therefore, chose a king; but not thinking proper to choose him from among themselves, they applied to the king of the Tepanecas, who readily sent them his son; and he was crowned first king of Tlatelolco in 1353. In this the Tlatelolcos seem to have had a design of humbling their rivals, as well as rendering themselves more respectable; and therefore it is probable that they had represented the Mexicans as wanting in that respect due to the Tepanecan monarch, as having elected a king without his leave, though at the same time they were tributaries to him. The consequence of this was, that he took a resolution to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> their tribute. Hitherto they had paid only a certain number of fish and waterfowl; but now they were ordered to bring also several thousands of fir and willow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> to be set in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> and gardens of Azcapozalco, and to transport to the court a great floating garden, which produced vegetables of every kind known in Anahnae. This being accomplished with great difficulty, the king commanded them next year to bring him another garden, with a duck and swan in it both sitting upon eggs; but so, that on their arrival at Azcapozalco the brood might be ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HATCH\">hatch</a>. This was also done; and the prince had the satisfaction of seeing the young birds come out of the eggs. The third year they were ordered to bring a live stag along with a garden. This was more difficult than any of the former tasks; because they were obliged, in order to hunt the stag, to go to the mountains of the continent, where they were in danger of falling into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of their enemies; however, this also was accomplished, and the desire of the king gratified.\n\nIn this manner the Mexicans were oppressed for no less than 50 years. They freed themselves, however, from all their difficulties by vigorous exertions, absurdly ascribing to the protection of that malevolent being whom they worshipped the glory of every deliverance. Acamapitzin governed this city, which at that time comprehended the whole of his dominions, for 37 years in peace. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> being barren, he married another wife, but without abandoning the first; and these two, instead of being rivals to one another, lived together in the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>; the first wife taking upon herself the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of educating Huitzilihuatl, the son of the second. He had, besides, several children by other women, and one named Hizcoatl, who afterwards proved one of the best and most renowned kings who sat on the throne of Mexico. He is said also to have conquered four considerable cities; but Clavigero thinks he must in this only have been an auxiliary, it being very improbable, that while he could scarce maintain his own territories, he should think of foreign conquests.\n\nAcamapitzin died in 1389, greatly lamented by the Mexicans, and his death was followed by an interregnum of four months. As the deceased monarch had formerly resigned his authority into the hands of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, it was necessary that a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> should take place; and when this was done, the choice fell upon Huitzilihuatl, the son of Acamapitzin. As he was still unmarried, it was resolved, if possible, to procure him an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> and advantageous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a>. With this view, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> of second nobility was sent to the king of Azcapozalco, requesting, in very humble terms, an alliance with one of his daughters. The expressions made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of by these ambassadors are said by our author to have been particularly elegant in the Mexican language; but it is difficult to understand how a speech made among a people ignorant of the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> could be particularly recorded at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a> of years after. They are as follow: \"We beseech you, with the most profound respect, to take compassion on our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> and your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> Huitzilihuatl, confined among the thick rushes of the lake.\u2014He is without a wife, and we without a queen.\u2014Vouchsafe, Sir, to part with one of your jewels or most...\"\nThis piece of oratory had such an effect upon the king, that he granted their request, and a Tepanecan princess was conducted in great triumph to Mexico, where the marriage was solemnized with the utmost joy. Though this princess brought him a son the first year of their marriage, the king, in order to strengthen himself by fresh alliances, married also the daughter of another prince, by whom he had Montezuma Ilhucamin, the most celebrated of all the Mexican kings.\n\nAs the Mexicans advanced in wealth and power, so did their rivals the inhabitants of Tlatelolco.\u2014Their first king died in 1399, leaving his subjects greatly improved in civilization, and the city much enlarged and beautified. The rivalry which subsisted between the two cities had indeed greatly contributed to the aggrandizement of both. The Mexicans had formed so many alliances by marriage with the neighbouring nations, had so much improved their agriculture and floating gardens on the lake, and had built so many more vessels to supply their extended commerce and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>, that they were enabled to celebrate their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> year, answering to A.D. 1402, with greater magnificence than they had ever done since they left their original country of Atztlan.\n\nAll this time Techotlala, the son of Quinatzin, continued to reign in Acolhuacan, and for 30 years enjoyed uninterrupted tranquillity; but being now very far advanced in years, and finding his end approach, he called to him his son Ixtlilxochitl, and recommended to him to beware of the ambitious disposition of the king of Azcapozalco, as he was apprehensive that he might attempt something against the peace of the empire. His suspicions were verified; for on the death of Techotlala, which happened in 1406, the king of Azcapozalco, without making the usual submissions to the new king, to whom he was a feudatory, set out for his own territories, with a view to stir up the other feudatory princes to rebellion. Having called to him the kings of Mexico and Tlatelolco, he told them, that Techotlala, who had long tyrannized over that country, being dead, he designed to procure freedom to the princes, so that each might rule his own territory entirely independent of the king of Acolhuacan; but for this purpose he needed their assistance, and trusted to their well known spirit to take part with him in the enterprise. He informed them likewise, that in order to ensure success, he would find means to unite other princes in the confederacy.\n\nThe new king of Acolhuacan, in the mean time, was employed in settling the affairs of his kingdom, and endeavouring to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the good will of his subjects. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> against him was soon discovered; but though Ixtlilxochitl was desirous of heading his army in person, he was dissuaded from so doing by his courtiers; so that the conduct of the war was committed to his generals. To weaken the enemy, they ravaged the territories of six revolted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a>; but, notwithstanding this, and the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> of the royal army, the war was carried on by the rebels with great obstinacy, their armies being constantly recruited by fresh troops in proportion to their losses. At last, after three years of a ruinous war, the king of Azcapozalco, finding that his resources would at last fail him, sued for peace; but with a design of accomplishing by treachery what he had not yet been able to do by force. His adversary, equally reduced with himself, consented to a peace, though he knew very well that the Tepanecan prince intended to observe it no longer than suited his purpose.\n\nIn the year 1409 died Huitzilhuitl king of Mexico, Chimalpoca third king of Mexico, who likewise left the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of electing a successor to the nobility. They made choice of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Chimalpocapoca; and from thence it became an established <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a> to choose one of the brothers of the deceased king, or, if he had no brothers, to elect one of his grandsons. While the new prince was endeavouring to secure himself on the throne, the treacherous Tezozomoc used all means in his power to strengthen the party he had formed against the king of Acolhuacan. In this he was attended with such success, that the unfortunate prince found himself reduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of wandering among the neighbouring mountains, at the head of a small army, accompanied by the lords of Huexotla and Coatlichan, who remained always faithful to him. The Tepanecans distressed him to such a degree, by intercepting his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, that he was forced to beg of them of his enemies. One of his grandsons was Distress sent to Otompan, a rebel state, to request them to and death supply their king with the provisions he stood in need of, and to exhort them to abandon the cause of the canrebels, which they had espoused. No task could be more dangerous; yet such was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a> of the young prince's disposition, that he readily set out on the journey; nor was he deterred by the information he got that there were in the place certain Tepanecans who had come on purpose to publish a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> from Tezozomoc. He went boldly to the most public place of the town, and in presence of those who published the proclamation made known his request. This heroism, however, did not meet with the success it deserved. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> were derided from the moment they were made; but the people did not offer any farther insult, until one of the meaner sort threw a stone at him, exciting others of the same stamp to put him to death. The Tepanecans, who had hitherto continued silent, perceiving their opportunity, joined in the general cry to kill the prince, and began also to throw stones. The prince attempted first to defend himself, and afterwards to escape by flight; but, both being equally impossible, he fell under a shower of stones. The Tepanecans, exulted in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of treachery, and soon after cut off Ixtlilxochitl himself, after having treacherously persuaded him to a conference with two of their captains. This perfidious act was committed in sight of the royal army, who were too weak to revenge it; the royal corpse was saved with difficulty; and Nezahualcoyotl, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> apparent to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, was obliged to shelter himself among the bushes from the fury of his enemies.\n\nTezozomoc having now in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> gained Acolhuacan point, proceeded to pour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> his troops upon those cities and districts which had remained faithful to the late unfortunate monarch. The people made a most desperate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, and killed vast numbers of their enemies; but at last being themselves reduced by the calamities of war, and in danger of total extermination, they were obliged to quit their habitations and fly\nfly to other countries. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>, then, finding himself superior to all his adversaries, gave Tezcuco in fief to Chimalpopoca king of Mexico, Huexotla to Tlacacotl king of Tlatelolco; placing faithful governors in other places, and appointing Azcapozaleo, the capital of his own territory, the royal residence and capital of Acolhuacan.\n\nPrince Nezahualcoyotl was present in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> at this disposal of his dominions, along with several other persons of distinction who were enemies of the tyrant; and so much was he transported with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, that it was with difficulty he could be restrained from killing Tezozomoc on the spot, though this would certainly have been done at the expense of his own life. All the rest of the Acolhuacan empire submitted; and Nezahualcoyotl <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> himself for the present deprived of all hopes of obtaining the crown.\n\nTezozomoc had now attained the summit of his ambition: but instead of conciliating the minds of his new subjects, oppressed them with new taxes; and being conscious of the precarious situation in which he stood, and tormented with remorse on account of his crimes, fell into melancholy, and was constantly haunted with frightful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a>. He was now become so old, that his body no longer retained its natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>. He was therefore obliged to be covered up with cotton in a great cradle, not being able to sit erect in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>. In this miserable condition, however, he never forgot his tyranny or cruelty. From his cradle he issued oppressive laws relating to the Acolhuacans; and almost with his last breath renewed his commands with regard to Nezahualcoyotl. At last he expired in the year 1422, leaving the crown to his son Tajatzin.\n\nTezozomoc was no sooner dead than Maxtlaton, without paying the least regard to his father's will, began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> the functions of a sovereign. Though it was the right of Tajatzin to invite to his father's funeral whom he pleased, Maxtlaton took that upon himself. Nezahualcoyotl, though not invited, came among the rest; but though Teuctzintli, brother to Maxtlaton, insisted upon his being put to death, the latter opposed it, as it could not then be done privately, and he hoped to find another opportunity. No sooner were the funeral ceremonies over, however, than Maxtlaton behaved in such a manner to his brother Tajatzin, that the prince thought proper to retire to Chimalpopoca king of Mexico, to whom he had been particularly recommended by his father, in order to have his advice. This monarch, agreeable to the character of that age and people, advised him to invite his brother to an entertainment, and then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> him. Unluckily for them both, this discourse was overheard by a servant, who in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of a reward informed the tyrant of what he had heard: but instead of this, Maxtlaton, pretending to disbelieve his story, drove the informer from his presence with ignominy. Notwithstanding this pretence, the tyrant had not the least doubt of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of what was told him; and therefore determined to rid himself of his brother without delay. This he soon accomplished in the very same way that had been projected against himself. Tajatzin, along with the kings of Mexico, Tlatelolco, and some other feudatory princes, were invited by Maxtlaton to an entertainment. The king of Mexico prudently excused himself, but the unsuspecting Tajatzin fell into the snare. He came to the place of entertainment, and was instantly put to death. The company were greatly alarmed; but Maxtlaton, having explained to them his reasons for so doing, they not only excused him, but proclaimed him king; to which it is not to be doubted that their fears greatly contributed.\n\nThough the king of Mexico escaped a sudden death by his absence at this time, it was only to perish in a more slow and ignominious manner. The vengeance of Maxtlaton first appeared by sending him a woman's dress in return to the present he sent him as a feudatory; which being a reflection upon his courage, was the highest affront that could be offered him. This insult, however, was quickly followed by one of a much higher nature. Having heard that one of the Mexican prince's wives was an extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, he enjoined some Tepanecan ladies who were accustomed to visit that princess, to invite her to spend some days with them at Azcapozaleo. This being complied with, the tyrant easily got an opportunity of ravishing her, and then sent her back to her husband. Chimalpopoca was so much affected by this misfortune, that he resolved to offer himself up a sacrifice to his god. Maxtlaton, however, was resolved that he should not have even this satisfaction. At the very time of the ceremony, therefore, he sent a body of troops; who entering Mexico without resistance, carried off the king alive, to the astonishment of the multitude; and who probably were so much confounded by this unexpected adventure, that they did not think of making any resistance.\n\nChimalpopoca being carried prisoner to Azcapozalco, was confined in a strong wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAGE\">cage</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> prison for criminals. Maxtlaton still was not satisfied: he wished to get into his hands Nezahualcoyotl; and with this view sent a message to him, pretending that he was willing to come to an agreement with him respecting the kingdom of Acolhuacan. Though the prince was well assured of the tyrant's treacherous intentions, he went boldly to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, presented himself before him, and told him that he had heard of the imprisonment of the king of Mexico; he had heard also that he wished to take away his own life; he desired him to do so, and to gratify his malice. Maxtlaton was so struck with this speech, that he assured the prince he had not formed any design against his life, and that he neither had put to death the king of Mexico, nor would do so. He then gave orders for his being properly entertained, and even allowed him to pay a visit to the king of Mexico in prison. The unfortunate Chimalpopoca, after reciting his misfortunes, requested the prince not to return to court, where they would certainly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> upon some project for taking away his life; and having pathetically recommended to him the care of his subjects, made him a present of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> pendant and some other jewels he wore; after which they took a last farewell.\n\nIn the mean time, the Mexicans raised to the throne Itzcoatl, the son of Acamapitzin by a slave, and who was accounted the most prudent, just, and brave, of all the Mexican nation. His election was no less pleasing who assists to Nezahualcoyotl and his party, than it was offensive Nezahualcoyotl to Maxtlaton. An alliance was quickly concluded between...\nbetween the exiled prince and the king of Mexico; and this was soon followed by the commencement of hostilities on the part of the former. His first enterprise was against the city of Tezcuco, which he determined to take by assault, but was prevented by the submission of the inhabitants. He put to death, however, all the officers established by the tyrant; and all the Tepanecans he found there. The very same day another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> city named Acolman was furiously attacked by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of his army; great numbers put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, and among the rest the governor, who was brother to Maxtlaton; and the same day also Coatlichan was taken by the Chalcece.\n\nThe Mexican monarch, hearing of the successes of his ally, sent an embassy to congratulate him upon them. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> was a son of king Huitzilihuatl, named Montezuma, who for his invincible courage and great qualities was surnamed the man of great heart and the archer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. The journey was extremely dangerous; but Montezuma undertook it without any fear, accompanied by another nobleman. They got in safety to the place where the prince was; but had the misfortune to be taken prisoners, and were carried to Chalco; the lord of which city, named Tototzin, was an inveterate enemy to the Mexicans. By him he was immediately put in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> confinement, under the care of one Quateozin, who was inviolably attached to the Mexican <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>.\n\nOrders were given to the latter to provide no sustenance for the prisoners; but what was prescribed by his lord, until the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of death which they were to suffer should be determined. Tototzin then sent his prisoners to them, that they might be sacrificed there if they thought proper. These people, however, rejected the proposal with disdain; on which Tototzin, thinking to regain the favour of Maxtlaton, informed him of the prisoners he had in his possession. But Maxtlaton called him a double-minded traitor, and commanded him instantly to set the prisoners at liberty. Before this answer arrived, however, Quateozin had instructed the prisoners how to make their escape, and directed them also not to return by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> lest they should again be intercepted, but to embark at a certain place, and proceed by water to Mexico. They followed his advice exactly; and having got to the place to which they were directed, arrived safely at their city, to the great surprise and joy of the inhabitants.\n\nTototzin, enraged at the loss of his prisoners, put Quateozin to a cruel death, destroying also all his family excepting one son and a daughter; of whom the latter fled to Mexico, where she was highly honoured on her father's account. Maxtlaton, too, notwithstanding his generosity to the prisoners (which Clavigero derives from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> opposition to Tototzin), prepared to wage a formidable war with the Mexicans, who had agreed to unite their troops with those of the prince. The Mexican populace, terrified at engaging so powerful an enemy, demanded that their king should submit and beg for peace. So great was the tumult, that the king himself was obliged to consent; and it required the utmost exertions of Montezuma's eloquence to persuade the people to agree to a commencement of hostilities. This being done at last, the king next called together the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> nobility, and asked which of them would have the courage to carry an embassy to the king of the Tepanecans? This adventure appeared so hazardous, that all of them kept a deep silence, until Montezuma declared himself willing to undertake the arduous enterprise. He was ordered to propose peace to Maxtlaton, but to accept of no dishonourable conditions; to which he punctually adhered. Maxtlaton refused to give any immediate answer, but promised to give one next day, after he had consulted his nobility. Montezuma, dreading some treachery if he staid all night, promised to return next day; which he did, and was told that Maxtlaton had determined upon war. Montezuma then performed the ceremony of challenging him, by presenting him with certain defensive weapons, anointing his head, and fixing feathers upon it, as was customary to do with dead persons. Lastly, he protested, in the name of his master, that as Maxtlaton would not accept of the offered peace, he and all the Tepanecans would infallibly be ruined. Maxtlaton showed not the least sign of displeasure, but gave Montezuma arms in like manner to present to the king of Mexico; and directed him, for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> security, to return in disguise through a small outlet from the palace. Montezuma followed his advice; but as soon as he found himself out of danger, began to insult the Tepanecan guards; and though they rushed violently upon him, he not only escaped from their attack, but killed one or two of them.\n\nOn his return to Mexico, the populace were again thrown into the utmost consternation by the news that war was inevitable, as the chiefs of the two nations had challenged one another. They now requested the king to allow them to retire from their city, of which they supposed the ruin to be certain. The king encouraged them with the hopes of victory. \"But if we are conquered (replied they), what will become of us?\" \"If that happens (answered the king), we are that moment bound to deliver ourselves into your hands, to be made sacrifices at your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>.\" \"Be it so (replied they); if we are conquered; but if we obtain the victory, we and our descendants are bound to be tributary to you; to cultivate your lands and those of your nobles; to build your houses; and to carry for you, when you go to war, your arms and baggage.\"\n\nMatters being thus settled, intelligence was sent to Prince Nezahualcoyotl to repair with his army to Mexico, which he did without delay; and the day after his arrival a furious engagement took place. The Tepanecan army was commanded by a general named Mazatlan; Maxtlaton himself not judging it proper to quit his capital. The soldiers on both sides fought with the utmost bravery; but towards night the Mexicans, disheartened by seeing the army of their enemies continually increasing in number, began once more to lose their courage and talk of surrendering. The king, greatly concerned, asked Montezuma what should be done to dissipate the fears of the people? That brave prince replied, that they must fight till death; that if they died with their arms in their hands, it would be honourable; but to survive their defeat, would be eternal ignominy. Nothing could be more salutary than this advice at so critical a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a>: for the Mexicans were already begun to implore the mercy of their enemies, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> to sacrifice their chiefs, whose ambition had brought the whole nation into\ninto such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DILEMMA\">dilemma</a>. On hearing this, the whole body of nobility, with the king and Montezuma, at their head, assaulted the enemy so furiously, that they repulsed them from a ditch of which they had taken possession; after which, Montezuma, happening to encounter Mazatl the Tepanecan general, struck him such a blow on the head that he fell down lifeless. Thus the Mexicans were inspired with fresh courage, and their enemies proportionally dispirited: however, they retired for that night to the city, in some hopes of being able to retrieve their fortune next day. Maxtlaton encouraged them by every method in his power; but fortune proved still more unfavourable than the day before. The Tepanecans were now entirely defeated, and the city of Azcapozalco taken. Maxtlaton, who seems not to have had the courage to fight, had not now the presence of mind to fly. He attempted indeed to hide himself; but being quickly discovered, he was beaten to death with sticks and stones. The city was plundered, the inhabitants butchered, and the houses destroyed by the victors.\n\nThis victory proved decisive in favour of the confederates. Every other place of strength in the country was quickly reduced, until the Tepanecans, finding themselves on the verge of destruction, sent an humble embassy to the king of Mexico, requesting to be taken under his protection, and to become tributaries to him. Itzcoatl received them graciously; but threatened them with total extirpation if they violated the fidelity they had sworn to him.\n\nItzcoatl, after this extraordinary success, took care to have the above-mentioned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> ratified between the nobility and common people, by which the latter were bound to perpetual services. Those who had discouraged the soldiers in time of battle were banished for ever from the state of Mexico; while Montezuma and others who had distinguished themselves by their bravery, were rewarded with lands, as was usual with other conquerors.\n\nItzcoatl, now finding himself firmly seated on the throne of Mexico, set about performing his engagements to the Acolhuacan prince, by seating him on the throne of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>. Having again joined their armies, they marched against Huaxota, a city which refused to submit, even though terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> were offered them. Instead of this, they rashly ventured a battle, in which they were entirely defeated; and were then fain to send a deputation of their old men, pregnant women, &c. as was customary in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of distress, to move the enemy to compassion. At last all obstacles being removed, Nezahualcoyotl was seated on the throne of Acolhuacan, the auxiliary troops were dismissed, and Itzcoatl left at liberty to pursue his conquests, in which he was still assisted by the king of Acolhuacan. The first expedition was against Cojolhuacan, and other two Tepanecan cities, who had not only refused submission themselves, but excited others to shake off the yoke also. The war against them proved bloody. Three battles were fought, in which Itzcoatl gained no other advantage than making the enemy retreat a little; but in the fourth, while the two armies were hotly engaged, Montezuma, with a body of chosen troops, which he had placed in ambuscade, attacked the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-REAR_GUARD\">rear-<a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> of the rebels with such vigour, that they were soon disordered; and obliged to fly to the city. The conquerors pursued them thither; and Montezuma perceiving that they intended to fortify themselves in the greater temple, frustrated their design by getting possession of it and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> the turret. By this disaster they were so much terrified, that they fled to the mountains south of Cojolhuacan; but even there the royal army overtook and pursued them more than 30 miles, till they came to another mountain, where, quite exhausted with fatigue, and seeing no means of escape, they were obliged to surrender at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>.\n\nHaving thus happily accomplished the conquest of Cojolhuacan and the other rebellious cities, the two kings returned to Mexico. Itzcoatl gave great part of the Tepanecan country, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of king of Tacuba, to Totoguiahuitzin, a grandson of Tezozomoc, but who does not appear to have been any concerned in his projects against the Mexicans. An alliance was then formed among the three kings on the following terms: The king of Tacuba held his crown on condition of serving the king of Mexico with all his troops, at any time when required; for which he can, and was to have a fifth part of the spoils taken from the Tepaneca enemy. The king of Acolhuacan was likewise to assist the king of Mexico in war; and for this he was to have a third part of the plunder, after deducting the share of the king of Tabuca; and the remainder was to belong to the king of Mexico. The kings of Tacuba and Acolhuacan, were both declared honorary electors of the kings of Mexico; the real electors being four nobles: and the king of Mexico was likewise bound to assist in the wars of his allies whenever it was demanded.\n\nAfter having thus settled matters among themselves, and rewarded their soldiers, Itzcoatl set out with Nezahualcoyotl for Tezcuco, where the Acolhuacan king was crowned with all possible ceremony. Here the new king took every method which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> could suggest to establish his authority on a permanent basis; but while he was thus employed, the Xochimilcas, fearing lest the Mexicans might conquer their country as they had done that of the Tepanecans, held a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> on what was to be done to prevent such a disgrace. In this council it was determined to commence hostilities against that rising state, before it should become more formidable by new conquests. Itzcoatl was no sooner informed of this determination, than he sent quests. Montezuma with a great army against them. The Xochimilcas met him with one still more numerous; but being worse disciplined, they were quickly defeated, and their city taken in a very short time after. This conquest was followed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Cuitlahnae, situated on a small island in the lake of Chalco. Their insular situation gave them confidence to attack the formidable power of the Mexicans. The king was so sensible of the difficulty of this enterprise, that he proposed to attack them with the whole force of the alliance: Montezuma, however, with only a small number of men of his own training, whom he furnished with proper vessels, reduced them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> days.\n\nItzcoatl died in the year 1436, at a very advanced age, in the height of prosperity, and was succeeded by Montezuma I., the greatest monarch that ever sat on the Mexican throne. Before his coronation, in order to comply with the barbarous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> of his religion,\ngion, he made war upon the Chalce, in order to procure the prisoners who were to be sacrificed at his coronation; and scarce was this ceremony over, when a new war commenced, which terminated in the destruction of that city. This quarrel happened between the Chalce and the Tezucans. Two of the royal princes of Tezcuco having gone a-hunting on the mountains which overlook the plains of Chalco, while employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>, and separated from their retinue, with only three Mexican lords, fell in with a troop of Chalce soldiers; who, to gratify the cruelty of their master, carried them all prisoners to Chalco. The cruel and inconsiderate tyrant who commanded there instantly put them all to death: after which he caused their bodies to be salted, dried, and placed in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> of his palace, where they served as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a> to the pine torches burned there for lights every evening. The king of Tezcuco, overwhelmed with grief, and to the last degree exasperated at such an inhuman act, called for the assistance of the allied kings. The city was attacked at once by land and water. The inhabitants, knowing that they had no mercy to expect, fought like men in despair. Even the old tyrant who commanded them, though unable to walk, caused himself to be carried in a litter among the combatants; notwithstanding which they were totally defeated, and the most severe vengeance executed upon them.\n\nMontezuma, on his return, found himself obliged to encounter an enemy more formidable on account of his vicinity, than more powerful ones at a distance. This was the king of Tlatelolco, who had formerly conspired against the life of Itzcoatl; and finding himself disappointed in this, had tried to reduce his power by entering into a confederacy with some of the neighbouring lords. At that time his designs proved abortive, but he resumed them in the time of Montezuma; the consequence of which was, that he was defeated and killed. One Moquihuix was chosen in his room; in whose election it is probable that Montezuma had a considerable share. This was followed by conquests of a much more important nature. The province of Cuitlaxcas, lying to the southward, was added to his dominions, comprehending a tract of country more than 150 miles in breadth; then, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> to the westward, he conquered another named Tzompahuacan. This success, however, was for a short time interrupted by a war with Atonaltzin, lord of a territory in the country of the Mixtacas. This prince, puffed up on account of the great wealth he possessed, took it into his head that he would allow no Mexican to travel through his country. Montezuma sent ambassadors to know the reason of such strange conduct; but Atonaltzin gave them no other answer than showing them some part of his wealth, making a present to the king, and desiring them from thence to observe how much the subjects of Atonaltzin loved him; and that he willingly accepted of war, which was to determine whether he should pay tribute to the Mexicans or the Mexicans to him. Montezuma having informed his allies of this insolent answer, sent a considerable army against Atonaltzin, but had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> to be informed of its defeat; in consequence of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of Atonaltzin was increased to a great degree. Montezuma, greatly chagrined at this first check, determined to head his next army in person; but before he could call together another, Atonaltzin had drawn into a confederacy with him the Huexotzincaes and Tlascalans, who were glad of the opportunity, as they supposed, of reducing the power of the Mexicans. Their numbers, however, availed but little; Montezuma in the very first engagement totally defeated the confederate army. The allies of Atonaltzin were particularly unfortunate; for such of them as were not killed in the field of battle, were destroyed by their own party out of revenge for the unfortunate event of the dominions enlarged.\n\nBy this victory the Mexican monarch became master not only of the dominions of Atonaltzin, but of many other neighbouring princes, against whom he made war on account of their having put to death some Mexican <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> or couriers without any just cause. The conquest of Cuatlachitlan or Cotasia, however, which he attempted in 1457, proved a much more difficult task. This province lies on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of the Mexican <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a>, and had been formerly inhabited by the Olmecans, whom the Tlascalans had driven out. The inhabitants were very numerous; but dreading the power of Montezuma, called in those of Tlascalan, together with the Huexotzincaes, to their assistance. Along with these the allies drew the Cholulans also into the confederacy; so that this seems to have been the most formidable combination that had yet been formed against the Mexican power. Montezuma collected an excellently equipped army; which, however, he did not on this occasion command in person. It contained a great number of persons of very high rank, among whom were three princes of royal blood, and Moquihuix king of Tlatelolco already mentioned. The combination of the three republics against Mexico was not known at court when the army set out; but Montezuma, being informed of it soon after, sent an order to his generals to return. This accorded so ill with the romantic notions of valour entertained by the Mexicans, that a consultation of the generals was held whether they should obey it or not. At last it was determined that the king's order should be obeyed; but no sooner was this agreed to than Moquihuix accused them all of cowardice, and threatened, with his own troops, unassisted, to go and conquer the enemy. His speech had such an effect upon them all, that they went to meet the confederates. The Cotastcse fought with great valour, but were unable to resist the royal forces; and their allies were almost totally destroyed. Six thousand two hundred of them were taken prisoners, and soon after sacrificed to the Mexican god of war in the barbarous manner already described. The victory was said to have been owing principally to the valour and good conduct of Moquihuix, insomuch that to this day a song made in his praise on that occasion is known in Mexico. Montezuma was so well pleased with the victory, that he not only forgave the disobedience of his orders, but bestowed upon Moquihuix a princess, one of his own cousins, to wife.\n\nDuring the reign of this great monarch a violent inundation happened in Mexico. The lake, swelled by the excessive rains which fell in the year 1446, poured its waters into the city with so much violence that\nmany houses were destroyed, and the streets inundated to such a degree that boats were everywhere made use of. The inundation was soon followed by a famine. This was occasioned by the stinting of the crop of maize in 1448; the ears while young and tender being destroyed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>. In 1450 the crop was totally lost for want of water; and in 1451, besides the unfavourable seasons, there was a scarcity of seed. Hence, in 1452, the necessities of the people became so great, that they were obliged to sell themselves for slaves in order to procure subsistence. Montezuma permitted them to go to other countries for support; but being informed that many sold themselves for a few days provision, he ordered, by proclamation, that no woman should sell herself for less than 400 ears of wheat, nor any man for less than 500. He opened also the public granaries for the relief of the lower classes; but nothing was able to stop the progress of the famine.\n\nMontezuma was succeeded by Axayacatl, who like his predecessor instantly commenced a war, for no other reason than that he might have prisoners to sacrifice at his coronation. He pursued Montezuma's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of conquest; in which, however, he was less successful, many of the provinces reduced by that monarch having revolted after his death, so that it was necessary to reconquer them. On his returning successful from one of these expeditions, he built a new temple, to which he gave the name of Coatlan; but the Tlatelolcos, whose ancient rivalry seems to have revived on the death of Montezuma, built another in opposition, which they called Coaxotolotl. Thus the former hatred between the two nations was renewed, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCORD\">discord</a> took place which ended in the ruin of the Tlatelolcos.\n\nThe Mexicans sustained an irreparable loss in 1469 and 1470 by the death of their allies the kings of Tacuba and Acolhuacan.\n\nThe king of Tacuba was succeeded by his son Chimalpopoca, and the Acolhuacan monarch by his son Nezahualpilli. A short time after the accession of the latter, the war broke out between the Tlatelolcos and Mexicans, which ended in the destruction of the former. King Moquihuix had been married by Montezuma to a sister of Axayacatl, now on the throne of Mexico; but it appears that this princess never was greatly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his affection. On the contrary, he took all methods of expressing his dislike, either out of enmity to herself, or envy of the superior greatness of her brother. Not content with this, he entered into an alliance with a great number of the neighbouring states, in order to reduce the Mexican greatness. His wife, however, being informed of this scheme, communicated the particulars to her brother; and soon after, being impatient of the ill usage she received, came to Mexico with her four sons to claim the protection of her brother. This uncommon accident exasperated the Mexicans and Tlatelolcos against each other to such a degree, that wherever they met, they fought, abused, and murdered each other. The king of Tlatelolco prepared for war with many horrid ceremonies, of which the drinking of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> blood was one. A day was appointed for attacking Mexico. Xiloman, lord of Colcuacan, was to begin the attack, afterwards to pretend flight, in order to induce the Mexicans to follow him; after which the Tlatelolcos were to fall upon their rear.\n\nFor some reason, however, with which we are not acquainted, the Tlatelolcos began the attack without waiting for Xiloman; the consequence of which was, that he retired in disgust, leaving them to finish their battle the best way they could. The engagement lasted till night, when the Tlatelolcos were obliged to retire. Axayacatl, during the night, disposed of his troops in all the roads which led to Tlatelolco, appointing them to meet in the market-place. The Tlatelolcos, finding themselves attacked on all sides, retired gradually before the Mexicans, until at last they were forced into the market-place, where they found themselves worse than ever on account of its narrowness, which did not allow them room to act. The king stood on the top of the great temple, encouraging his men to exert themselves against the enemy. His words, however, had now lost their usual influence. He not only was not obeyed, but was reproached with cowardice because he did not come down and fight among the rest. At last the Mexicans arrived at the temple, and ascended to the balcony where the king was. He made a desperate defence for a little; but by a violent push in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> was thrown backwards upon the steps of the temple, and stunned or perhaps killed by the fall.\n\nThe Tlatelolcos being thus reduced, Axayacatl next set out on an expedition against the Matlazincas, a tribe in the vale of Toluca, who still refused to submit to the Mexican yoke. Having proved successful in this expedition, he undertook to subdue also the northern part of the valley, now called Valle de Ixtlahuacan, particularly Xiquipilco, a considerable city and state of the Otomies, whose chief was much renowned for strength and bravery. Axayacatl, who likewise valued himself on these qualities, encountered him in single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>. In this, however, he was overmatched, and received a violent wound in the thigh; after which he would have been taken prisoner, had not some young Mexicans made a desperate effort for his rescue. Notwithstanding this disaster, Axayacatl's army gained a complete victory, carrying off 11,060 prisoners among whom was the chief of the Otomies himself, and two of his officers who had attacked the king. These chiefs were put to death at an entertainment of the allied kings, the sight of their agonies not interrupting in the least the mirth of the feast; so much were they familiarized to the shedding of human blood.\n\nHe was succeeded by his elder brother Tizoc, who intended to have built a larger temple than any that had yet been seen in Mexico, though that originally built had been greatly enlarged by some of his predecessors. For this purpose he collected a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of materials; but before he could bring his projects to bear, he was taken off by a conspiracy of his subjects. During the reign of Tizoc, the Acolhuacans made war upon the Huexotzincoas, ruined their city, and conquered their territory. Nezahualpilli also, the Acolhuacan monarch, though he had already several wives, had not made any of them queen, having wished to confer that honour upon one of the royal family of Mexico. Tizoc readily gave him one of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a>-daughters, who had a sister of singular beauty named Xocotzin. The friendship betwixt these two ladies was such, that the one could\nnot think of being separated from the other; for which reason the new queen sought and obtained permission to take her sister along with her to Tezcuco. Xocotzin had not been long there before the king fell in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> with her, and married her with the title of queen likewise. Soon after this second marriage, the first queen brought forth a son named Cacamatzin, who succeeded him in the throne, and was afterwards taken prisoner by the Spaniards.\n\nAhuitzotl, the brother of Tizoc, succeeded him in the kingdom of Mexico. His first object was to finish the great temple begun by his predecessor; and such was the number of workmen, that it was completed in four years. During the time that it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, the king employed himself in making war with different nations, reserving all the prisoners he took for victims at the dedication of the temple. The number of prisoners sacrificed at this dedication is said by Torquemada to have been 72,324; by other historians 64,060. The miserable victims were ranged in two files, each a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> and a half in length, terminating at the temple. The same year another temple was built by a feudatory lord, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the great one built by the king; at the dedication of which a vast number of prisoners were also sacrificed. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> were dedicated in 1486. In 1487 happened a violent earthquake; and Chimalpopoca king of Acollanacan died, who was succeeded by Totoquihuatzin II.\n\nAhuitzotl died in 1502, of a disorder produced by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTUSION\">contusion</a> in his head. At the time of his death, the Mexican empire was brought to its utmost extent. His successor, Montezuma Xocoyotzin or Montezuma Junior, was a person of great bravery, besides which he was likewise a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, and held in great estimation on account of his gravity and the dignity of his deportment. His election was unanimous; and the nobles congratulated themselves on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> the country was to enjoy under him, little thinking how short the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of their happiness or of their empire was to be.\n\nThe first care of the new monarch, as usual, was to procure victims for the barbarous sacrifices to be made at his coronation. The people of Atlitico, who had again shaken off the Mexican yoke, were the sufferers on this occasion, being once more reduced, though not without great loss on the part of the Mexicans, some of whose bravest officers perished in the war. The ceremony of coronation was performed with such pomp as had never been seen before in Mexico; but no sooner was this ceremony over than Montezuma began to discover a pride which nobody had suspected before. All his predecessors had been accustomed to confer offices upon persons of merit, and those who appeared the most able to discharge them, without any partiality as to birth or wealth. Montezuma, however, disapproved of the conduct of his predecessors, under pretence that the plebeians should be employed according to their rank; for that in all their actions the baseness of their birth and the meanness of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> appeared: and in consequence of this maxim he deprived all the commoners of the offices they held about the court, declaring them incapable of holding any for the future. All the royal servants now were people of rank. Besides these who lived in the palace, 600 feudatory lords and nobles came to pay court to him. They passed the whole day in the antichamber, where none of their servants were permitted to enter; conversing in a low voice, and waiting the orders of their sovereign. The servants of these lords were so numerous that they occupied three small courts of the palace, and many waited in the streets.\n\nIn every respect Montezuma kept up, as far as was possible, an extravagant appearance of dignity. His dainty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> utensils were of the finest earthen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>, and played in his tablecloths and napkins of the finest cotton; but none of these ever served the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> more than once, being immediately made a present of to some nobleman. The vessels in which his chocolate and other drinks from cocoa were prepared, were all of gold, or some beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-shell, or naturally-formed vessels, curiously varnished. He had also gold plate, but it was used only on particular occasions in the temple. The number and variety of his dishes astonished the Spaniards. He took great delight in the cleanliness of his own person, and of every thing about him. He bathed regularly every day, and had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a> in all his palaces. Every day he wore four dresses, never using again those which he had put off, but reserving them as largesses for the nobility, or those who had distinguished themselves in war. The expense of all this rendered him very disagreeable to a great number of his subjects; though others were pleased with the readiness he showed to relieve the necessities of individuals, and his generosity in rewarding his generals and ministers who deserved it. Among other actions worthy of imitation, he appointed the city of Colhuacan as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a> for all invalids, who after having faithfully served the crown either in the civil or military line, required a provision on account of their age and infirmities. In this place they were maintained and attended at the expense of the king.\n\nThe reign of Montezuma, even before the arrival of the Spaniards, was far from being so glorious with regard to his successes in war as those of his predecessors had been. He reduced indeed one rebellious province, and conquered another which had never before with Tlascalans been subjugated; but in his war with Tlascala he was cala by no means successful. This was but a small republic at no great distance from the capital, but the inhabitants were remarkable for their bravery and independent spirit. The neighbouring states, however, who had been reduced by the Mexicans, envious of their liberty and prosperity, exasperated the Mexicans against them, by representing that the Tlascalans were desirous of making themselves masters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> provinces on the Mexican gulf, and that by their commerce with these provinces they were increasing their wealth and power, and gaining the hearts of the people with whom they were to traffic. In consequence of this representation, strong garrisons were placed on the frontiers of Tlascala, to obstruct the commerce of the inhabitants, and thus to deprive them of the means of obtaining some of the necessaries of life. The Tlascalans complained; but received no other answer than that the king of Mexico was lord of all the world, and that the Tlascalans must submit and pay tribute to him. The Tlascalans returned a spirited answer to this insolent speech, and began to fortify their frontier. They had already enclosed all the lands of the republic.\nDuring the remainder of Montezuma's reign the empire was disturbed by various rebellions, of which the accounts are not sufficiently interesting to merit a particular detail; but in the year 1588, Montezuma began to entertain apprehensions of that fatal event which at length overtook him. An expedition having been undertaken against a very distant region named Amatla, the army in marching over a lofty mountain were attacked by a furious north <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, accompanied with snow; which made great havoc in the army, many of them perishing with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, and others being killed by the trees rooted up by the wind. The remains of the army continued their march to Amatla, where they were almost all killed in battle. By this and other calamities, together with the appearance of a comet, the Mexicans were thrown into the utmost consternation. Montezuma was so terrified by these omens, that having in vain consulted his astrologers, he applied to the king of Acolhuacan, who was reported to be very skilful in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>. Nezahualpilli having conferred with him upon the subject, told Montezuma that the comet presaged some calamity which was about to befall their kingdoms by the arrival of a new people: but this being unsatisfactory to the emperor, the king of Acolhuacan challenged him to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAME\">game</a> at foot-ball, staking the truth of his prediction on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> of the game. Montezuma lost the game, but did not yet acquiesce in the truth of his prediction. He therefore applied to a celebrated astrologer, whom it seems he had not yet consulted; but he confirmed the interpretation of Nezahualpilli: for which the emperor caused his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> to be pulled down, and himself buried in the ruins.\n\nMexico itself was first discovered, though imperfectly, by a Spaniard named Nunez de Balboa; but in 1518 the conquest of it was undertaken by a celebrated adventurer named Ferdinando Cortes. On the 10th of February 1519, he set sail from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAVANNAH\">Havannah</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBA\">Cuba</a>; and soon landed on the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COZUMEL\">Cozumel</a>, on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-YUCATAN\">Yucatan</a>, discovered the preceding year. Here he joined one of his officers named Pedro d'Alvaredo, who had arrived some days before, and collected some booty and taken a few prisoners. But the general severely censured his conduct; and the prisoners were dismissed, after they had been informed by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> interpreter named Melchor, that such injuries were entirely disagreeable to the intentions and wishes of Cortes. Here he mustered his army, and found that it amounted to 508 soldiers, 16 horsemen, and 109 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, pilots, and mariners. Having encouraged his men by a proper speech, and released, by means of some Indian ambassadors, a Spaniard named Jeron de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGUILAR\">Aguilar</a>, who had been detained a prisoner for eight years, he proceeded to the river Tabasco, where he hoped to be received in a friendly manner, as one Grijalva had been a short time before; but, from some unknown cause, he was violently attacked by them: however, the superiority of the Spanish arms soon decided the victory, and the inhabitants were obliged to own the king of Castile as their sovereign.\n\nThe Spaniards then continued their course westward, to the harbour of St Juan de Ullua; where they were met by two Mexican canoes, which carried two ambassadors from the emperor of that country, and showed the greatest signs of peace and amity. Their language was unknown to Aguilar; but one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> prisoners above mentioned understood it, and translated it into the Yucatan tongue; after which Aguilar interpreted the meaning in Spanish. This slave was afterwards named Donna Marina, and proved very useful in their conferences with the natives.\n\nAt this time the Mexican empire, according to Dr Robertson, was arrived at a pitch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> at which no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> had ever attained in so short a period. Though it had subsisted only for 130 years, its dominion extended from the north to the south sea, over territories stretching about 500 leagues from east to west, and more than 200 from north to south; comprehending provinces not inferior in fertility, population, and opulence, to any in the torrid zone.\u2014Though by nature Montezuma possessed a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of courage and resolution; yet from the first moment that the Spaniards appeared on his coast, he discovered symptoms of timidity and embarrassment, and all his subjects were embarrassed as well as himself. The general dismay which took place on this occasion was partly owing to the strange <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> the Spaniards made, and the prodigious power of their arms; but partly also to the following circumstance. An opinion prevailed almost universally among the Americans, that some dreadful calamity impended over their heads, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of formidable invaders who should come from regions towards the rising sun, to overrun and desolate their country.\n\nBy means of his two interpreters, Donna Marina and Aguilar, Cortes learned that the chiefs of the Mexican embassy were deputies from Pilpatoe and Teutile; the one governor of a province under the emperor, and the other the commander of all his forces in that province: the purport of their embassy was to inquire what his intentions were in visiting their coasts, and to offer him what assistance he might need in order to continue his voyage. Cortes, in his turn, also professed the greatest friendship; and informed the ambassadors, that he came to propose matters of the utmost consequence to the welfare of the prince and his kingdom; which he would more fully unfold in person to the governor and the general. Next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, without waiting for any answer, he landed his troops, his horses, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>; began to erect huts for his men, and to fortify his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>.\n\nThe next day the ambassadors had a formal audience; at which Cortes acquainted them, that he came from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Carlos of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>, king of Castile, the greatest monarch of the east, and was intrusted with propositions of such moment that he would impart them to none but the emperor himself; and therefore required to be conducted immediately to the capital. This demand produced the greatest uneasiness;\nand the ambassadors did all in their power to dissuade Cortes from his design, endeavouring to conciliate his good will by the presents sent him by Montezuma. These they introduced with great parade, and consisted of fine cotton cloth, of plumes of various colours, and of ornaments of gold and silver from going to a considerable value, the workmanship of which appeared to be as curious as the materials were rich.\n\nBut these presents served only to excite the avidity of the Spaniards, and to increase their desire for becoming masters of a country which abounded with so many precious commodities. Cortes indeed could scarcely restrain himself so far as to hear the arguments made use of by the ambassadors to dissuade him from going to the capital; and, in a haughty, determined tone, insisted on his former demand of being admitted to a personal interview with their sovereign.\n\nDuring this conversation, some painters in the retinue of the Mexican chiefs had been diligently employed in delineating, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> cotton cloths, figures of the ships, horses, artillery, soldiers, and whatever else attracted their eyes as singular.\n\nWhile exerting their utmost efforts in representing all these wonderful things, messengers were immediately despatched to Montezuma with the pictures, and a full account of every thing that had passed since the arrival of the Spaniards, together with some European curiosities to Montezuma; which Cortes believed would be acceptable on account of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>. The Mexican monarchs had couriers posted at proper stations along the principal roads; and as these were trained to agility by a regular education, they conveyed intelligence with surprising rapidity. Though the city in which Montezuma resided was above 180 miles from St Juan de Ulua, Cortes's presents were carried thither, and an answer returned to his demands, in a few days. As the answer was unfavourable, Montezuma had endeavoured to mollify the Spanish general by the richness of his presents. These consisted of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of the country; cotton stuffs so fine, and of such delicate texture, as to resemble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>; pictures of animals, trees, and other natural objects, formed with feathers of different colours, disposed and mingled with such skill and elegance as to rival the works of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> in truth and beauty of imitation. But what chiefly attracted their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, were two large plates of a circular form; one of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASSIVE\">massive</a> gold representing the sun, the other of silver representing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>. These were accompanied with bracelets, collars, rings, and other trinkets of gold; and that nothing might be wanting which could give the Spaniards a complete idea of what the country afforded, some boxes filled with pearls, precious stones, and grains of gold unwrought, as they had been found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> or rivers, were sent along with the rest. Cortes received all with an appearance of the most profound respect for Montezuma; but when the Mexicans, presuming upon this, informed him, that their master, though he desired him to accept of what he had sent as a token of his regard for the prince whom he represented, would not give his consent that foreign troops should approach nearer to his capital, or even allow them to continue longer in his dominions, Cortes declared in a manner more resolute and peremptory than formerly, that he must insist on his first demand; as he could not, without dishonour, return to his own sovereign until he was admitted into the presence of the prince whom he was appointed to visit in his name.\n\nThe pusillanimity of the Indian monarch afforded time to the Spaniards to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> which would have been out of their power had they been vigorously attacked on their first refusal to obey his orders. Cortes used every method of securing the affections of the soldiers; which indeed was very necessary, as many of them began to exclaim against the rashness of his attempt in leading them against the whole force of the Mexican empire. In a short time Teutile arrived with another present from Montezuma, and Montezuma together with it delivered the ultimate orders of that monarch to depart instantly out of his dominions; and when Cortes, instead of complying with his demands, to leave his renewed request of audience, the Mexican immediately left the camp with strong marks of surprise and resentment. Next morning, none of the natives appeared; all friendly correspondence seemed to be at an end, and hostilities were expected to commence every moment. A sudden consternation ensued among the Spaniards, and a party was formed against him by the adherents of Vclasques; who took advantage of the occasion, and deputed one of their number, a principal officer, to remonstrate, as if in name of the whole army, against his rashness, and to urge the necessity of his returning to Cuba. Cortes received the message without any appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a>; and as he well knew the temper and wishes of his soldiery, with much complacency he pretended to comply with the request now made him, and issued orders that the army should be in readiness next day to embark for Cuba. Upon hearing this, the troops, as Cortes had expected, were quite outrageous; they positively refused to comply with these orders, and threatened immediately to choose another general if Cortes continued to insist on their departure.\n\nOur adventurer was highly pleased with the disposition which now appeared among his troops; nevertheless, dissembling his sentiments, he declared, that his orders for embarking had proceeded from a persuasion that it was agreeable to his fellow-soldiers, to whose opinion he had sacrificed his own; but now he acknowledged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, and was ready to resume his original plan of operation. This speech was highly applauded; and Cortes, without allowing his men time to cool, set about carrying his designs into execution. In order to give a beginning to a colony, he Villa Rica assembled the principal persons in his army, and by founded their suffrages elected a council and magistrates, in whom the government was to be vested. The persons chosen were most firmly attached to Cortes; and the new settlement had the name of Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz; that is, the rich town of the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>.\n\nBefore this court of his own making, Cortes did not hesitate at resigning all his authority, and was verment immediately re-elected chief-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of the colony, of the new and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>-general of his army, with an ample <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, in the king's name, to continue in force till the royal pleasure should be farther known. The soldiers eagerly ratified their choice by loud acclamations; and Cortes, now considering himself as no longer accountable to any subject, began to assume a\nmuch greater degree of dignity, and to exercise more extensive powers than he had done before.\n\nCortes having thus strengthened himself as well as he could, resolved to advance into the country; and to this he was encouraged by the behaviour of the cacique or petty prince of Zempoalla, a considerable town at no great distance. Here he was received in the most friendly manner imaginable, and had a respect paid towards him almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to adoration. The cacique informed him of many particulars relating to the character of Montezuma.\u2014He told him that he was a tyrant, haughty, cruel, and suspicious; who treated his own subjects with arrogance, ruined the conquered provinces by his extortions, and often tore their sons and daughters from them by violence; the former to be offered as victims to his gods, the latter to be reserved as concubines for himself and favourites. Cortes, in reply, artfully insinuated, that one great object of the Spaniards in visiting a country so remote from their own was, to redress grievances, and to relieve the oppressed; and having encouraged him to hope for this interposition in due time, continued his march to Quiaibishan, the territory of another cacique, and where, by the friendly aid of the Indians, a Spanish colony was soon formed.\n\nDuring the residence of Cortes in these parts, he so far wrought on the minds of the caciques of Zempoalla and Quiaibishan, that they ventured to insult the Mexican power, at the very name of which they had been formerly accustomed to tremble. Some of Montezuma's officers having appeared to levy the usual tribute, and to demand a certain number of human victims, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIATION\">expiation</a> of their guilt in presuming to hold intercourse with those strangers whom the emperor had commanded to leave his dominions; instead of obeying his orders, they made them prisoners, treated them with great indignity, and, as their superstition was no less barbarous than Montezuma's, they threatened to sacrifice them to their gods.\n\nThough Cortes had now taken such measures as in a manner ensured his success; yet as he had thrown off all dependence on the governor of Cuba, who was his lawful superior, and apprehended his interest at court, he thought proper, before he set out on his intended expedition, to take the most effectual measures against the impending danger. With this view, he persuaded the magistrates of his colony to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to the king, containing a pompous account of their own services, of the country they had discovered, &c., and of the motives which had induced them to throw off their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to the governor of Cuba, and to settle a colony dependent on the crown alone, in which the supreme power, civil as well as military, had been vested in Cortes; humbly requesting their sovereign to ratify what had been done by his royal authority.\n\nSome soldiers and sailors, secretly disaffected to Cortes, formed a design of seizing one of the brigantines, and making their escape to Cuba, in order to give such intelligence to the governor as might enable him to intercept the vessel which was to carry the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> and despatches to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. This conspiracy was conducted with profound secrecy; but at the moment when every thing was ready for execution, the secret was discovered by one of the associates. The latent spirit of disaffection which Cortes was now too well convinced had not been extinguished amongst his troops, gave him very great uneasiness. The only method which he could think of to prevent such conspiracies for the future was to destroy his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, and thus deprive his soldiers of every resource except that of conquest: and with this proposal he persuaded his men to comply. With <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> consent therefore the ships were drawn ashore, and, after being stripped of their sails, rigging, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> work, and whatever else might be of use, they were broke in pieces.\n\nCortes having thus rendered it necessary for his troops to follow wherever he chose to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, began his march to Zempoalla with 500 infantry, 15 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, and six field pieces. The rest of his troops being less fit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, he left them as a garrison in Villa Rica, under the command of Escalante, an officer of merit, and warmly attached to his interest. The cacique of Zempoalla supplied him with provisions; and with 200 of those Indians called Tamanes, whose office, in a country where tame animals were unknown, was to carry burdens, and perform all manner of servile labour. He offered likewise a considerable body of troops; but Cortes was satisfied with 400; taking care, however, to choose persons of such note, that they might serve as hostages for the fidelity of their master.\n\nNothing memorable happened till the Spaniards arrived on the confines of the republic of Tlascala. The inhabitants of that province were warlike, fierce, and revengeful, and had made considerable progress in agriculture, and some other arts. They were implacable enemies to Montezuma; and therefore Cortes hoped that it would be an easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> for him to procure their friendship. With this view, four Zempoallans of high rank were sent ambassadors to Tlascalca, dressed with all the badges of that office usual among the Indians. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> were divided in their opinions with regard to the proposals of Cortes: but at last Magiscatzin, one of the oldest senators, and a person of great authority, mentioned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> of their ancestors, and the revelations of their priests; that a race of invincible men, of divine origin, who had power over the elements, should come from the east to subdue their country. He compared the resemblance which the strangers bore to the persons figured in the traditions of Mexico, their dominion over the elements of fire, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and water; he reminded the senate of their prodigies, omens, and signals, which had lately terrified the Mexicans, and indicated some very important event; and then declared his opinion, that it would be rashness to oppose a force apparently assisted by heaven, and men who had already proved, to the sad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of those who opposed them, that they were invincible. This orator was opposed by Xicotencal, who endeavoured to prove that the Spaniards were at best but powerful magicians: that they had rendered themselves obnoxious to the gods by pulling down their images and altars (which indeed Cortes had very imprudently done at Zempoalla); and of consequence, that they might easily be overcome, as the gods would not fail to resent such an outrage. He therefore voted for war, and advised the crushing of these invaders at one blow.\n\nThe advice of Xicotencal prevailed; and in consequence of it, the ambassadors were detained; which\ngiving Cortes the alarm, he drew nearer the city of Tlascala. They suffered him with his army drawn up in good order, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> a strong wall between two mountains, which might have been very advantageously defended against him. He had not advanced far beyond this pass, however, before a party of Tlascalans with plumes were discovered, which denoted that an army was in the field. These he drove before him by a detachment of six horse, obliged them to join another party, and then reinforcing the advanced detachment, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> the enemy with such vigour that they began to retire. Five thousand Tlascalans then rushed out of their hiding places, just as the infantry came up to assist their slender body of cavalry. The enemy attacked with the utmost fury; but were so much disconcerted by the first discharge of the fire-arms, that they retreated in confusion, furnishing the Spaniards with an opportunity of pursuing them with great slaughter. Cortes, however, supposing that this could not be their whole force, advanced with the utmost caution, in order of battle, to an eminence, from whence he had a view of the main body of the Tlascalan army commanded by Xicotencal, consisting of no fewer than 40,000 men. By these the small army of Cortes was entirely surrounded; which Xicotencal no sooner perceived, than he contracted the circle with incredible diligence, while the Spaniards were almost overwhelmed with showers of arrows, darts, and stones. It is impossible but in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> many of the Spaniards must have perished, had it not been for the insufficiency of the Indian weapons. This circumstance gave the Spaniards a prodigious advantage over them; and therefore the Tlascalans, notwithstanding their valour and superiority in number, could accomplish no more in the present instance, than to kill one horse and slightly wound nine soldiers.\n\nThe Tlascalans being taught by this, and some subsequent encounters, how much they were inferior to the Spaniards, began to conceive them to be really what Magiscatzin had said; a superior order of beings, against whom human power could not prevail. In this extremity they had recourse to their priests, requiring them to reveal the causes of such extraordinary events, and to declare what means they should take to repel such formidable invaders. The priests, after many sacrifices and incantations, delivered their response, That these strangers were the offspring of the sun, procreated by his animating energy in the regions of the east: that, by day, while cherished with the influence of his parental beams, they were invincible; but by night, when his reviving heat was withdrawn, their vigour declined and faded like herbs in the field, and they dwindled down into mortal men. In consequence of this, the Tlascalans acted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to one of their most established maxims in war, and ventured to attack the enemy in the night time, hoping to destroy them when enfeebled and surprised. But the Spanish centinels having observed some extraordinary movements among the Tlascalans, gave the alarm. Immediately the troops were under arms, and sallying out, defeated their antagonists with great slaughter, without allowing them to approach the camp. By this disaster the Tlascalans were heartily disposed to peace; but they were at a loss to form an adequate idea of the enemies they had to deal with. They could not ascertain the nature of these surprising beings, or whether they were really of a benevolent or malignant disposition. There were circumstances in their behaviour which seemed to favour each opinion. On the one hand, as the Spaniards constantly dismissed the prisoners whom they took, not only without injury, but often with presents of European toys, and renewed their offers of peace after every victory; this lenity amazed people accustomed to the exterminating system of war known in America, and who sacrificed and devoured without mercy all the captives taken in battle; and disposed them to entertain sentiments favourable to their humanity. But, on the other hand, as Cortes had seized 50 of their countrymen who brought provisions to their camp, and cut off their heads; this bloody spectacle, added to the terror occasioned by the fire-arms and horses, filled them with dreadful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of their ferocity. Accordingly they addressed them in the following manner: \"If (said they) you are divinities of a cruel and savage nature, we present to you five slaves, that you may drink their blood and eat their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>. If you are mild deities, accept an offering of incense and variegated plumes. If you are men, here is meat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and fruit, to nourish you.\" After this address, the peace was soon concluded, to the great satisfaction of both parties. The Tlascalans yielded themselves as vassals to the crown of Castile, and engaged to assist Cortes in all his operations; while he took the republic under his protection, and promised to defend their persons and possessions from injury and violence.\n\nCortes left no method untried to gain the favour and confidence of the Tlascalans; which, however, he had almost entirely lost, by his untimely zeal in destroying their idols as he had done those of Zempoalla. But he was deterred from this rash <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> by his chaplain Father Bartholomew de Olmedo; and left the Tlascalans in the undisturbed exercise of their superstition, requiring only that they should desist from their horrid practice of offering human victims. As soon as his troops were fit for service, he resolved to continue his march towards Mexico, notwithstanding the remonstrances of the Tlascalans, who looked upon his destruction as unavoidable if he put himself into the power of such a faithless prince as Montezuma. But the emperor, probably intimidated with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of his exploits, had resolved to admit his visit; and informed Cortes that he had given orders for his friendly reception at Cholula, the next place of any consequence on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to Mexico. Cortes was received with much seeming cordiality, but 6000 Tlascalan troops who accompanied him were obliged to remain without the town, as the Cholulans the Cholulans refused to admit their ancient enemies within their precincts. Yet two of these, by disguising themselves, got into the city, and acquainted Cortes that they observed the women and children belonging to the principal citizens retiring every night in a great hurry, and that six children had been sacrificed in the great temple; a sign that some warlike enterprise was at hand. At the same time Donna Marina, the interpreter, received information from an Indian woman of distinction, whose confidence she had gained; that the destruction of the Spaniards was concerted; that a body of Mexican troops lay concealed near the town; that some of the streets were barricaded, in others deep pits or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a> were dug,\ndug, and slightly covered over, as traps into which the horse might fall; that stones and missile weapons were collected on the tops of the temples, with which to overwhelm the infantry; that the fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> was already at hand, and their ruin unavoidable. Cortes, alarmed at this news, secretly arrested three of the chief priests, from whom he extorted a confession that confirmed the intelligence he had already received. As not a moment was to be lost, he instantly resolved to prevent his enemies, and to inflict on them such dreadful vengeance as might strike Montezuma and his subjects with terror.\n\nOn a signal given, the troops rushed out, and fell upon the multitude, destitute of leaders, and so much astonished, that the weapons dropped from their hands, and they stood motionless, and incapable of defence. While the Spaniards attacked them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, the Tlacalans did the same in the rear; the streets were filled with slaughter; the temples, which afforded a retreat to the priests and some leading men, were set on fire, and they perished in the flames. At length the carnage ceased, after the slaughter of 6000 Cholulans, without the loss of a single Spaniard. Cortes then released the magistrates; and reproaching them bitterly for their intended treachery, declared, that as justice was now appeased, he forgave the offence; but required them to recall the inhabitants who had fled, and re-establish order in the town.\n\nFrom Cholula, Cortes advanced directly towards Mexico; and throughout the whole of his journey was entertained with accounts of the oppressions and cruelty of Montezuma. This gave him the greatest hope of accomplishing his design; as he now perceived that the empire was entirely divided, and no sort of unanimity prevailed among them. No enemy appeared to check his progress. Montezuma was quite irresolute; and Cortes was almost at the gates of the capital before the emperor had determined whether to receive him as a friend or oppose him as an enemy. But as no sign of open hostility appeared, the Spaniards, without regarding the fluctuations of Montezuma's sentiments, continued their march to Mexico, with great circumspection and the strictest discipline, though without seeming to suspect the prince whom they were about to visit.\n\nWhen they drew near the city, about 1000 persons who appeared to be of distinction, came forth to meet them, adorned with plumes, and clad in mantles of fine cotton. Each of these, in his order, passed by Cortes, and saluted him according to the mode deemed most respectful and submissive in their country. They announced the approach of Montezuma himself, and soon after his harbingers came in sight. There appeared first 200 persons in an uniform dress, with large plumes of feathers, alike in fashion, marching two and two, in deep silence, barefooted, with their eyes fixed on the ground. These were followed by a company of higher rank, in their most showy apparel: in the midst of whom was Montezuma, in a chair or litter richly ornamented with gold and feathers of various colours. Four of his principal favourites carried him on their shoulders, others supported a canopy of curious workmanship over his head. Before him marched three officers with rods of gold in their hands, which they lifted up on high at certain intervals; and at that signal all the people bowed their heads, and hid their faces, as unworthy to look on so great a monarch.\n\nWhen he drew near, Cortes dismounting, advanced towards him with officious haste, and in a respectful posture. At the same time Montezuma alighted from his chair, and leaning on the arms of two of his near relations, approached with a slow and stately pace, his attendants covering the streets with cotton cloths, that he might not touch the ground. Cortes accosted him with profound reverence, after the European fashion. He returned the salutation, according to the mode of his country, by touching the earth with his hand, and then kissing it. This ceremony appeared such amazing condescension in a proud monarch, who scarcely deigned to consider the rest of mankind as of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> with himself, that all his subjects firmly believed those persons, before whom he humbled himself in this manner, to be something more than human. Accordingly, as they marched through the crowd, the Spaniards frequently, and with much satisfaction, heard themselves denominated teules, or divinities. Nothing material passed in this first interview. Montezuma conducted Cortes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> which he had prepared for his reception; and immediately took leave of him with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a> not unworthy of a court more refined: \"You are now (says he), with your brothers, in your own house; refresh yourselves after your fatigue, and be happy until I return.\" The place allotted to the Spaniards for their lodging was a house built by the father of Montezuma. It was surrounded by a stone wall, with towers at proper distances, which served for defence as well as for ornament; and its apartments and courts were so large as to accommodate both the Spaniards and their Indian allies. The first care of Cortes was to take precautions for his security, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> the artillery so as to command the different avenues which led to it, by appointing a large division of his troops to be always on guard, and by posting sentinels at proper stations, with injunctions to observe the same vigilant discipline as if they were within sight of an enemy's camp.\n\nIn the evening Montezuma returned to visit his guests with the same pomp as in their first interview; and brought presents of such value, not only to Cortes and to his officers, but even to the private men, as proved the liberality of the monarch to be suitable to the opulence of his kingdom. A long conference ensued, in which Cortes learned what was the opinion of Montezuma with respect to the Spaniards. It was an established tradition, he told him, among the Mexicans, that their ancestors came originally from a remote region, and conquered the provinces now subject to his dominion; that after they were settled there, the great captain who conducted this colony returned to his own country, promising that at some future period his descendants should visit them, assume the government, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> their constitutions and laws: that, from what he had heard and seen of Cortes and his followers, he was convinced that they were the very persons whose appearance their prophecies taught them to expect; that accordingly he had received them, not as strangers, but as relations of the same blood and parentage, and desired that they might consider themselves as masters in his dominions; for both himself and his subjects should be ready to comply with their will, and even to prevent their wishes. Cortes made a re-\nply in his usual style with respect to the dignity and power of his sovereign, and his intention in sending him into that country; artfully endeavouring so to frame his discourse, that it might coincide as much as possible with the idea which Montezuma had formed concerning the origin of the Spaniards. Next morning, Cortes and some of his principal attendants were admitted to a public audience of the emperor. The three subsequent days were employed in viewing the city; the appearance of which, so far superior in the order of its buildings and the number of its inhabitants to any place the Spaniards had beheld in America, and yet so little resembling the structure of an European city, filled them with surprise and admiration.\n\nMexico is situated in a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, environed by mountains of such height, that though within the torrid zone, the temperature of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> is mild and healthful. All the moisture which descends from the high grounds is collected in several lakes, the two largest of which, of about 90 miles in circuit, communicate with each other. The waters of the one are fresh, those of the other brackish. On the banks of the latter, and on some small islands adjoining to them, the capital of Montezuma's empire was built. The access to the city was by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> causeways or streets, formed of stones and earth, about 30 feet in breadth. As the waters of the lake, during the rainy season, overflowed the flat country, these causeways were of considerable length. That of Tacuba on the west a mile and a half; that of Tezcuco on the north-west three miles; that of Cuoyacan towards the south six miles. On the east there was no causeway, and the city could be approached only by canoes. In each of these causeways were openings at proper intervals, through which the waters flowed; and over these beams of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> were laid, which being covered with earth, the causeway or street had everywhere an uniform appearance. As the approaches to the city were singular, its construction was remarkable. Not only the temples of their gods, but the houses belonging to the monarch, and to persons of distinction, were of such dimensions, that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with any other buildings which had been discovered in America, they might be termed magnificent. The habitations of the common people were mean, resembling the huts of other Indians. But they were all placed in a regular manner, on the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> which passed through the city, in some of its districts, or on the sides of the streets which intersected it in other quarters. In several places were large openings or squares, one of which, allotted for the great market, is said to have been so spacious that 40,000 or 50,000 persons carried on traffic there. In this city, the pride of the New World, and the noblest monument of the industry and art of man, while unacquainted with the use of iron, the Spaniards, who are most moderate in their computations, reckon that there were at least 60,000 inhabitants.\n\nBut how much soever the novelty of those objects might amuse or astonish the Spaniards, they felt the utmost solicitude with respect to their own situation. From a concurrence of circumstances, no less unexpected than favourable to their progress, they had been allowed to penetrate into the heart of a powerful kingdom, and were now lodged in its capital, without having once met with open opposition from its monarch. The Tlascalans, however, had earnestly dissuaded them from placing such confidence in Montezuma as to enter a city of such a peculiar situation as Mexico, where that prince would have them at mercy, shut up as it were in a snare, from which it was impossible to escape. They assured them that the Mexican priests had, in the name of the gods, counselled their sovereign to admit the strangers into the capital, that he might cut them off there at one blow with perfect security. The Spaniards now perceived, too plainly, that the apprehensions of their allies were not destitute of foundation; that, by breaking the bridges placed at certain intervals on the causeways, or by destroying part of the causeways themselves, their retreat would be rendered impracticable, and they must remain cooped up in the centre of a hostile city, surrounded by multitudes sufficient to overwhelm them, and without a possibility of receiving aid from their allies.\n\nBefore he set out from Cholula, Cortes had received some hostile advice from Villa Rica, that Qualpopoca, one of the cities between the Mexican generals on the frontiers, having assembled between the Spaniards' army in order to attack some of the people whom the Spaniards had encouraged to throw off the Mexican yoke, Escalante had marched out with part of the garrison to support his allies; that an engagement had ensued, in which, though the Spaniards were victorious, Escalante, with seven of his men, had been mortally wounded, his horse killed, and one Spaniard had been surrounded by the enemy and taken alive; that the head of this unfortunate captive, after being carried in triumph to different cities, in order to convince the people that their invaders were not immortal, had been sent to Mexico. Cortes, though alarmed with this intelligence, as an indication of Montezuma's hostile intentions, had continued his march. But as soon as he entered Mexico he became sensible, that, from an excess of confidence in the superior valour and discipline of his troops, as well as from the disadvantage of having nothing to guide him in an unknown country but the defective intelligence which he received from people with whom his mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> was very imperfect, he had pushed forward into a situation, where it was difficult to continue, and from which it was dangerous to retire. Disgrace, and perhaps ruin, was the certain consequence of attempting the latter. The success of his enterprise depended upon supporting the high opinion which the people of New Spain had formed with respect to the irresistible power of his arms. Upon the first symptom of timidity on his part, their veneration would cease, and Montezuma, whom fear alone restrained at present, would let loose upon him the whole force of his empire. At the same time, he knew that the countenance of his own sovereign was to be obtained only by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of victories; and that nothing but the merit of extraordinary success could screen his conduct from the censure of irregularity. From all these considerations, it was necessary to maintain his station, and to extricate himself out of the difficulties in which one bold step had involved him, by venturing upon another still bolder. The situation was trying, but his mind was equal to it; and after revolving the matter with deep attention, he fixed upon a plan no less extraordinary than daring. He determined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> Montezuma in his palace, and carry him a prisoner to his palace.\nthe Spanish quarters. From the superstitious veneration of the Mexicans for the person of their monarch, as well as their implicit submission to his will, he hoped, by having Montezuma in his power, to acquire the supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of their affairs; or at least, with such a sacred pledge in his hands, he made no doubt of being secure from any effort of their violence.\n\nThis he immediately proposed to his officers. The timid startled at a measure so audacious, and raised objections. The more intelligent and resolute, conscious that it was the only resource in which there appeared any prospect of safety, warmly approved of it, and brought over their companions so cordially to the same opinion, that it was agreed instantly to make the attempt. At his usual hour of visiting Montezuma, Cortes went to the palace, accompanied by Alvarado, Sandoval, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUGO\">Lugo</a>, Velasquez de Leon, and Davila, five of his principal officers, and as many trusty soldiers. Thirty chosen men followed, not in regular order, but sauntering at some distance, as if they had no object but curiosity; small parties were posted at proper intervals, in all the streets leading from the Spanish quarters to the court; and the remainder of his troops, with the Tlascalan allies, were under arms, ready to sally out on the first alarm. Cortes and his attendants were admitted without suspicion; the Mexicans retiring, as usual out of respect. He addressed the monarch in a tone very different from that which he had employed in former conferences; reproaching him bitterly as the author of the violent assault made upon the Spaniards by one of his officers, and demanding public reparation for the loss which he had sustained by the death of some of his companions, as well as for the insult offered to the great prince whose servants they were. Montezuma, confounded at this unexpected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a>, and changing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> either from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of guilt, or from feeling the indignity with which he was treated, asserted his own innocence with great earnestness; and, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of it, gave orders instantly to bring Qualpopoca and his accomplices prisoners to Mexico. Cortes replied, with seeming complaisance, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> so respectable left no doubt remaining in his own mind; but that something more was requisite to satisfy his followers, who would never be convinced that Montezuma did not harbour hostile intentions against them, unless, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of his confidence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>, he removed from his own palace and took up his residence in the Spanish quarters, where he should be served and honoured as became a great monarch. The first mention of so strange a proposal bereaved Montezuma of speech, and almost of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. At length he haughtily answered, \"That persons of his rank were not accustomed voluntarily to give up themselves as prisoners; and were he mean enough to do so, his subjects would not permit such an affront to be offered to their sovereign.\" Cortes, unwilling to employ force, endeavoured alternately to soothe and intimidate him. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ALTERCATION\">altercation</a> became warm; and having continued above three hours, Velasquez de Leon, an impatient and gallant young man, exclaimed with impatience, \"Why waste more time in vain? Let us either seize him instantly, or stab him to the heart.\" The threatening voice and fierce gestures with which these words were uttered, struck Montezuma. The Spaniards, he was sensible, had now proceeded so far, as left him no hope that they would recede. His own danger was imminent, the necessity unavoidable. He saw both; and abandoning himself to his fate, complied with their request.\n\nHis officers were called. He communicated to them his resolution. Though astonished and afflicted, they presumed not to question the will of their master, but carried him in silent pomp, all bathed in tears, to the Spanish quarters.\n\nThey at first pretended to treat Montezuma with great respect; but soon took care to let him know that he was entirely in their power. Cortes wished that the shedding the blood of a Spaniard should appear the most infamous crime that could be committed; and therefore not only took a most exemplary vengeance on those who had been concerned in the affair of Villa Rica, but even put the emperor himself in chains till the execution of the Mexican general was over. By these, and other insults, he at last gained Cortes entirely the ascendant over this unhappy monarch; and he took care to improve his opportunity to the utmost. He sent his emissaries into different parts of the kingdom, accompanied with Mexicans of distinction, who might serve both to guide and to protect them. They visited most of the provinces, viewed their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and productions, surveyed with particular care the districts which yielded gold or silver, pitched upon several places as proper for future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>, and endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people for submitting to the Spanish yoke: and while they were thus employed, Cortes, in the name and by the authority of Montezuma, degraded some of the principal officers in the empire, whose abilities or independent spirit excited his jealousy; and substituted in their place persons who he imagined would be more obsequious. One thing, however, was still wanting to complete his security. He wished to have such a command of the lake as might ensure a retreat, if, either from levity or disgust, the Mexicans should take arms against him, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> down the bridges or causeways, in order to enclose him in the city. In order to obtain this without giving disgust to the emperor or his court, Cortes artfully inflamed the curiosity of the Indians with accounts of the Spanish shipping, and those floating palaces that moved with such velocity on the water; and when he found that the monarch himself was extremely desirous of seeing such a novelty, he gave him to understand, that nothing was wanting to his gratification besides a few necessaries from Vera Cruz, for that he had workmen in his army capable of building such vessels. The bait took with Montezuma; and he gave immediate orders that all his people should assist Cortes in whatever he should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> concerning the shipping. By this means, in a few days, two brigantines were got ready, full rigged and equipped; and Montezuma was invited on board, to make the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of their sailing, of which he could form no idea. Accordingly he embarked for this purpose, and gave orders for a great hunting upon the water, in order that all his people might be diverted with the novelty presented by the Spaniards. On the day appointed, the royal equipage was ready early in the morning; and the lake was covered with a multitude of boats and canoes loaded with people. The Mexicans had augmented the\nthe number of their rowers on board the royal barges, which they regarded as clumsy, unwieldy, and heavy. But they were soon undeceived; a fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-GALE\">gale</a> started up, the brigantines hoisted sail, to the utter astonishment of all the spectators, and soon left all the canoes behind; while the monarch exulted in the victory of the Spaniards, without once considering that now he had effectually rivetted his own chains.\n\nCortes having obtained this important point, resolved to put the condescension of the emperor to a trial still more severe. He urged Montezuma to acknowledge himself a vassal to the crown of Castile; to hold his crown of him as superior, and to subject his dominions to the payment of an annual tribute. With this requisition, humiliating as it was, Montezuma complied. He called together the chief men of his empire, and, in a solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARANGUE\">harangue</a>, reminded them of the traditions and prophecies which led them to expect the arrival of a people sprung from the same stock with themselves, in order to take possession of the supreme power; he declared his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that the Spaniards were this promised race; and that therefore he recognised the right of their monarch to govern the Mexican empire, would lay his crown at his feet, and obey him as a tributary. While uttering these words, Montezuma discovered how deeply he was affected in making such a sacrifice. Tears and groans frequently interrupted his discourse. The first mention of such a resolution struck the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> dumb with astonishment. This was followed by a sullen murmur of sorrow mingled with indignation; which indicated some violent eruption of rage to be near at hand. This Cortes foresaw, and seasonably interposed to prevent it, by declaring that his master had no intention to deprive Montezuma of the royal dignity, or to make any innovation upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> and laws of the Mexican empire. This assurance, added to their dread of the Spanish arms, and the authority of their monarch's example, extorted the consent of the assembly; and the act of submission and homage was executed with all the formalities which the Spaniards pleased to prescribe.\n\nMontezuma, at the request of Cortes, accompanied this profession of fealty and homage with a magnificent present to his new sovereign; and, after his example, his subjects brought in very liberal contributions. The Spaniards then collected all the treasure which had been either voluntarily bestowed upon them at different times by Montezuma, or had been extorted from his people under various pretences; and having melted the gold and silver, the value of these amounted to 600,000 pesos. The soldiers were impatient to have it divided; and Cortes complied with their desire. A fifth of the whole was set apart as the tax due to the king. Another fifth was allowed to Cortes as commander. The sums advanced by the governor of Cuba, who had originally fitted out the expedition, were then deducted. The remainder was then divided among the army, including the garrison of Vera Cruz, in proportion to their different ranks; and after so many deductions, the share of a private man did not exceed 100 pesos. This sum fell so far below their sanguine expectations, that it required all the address, and no small exertions of the liberality of Cortes, to prevent an open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTINY\">mutiny</a>. However, he at last restored tranquillity; but had no sooner escaped this danger, than he involved himself by his imprudent zeal for religion, in one much worse. Montezuma, though often importuned, had obstinately refused to change his religion, or abolish the superstitious rites which had been for such a long time practised throughout his dominions. This at last transported Cortes; he led out his soldiers in order to throw down the idols in the great temple by force. But the priests, taking arms in defence of their altars, and the people crowding with great ardour to support them, Cortes's prudence overruled his zeal, and induced him to desist from his rash attempt, after dislodging the idols from one of the shrines, and placing in their stead an image of the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>.\n\nFrom this moment the Mexicans began to meditate the expulsion or the destruction of the Spaniards. The duces and leading men held frequent meetings with Montezuma for this purpose. But as any violent attempt might have proved fatal to the captive monarch, it was thought proper first to try more gentle means. Having called Cortes into his presence, he observed, that now, as all the purposes of his embassy were fully accomplished, the gods had declared their will, and the people signified their desire, that he and his followers should instantly depart out of the empire. With this requirement they complied, or unavoidable destruction would fall suddenly on their heads. This unexpected requisition, as well as the manner in which it was delivered, alarmed Cortes. However, he supposed that more might be gained by a feigned compliance than by open resistance; and therefore replied with great composure, that he had already begun to prepare for his return; but as he had destroyed the vessels in which he arrived, some time was requisite for building other ships. This appeared reasonable; and a number of Mexicans were sent to Vera Cruz to cut down timber, and some Spanish carpenters were appointed to superintend the work.\n\nCortes flattered himself, that, during this interval, he might either find means to avert the threatened danger or receive such reinforcements as would enable him to defend himself. Nine months had now elapsed since Portocarrero and Montejo had sailed with his despatches to Spain; and he daily expected a return, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of his authority from the king, without which all that he had done served only to mark him out as an object of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. While he remained in great anxiety on this account, news were brought that some ships had appeared on the coast. These were imagined by Cortes to be a reinforcement sent him from Spain; but his joy was of short continuance, for a courier very soon arrived from Vera Cruz, with certain information that the armament was fitted out by Velasquez, the governor of Cuba; and instead of bringing succours, threatened them with immediate destruction.\n\nVelasquez had been excited to this hostile measure chiefly through the indiscretion, or rather treachery, of the messengers of Cortes; who, contrary to his express injunctions, had landed on the island of Cuba, and given intelligence of all that had passed: and Velasquez, transported with rage at hearing of the proceedings of Cortes, had now sent against him this armament; consisting of 18 ships, which carried 80 horsemen,\nmen, 800 infantry, of which 80 were musketeers, and 120 cross bowmen, commanded by a brave officer named Pamphilo de Narvaez; whose instructions were, to seize Cortes and his principal officers, to send them prisoners to him, and then to complete the discovery and conquest of the country in his name. This proved a most afflicting piece of news to Cortes.\n\nHaving now no resource but in war, he left 150 men under the command of Pedro de Alvarado, an officer of great bravery, and much respected by the Mexicans, to guard the capital and the captive emperor; while he himself marched with the remainder, to meet his formidable opponent, who had taken possession of Zempoalla. Even after being reinforced by Sandoval his governor of Vera Cruz, the force of Cortes did not exceed 250 men. He hoped for success chiefly from the rapidity of his motions and the possibility of surprising his enemies; and as he chiefly dreaded their cavalry, he armed his soldiers with long spears, accustomed them to that deep and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> arrangement which the use of this formidable weapon enabled them to assume. As he advanced, however, he repeated his proposals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>; but these being constantly rejected, and a price set upon his head, he at last attacked Narvaez in the night-time, entirely defeated and took him prisoner, obliging all his troops to own allegiance to himself.\n\nNothing could be more seasonable than this victory, by which Cortes found his army very considerably increased; for most of the soldiers of Narvaez chose rather to follow Cortes than to return to Cuba, whether the conqueror had offered to send them if they chose. His affairs at Mexico, in the mean time, were in the utmost danger of being totally ruined; and had this decisive victory been delayed but a few days longer, he must have come too late to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> his companions. A short time after the defeat of Narvaez, a courier arrived from Mexico with the disagreeable intelligence that the Mexicans had taken arms; and having seized and destroyed the two brigantines which he had built in order to secure the command of the lake, had attacked the Spaniards in their quarters, killed some, and wounded many more, burnt their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> of provisions, and, in short, carried on hostilities with such fury, that though Alvarado and his men defended themselves with undaunted resolution, they must either be cut off by famine, or sink under the multitude of their enemies. This revolt was excited by motives which rendered it still more alarming. On the departure of Cortes for Zempoalla, the Mexicans flattered themselves, that the long-expected opportunity of restoring their sovereign to liberty, and driving out the Spaniards, was arrived; and consultations were accordingly held for bringing about both these events. The Spaniards in Mexico, conscious of their own weakness, suspected and dreaded these machinations; but Alvarado, who had neither the prudence nor the address of Cortes, took the worst method imaginable to overcome them. Instead of attempting to soothe or cajole the Mexicans, he waited the return of one of their solemn festivals, when the principal persons in the empire were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>, according to custom, in the court of the great temple; he seized all the avenues which led to it; and, allured partly by the rich ornaments which they wore in honour of their gods, and partly by the facility of cutting off at once the authors of that conspiracy which he dreaded, he fell upon them, unarmed and unsuspicous of danger, and massacred a great number; none escaping; but such as made their way over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BATTLEMENTS\">battlements</a> of the temple. An action so cruel and treacherous filled not only the city, but the whole empire, with indignation and rage; and the Mexicans immediately proceeded in the manner above mentioned.\n\nCortes advanced with the utmost celerity to the relief of his distressed companions; but as he passed along, had the mortification to find that the Spaniards were generally held in abhorrence. The principal inhabitants had deserted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> through which he passed; no person of note appeared to meet him with the usual respect; nor were provisions brought to his camp as usual. Notwithstanding these signs of aversion and horror, however, the Mexicans were so lowed to ignorant of the military art, that they again permitted him to enter the capital without opposition; though it was in their power to have easily prevented him, by breaking down the bridges and causeways which led to it.\n\nCortes was received by his companions with the utmost joy; and this extraordinary success so far intoxicated the general himself, that he not only neglected to visit Montezuma, but expressed himself very contemptuously concerning him. These expressions but is being reported among the Mexicans, they all at once roused to arms, and made such a violent and sudden attack, that all the valour and skill of Cortes were scarce sufficient to repel them. This produced great uneasiness among the soldiers of Narvaez, who had imagined there was nothing to do but to gather the spoils of a conquered country. Discontent and murmurings, however, were now of no avail; they were enclosed in a hostile city, and, without some extraordinary exertions, were inevitably undone. Cortes, therefore, made a desperate sally; but, after exerting his utmost efforts for a whole day, was obliged to retire with the loss of 12 killed, and upwards of 60 wounded. Another sally was attempted with the like bad success, and in it Cortes himself was wounded in the hand.\n\nThe Spanish general was now thoroughly convinced of his error; and therefore betook himself to the only resource which was left; namely, to try what effect the interposition of Montezuma would have to soothe or overawe his subjects. When the Mexicans approached the next morning to renew the assault, that unfortunate prince, at the mercy of the Spaniards, and reduced to the sad necessity of becoming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of his own disgrace, and of the slavery of his people, advanced to the battlements in his royal robes, and with all the pomp in which he used to appear on solemn occasions. At the sight of their sovereign, whom they had been long accustomed to reverence almost as a god, the Mexicans instantly forebore their hostilities, and many prostrated themselves on the ground; but when he addressed them in favour of the Spaniards, and made use of all the arguments he could think of to mitigate their rage, they testified their resentment with loud murmurings; and at length broke forth\nforth with such fury, that before the soldiers, appointed to guard Montezuma, had time to cover him with their shields, he was wounded with two arrows, and a blow on his temple with a stone struck him to the ground. On seeing him fall, the Mexicans instantly fled with the utmost precipitation: but the unhappy monarch, now convinced that he was become an object of contempt even to his own subjects, obstinately refused all nourishment; and thus in a short time ended his days.\n\nOn the death of Montezuma, Cortes having lost all hope of bringing the Mexicans to any terms of peace, prepared for retreat. But his antagonists, having taken possession of a high tower in the great temple, which overlooked the Spanish quarters, and placing there a garrison of their principal warriors, the Spaniards were so much exposed to their missile weapons, that none could stir without danger of being killed or wounded. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>, therefore, it was necessary to dislodge them at any rate; and Juan de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESCOBAR\">Escobar</a>, with a large detachment of chosen soldiers, was ordered to make the attack. But Escobar, though a valiant officer, and though he exerted his utmost efforts, was thrice repulsed. Cortes, however, sensible that not only his reputation, but the safety of his army, depended on the success of this assault, caused a buckler to be tied to his arm, as he could not manage it with his wounded hand, and rushed with his drawn sword amongst the thickest of the combatants. Encouraged by the presence of their general, the Spaniards returned to the charge with such vigour, that they gradually forced their way up the steps, and drove the Mexicans to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a> at the top of the tower. There a dreadful carnage began; when two young Mexicans of high rank, observing Cortes, as he animated his soldiers, resolved to sacrifice their own lives in order to cut off the author of so many calamities which desolated their country. They approached him in a suppliant posture, as if they intended to lay down their arms; and seizing him in a moment, hurled him towards the battlements, over which they threw themselves headlong, in hopes of dragging him along with them. But Cortes, by his strength and agility, disengaged himself from their grasp; so that the two Mexicans perished alone.\n\nAs soon as the Spaniards became masters of the tower, they set fire to it, and without further molestation continued the preparations for their retreat. This became the more necessary, as their enemies, astonished at this last effort of their valour, had now entirely changed their system of hostility; and, instead of incessant attacks, endeavoured, by barricading the streets, and breaking down the causeways, to cut off the communication of the Spaniards with the continent, and thus to starve an enemy whom they could not subdue. The first point to be determined, was whether they should march out openly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of day, when they could discern every danger, or whether they should endeavour to retire secretly in the night. The latter was preferred, partly from hopes that the superstition of the Mexicans would prevent them from attacking them in the night, and partly from their own superstition in giving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to the predictions of a private soldier, who pretended to astrology, and assured them of success if they retreated in this manner.\n\nTowards midnight, therefore, they began their march, in three divisions. Sandoval led the van; Pedro Alvarado and Velasquez de Leon had the conduct of the rear; and Cortes commanded in the centre, where he placed the prisoners, among whom were a son and two daughters of Montezuma, together with several Mexicans of distinction, the artillery, baggage, and a portable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of timber intended to be laid over the breaches in the causeway. They marched in profound silence along the causeway which led to Tacuba, because it was shorter than any of the rest, and, lying more remote from the road towards Tlascala and the sea coast, had been left most entire by the Mexicans.\n\nThey reached the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> in the causeway without molestation, hoping that their retreat was undiscovered. But the Mexicans had not only watched all their motions, but made preparations for a most formidable attack. While the Spaniards were intent upon placing their bridges in the breach, and occupied in conducting their horses and artillery along it, they were suddenly alarmed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of warlike instruments, and found themselves assaulted on all sides by an innumerable multitude of enemies. Unfortunately the wooden bridge was wedged so fast in the mud by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the artillery, that it was impossible to remove it. Dismayed at this accident, the Spaniards advanced with precipitation to the second breach. The Mexicans hemmed them in on every side; and though they defended themselves with their usual courage, yet crowded as they were in a narrow causeway, their discipline and military skill were of little avail; nor did the obscurity of the night allow them to derive much advantage from their fire-arms or the superiority of their other weapons. At last the Spaniards, overcome with the numbers of their enemies, began to give way, and in a moment the confusion was universal. Cortes, with about 100 foot soldiers, and a few horse, forced his way over the two remaining breaches in the causeway, the bodies of the dead serving to fill up the chasms, and reached the main land. Having formed them as soon as they arrived, he returned with such as were yet capable of service, to assist his friends in their retreat. He met with part of his soldiers who had forced their way through the enemy, but found many more overwhelmed by the multitude of their aggressors, or perishing in the lake; and heard the grievous lamentations of others whom the Mexicans were carrying off in triumph to be sacrificed to the god of war.\n\nIn this fatal retreat more than one half of Cortes's army perished, together with many officers of distinction. All the artillery, ammunition, and baggage, were lost; the greater part of the horses and above 2000 Tlascalans were killed, and only a very small part of their treasure saved. The first care of the Spanish general was to find some shelter for his wearied troops; for, as the Mexicans infested them on every side, and the people of Tacuba began to take arms, he could not continue in his present station. At last he discovered a temple seated on an eminence, in which he found not only the shelter he wanted, but some provisions; and though the enemy did not intermit their attacks throughout the day, they were without much difficulty prevented from making any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>. For\nsix days after, they continued their march through a barren, ill cultivated, and thinly peopled country, where they were often obliged to feed on berries, roots, and the stalks of green maize; at the same time they were harassed without intermission by large parties of Mexicans, who attacked them on all sides. On the sixth day they reach Otumba, not far from the road between Mexico and Tlascala. Early next morning they began to advance towards it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> parties of the enemy still hanging on their rear; and amidst the insults with which they accompanied their hostilities, Donna Marina remarked, that they often exclaimed with exultation, \"Go on, robbers; go to the place where you shall quickly meet the vengeance due to your crimes.\"\n\nThe meaning of this threat the Spaniards did not comprehend, until they reached the summit of an eminence before them. There a spacious valley opened to their view, covered with a vast army as far as the eye could reach. The Mexicans, while with one body of their troops they harassed the Spaniards in their retreat, had assembled their principal force on the other side of the lake; and marching along the road which led directly to Tlascala, posted it in the plain of Otumba, through which they knew Cortes must pass. At the sight of this incredible multitude, which they could survey at once from the rising ground, the Spaniards were astonished, and even the boldest began to despair. But Cortes, without allowing their fears time to operate, after warning them briefly that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> remained but to conquer or die, led them instantly to the charge.\n\nThe Mexicans waited their approach with unusual fortitude: yet such was the superiority of the Spanish discipline and arms, that the impression of this small body was irresistible; and whichever way its force was directed, it penetrated and dispersed the most numerous battalions. But while these gave way in one quarter, new combatants advanced from another; and the Spaniards, though successful in every attack, were ready to sink under these repeated efforts, without seeing any end to their toil, or any hope of victory. At that time Cortes observed the great standard of the empire, which was carried before the Mexican general, advancing; and fortunately recollecting to have heard, that on the fate of it depended the event of every battle, he assembled a few of his bravest officers, whose horses were still capable of service, and placing himself at their head, pushed towards the standard with such impetuosity that he bore down everything before him. A chosen body of nobles, who guarded the standard, made some resistance, but were soon broken. Cortes, with a stroke of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCE\">lance</a>, wounded the Mexican general, and threw him to the ground. One of his followers alighting, put an end to his life, and laid hold of the imperial standard. The moment that their leader fell, and the standard, towards which all directed their eyes, disappeared, an universal panic struck the Mexicans; and, as if the bond which held them together had been dissolved, every ensign was lowered, each soldier threw away his weapons, and fled with precipitation to the mountains. The Spaniards, unable to pursue them far, returned to collect the spoils of the field; and these were so valuable as to be some compensation for the wealth which they had lost in Mexico; for in the enemy's army were most of their principal warriors dressed out in their richest ornaments, as if they had been marching to assured victory.\n\nThe day after this important action (being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 8, 1520), the Spaniards entered the Tlascalan territories, where they were received with the most cordial friendship. Cortes endeavoured to avail himself of this disposition as much as possible; for which purpose he distributed among them the rich spoils taken at Otumba with such a liberal hand, that he made himself sure of obtaining from the republic whatever he should desire. He drew a small supply of ammunition, and two or three field-pieces, from his stores at Vera Cruz. He despatched an officer of confidence with four ships of Narvaez's fleet to Hispaniola and Jamaica, to engage adventurers, and to purchase horses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, and other military stores. And as he knew that it would be in vain to attempt the reduction of Mexico, unless he could secure the command of the lake, he gave orders to prepare, in the mountains of Tlascala, materials for building 12 brigantines, so that they might be carried thither in pieces, ready to be put together, and launched when he stood in need of their service. But, in the mean time, his soldiers, alarmed at the thoughts of being exposed to such calamities a second time, presented a remonstrance to their general; in which they represented the imprudence of attacking a powerful empire with his shattered forces, and formally required him to return back to Cuba. All the eloquence of Cortes could now only prevail with them to delay their departure for some time, when he promised to dismiss such as should desire it. However, this was only a pretence; for Cortes, in fact, had the conquest of Mexico as much at heart as ever. Without giving his soldiers an opportunity of caballing, therefore, he daily employed them against the people of the neighbouring provinces, who had cut off some detachments of Spaniards during his misfortunes at Mexico; and by which, as he was constantly attended with success, his men soon resumed their wonted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of superiority.\n\nBut all the efforts of Cortes could have been of little avail, had he not unexpectedly obtained a reinforcement of Spanish soldiers. These belonged to an armament fitted out by Francisco de Garay, governor of Jamaica, who had long aimed at dividing with Cortes the glory and gain of annexing the empire of Mexico to the crown of Castile. They had, however, unadvisedly made their attempt on the northern provinces, where the country was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and the inhabitants fierce and warlike; so that, after a succession of disasters, they were now obliged to venture into Vera Cruz, and cast themselves upon the mercy of their countrymen; and here they also were soon persadied to throw off their allegiance to their master, and to enlist with Cortes. About the same time a ship arrived from Spain, freighted by some private adventurers, with military stores; and the cargo was eagerly purchased by Cortes, while the crew, following the example of the rest, joined him at Tlascala.\n\nFrom these various quarters, the army of Cortes was augmented with 180 men and 20 horses; by which means he was enabled to dismiss such of the soldiers of Narvaez as were most troublesome and discontented; after the departure of whom he still mustered 550 infantry, of whom 80 were armed with muskets or cross-\ncross bows, 40 horsemen, and nine pieces of artillery. At the head of these, with 10,000 Tlascalans and other friendly Indians, he began his march towards Mexico, on the 28th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, six months after his fatal retreat from that city.\n\nAs soon as Cortes entered the enemy's territories, he discovered various preparations to obstruct his progress. But his troops forced their way with little difficulty; and took possession of Tezcuco, the second city of the empire, situated on the banks of the lake, about 20 miles from Mexico. Here he determined to establish his headquarters, as the most proper station for launching his brigantines, as well as for making his approaches to the capital. In order to render his residence there more secure, he deposed the cacique or chief, who was at the head of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, under pretence of some defect in his title, and substituted in his place a person whom a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> of the nobles pointed out as the right heir of that dignity. Attached to him by this benefit, the new cacique and his adherents served the Spaniards with inviolable fidelity.\n\nAs the construction of the brigantines advanced slowly under the unskilful hands of soldiers and Indians, whom Cortes was obliged to employ in assisting three or four carpenters who happened fortunately to be in his service, and as he had not yet received the reinforcement which he expected from Hispaniola, he was not in a condition to turn his arms directly against the capital. To have attacked a city so populous, so well prepared for defence, and in a situation of such peculiar strength, must have exposed his troops to inevitable destruction. Three months elapsed before the materials for constructing the brigantines were finished, and before he heard anything with respect to the success of his negociation in Hispaniola. This, however, was not a season of inaction to Cortes. He attacked successively several of the towns situated around the lake; and though all the Mexican power was exerted to obstruct his operations, he either compelled them to submit to the Spanish crown, or reduced them to ruins. Other towns he endeavoured to conciliate by more gentle means; and though he could not hold any intercourse with the inhabitants but by the intervention of interpreters, yet, under all the disadvantages of that tedious and imperfect mode of communication, he had acquired such a thorough knowledge of the state of the country, as well as of the dispositions of the people, that he conducted his negociations and intrigues with astonishing dexterity and success. Most of the cities adjacent to Mexico were originally the capitals of small independent states; and some of them having been but lately annexed to the Mexican empire, still retained the remembrance of their ancient liberty, and bore with impatience the rigorous yoke of their new masters. Cortes having early observed symptoms of their disaffection, availed himself of this knowledge to gain their confidence and friendship. By offering with confidence to deliver them from the odious dominion of the Mexicans, and by liberal promises of more indulgent treatment if they would unite with him against their oppressors, he prevailed on the people of several considerable districts, not only to acknowledge the king of Castile as their sovereign, but to supply the Spanish camp with provisions, and to strengthen his army with auxiliary troops.\n\nGuatimozin, on the first appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DEFECTION\">defection</a> among his subjects, exerted himself with vigour to prevent or to punish their revolt; but, in spite of his efforts, the spirit continued to spread. The Spaniards gradually acquired new allies; and with deep concern he beheld Cortes arming against his empire those very hands which ought to have been active in his defence, and ready to advance against the capital at the head of a numerous body of his own subjects.\n\nWhile, by these various methods, Cortes was gradually circumscribing the Mexican power within such narrow limits that his prospect of overturning it seemed neither to be uncertain nor remote, all his schemes were well nigh defeated by a conspiracy against his own person, and which was discovered only a short time before it was to have been executed. Though many were concerned, Cortes did not think proper to punish any more than the principal ringleader, whom he caused immediately to be hanged; and then, without allowing them leisure to ruminate on what had happened, and as the most effectual means of preventing the return of a mutinous spirit, he determined to call forth his troops immediately to action. Fortunately a proper occasion for this occurred, without his seeming to court it. He received intelligence, that the materials for building the brigantines were at length completely finished, and waited only for a body of Spaniards to conduct them to Tezcuco. The command of this convoy, consisting of 200 foot soldiers, 15 horsemen, and two field-pieces, he gave to Sandoval, who by the vigilance, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, and courage, which he manifested on every occasion, was growing daily in his confidence, and in the estimation of his fellow-soldiers. The Tlascalans furnished 8000 Tamenes, an inferior order of men destined for servile tasks, to carry the materials on their shoulders, and appointed 15,000 warriors to accompany and defend them. Sandoval made the disposition for their progress with great propriety, placing the Tamenes in the centre, one body of warriors in the front, another in the rear, with considerable parties to cover the flanks. To each of these he joined some Spaniards, not only to assist them in danger, but to accustom them to regularity and subordination. Parties of Mexicans frequently appeared hovering around them on the high grounds; but perceiving no prospect of success in attacking an enemy continually on his guard, and prepared to receive them, they did not venture to molest him; and Sandoval had the glory of conducting safely to Tezcuco a convoy on which all the future operations of his countrymen depended.\n\nCortes determined to attack the city from three different quarters; from Tezcuco on the east side of the sieged lake, from Tacuba on the west, and from Chayocan towards the south. Those towns were situated on the principal causeways which led to the capital, and intended for their defence. He appointed Sandoval to command in the first, Pedro de Alvarado in the second, and Christoval de Olid in the third; allotting to each a numerous body of Indian auxiliaries, together with an equal division of Spaniards, who, by the junction of the troops from Hispaniola, amounted now to 86 horsemen, and 818 foot soldiers; of whom 118 were armed with muskets or cross-bows. Their train of artillery consisted of three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTERING\">battering</a> cannon, and 15 field-pieces.\npieces. He reserved for himself, as the station of greatest importance and danger, the conduct of the brigantines, each armed with one of his small cannon, and manned with 25 Spaniards.\n\nAs Alvarado and Olid proceeded towards the posts assigned them, they broke down the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AQUEDUCTS\">aqueducts</a> which the ingenuity of the Mexicans had erected for conveying water into the capital, and, by the distress to which this reduced the inhabitants, gave a beginning to the calamities which they were destined to suffer. Alvarado and Olid found the towns, of which they were ordered to take possession, deserted by their inhabitants, who had fled for safety to the capital, where Guatimozin had collected the chief force of his empire, as there alone he could hope to make a successful stand against the formidable enemies who were approaching to assault him.\n\nThe first effort of the Mexicans was to destroy the fleet of brigantines, the fatal effects of whose operations they foresaw and dreaded. Though the brigantines, after all the labour and merit of Cortes in constructing them, were of inconsiderable bulk, rudely constructed, and manned chiefly with landmen, hardly possessed of skill enough to conduct them, they must have been objects of terror to a people unacquainted with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> but that of their lake, and possessed of no vessel larger than a canoc. Necessity, however, urged Guatimozin to hazard the attack; and hoping to supply by numbers what he wanted in force, he assembled such a multitude of canoes as covered the face of the lake. They rowed on boldly to the charge, while the brigantines, retarded by a dead calm, could scarcely advance to meet them. But as the enemy drew near, a breeze suddenly sprung up; in a moment the sails were spread, and the brigantines with irresistible impetuosity broke their feeble opponents, overset many canoes, and dissipated the whole armament with such slaughter, as convinced the Mexicans, that the progress of the Europeans in knowledge and arts rendered their superiority greater on this new element than they had hitherto found it by land.\n\nFrom that time Cortes remained master of the lake; and the brigantines not only preserved a communication between the Spaniards in their different stations, though at a considerable distance from each other; but were employed to cover the causeways on each side, and keep off the canoes, when they attempted to annoy the troops as they advanced towards the city. He formed the brigantines in three divisions, allotting one to each station, with orders to second the operations of the officer who commanded there. From all the three stations he pushed on the attack against the city with equal vigour; but in a manner so very different from that by which sieges are conducted in regular war, as might appear no less improper than singular to persons unacquainted with his situation. Each morning his troops assaulted the barricades which the enemy had erected on the causeways, forced their way over the trenches which they had dug, and through the canals where the bridges were broken down, and endeavoured to penetrate into the heart of the city, in hopes of obtaining some decisive advantage, which might force the enemy to surrender, and terminate the war at once; but when the obstinate valour of the Mexicans rendered the efforts of the day ineffectual, the Spaniards retired in the evening to their former quarters. Thus their toil and danger were, in some measure, continually renewed, the Mexicans repairing in the night what the Spaniards had destroyed through the day, and recovering the posts from which they had driven them. But necessity prescribed this slow and untoward mode of operation. The number of his troops was so small, that Cortes durst not, with a handful of men, attempt to make a lodgement in a city where he might be surrounded and annoyed by such a multitude of enemies. The remembrance of what he had already suffered by the ill-judged confidence with which he had ventured into such a dangerous situation, was still fresh in his mind. The Spaniards, exhausted with fatigue, were unable to guard the various posts which they daily gained; and though their camp was filled with Indian auxiliaries, they durst not devolve this charge upon them, because they were so little accustomed to discipline, that no confidence could be placed in their vigilance. Besides this, Cortes was extremely solicitous to preserve the city as much as possible from being destroyed, both as he destined it to be the capital of his conquests, and wished that it might remain as a monument of his glory. From all these considerations, he adhered obstinately, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> after the siege was opened, to the system which he had adopted. The Mexicans, in their own defence, displayed valour which was hardly inferior to that with which the Spaniards attacked them. On land, on water, by night and by day, one furious conflict succeeded to another. Several Spaniards were killed, more wounded, and all were ready to sink under the toils of unintermitting service, which were rendered more intolerable by the injuries of the season, the periodical rains being now set in with their usual violence.\n\nAstonished and disconcerted with the length and difficulties of the siege, Cortes determined to make one great effort to get possession of the city before he relinquished the plan which he had hitherto followed, and had recourse to any other mode of attack. With this view he sent instructions to Alvarado and Sandoval to advance with their divisions to a general assault, and took the command in person of that posted on the causeway of Cuyocan. Animated by his presence, and the expectations of some decisive event, the Spaniards pushed forward with irresistible impetuosity. They broke through one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRICADE\">barricade</a> after another, forced their way over the ditches and canals, and having entered the city, gained ground incessantly, in spite of the multitude and ferocity of their opponents. Cortes, though delighted with the rapidity of his progress, did not forget that he might still find it necessary to retreat; and in order to secure it, appointed Julian de Alderete, a captain of chief note in the troops which he had received from Hispaniola, to fill up the canals and gaps in the causeway as the main body advanced. That officer deeming it inglorious to be thus employed, while his companions were in the heat of action and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of victory, neglected the important charge committed to him, and hurried on inconsiderately to mingle with the combatants. The Mexicans, whose military attention and skill were daily improving, no sooner observed this, than they carried an account of it to their monarch.\n\nGuatimozin instantly discerned the consequences of\nthe error which the Spaniards had committed, and, with admirable presence of mind, prepared to take advantage of it. He commanded the troops posted in the front to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLACKEN\">slacken</a> their efforts, in order to allure the Spaniards to push forward, while he despatched a large body of chosen warriors through different streets, some by land, and others by water, towards the great breach in the causeway, which had been left open. On a signal which he gave, the priests in the great temple struck the great drum consecrated to the god of war. No sooner did the Mexicans hear its doleful solemn sound, calculated to inspire them with contempt of death and with enthusiastic ardour, than they rushed upon the enemy with frantic rage. The Spaniards, unable to resist men urged on no less by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> fury than hope of success, began to retire, at first leisurely, and with a good countenance; but as the enemy pressed on, and their own impatience to escape increased, the terror and confusion became so general, that when they arrived at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAP\">gap</a> in the causeway, Spaniards and Tlascalans, horsemen and infantry, plunged in promiscuously, while the Mexicans rushed upon them fiercely from every side, their little canoes carrying them through shoals which the brigantines could not approach. In vain did Cortes attempt to stop and rally his flying troops; fear rendered them regardless of his entreaties or commands. Finding all his endeavours to renew the combat fruitless, his next care was to save some of those who had thrown themselves into the water; but while thus employed, with more attention to their situation than to his own, six Mexican captains suddenly laid hold of him, and were hurrying him off in triumph; and though two of his officers rescued him at the expense of their own lives, he received several dangerous wounds before he could break loose. Above 60 Spaniards perished in the rout; and what rendered the disaster more afflicting, 40 of these fell alive into the hands of an enemy never known to show mercy to a captive.\n\nThe approach of night, though it delivered the dejected Spaniards from the attacks of the enemy, ushered in, what was hardly less grievous, the noise of their barbarous triumph, and of the horrid festival with which they celebrated their victory. Every quarter of the city was illuminated; the great temple shone with such peculiar splendour, that the Spaniards could plainly see the people in motion, and the priests busy in hastening the preparations for the death of the prisoners. Through the gloom they fancied that they discerned their companions by the whiteness of their skins, as they were stripped naked and compelled to dance before the image of the god to whom they were to be offered. They heard the shrieks of those who were sacrificed, and thought they could distinguish each unhappy victim by the well known sound of his voice. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">Imagination</a> added to what they really saw or heard, and augmented its horror. The most unfeeling melted into tears of compassion, and the stoutest heart trembled at the dreadful spectacle which they beheld.\n\nCortes, who, besides all that he felt in common with his soldiers, was oppressed with the additional load of anxious reflections natural to a general on such an unexpected calamity, could not like them relieve his mind by giving vent to its anguish. He was obliged to assume an air of tranquillity in order to revive the spirits and hopes of his followers. The juncture, indeed, required an extraordinary exertion of fortitude. The Mexicans elated with their victory, sallied out next morning to attack him in his quarters. But they did not rely on the efforts of their own arms alone: they sent the fury of the heads of the Spaniards whom they had sacrificed to the leading men in the adjacent provinces, and assured them that the god of war, appeased by the blood of their invaders, which had been shed so plentifully on his altars, had declared with an audible voice, that in eight days time those hated enemies should be finally destroyed, and peace and prosperity re-established in the empire.\n\nA prediction, uttered with such confidence, and in terms so void of ambiguity, gained universal credit among a people prone to superstition. The zeal of the provinces which had already declared against the Spaniards augmented, and several which had hitherto remained inactive took arms with enthusiastic ardour to execute the decrees of the gods. The Indian auxiliaries who had joined Cortes, accustomed to venerate the same deities with the Mexicans, and to receive the responses of their priests with the same implicit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, abandoned the Spaniards as a race of men devoted to certain destruction. Even the fidelity of the Tlascalans was shaken, and the Spanish troops were left almost alone in their stations. Cortes, finding that he attempted in vain to dispel the superstitious fears of his confederates by argument, took advantage, from the imprudence of those who had framed the prophecy in fixing its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> so near at hand, to give them a striking demonstration of its falsity. He suspended all military operations during the period marked out by the oracle. Under cover of the brigantines, which kept the enemy at a distance, his troops lay in safety, and the fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> expired without any disaster.\n\nHis allies, ashamed of their own credulity, returned to their station. Other tribes, judging that the gods, who had now deceived the Mexicans, had decreed finally to withdraw their protection from them, joined his standard; and such was the levity of a simple people, moved by every slight impression, that, in a short time after such a general defection of his confederates, Cortes saw himself, if we may believe his own account, at the head of 150,000 Indians. Even with such a numerous army, he found it necessary to adopt a new and more wary system of operation. Instead of renewing his attempts to become master of the city at once, by such bold but dangerous efforts of valour as he had already tried, he made his advances gradually, and with every possible precaution against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> his men to any calamity similar to that which they still bewailed. As the Spaniards pushed forward, the Indians regularly repaired the causeways behind them. As soon as they got possession of any part of the town, the houses were instantly levelled with the ground. Day by day, the Mexicans, forced to retire as their enemies gained ground, were hemmed in within more narrow limits. Guatimozin, though unable to stop the career of the enemy, continued to defend his capital with obstinate resolution, and disputed every inch of ground. But the Spaniards, having not only varied their mode of attack, but, by order of Cortes, having changed the weapons\nwith which they fought, were again armed with the long Chinantlan spears, which they had employed with such success against Narvaez; and, by the firm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARRAY\">array</a> in which this enabled them to range themselves, they repelled, with little danger, the loose assault of the Mexicans; incredible numbers of whom fell in the conflicts, which they renewed every day. While war wasted without, famine began to consume them within the city. The Spanish brigantines, having the entire command of the lake, rendered it impossible to receive any supply of provisions by water. The vast number of his Indian auxiliaries enabled Cortes to shut up the avenues to the city by land. The stores which Guatimozin had laid up were exhausted by the multitudes which crowded into the capital to defend their sovereign and the temples of their gods. Not only the people, but persons of the highest rank, felt the utmost distresses of want. What they suffered brought on infectious and mortal distempers, the last calamity that visits besieged cities, and which filled up the measure of their woes.\n\nBut, under the pressure of so many and such various evils, the spirit of Guatimozin remained firm and unsubdued. He rejected with scorn every overture of peace from Cortes; and, disdaining the idea of submitting to the oppressors of his country, determined not to survive its ruin. The Spaniards continued their progress. At length all the three divisions penetrated into the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> in the centre of the city, and made a secure lodgment there. Three-fourths of the city were now reduced, and laid in ruins. The remaining quarter was so closely pressed, that it could not long withstand assailants who attacked it from their new station with superior advantage, and more assured expectation of success. The Mexican nobles, solicitous to save the life of a monarch whom they revered, prevailed on Guatimozin to retire from a place where resistance was now vain, that he might rouse the more distant provinces of the empire to arms, and maintain there a more successful struggle with the public enemy. In order to facilitate the execution of this measure, they endeavoured to amuse Cortes with overtures of submission, that, while his attention was employed in adjusting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of pacification, Guatimozin might escape unperceived. But they made this attempt upon a leader of greater sagacity and discernment than to be deceived by their arts. Cortes suspecting their intention, and aware of what moment it was to defeat it, appointed Sandoval, the officer on whose vigilance he could most perfectly rely, to take the command of the brigantines, with strict injunctions to watch every motion of the enemy. Sandoval, attentive to the charge, observing some large canoes crowded with people rowing along the lake with extraordinary rapidity, instantly gave the signal to chase. Gracia Holguin, who commanded the fleetest brigantine, soon overtook them, and was preparing to fire on the foremost canoe, which seemed to carry some person whom all the rest followed and obeyed. At once the rowers dropt their oars, and all on board, throwing down their arms, conjured him with cries and tears to forbear, as the emperor was there. Holguin eagerly seized his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a>; and Guatimozin, with a dignified composure, gave himself up into his hands, requesting only that no insult might be offered to the empress or his children. When conducted to Cortes, he appeared neither with the sullen fierceness of a barbarian, nor with the dejection of a suppliant. \"I have done,\" said he, addressing himself to the Spanish general, \"what became a monarch. I have defended my people to the last extremity. Nothing now remains but to die. Take this dagger,\" laying his hand on which Cortes wore, \"plant it in my breast, and put an end to a life which can no longer be of use.\"\n\nAs soon as the fate of their sovereign was known, Mexico the resistance of the Mexicans ceased; and Cortes took possession of that small part of the capital which yet remained undestroyed. Thus terminated the siege of Mexico, the most memorable event in the conquest of America. It continued 75 days, hardly one of which passed without some extraordinary effort of one party in the attack, or of the other in the defence of a city, on the fate of which both knew that the fortune of the empire depended. As the struggle here was more obstinate, it was likewise more equal, than any between the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds. The great abilities of Guatimozin, the number of his troops, the peculiar situation of his capital, so far counterbalanced the superiority of the Spaniards in arms and discipline, that they must have relinquished the enterprise, if they had trusted for success to themselves alone. But Mexico was overturned by the jealousy of neighbours who dreaded its power, and by the revolt of subjects impatient to shake off its yoke. By their effectual aid, Cortes was enabled to accomplish what, without such support, he would hardly have ventured to attempt. How much soever this account of the reduction of Mexico may detract, on the one hand, from the marvellous relations of some Spanish writers, by ascribing that to simple and obvious causes which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> to the romantic valour of their countrymen, it adds, on the other, to the merit and abilities of Cortes, who, under every disadvantage, acquired such an ascendant over unknown nations, as to render them instruments towards carrying his scheme into execution.\n\nThe exultation of the Spaniards, on accomplishing this arduous enterprise, was at first excessive. But this was quickly damped by the cruel disappointment of those sanguine hopes which had animated them amidst so many hardships and dangers. Instead of the inexhaustible wealth which they expected from becoming masters of Montezuma's treasures, and the ornaments of so many temples, their rapaciousness could collect only an inconsiderable booty amidst ruins and desolation (A). Guatimozin, aware of his impending fate, had ordered what remained of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> amassed by his ancestors to be thrown into the lake. The Indian auxiliaries, while the Spaniards were engaged in con-\n\n(A) The gold and silver, according to Cortes, amounted only to 120,000 pesos, (Relat. 28o, A.) a sum far inferior to that which the Spaniards had formerly divided in Mexico.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>, sict with the enemy, had carried off the most valuable part of the spoil. The sum to be divided among the conquerors was so small, that many of them disdained to accept of the pittance which fell to their share, and all murmured and exclaimed: some against Cortes and his confidants, whom they suspected of having secretly appropriated to their own use a large portion of the riches which should have been brought into the common stock; others against Guatimozin, whom they accused of obstinacy, in refusing to discover the place where he had hidden his treasure.\n\nArguments, entreaties, and promises, were employed in order to soothe them; but with so little effect, that Cortes, from solicitude to check this growing spirit of discontent, gave way to a deed which stained the glory of all his great actions. Without regarding the former dignity of Guatimozin, or feeling any reverence for those virtues which he had displayed, he subjected the unhappy monarch, together with his chief favourite, to torture, in order to force from them a discovery of the royal treasures, which it was supposed they had concealed. Guatimozin bore whatever the refined cruelty of his tormentors could inflict, with the invincible fortitude of an American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>. His fellow-sufferer, overcome by the violence of the anguish, turned a dejected eye towards his master, which seemed to implore his permission to reveal all that he knew. But the high-spirited prince, darting on him a look of authority mingled with scorn, checked his weakness, by asking, \"Am I now reposing on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>?\" Overawed by the reproach, he persevered in his dutiful silence, and expired. Cortes, ashamed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> so horrid, rescued the royal victim from the hands of his torturers, and prolonged a life reserved for new indignities and sufferings.\n\nThe fate of the capital, as both parties had foreseen, decided that of the empire. The provinces submitted one after another to the conquerors. Small detachments of Spaniards marching through them without interruption, penetrated, in different quarters, to the great Southern ocean, which, according to the ideas of Columbus, they imagined would open a short as well as easy passage to the East Indies, and secure to the crown of Castile all the envied wealth of those fertile regions; and the active mind of Cortes began already to form schemes for attempting this important discovery. In his after-schemes, however, he was disappointed; but Mexico hath ever since remained in the hands of the Spaniards.\n\nTill Humboldt's work appeared, the internal situation of Mexico was very imperfectly known. This celebrated traveller, who spent a considerable time in visiting the most remarkable objects, and had access to the best sources of information, has furnished us with a very interesting account of the colony.\n\nOne of the most remarkable peculiarities of New Spain is the great elevation of the soil. Three fifths of the viceroyalty consist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> land, elevated from 6000 to 8000 feet above the sea. It presents a continuous and hardly broken plain between 18\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 of north latitude. The slight ridges that interrupt it seldom rise more than 600 or 800 feet above the valleys they separate. Some of the mountains, however, are of colossal magnitude. The tops of four only are covered with perpetual snow, the highest of which has an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> of 17,700 feet. The table land gradually declines towards the north. The more elevated plains are arid, destitute of trees, and covered with a saline efflorescence. But the greater part of it is extremely fertile, and the whole exceedingly healthy. It enjoys a dry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, and a mild and temperate climate. The medium temperature of winter is from 55\u00b0 to 57\u00b0 of Fahrenheit's thermometer, and in the greatest heat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> it never rises above 75\u00b0. On the coast, however, the air is moist, hot, and unwholesome, and the medium temperature of the whole year is about 75\u00b0 or 79\u00b0. The settlers divide the cultivated part into three zones. 1. The tierras calientes, or warm grounds, which never rising 1000 feet above the sea, have a heat of about 80\u00b0, and yield abundantly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>, cotton, plantains, or bananas. 2. The tierras templadas, or temperate grounds, which lying on the declivity of the great ridge, at an altitude from 4000 to 5000 feet, enjoy a mild vernal temperature of 68\u00b0 or 70\u00b0, that seldom varies 10\u00b0 through the whole year. 3. The tierras fr\u00edas, or cold grounds, having an elevation of 8000 feet, and comprehending the high plains or table land, of which the temperature is generally under 63\u00b0, and never exceeds 75\u00b0.\n\nThe great chain of mountains called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANDES\">Andes</a> is continued through the isthmus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PANAMA\">Panama</a> and through all Mexico, until they are lost in the unknown mountains of the north. The most considerable of that chain is known in Mexico by the name of Sierra Madre.\n\nMexico, like Old Spain, suffers from the want of water and navigable rivers. The R\u00edo Bravo del Norte, and the R\u00edo Colorado are the most considerable, the former having a course of 512 leagues, and the latter of 250. Those rivers, however, are situated in the most uncultivated part of the country. In the southern part of Mexico there are only small rivers, the Alvarado, Guasacualco, Mortezuma, and Zacatula; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SANTIAGO\">Santiago</a> which flows westward, and falls into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific ocean</a> in latitude 21\u00b0, is a large river.\n\nThere are likewise in this country several lakes of very considerable magnitude; but those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NICARAGUA\">Nicaragua</a>, Chapalla, and Pazquaro, which are of the greatest extent, did not belong to the ancient Mexican empire. The most remarkable were those in the vale of Mexico, upon which the capital of the empire was founded. Of these, the fresh water one, called the lake of Chalco, extended in length from east to west 12 miles, as far as the city of Xochimilco; from thence, taking a northerly direction, it incorporated itself by means of a canal with the lake of Tezcuco; but its breadth did not exceed six miles. The other, named the lake of Texcoco, extended 15, or rather 17 miles from cast to west, and something more from south to north; but its extent is now much less, by reason of the Spaniards having diverted the course of many of the streams which run into it. This lake is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, which Clavigero supposes to arise from the nature of the soil which forms its bed.\n\nBesides these, there are a number of smaller lakes, some of which are very delightful. There is a vast variety of mineral waters, of the nitrous, sulphureous, and alumious kinds, some of them so hot that meat may be boiled in them. At Tetihuacan is a kind of petrifying water, as well as in several other parts of\nOne of them forms a kind of smooth white stones, not displeasing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>; the scrapings of which taken in broth are celebrated as a diaphoretic, probably without any good reason. The dose for a person not difficult to be sweated is one dram of the scrapings. Many of the rivers of Mexico afford surprising and beautiful cascades; particularly the river Guadalaxara, at a place called Tempisque, 15 miles to the southward of that city. Along a deep river called Atoyaque is a natural bridge, consisting of a vast mound of earth, along which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> pass conveniently. Clavigero supposes it to have been the fragment of a mountain thrown down by an earthquake, and then penetrated by the river.\n\nThe agriculture of Mexico, with all other branches of industry, have been much improved within the last 30 or 40 years; and so far from the mines operating against it, the cultivation of the soil is generally carried on with the greatest spirit in the mining districts. The plantain or banana tree, which is cultivated over an extent of country containing a million and a half of inhabitants, yields so great a produce, that an arpent of ground covered with it will maintain 50 persons, though if sown with wheat it would not support two. The fruit is farinaceous, and contains much saccharine matter. The tree does not thrive where the medium temperature is below 75\u00b0 F. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-CASSAVA\">cassava</a> root, which grows also in the warm region, at a height from 2000 to 2700 feet, affords a flour, called manioc, which has the inestimable advantage, that when dried and toasted it is secure from the depredations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> and other insects. But maize is the chief food of the inhabitants. It is cultivated from the coast to the height of 9000 feet above the sea. On very fertile lands, and in good years, it yields 800 for 1; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> return for the intratropical part of the country is not more than 150 for 1, and in New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALIFORNIA\">California</a> 70 or 80. The crop is very uncertain, and as it is seldom equally good in every part of the country, the transport of maize comes to be the principal branch of internal commerce. A general failure is followed by scarcity, or even famine. Its price varies from 2\u00bd to 2\u00bd livres the fanega (equal to 1\u00bd English bushels). The annual produce of New Spain in maize is estimated at 17 millions of fanegas. The Mexican wheat is of excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, and the medium return is from 22 to 25 for 1. Much wheat is exported to Cuba. Barley and rye thrive well; oats are very little cultivated. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-POTATO\">potato</a> is raised abundantly in the high and cold parts of the country. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">Rice</a> is but little attended to, though well adapted for the marshy lands on the coast. The cerealia are not cultivated in the intratropical part of Mexico, at a lower elevation than about 2700 feet above the sea, and in very small quantity at a less height than 4000. Neither wheat nor rye come to maturity at a greater height than 1200 feet.\n\nThe sugar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a> has been successfully introduced into some of the interior provinces of the continent. Sugar plantations are spreading rapidly in the plain of Mexico, and supply not only the home consumption, but afford an export of half a million of arobas (equal to about 25 lbs. avoirdupois each); The sugar cane is not cultivated by slaves.\n\nThe Spanish government has always discouraged the cultivation of the vine, the olive, the mulberry-tree, and the plants producing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>. When Humboldt was in the country, an order came from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MADRID\">Madrid</a> to grub up all the vines in the northern parts of the kingdom, where they had been cultivated with so much success as to give alarm to the merchants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADIZ\">Cadiz</a>, by the diminished consumption of wine from the mother country. There is but one olive plantation in the country, which belongs to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Mexico. Since 1764, when the royal monopoly was established, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> can be planted, except in particular districts, and none can be sold except to the king's officers. Parties of soldiers are employed to go about the country in search of tobacco fields; and where they find one on forbidden ground, they impose a fine on the owner, and direct the plantation to be destroyed. This monopoly produces a revenue of more than 20 millions of livres annually.\n\nFrom maize the Indians obtain several kinds of beer or cider by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>. A spirituous liquor named pulque is also procured from this plant. But the intoxicating liquor most in use, and which is also called pulque, is made from the agave Americana. A vigorous plant will afford four gallons of sap per day during four or five months; and this when fermented three or four days forms pulque. It tastes like cider, but has an offensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> of meat in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>. The ardent spirit from it is strictly prohibited by law, lest it should interfere with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of Spanish brandy; but great quantities of it are made clandestinely.\n\nCotton, indigo, coffee, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CACAO\">cacao</a>, are not cultivated to a great extent in New Spain. But the whole of the vanilla consumed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> comes from the provinces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OAXACA\">Oaxaca</a> and Vera Cruz, amounting to 900,000 pods, the value of which, at Vera Cruz, is about 30,000 or 40,000 piastres or dollars. The province of Oaxaca also furnishes 32,000 arobas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COCHINEAL\">cochineal</a>, valued at 2,400,000 dollars.\n\nThe whole annual produce of the agriculture of New Spain is valued by Humboldt at 29 millions of dollars; and as this amount is founded on accurate returns of the amount of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">tithes</a>, and was revised and corrected by well informed persons, it may be considered as a near approximation to the truth.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> of labour in New Spain are 2\u00bd reals de plata a-day on the coast, and 2 reals de plata, or \u00bc dollar, on the table land. The average price of maize on the table land is estimated by Humboldt at 5 livres the fanega; and consequently a labourer on the table land, earns about 1\u00bd pecks of Indian corn a-day. Wheat is dearer in the city of Mexico than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, chiefly in consequence of the cost of transportation.\n\nThe tree producing liquid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>, the liquid storax of the Mexicans, is of a large size, the leaves similar to those of the maple, indented, white in one part and dark in the other, disposed in threes; the fruit is thorny and round, but polygonous, with the surface and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>; the bark of the tree partly green and partly tawney. By incisions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> they extract that valuable substance named liquid amber, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of the same name, which is still more valuable. Liquid amber is likewise obtained from a decoction of the branches, but it is inferior to that obtained from the trunk.\n\nThe name copalli in Mexico is generic, and com-\nmon to all the resins; but especially signifies those made use of for incense. There are ten species of these trees yielding resins of this kind; the principal of which is that from which the Copal is got, so well known in medicine and varnishes. A great quantity of this was made use of by the ancient Mexicans, and is still used for similar purposes by the Spaniards.\n\nThe teocalli or tepecopalli is a resin similar to the incense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>; which distills from a tree of moderate size that grows in the mountains, having a fruit like an acorn, and containing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> enveloped in a mucilage, within which there is a small kernel useful in medicine.\n\nThe mitzquitl, or mezquite, is a species of true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-ACACIA\">acacia</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> distilled from it is said to be the true gum arabic. It is a thorny shrub, with branches irregularly disposed, the leaves small, thin, and pinnated; the flowers being like those of the birch-tree. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> gum, which is found in plenty in Mexico, the natives were in use to make foot-balls, which, though heavy, have a better spring than those filled with air. With this they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>, cloaks, boots, and great coats, in a manner similar to what is done in Europe with wax; and by which means they are rendered all water proof.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> found in Mexico at the arrival of the Spaniards, were lions, tygers, wild cats, bears, wolves, foxes, the common stags, white stags, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCKS\">bucks</a>, wild goats, badgers, polecats, weasels, martins, squirrels, polatucas, rabbits, hares, otters, and rats. All these animals are supposed to be common to both continents. The white stag, whether it be the same species of the other or not, is undoubtedly common to both, and was known to the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>. The Mexicans call it the king of the stags. M. Buffon imagines the white colour of this creature to be the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>; but Clavigero says, that it is found wild, and of the same white colour, on the mountains of New Spain. In many other points, he also contradicts the opinions of this celebrated naturalist, who will not allow the lion, tyger, or rabbit, to be natives of America.\n\nClavigero enumerates the quadrupeds common to New Spain with the rest of the continent of America. Among these he will not allow a place to the Peruvian sheep, the huanaoqo, and sloth; all of which are peculiar to South America. Hernandez indeed makes mention of the Peruvian sheep, and gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> of it; but this was only on account of a few individuals brought thence from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>, which the Mexicans called by that name, in the same manner as he describes several animals of the Philippine isles; not that they had ever been bred in Mexico, or found in any country of North America, unless it was some individual carried there, as they are carried as a curiosity from Europe. The animals which he allows to be common to both countries, are, the Mexican <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HOG\">hog</a>, the moufete, the opossum, the armadillo, the techichi, a small animal resembling a dog; which being perfectly dumb, gave occasion to a report that the Mexican dogs could not bark. The flesh of this animal was eaten by them, and was esteemed agreeable and nourishing food. After the conquest of Mexico, the Spaniards having neither large cattle nor sheep, provided their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> with this quadruped; by which means, the species soon came to be extinct, though it had been very numerous. The land-squirrel is very numerous in the kingdom of Michuacan, has great elegance of form, and is extremely graceful in its movements; but it cannot be tamed, and bites most furiously every person who approaches it.\n\nBesides these, there are sea lions, ratoons, and that voracious animal named the tapir. Oviedo informs us, that he has seen it at one bite tear off two or three hand-breadths of skin from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HOUND\">hound</a>, and at another a whole leg and thigh. The flesh is eatable, and its skin is valued on account of its being sufficiently strong to resist musket-balls. There are likewise great numbers of monkeys of many different kinds; some of which have heads resembling those of dogs. Some of them are strong and fierce, equalling a man in stature when they stand upright.\n\nAmong the animals peculiar to Mexico, is one named coyoto, which appears to have been inaccurately described by natural historians; some making it one species and some another. It is about the size of a mastiff, but more slender. The eyes are yellow and sparkling, ears small, pointed, and erect; the snout blackish, strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, and the feet armed with large crooked nails. The tail is thick and hairy, the skin a mixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, and white; and the voice is compounded of the howl of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">wolf</a> and the bark of the dog. It pursues the deer, and will sometimes even attack men. Its usual pace is a trot, but so quick that a horse at the gallop can scarcely overtake it. The tlalecojotl or tlalecoyo is about the size of a middling dog, and the largest animal that lives under the earth. Its head has some resemblance to that of a cat; but in colour and length of hair it resembles the lion.\u2014It has a long thick tail, and feeds upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a> and small animals, which it catches in the night-time. The tepeizquintli, or mountain-dog, though it is but of the size of a small dog, is so bold that it attacks deer, and sometimes kills them. Its hair and tail are long, the body black, but the head, neck, and breast, white. M. Buffon reckons this animal the same with the glutton, but Clavigero denies it. Another animal, larger than the two foregoing, is called the xolotzcuintli. Some of these are no less than four feet in length. It has a face like the dog, but tusks like the wolf, with erect ears, the neck <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a>, and the tail long.\u2014It is entirely destitute of hair, excepting only the snout, where there are some thick crooked bristles. The whole body is covered with a smooth, soft ash-coloured skin, spotted partly with black and tawney. This species of animals, as well as the two former, are almost totally extinct. A Lyncean academician named Giovanni Febriz, has endeavoured to prove that the xolotzcuintli is the same with the wolf of Mexico; but this is denied by Clavigero.\n\nA curious animal of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a> kind is called tozan or tuza. It is about the size of a European mole, but very different otherwise. The body is about seven or eight inches long, and well made; the snout like that of a mouse, the ears small and round, with the tail short. The mouth is armed with very strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, and its paws are furnished with strong crooked nails, with which it digs its habitation in the earth. It is extremely destructive to the corn fields by the quantity of grain it steals, and to the highways by the number\nThe birds are so numerous, and of such various appearances and qualities, that Mexico has been called the country of birds, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> is of quadrupeds. Hernandez describes above 200 peculiar to the country. He allows to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAGLES\">eagles</a> and hawks of Mexico a superiority over those of Europe; and the falcons of this country were formerly esteemed so excellent, that, by the desire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> II., a hundred of them were sent every year over to Spain. The largest, the most beautiful, and the most valuable kind of eagles, is called by the Mexicans *itzquauhtli*, and will pursue not only the larger kinds of birds, but quadrupeds, and even men.\n\nThe ravens of Mexico, do not, like those of other countries, feed upon carrion, but subsist entirely by stealing corn. The carrion is devoured by the birds called in South America *gallinazzi*, in Mexico *zopilots* and *aure*. By Hernandez they are said to be a species of ravens; but, according to Clavigero, they are very different, not only in their size, but in the shape of their head, their flight, and their voice.\n\nThe aquatic birds are very numerous, and of great variety.\u2014There are at least 20 species of ducks, a vast number of geese, with several kinds of herons, great numbers of swans, quails, water rails, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a>, king's fishers, pelicans, &c. The multitude of ducks is sometimes so great, that they cover the fields, and appear at a distance like flocks of sheep. Some of the herons and egrets are perfectly white, some ash-coloured; others have the plumage of the body white, while the neck, with the tops and upper part of the wings, and part of the tail, are enlivened with a bright scarlet, or beautiful blue.\n\nNumbers of the other classes of birds are valuable for their flesh, plumage, or song, while some are remarkable for their extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a> or other properties. Clavigero enumerates more than 70 species of those which afford an agreeable and wholesome food. Besides the common fowls which were brought from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANARIES\">Canaries</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANTILLES\">Antilles</a>, and from these to Mexico, there were, and still are, fowls peculiar to the country itself. These partly resemble the common fowl and partly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PEACOCK\">peacock</a>, whence they had the name of *gallipavos* from the Spaniards. From Mexico they were imported into Europe, where they have multiplied very fast, especially in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, though the common fowls have multiplied much more in Mexico.\n\nThere are great numbers of birds valuable on account of their plumage, which was made use of by the Mexicans in their excellent mosaic works; an art which seems now to be totally lost. Peacocks have been carried from the old continent to Mexico; but, not being attended to, have propagated very slowly. The birds remarkable for their song are likewise very numerous; among which that called the *centzonitl*, by Europeans the *mocking-bird*, is the most remarkable, on account of its counterfeiting naturally the notes of all others it hears. There are great numbers of beautiful parrots; and there is a bird which counterfeits the human voice, but in a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURLESQUE\">burlesque</a> tone, and will follow travellers a great way. The *txacua* is remarkable for its instinct. Birds of this kind live in society, every tree being a village or city to them, having great numbers of nests in the neighbourhood of each other, all hanging from the boughs. One of them, whose office it is to be the head or guard of the village, resides in the middle of the tree; from which it flies about from one nest to another, visiting them all, and after singing a little, returns to its place, while the rest continue perfectly silent. If any bird of a different species approaches the tree, he flies to it, and with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> and wings endeavours to drive it off; but if a man or any large animal comes near, he flies screaming to another tree; and if at that time any of his fellows happen to be returning to their nests, he meets them, and, changing his note, obliges them to retire again: as soon as he perceives the danger over, he returns to his wonted round of visiting the nests.\n\nMexico, like all other American countries, abounds with reptiles, many of them of enormous size. The crocodiles are not less to be dreaded than those of Africa or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, and there are likewise some of those monstrous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a> met with in the East Indies and in South America: though happily the species of those terrible creatures seems to be nearly extinct, as they are seldom to be found but in some solitary wood, or other remote place. There are great numbers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIZARDS\">lizards</a>, some of which the people suppose to be poisonous; but Clavigero thinks this opinion ill-founded. There are several kinds of poisonous serpents, of which the rattlesnake is one.\n\nThe aquatic animals are innumerable. Clavigero mentions a species of frogs so large that a single one will weigh a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>, and which are excellent food.\u2014Of fish proper for food, he says that he has counted upwards of 100 species, without taking in the turtle, crab, lobster, or any other crustaceous animal. The sharks are well known for their voracity. A whole sheep's skin, and even a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a>'s knife, has been found in the belly of one of them. They are accustomed to follow vessels, to devour any filth that is thrown overboard; and, according to Oviedo, they have been known to keep up with ships sailing before a fair wind for no less than 500 miles. The bottetto is a fish about eight inches in length, but excessively thick. While this fish lies alive upon the beach, it swells whenever it is touched to an enormous size, and boys often take pleasure in making it burst with a kick. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> is so poisonous as to kill with strong convulsions in half an hour after it is eaten.\n\nOf flying and other minute insects, the number is prodigiously great. There are a variety of beetles: some of a green colour make a great noise in flying; on which account children are fond of them. There are great numbers of shining beetles, which make a delightful appearance at night, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> flies which abound in the country. There are six kinds of bees and four kinds of wasps; of which last, one collects wax and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> of a very sweet taste; another is called the *wandering wasp* from its frequent change of abode; and in consequence of these changes, it is constantly employed in collecting materials for its habitations. The lake of Mexico abounds with a kind\nAnimals of fly, the eggs of which are deposited upon the flags and rushes in such quantities as to form large masses. These are collected by the fishermen, and carried to market for sale. They are eaten by both Mexicans and Spaniards, and have much the same taste as the caviare of fish. There are abundance of gnats in the moist places and lakes; but the capital, though situated upon a lake, is entirely free from them. The butterflies are in vast numbers, and their wings glow with colours far superior to those of Europe; the figures of some of them are given by Hernandez. But notwithstanding its beauties and advantages, Mexico is subject to the dreadful devastations of locusts, which sometimes occasion the most destructive famines.\n\nThere are some of the worms of Mexico made use of by the inhabitants as food; others are poisonous. There are great numbers of scolopendrae and scorpions, some of the former growing to an immense size. Hernandez says, that he has seen some of them two feet long and two inches thick. The scorpions are very numerous; and in the hot parts of the country their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> is so strong as to kill children, and give terrible pain to adults. Their sting is most dangerous during those hours of the day in which the sun is hottest. There is a mischievous kind of tick, which in the hot countries abounds among the grass. From thence it easily gets among the clothes, and from them upon the skin. There it fixes with such force, from the particular figure of its feet, that it can scarcely be got off. At first it seems nothing but a small black speck, but in a short time enlarges to such a degree, from the blood which it sucks, that it equals the size of a bean, and then assumes a leaden colour. If it is not speedily removed, a wound is made similar to that which the nigera or chegoc makes.\n\nMexico produces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-SILK_WORMS\">silk-worms</a>: and the manufacture of silk might be carried on to great advantage, were it not prohibited for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> reasons. Besides the common silk, there is another found in the woods, very white, soft, and strong. It grows on the trees in several maritime places, particularly in dry seasons. Unless by poor people, however, this silk is not turned to any use, partly from inattention to their interests, but \"chiefly (says our author) from the obstructions which would be thrown in the way of any one who should attempt a trade of that kind. We know from Cortes's letters to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. that silk used to be sold in the Mexican markets; and some pictures are still preserved, done by the ancient Mexicans upon a paper made of silk.\"\n\nThe mines of Mexico have greatly increased in productiveness within the last forty years. They are chiefly of silver; and the ore is remarkable for its poverty; but, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> this disadvantage, it occurs in great abundance. The whole number of persons employed under ground does not exceed 30,000, and all these are free labourers, who have high wages; the mita tanda, or forced labour of the Indians, having been abolished more than forty years ago. The subjoined table gives the average annual coinages of Mexico during successive periods; and, as very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULLION\">bullion</a> is exported from Mexico, the amount of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COINAGE\">coinage</a> expresses very nearly the produce of the mines.\n\n| Silver Dollars | Gold Dollars | Total Dollars |\n|---------------|-------------|--------------|\n| From 1733 to 1742, ten years, | 8,998,209 | 434,050 | 9,432,259 |\n| 1743\u20141752, \u2014 | 11,566,030 | 455,109 | 12,021,139 |\n| 1753\u20141762, \u2014 | 11,971,835 | 462,773 | 12,434,603 |\n| 1763\u20141771, nine years, | 11,777,909 | 761,553 | 12,539,462 |\n| 1772\u20141782, eleven years, | 17,551,906 | 835,386 | 18,387,492 |\n| 1783\u20141792, ten years, | 19,491,309 | 644,040 | 20,135,349 |\n| In 1793, \u2014 | 23,428,680 | 884,262 | 24,312,942 |\n| From 1795 to 1804, ten years, | 21,084,787 |","sp":795,"ep":826},{"h":"MEXICO","t":"New, so called because it was discovered later than Old Mexico, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, lying on the eastern side of the northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANDES\">Andes</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Stony <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and extending from the 31st to the 38th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of latitude. Its length from north to south is 175 leagues, and its breadth from east to west from 30 to 50. Its surface covers 5700 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> leagues, and it contained in 1803, 40,200 inhabitants according to Humboldt. It is fertile, but is believed to be destitute of metallic wealth. It is watered through its whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> by the Rio del Norte, the banks of which are picturesque, and are adorned with beautiful poplars, and other trees peculiar to the temperate zone.\n\nThough under the same latitude with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a> and central <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, this country has a remarkably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. Near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SANTA_FE\">Santa Fe</a>, and a little further north, the Rio del Norte is sometimes covered for a succession of several years with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> thick enough to admit the passage of horses and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>. The mountains which bound the valley of the Rio del Norte, lose their snow towards the beginning of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>.\n\nThe Rio del Norte has a periodical swell like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MISSISSIPPI\">Mississippi</a>. Its waters, which are always muddy, begin to rise in April, are at their height in May, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> towards the end of June. The inhabitants can only ford the river on horses of an extraordinary size, during the drought of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>. Humboldt informs us that in 1752, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of this river, for more than 30 leagues above and 20 leagues below Passo del Norte, became dry of a sudden, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> having precipitated itself into a newly formed chasm, and only made its re-appearance near the Presidio de San Eleazar; at length, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of several weeks, the water resumed its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> course, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt because the chasm and the subterraneous conductors had been filled up. In the northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of New Mexico, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> take their rise which run into the Mississippi.\n\nThe colonists of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, known for their great energy of character, live in a state of perpetual warfare with the neighbouring Indians. It is on account of this insecurity of the country <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, that we find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> more populous than we should expect in so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> a country. Some commercial intercourse exists however, between the whites and the Indians, and it is carried on in a singular manner. The savages plant upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> from Chihuahua to Santa Fe, small crosses, to which they suspend a leathern pocket, with a piece of stag's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>; and below a buffalo's hide is stretched.

Having performed his studies at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAEN\">Caen</a>, he discovered a strong inclination to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>; but going to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, he, by the advice of one of his friends, applied himself to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of politics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, and procured the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMISSARY\">commissary</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, which he held for two campaigns. He then shut himself up in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARBE\">Barbe</a>, in the midst of books and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a>; and, in 1643, published the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the History of France, in folio; and some years after, the other two volumes. Mezeray in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> surpassed all who had written the history of France before him, and was rewarded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> with a pension of 4000 livres. In 1668, he published an Abridgement of his History of France, in three volumes 4to, which was well received by the public; but as he inserted in that work the origin of most of the taxes, with very free reflections, M. Colbert complained of it, when Mezeray promised to correct what he had done in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> edition; but those corrections being only palliations, the minister caused half of his pension to be suppressed. Mezeray complained of this in very severe terms; when he obtained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other answer than the suppression of the other half. Vexed at this treatment, he resolved to write on subjects that could not expose him to such disappointments; and composed his treatise on the origin of the French, which did him much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>. He was elected perpetual secretary to the French academy; and died in 1683.

To perform it, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAKE\">rake</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HATCH\">hatch</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNCH\">punch</a>, the surface of the plate all over with a knife, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> made for the purpose, first one way, then the other, across, &c. till the surface of the plate be thus entirely furrowed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> or furrows, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> and as it were contiguous to each other; so that, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> was then taken from it, it would be one uniform blot or smut. This done, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> is drawn or marked on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>; after which, they proceed with burnishers, scrapers, &c. to expunge and take out the dents or furrows, in all parts where the lights of the piece are to be; and that more or less as the lights are to be stronger or fainter; leaving those parts.\nparts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> which are to represent the shadows or deepenings of the draught.\n\nAs it is much easier to scrape or burnish away parts of a dark ground corresponding with the outline of any design sketched upon it, than to form shades upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> ground by an infinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HATCHES\">hatches</a>, strokes, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, which must all terminate with exactness on the outline, as well as differ in their force and manner; the method of scraping, as it is called, in mezzotinto, consequently becomes much more easy and expeditious than any other method of engraving. The instruments used in this kind of engraving are cradles, scrapers and burnishers.\n\nIn this engraving, the plate must be prepared and polished in the same manner as for other engraving; and afterwards divided equally by lines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to each other, and traced out with very soft chalk.\u2014The distance of these lines should be about one-third of the length of the face of the cradle which is to be used, and these lines should be marked with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> letters, or strokes of the chalk. The cradle is then to be placed exactly betwixt the two first lines, and passed forwards in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; being kept as steady as possible, and pressed upon with a moderate force. The same operation must be repeated with respect to all other lines; till the instrument has thus passed over the whole surface of the plate.\u2014Other lines must be then drawn from the extremities of the other two sides, in the same manner; which, intersecting the first at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> with them form squares; and the same operation must be repeated with the cradle as in the ease of the first. New lines must then be drawn diagonally, and the cradle passed betwixt them as before; and when the first diagonal operation is performed, the lines must be crossed at right angles as the former, and the cradles passed betwixt them in the same manner.\u2014The plate having undergone the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the cradle, according to the disposition of the first order of lines, a second set must be formed, having the same distances from each other as the first. But they must be so placed as to divide those already made into spaces one-third less than their whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; i.e., every one after the first on each side will take in one-third of that before it, e.g., beginning at A, of which the first third must be left out; a third of B will consequently be taken in, and so of the rest. These lines of the second order must be marked with small letters, or lesser strokes, to distinguish them from the first: and the same treatment of the plate must be pursued with respect to them as was practised for the others. When this second operation is finished, a third order of lines must be made, the first of which, e.g., in A, must omit two-thirds of it, and consequently take in two-thirds of B, &c. By these means, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> spaces will be exactly divided into equal thirds; and the cradle must be again employed betwixt these lines as before.\u2014When the whole of this operation is finished, it is called one turn; but in order to produce a very dark and uniform ground, the plate must undergo the repetition of all these several operations for above twenty times; beginning to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the cradle again betwixt the first lines, and proceeding in the same manner through all the rest. When the plate is prepared with a proper ground, the sketch must be chalked on it, by rubbing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on the backside with chalk.\n\nIt is also proper to overtrace it afterwards with black lead or Indian ink. The scraping is then performed, by paring or cutting away the grain of the ground in various degrees; so that none of it is left in the original state except in the touches of the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>. The general manner of proceeding is the same as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> upon black paper. The masses of light are first begun with; and those parts which go off into light in their upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, but are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> below: the reflections are then entred upon; after which the plate is blackened with a printer's blacking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> made of felt, in order to discover the effect; and then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> is proceeded with; observing always to begin every part in the places where the strongest lights are to be.\n\nThe art of scraping mezzotintos has been applied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> with a variety of colours, in order to produce the resemblance of paintings. The inventor of the method of doing this was J. C. Le Blon, a native of Frankfort, and pupil of Carlo Marata, between the years 1720 and 1730. It was established by the inventor on this principle, that there are three primitive colours, of which all the rest may be composed by mixing them in various proportions; that any two of these colours being mixed together, preserve their original power, and only produce a third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> such as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> must necessarily give; but if transparent colours be mixed, and three primitive kinds compounded together, they destroy each other, and produce black, or a tendency to it, in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> or inequality of the mixture; and that if, therefore, these three colours be laid, either separately or upon each other, by three plates, engraved correspondently on these principles to the colouring of the design, the whole variety of teints necessary may be produced. The requisites, therefore, to the execution of any design in this method of printing are as follows:\n\n1. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the colouring to be imitated; showing where the presence of each of the three simple colours is necessary, either in its pure state or combined with some other, to produce the effect required; and to reduce this plan to a painted sketch of each, in which not only the proper outlines, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of strength should be expressed.\n\n2. To engrave three plates according to this plan, which may print each of the colours exactly in the places where, and proportion in which, they are wanted.\n\n3. To find three transparent substances proper for printing with these three primitive colours. The manner in which M. le Blon prepared the plates was as follows: The three plates of copper were first well fitted with respect to size and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> to each other, and grounded in the same manner as those designed for mezzotinto prints: and the exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> and boundary of each of the three primitive colours, conformably to the design, were sketched out on three papers, answering in dimensions to the plate. These sketches were then chalked on the plates; and all the parts of each plate that were not to convey the colour to which it was appropriated to the print, were entirely scraped away, as in forming the light of mezzotinto prints. The parts that were to convey the colours were then worked upon; and where the most light or diluted teints of the colour were to be, the grain in the ground was proportionably taken off; but where the\nfull colour was required, it was left entire. In this regard was had, not only to the effects of the colour in its simple state, but to its combined operation, either in producing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a>-colour, green, or purple, by its admixture with one alone; and likewise to its forming brown, gray, and shades of different degrees, by its co-operation with both the others. But though the greatest part of the engraving was performed in the mezzotinto manner, yet the graver was employed occasionally for strengthening the shades, and for correcting the outline where it required great accuracy and steadiness. It was found necessary sometimes to have two separate plates for printing the same colour, in order to produce a stronger effect: but the second plate, which was used to print upon the first, was intended only to glaze and soften the colours in particular parts that might require it. With respect to the black and brown tints, which could not be so conveniently produced in a due degree by the mixture of the colours, umber and black were likewise used.\n\nWith respect to the order in which the plates are to be applied, it may be proper to observe, that the colour which is least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> should be laid on first; that which is betwixt the most and least apparent next; and that which predominates last; except where there may be occasion for two plates for the same colour, as was before mentioned; or where there is any required for adding browns and shades.\n\nM. le Blon applied this art to portraits, and showed, by the specimens he produced, the possibility of its being brought, by farther improvements, to afford imitations of painting which might have some value. It is nevertheless much better adapted to the simpler subjects, where there are fewer intermixtures of colours; and where the accuracy of the reflections, and demi-tints, are not so essentially necessary to the truth of the design, from the greater latitude of form, and disposition of the colour, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, anatomical figures, and some subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>.

As to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> between Michael and the Dragon, some authors understand it literally, and think it means the expulsion of certain rebellious angels, with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> or leader, from the presence of God. Others take it in a figurative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>; and refer it, either to the contest that happened at Rome between St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> and Simon Magus, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> prevailed over the magician, or to those violent persecutions under which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> laboured for three hundred years, and which happily ceased when the powers of the world became Christian. Among the commentators who maintain the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is Grotius; and among those who take it in a figurative sense are Hammond and Mede.\n\nThe contest about the body of Moses is likewise taken both literally and figuratively. Those who understand it literally are of opinion, that Michael by the order of God hid the body of Moses after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and that the Devil endeavoured to discover it, as a fit means to entice the people to idolatry, by a superstitious worship of his relics. But this dispute is figuratively understood to be a controversy about rebuilding the temple, and restoring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of God among the Jews at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>; the Jewish church being fitly enough styled the body of Moses. It is thought by some, that this story of the contest between Michael and the Devil was taken by St Jude out of an apocryphal book called The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">Assumption</a> of Moses.\n\nThe Romish church celebrates three appearances of Michael, of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> mention is made in scripture, and which have happened, they say, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the apostles. The first appearance of this archangel was at Colosse in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRYGIA\">Phrygia</a>, but at what time is uncertain. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> is that of Mount Garganus, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, about the end of the fifth century. The third is his appearance to Aubert bishop of Avranches, upon a rock called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">Tomb</a>, where at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a> of St Michael. This was about the year 766. The first of these festivals is observed on the 6th of September, the second on the 6th of May, and the last on the 16th of October. It has been supposed, that it was Michael the archangel who conducted the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness, (see Exod. xxxii. 20, 23, and xxxiii. 2.) that it was he who appeared to Moses in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> bush; who appeared to Joshua in the fields of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERICHO\">Jericho</a>, and to Gideon and Manoah the father of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMSON\">Samson</a>;\nMichael, and, in a word, to him have been imputed the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the most remarkable appearances either in the Old or New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>.\n\n**Michael Angelo.** See **Angelo.**\n\n**Mount Michael,** formerly one of the most celebrated state <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISONS\">prisons</a> of France, lies about 20 miles from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANVILLE\">Granville</a>. It is a rock situated in the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of Avranches; and is only accessible at low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> has completely fortified one side, by its craggy and almost perpendicular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, which renders it impracticable to mount it by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> or courage, however consummate. The other parts are surrounded by walls fenced with semilunar towers after the Gothic manner; but sufficiently strong, together with the advantage of its situation, to render it impregnable to any attack. At the foot of the mountain begins a street or town, which winds round its base to a considerable height. Above are chambers where state prisoners are kept, and where there are other buildings intended for residence. On the summit is erected the abbey itself, occupying a prodigious space of ground, and of a strength and solidity equal to its enormous size; since it has for many centuries withstood all the injuries of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, to which it is so much exposed. In an apartment, called the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">Sale</a> de Chavalerie,* the knights of St Michael used to meet in solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a> on important occasions. They were the defenders and guardians of this mountain and abbey, as those of the Temple, and of St John of Jerusalem, were of the holy sepulchre. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> in which they met is very spacious, but rude and barbarous. At one end is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> of the archangel, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of their order; and in this hall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XI. first instituted and invested with the insignia of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a> the chevaliers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> of St Michael. There is a miserable dark apartment, or rather dungeon, in which many eminent persons were formerly confined. In the middle of it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAGE\">cage</a>, composed of prodigious bars of wood; and the wicket which gives entrance into it is 10 or 12 inches in thickness. The inside of it comprises about 12 or 14 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, and it is nearly 20 in height. Towards the latter end of the 17th century, a newswriter in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, who had presumed to print some very severe and sarcastic reflections on Madame de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAINTENON\">Maintenon</a>, was confined in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. Some months after his publication, he was induced, by a person sent expressly for that purpose, to make a tour into French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>. The moment he had quitted the Dutch territories, he was put under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a>; and immediately, by his majesty's express command, conducted to Mount Michael, where he was shut up in this cage. Here he lived upwards of 23 years; and here he at length expired.\n\nDuring the long nights of winter, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> or fire was allowed him. He was not permitted to have any book. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, except the gaoler, who came once every day to present him, through a hole in the wicket, with his little portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and wine. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> was given him with which he could destroy himself; but he found means at length to draw out a nail from the wood, with which he engraved, or cut on the bars of his cage, certain fleurs de lis and armorial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BEARINGS\">bearings</a>, which formed his only employment and recreation. They are very curiously performed considering the rudeness of his instrument.\n\nThe subterraneous chambers in this mountain are said to be so numerous, that the gaolers themselves do not know them. There are certain dungeons called *aubliettes,* into which they were accustomed anciently to let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> malefactors guilty of very heinous crimes: they provided them with a loaf of bread and a bottle of wine, and then they were totally forgotten, and left to perish by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> in the dark vaults of the rock. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, however, has not been inflicted by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> in the last or present century.\n\nHere also is a remarkable chamber, in one corner of which is a kind of window: between this and the wall of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> is a very deep space, of near 100 feet perpendicular, at the bottom of which is another window opening to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. It is called the *Hole of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTGOMERY\">Montgomery</a>*; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of it is as follows: In the year 1559, Henry II. king of France was unfortunately killed at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOURNAMENT\">tournament</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> de Montgomery*. He was a Huguenot; and having escaped the massacre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, made head against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> forces in Normandy, supported by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> No 14\u00b0, with arms and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>. Being driven from his fortresses in these parts, he retired to a rock called the *Tombelaine:* This is another similar to Mount Michael; only three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> from it, and of nearly equal dimensions. At that time there was a castle upon it, which has since been demolished, and of which scarce any vestiges now remain. From this fortress, accessible only at low-water, he continually made excursions, and annoyed the enemy, who never dared to attack him. He coined money, laid all the adjacent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> under contribution, and rendered himself universally dreaded. Desirous, however, to surprise Mount Michael, he found means to engage one of the monks resident in the abbey; who promised to give him the signal for his enterprise by displaying a handkerchief. The monk having made the signal, betrayed him, and armed all his associates, who waited Montgomery's arrival. The chieftain came, attended by 50 chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, all desperate, and capable of any attempt. They crossed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>; and having placed their scaling-ladders, mounted one by one. As they came to the top, they were despatched, each in turn, without noise. Montgomery, who followed last, discovered the perfidy, and escaped with only two of his men, with whom he regained the Tombelaine. They preserve with great care the ladders and grappling irons used on this occasion. The count was at last besieged and taken prisoner, by the mar\u00e9chal de Matignon, in 1574, at Domfront, in Normandy; and Catharine de M\u00e9dicis, who hated him for having been, though innocently, the cause of her husband's death, caused him to be immediately executed.\n\nThe church of Mount Michael is a great curiosity. It stands on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> pillars of most enormous dimensions, built on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> rock. Each of them appears to be about 25 feet in circumference: besides these, there are two others much inferior in size, on which the centre of the church rests, and over which is the tower. The following is the legendary account of the origin of this church: In the reign of Childibert II. there was a bishop of Avranches named St Aubert. To this holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> the archangel Michael was pleased to appear one night, and ordered him to go to this rock to build a church. St Aubert treated this as a dream; upon which the angel appeared a second time; and being still disobeyed,\nMichael disobeyed, he returned a third time, when, by way of imprinting his command upon the saint's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, he made a hole in his skull by touching it with his thumb. The skull is still preserved in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> of the church. It is enclosed in a little shrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, and a crystal, which opens over the orifice, admits the gratification of curiosity by the minutest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of it. The hole is of a size and shape proportionable to the thumb said to have produced it; but it is impossible to determine whether it has been really made by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> or any other way. It is not to be supposed that the saint would forget such a sensible mark of the angel's displeasure; he therefore immediately repaired to the rock, and constructed a small church, as he had been commanded. Here, however, true history supplies the place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>; and informs us, that it was in 966 when Richard the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Normandy began to build the abbey. It was completed about the year 1070, under William the Conqueror, though many other additions were made by succeeding abbots.\n\nIn the treasury of the church are innumerable other relics: among which some few have a real and intrinsic value. There is a fine head of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> VI. of France, cut in a crystal, and the representation of a cockleshell in gold, weighing many pounds, given by Richard II. duke of Normandy, when he founded the abbey. There is an arm said to belong to St Richard king of England; but who this saint was it must be very difficult to determine. Such is the history of the prison, abbey, and church of Mount Michael previous to the revolution; they have probably undergone some changes since that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>.\n\nSt MICHAEL'S, a borough town of Cornwall, between St Columb and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRURO\">Truro</a>, 247 miles from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.

Of the works that were published during his life-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and which are very numerous, a catalogue, in the order of their publication, is given in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1792.","sp":840,"ep":840},{"h":"MICHAELMAS","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Feast of St MICHAEL and all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">Angels</a>, a festival of the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, observed on the 29th of September.

He was born about the year 1735, and was educated by his father. In his early years his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> frequently discovered itself; though till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 13 he did not show any particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to books. At that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> having accidentally met with Spenser's Faery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>, he became enamoured of his manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, and instantly began to imitate him. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his father, he came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> to reside with his uncle who was a brewer there, and who admitted him into a share of his business; not being qualified to succeed in this line, he went to London about the time of the conclusion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> which began in 1755, with a view to procure a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. Here he was disappointed; but introduced himself to the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Lyttelton, to whom he sent one of his poems. From his Lordship, however, he received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other favour than being admitted to several interviews, and encouraged to persevere in his poetical plans.\n\nSo closely did our author cultivate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">muses</a>, that before he was 18 years of age he had written two tragedies and half an epic poem; but all these were committed to the flames. The first of his poems which appeared in print was published in one of the Edinburgh magazines, and entitled, \"On passing through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">Close</a> of Edinburgh at Midnight.\" This was afterwards inserted in A Collection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">Original</a> Poems by a Scotch gentleman, vol. ii. p. 137.\n\nFrom the time of Mr Mickle's arrival in London till the year 1765, it is not known how he employed his time, though it is probable that he was employed in some branch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> business; and in 1765 he engaged himself as corrector to the Clarendon press. This year he published the Poem which first brought him into notice, entitled, \"Pollio, an Elegiac Ode, written in the Wood near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROSLIN\">Roslin</a> Castle,\" 4to. This was an elegy written on the death of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, which, previous to its publication, had been shown to Lord Lyttelton, and received some corrections from him. The latter, in an epistle to the author, spoke of it as equal to any thing of the kind in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. In 1767 he published a poem called \"The Concubine, in two cantos, after the manner of Spencer,\" 4to; and in 1769 he published, \"A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">Letter</a> to Mr Harwood, wherein some of his evasive glosses, false translations, and blundering criticisms, in support of the Arian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">Heresy</a>, contained in his literal translation of the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, are pointed out and confuted,\" 8vo: and next year he published \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> Queen of Scots, an Elegy;\" \"Hengist and Mary, a ballad;\" and \"Knowledge, an Ode;\" in Peach's Collection of Poems. In 1770 he published \"Voltaire in the Shades, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Dialogues on the Deistical Controversy,\" 8vo. The Elegy on Mary had been submitted to the judgment of Lord Lyttelton, who declined to criticise it, not for its deficiency in poetical merit, but from thinking differently from the author concerning that unfortunate princess.\n\nAbout this time Mr Mickle was a frequent writer in the Whitehall Evening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">Post</a>; but a more important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> now engaged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. When no more than 17 years of age he had read Castara's translation of the Lusiad of Camoens into French, and then projected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of giving an English translation of it. From this, however, he was prevented by various avocations till the year 1771, when he published the first book as a specimen: and having prepared himself by acquiring some knowledge of the Portuguese language, he determined to apply himself entirely to this work. With this view he quitted his residence at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, and went to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> at Forest-hill, where he pursued his design with unremitting assiduity till the year 1775, when the work was entirely finished.\n\nDuring the time that Mr Mickle was engaged in this work, he subsisted entirely by his employment as corrector of the press; and on his quitting that employment he had only the subscriptions he received for his translation to support him. Notwithstanding these difficulties, he adhered steadily to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> he laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and completed it in about five years.\n\nWhen his work was finished, Mr Mickle applied to a person of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, with whom his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> had been connected, for permission to dedicate it to him. Permission was granted, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> honoured him with a very polite letter; but after receiving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>, for which an extraordinary price was paid for the binding, he did not think proper to take any notice of the author. At last a gentleman of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> rank in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> world, a firm friend to the author, and who afterwards took him under his protection, waited on the patron, and heard him declare that he had not read the work, but that it had been represented not to have the merit it was at first said to possess. The applause with which the work was received, however, soon banished from the author's mind those disagreeable sensations which had been occasioned by the contemptuous neglect of his patron, as well as some severe criticisms which had been circulated concerning it. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> edition was prepared in 1778, with a plate prefixed to it, executed by the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> Mortimer; on whom Mr Mickle wrote an epitaph in 1779. This year also he published a pamphlet, entitled, \"A Candid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">Examination</a> of the Reasons for depriving the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARTER\">Charter</a>, contained in The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> and Management of the East India Company from its Commencement to the Present Time; together with some Strictures on the Self-Contradictions and Historical Errors of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Smith, in his Reasons for the Abolition of the said Company,\" 4to. About this time some of his friends thought of recommending him to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> as deserving of a pension; but this scheme was never put in execution. Dr Lowth, bishop of London, would have put him into orders, and provided for him in the church; but this was not agreeable to our author's disposition. While he was meditating a publication of all his poems, in which he would most probably have found his account, he was appointed secretary to Commodore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOHNSTONE\">Johnstone</a>, who had lately obtained the command of the Romney <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of war. In November 1779 he arrived at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a>, and was named by his patron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> for the prizes which were taken. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> and its neighbourhood he resided more than six months, being everywhere received with every mark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a> and attention;\ntention; and during this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> he composed his poem called \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALMADA\">Almada</a> Hill,\" which in 1781 was published in quarto. He collected also many particulars concerning the manners of the Portuguese, which he intended also to have published. During his stay at Lisbon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy was opened; and Mr Mickle, who was present at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of its commencement, had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to be admitted a member under the presidency of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> John of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRAGANZA\">Braganza</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Lusoens. His presence being thought necessary in England to attend to the proceedings of the courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a> respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> of some of the prizes, he did not accompany the Commodore in his last expedition, nor did <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> go any more to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. In 1782 he published \"The Prophecy of Queen Emma, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Ballad lately discovered, written by Johannes Turgotus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>, in the reign of William Rufus; to which is added by the Editor, an Account of the Discovery, and Hints towards a Vindication of the Authenticity, of the Poems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OSSIAN\">Ossian</a> and Rowley,\" 8vo.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> this year Mr Mickle married Miss Tomkins, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of the person with whom he resided at Forest-hill, while engaged in translating the Lusiad. Having received some fortune with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, as well as made some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> himself when in the service of Commodore Johnstone, he now enjoyed a comfortable independence. He afterwards fixed his residence at Wheatley in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXFORDSHIRE\">Oxfordshire</a>, and devoted his time to the revision of his poetical works, which he proposed to publish by subscription. During the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> he was employed in writing for the European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>. The Fragments of Leo, and some of the most approved reviews of books, in that periodical work, were of his production. He died after a short illness, on the 25th of October 1788, at Wheatley, leaving one son behind him. His poetry possesses much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, variety, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> of numbers, and vigour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>; his life was without reproach; his foibles were few and inoffensive; his virtues many; and his genius very considerable.","sp":840,"ep":842},{"h":"MICROCOSM","t":"a Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> signifying the little world; used by some for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, as being supposed an epitome of the universe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> great world.","sp":842,"ep":842},{"h":"MICROGRAPHY","t":"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of objects viewed with the assistance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>.

The first TELESCOPIC micrometers were only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> contrivances for measuring the image of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> of the object-glass. Before these contrivances were thought of, astronomers were accustomed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the field of view in each of their telescopes, by observing how much of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> they could see through it, the semidiameter being reckoned at 15 or 16 minutes; and other distances were estimated by the eye, comparing them with the field of view. Mr Gascoigne, an English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, however, fell upon a much more accurate method before the year 1647, and had a Treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a> prepared for the press; but he was killed during the civil wars in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. and his manuscript was never found. His instrument, however, fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of Mr R. Townly*, who says, that by the help of it he could mark above 40,000 divisions in a foot.\n\n2. Mr Gascoigne's instrument being shown to Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>. 25, Hooke, he gave a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of it, and proposed several improvements\u2020. Mr Gascoigne divided Trans. Abr. the image of an object in the focus of the object-glass, by the approach of two pieces of metal ground to a very fine Posthumous edge, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of which Dr Hooke would substitute Works, two fine hairs stretched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to one another.\n\n3. Mr Huygens measured the apparent diameters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, by first determining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the field of view in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>; which, he says, is best done by p. 190, observing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STAR\">star</a> takes up in passing over Huygen's it, and then preparing two or three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and slender microme-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> plates, of various breadths, the sides of which are ter. very straight, and converging to a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>. In using these pieces of brass, he made them slide in two slits, made in the sides of the tube, opposite to the place of the image, and observed in what place it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> covered the diameter of any planet, or any small distance that he wanted to measure. It was observed, however, by Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, that the diameters of planets, measured in this manner, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be larger than they should be, as all lucid objects appear to be when they are viewed upon dark ones.\n\n4. In the Ephemerides of the Marquis of Malvasia, Marquis of published in 1662, it appears that he had a method of measuring small distances between fixed stars and the micrometers of the planets, and also of taking accurate draughts of the spots of the moon by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> of silver wire, fixed in the focus of the eye-glass. He likewise contrived to make one of two stars <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> along the threads of this net, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> it, or the telescope, as much as was necessary for that purpose; and he counted, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a>-clock, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> seconds, the time that elapsed in its passage from one wire to another, which gave him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of minutes and seconds of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> contained between the intervals of the wires of his net, with respect to the focal length of his telescope.\n\n5. In 1666, Messrs Auzout and Picard published Auzout's description of a micrometer, which was nearly the same micrometer with that of the Marquis of Malvasia, excepting the method of dividing it, which they performed with more exactness by a screw. In some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> they used threads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, as being finer than silver wires. Dechales also recommends a micrometer consisting of fine wires, or silken threads, the distances of which were exactly known, disposed in the form of a net, as peculiarly convenient for taking a map of the moon.\n\n6. M. de la Hire says, that there is no method more DelaHire's simple or commodious for observing the digits of an eclipse than a net in the focus of the telescope. These, he says, were generally made of silken threads; and that for this particular purpose six concentric circles had also been made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of, drawn upon oiled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>; but he advises to draw the circles on very thin pieces of glass with the point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a>. He also gives several particular directions to assist persons in the use of them.\n\n7. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">Construction</a> of Different Micrometers. The first we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">Common</a> shall describe is the common micrometer. Let ABCD microme-be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the telescope at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> focus of the object-glass.\nobject-glass, or where the wires are situated, which are placed in a short tube containing the eye-glass, and may be turned into any position by turning that tube; \\( mn \\) is a fine wire extended over its centre; \\( vw \\), \\( xy \\), are two parallel wires well defined, and perpendicular to \\( mn \\); \\( vw \\) is fixed, and \\( xy \\) moves parallel to it by means of a screw, which carries two indexes over a graduated plate, to show the number of revolutions and parts of a revolution which it makes. Now to measure any angle, we must first ascertain the number of revolutions and parts of a revolution corresponding to some known angle, which may be thus done: 1st, Bring the inner edges of the wires exactly to coincide, and set each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> to \\( o \\); turn the screw, and separate the wires to any distance; and observe the time a star is passing along the wire \\( mn \\) from one vertical wire to the other: for that time, turned into minutes and seconds of a degree, will be the angle answering to the number of revolutions, or the angle corresponding to the distance. Thus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> \\( d = \\cos \\) of the star's declination, we have \\( 15' dm \\), the angle corresponding to this distance; and hence, by proportion, we find the angle answering to any other.\n\n2dly, Set up an object of a known diameter, or two objects at a given distance, and turn the screw till the vertical wires become tangents to the object, or till their opening just takes in the distance of the two objects upon the wire \\( mn \\); then from the diameter, or distance of the two objects from each other, and their distance from the glass, calculate the angle, and observe the number of revolutions and parts corresponding.\n\n3dly, Take the diameter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> on any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, by making the wires tangents to the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, and find, from the nautical almanac, his diameter on that day. Here it will be best to take the upper and lower limbs of the sun when on the meridian, as he has then no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> perpendicular to the horizon. If the edges do not coincide when the indexes stand at \\( o \\), we must allow for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. Instead of making a proportion, it is better to have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> calculated to show the angle corresponding to every revolution and parts of a revolution. But the observer must remember, that when the micrometer is fixed to telescopes of different focal lengths, a new table must be made. The whole system of wires is turned about in its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, by turning the eyetube round with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and by that means the wire \\( mn \\) can be thrown into any position, and consequently angles in any position may be measured. Dr Bradley added a small motion by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a> to set the wires more accurately in any position.\n\n8. But the micrometer, as now contrived, is of use, not only to find the angular distance of bodies in the field of view at the same time, but also of those which, when the telescope is fixed, pass through the field of view successively; by which means we can find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> ascensions and declinations. Let \\( <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">Aa</a> \\), \\( Bb \\), \\( Cc \\), be three parallel and equidistant wires, the middle one bisecting the field of view; \\( HOR \\) a fixed wire perpendicular to them passing through the centre of the field; and \\( Ff \\), \\( Gg \\), two wires parallel to it, each moveable by a micrometer screw, as before, so that they can be brought up to \\( HOR \\), or a little beyond. Then to find the angular distance of two objects, bring them very near to \\( Bb \\), and in a line parallel to it, by turning about the wires, and bring one upon \\( HOR \\), and by the micrometer screw make \\( Ff \\) or \\( Gg \\) pass through the other; then turn the screw till that wire coincides with \\( HOR \\), and the arc which the index has passed over shows their angular distance. If the objects be further remote than you can carry the distance of one of the wires \\( Ff \\), \\( Gg \\) from \\( HOR \\), then bring one object to \\( Ff \\) and the other to \\( Gg \\); and turn each micrometer screw till they meet, and the sum of the arcs passed over by each index gives their angular distance. If the objects be two stars, and one of them be made to run along \\( HOR \\), or either of the moveable wires as occasion may require, the motion of the other will be parallel to these wires, and their difference of declinations may be observed with great exactness; but in taking any other distances, the motion of the stars being oblique to them, it is not quite so easy to get them parallel to \\( Bb \\); because if one star be brought near, and the eye be applied to the other to adjust the wires to it, the former star will have gotten a little away from the wire. Dr Bradley, in his account of the use of this micrometer, published by Dr Maskelyne in the Philosophical Transactions for 1772, thinks the best way is to move the eye backwards and forwards as quick as possible; but it seems to be best to fix the eye at some point between, by which means it takes in both at once sufficiently well defined to compare them with \\( Bb \\). In finding the difference of declination, if both bodies do not come into the field of view at the same time, make one run along the wire \\( HOR \\), as before, and fix the telescope and wait till the other comes in, and then adjust one of the moveable wires to it, and bring it up to \\( HOR \\), and the index gives the difference of their declinations. The difference of time between the passage of the star at either of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> moveable wires, and the transit of the other star over the cross fixed wire (which represents a meridian), turned into degrees and minutes, will give the difference of right ascension. The star has been here supposed to be bisected by the wire; but if the wire be a tangent to it, allowance must be made for the breadth of the wire, provided the adjustment be made for the coincidence of the wires. In observing the diameters of the sun, moon, or planets, it may perhaps be most convenient to make use of the outer edges of the wires, because they appear most distinct when quite within the limb; but if there should be any sensible inflection of the rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> in passing by the wires, it will be best avoided by using the inner edge of one wire and the outward edge of the other; for by that means the inflection at both limbs will be the same way, and therefore there will be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of the relative position of the rays passing by each wire. And it will be convenient in the micrometer to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> at what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> the index stands when the moveable wire coincides with \\( HOR \\); for then you need not bring the wire when a star is upon it up to \\( HOR \\), only reckon from the division at which the index then stands to the above division.\n\n9. With a micrometer thus adapted to a telescope, Mr S. Savery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXETER\">Exeter</a> proposed a new way of measuring the difference between the greatest and least apparent diameters of the sun, although the whole of the sun was not visible in the field of view at once. The method we shall briefly describe. Place two object-glasses instead...\ninstead of one, so as to form two images whose limbs shall be at a small distance from each other; or instead of two perfect lenses, he proposed to cut a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENS\">lens</a> into four parts of equal breadths by parallel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, and to place the two segments with their straight sides against each other, or the two middle frustums with their opposite edges together; in either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the two parts which before had a common centre and axis, have now their centres and axes separated, and consequently two images will be formed as before by two perfect lenses. Another method in reflectors was to cut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> concave reflector through the centre, and by a contrivance to turn up the outer edges whilst the straight ones remained fixed; by which means the axis of the two parts became inclined, and formed two images. Two images being formed in this manner, he proposed to measure the distance between the limbs when the diameters of the sun were the greatest and least, the difference of which would be the difference of the diameters required. Thus far we are indebted to Mr Savery for the idea of forming two images; and the admirable uses to which it was afterwards applied we shall next proceed to describe.\n\n10. The divided object-glass micrometer, as now made, by Mr John Dollond, and by him adapted to the object-end of a reflecting telescope, and has been since by the present Mr P. Dollond his son applied with equal advantage to the end of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACHROMATIC\">achromatic</a> telescope. The principle is this: The object-glass is divided into two segments in a line drawn through the centre: each segment is fixed in a separate frame of brass, which is moveable, so that the centres of the two segments may be brought together by a handle for that purpose, and thereby form one image of an object; but when separated they will form two images, lying in a line passing through the centre of each segment; and consequently the motion of each image will be parallel to that line, which can be thrown into any position by the contrivance of another handle to turn the glass about in its own plane. The brass-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> carries a vernier to measure the distance of the centres of the two segments. Now let E and H be the centres of the two segments, F their principal focus, and PQ two distant objects in FE, FH, produced, or the opposite limbs of the same object PBQD; then the images of P and Q, formed by each segment, or the images of the opposite limbs of the object PBQD, coincide at F; hence two images m \u2248 F, n \u2248 F of that Micrometer object are formed, whose limbs are in contact; therefore the angular distance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> P and Q is the same as the angle which the distance EH subtends at F, which, as the angles supposed to be measured are very small, will vary as EH extremely nearly; and consequently if the angle corresponding to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of the centres of the segments be known, the angle corresponding to any other will be found by proportion. Now to find the interval for some one angle, take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> diameter of the sun on any day, by separating the images till the contrary limbs coincide, and read off by the vernier the interval of their centres, and look into the nautical almanac for the diameter of the sun on that day, and you have the corresponding angle. Or if greater exactness be required than from taking the angle in proportion to the distances of their centres, we may proceed thus:\u2014Draw FG perpendicular to EH, which therefore bisects it; then one half EH, or EG, is the tangent of half the angle EFH; hence, half the distance of their centres is to the tangent of half the angle corresponding to that distance as half any other distance of the centres is to the tangent of half the corresponding angle (A).\n\n11. From this the method of measuring small angles is manifest; for we consider P, Q either as two objects whose images are brought together by separating the two segments, or as the opposite limbs of one object PBQD, whose images formed by the two segments E, H, touch at F; in the former case, EH gives the angular distance of the two objects; and in the latter, it gives the angle under which the diameter of the object appears. In order to find the angular distance of two objects, therefore, separate the segments till the two images which approach each other coincide; and to find the diameter of an object, separate the segments till the contrary limbs of the images touch each other, and read off the distance of the centres of the segment from the vernier (B), and find the angle as directed in the last article. Hence appears one great superiority in this above the wire micrometer; as, with the one any diameter of an object may be measured with the same ease and accuracy; whereas with the other we cannot with accuracy measure any diameter, except that which is at right angles to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of motion.\n\n12. But, besides these two uses to which the instrument\n\n(A) If the object is not distant let f be the principal focus; then $Ff : FG :: FG : FK$ (FG being produced to meet a line joining the apparent places of the two objects P, Q,), $\\therefore$ dividendo, $f'G : FG :: GK : FK$, and alternando, $f'G : GK :: FG : FK ::$ (by similar triangles) $EH : PQ$, hence $\\frac{EH}{f'G} = \\frac{PQ}{GK}$, therefore the angle subtended by EH at $f'$ is the angle subtended by PQ at G; and consequently, as $f'G$ is constant, the angle measured at G is, in this case, also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to EH. The instrument is not adapted to measure the angular distance of bodies, one of which is near and the other at a distance, because their images would not be formed together.\n\n(B) To determine if there be any error in the adjustment of the micrometer scale, measure the diameter of any small well-defined object, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>'s equatorial diameter, or the longest axis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a>, both ways, that is, with o on the vernier to the right and left of o on the scale, and half the difference is the error required. This error must be added to or subtracted from all observations, according as the diameter measured with o on the vernier, when advanced on the scale, is less or greater than the diameter measured the other way. And it is also evident, that half the sum of the diameters thus measured gives the true diameter of the object.\nment seems so well adapted, Dr Maskelyne* has shown how it may be applied to find the difference of right ascensions and declinations. For this purpose, two wires at right angles to each other, bisecting the field of view, must be placed in the principal focus of the eye-glass, and moveable about in their own plane.\n\nLet HCR c be the field of view, HR and C c the two wires; turn the wires till the westernmost star, (which is the best, having further to move) run along ROH; then separate the two segments, and turn about the micrometer till the two images of the same star <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in the wire C c; and then, partly by separating the segments, and partly by raising or depressing the telescope, bring the two innermost images of the two stars to appear and run along ROH, as a, b, and the vernier will give the difference of their declinations; because, as the two images of one of the stars coincided with C c, the image of each star was brought perpendicularly upon HR, or to HR in their proper meridian. And, for the same reason, the difference of their times of passing the wire CO c will give their difference of right ascensions. These operations will be facilitated, if the telescope be mounted on a polar axis. If two other wires KL, MN, parallel to C c, be placed near H and R, the observation may be made on two stars whose difference of meridians is nearly equal to HR the diameter of the field of view, by bringing the two images of one of the stars to coincide with one of these wires. If two stars be observed whose difference of declinations is well settled, the scale of the micrometer will be known.\n\n13. It has hitherto been supposed, that the images of the two stars can be both brought into the field of view at once upon the wire HOR: but if they cannot, set the micrometer to the difference of their declinations as nearly as you can, and make the image which comes first run along the wire HOR, by elevating or depressing the telescope; and when the other star comes in, if it do not also run along HOR, alter the micrometer till it does, and half the sum of the numbers shown by the micrometer at the two separate observations of the two stars on the wire HOR will be the difference of their declinations. That this should be true, it is manifestly necessary that the two segments should recede equally in opposite directions; and this is effected by Mr Dollond in his new improvement of the object-glass micrometer.\n\n14. The difference of right ascensions and declinations of Venus or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a> in the sun's disk and the sun's limb may be thus found. Turn the wires so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> limb n of the sun's image <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a>, or the north limb of the image V of the planet, may run along the wire RH, which therefore will then be parallel to the equator, and consequently C c a secondary to it; then separate the segments, and turn about the micrometer till the two images V v of the planet pass C c at the same time, and then by separating the segments, bring the north limb of the northernmost image V of the planet to touch HR, at the time the northernmost limb n of the southernmost image AB of the sun touches it, and the micrometer shows the difference of declinations of the northernmost limbs of the planet and sun, for the reason formerly given (Art. 11.) we having brought the northernmost limbs of the two innermost images V and AB to HR, these two being Micrometer manifestly interior to v and the northernmost limb N of the image PQ. In the same manner we take the difference of declinations of their southernmost limbs; and half the difference of the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> (taking immediately one after another) is equal to the difference of the declinations of their centres, without any regard to the sun's or planet's diameters, or error of adjustment of the micrometer; for as it affects both equally, the difference is the same as if there were no error; and the difference of the times of the transits of the eastern or western limbs of the sun and planet over C c gives the difference of their right ascensions.\n\n15. Instead of the difference of right ascensions, the distance of the planet from the sun's limb, in lines parallel to the equator, may be more accurately observed thus: Separate the segments, and turn about the wires and micrometer, so as to make both images V, v, run along HR, or so that the two intersections Fig. 6. I, T of the sun's image may pass C c at the same time. Then bring the planet's and sun's limbs into contact, as at V, and do the same for the other limb of the sun, and half the difference gives the distance of the centre of the planet from the middle of the chord on the sun's disk parallel to the equator, or the difference of the right ascensions of their centres, allowing for the motion of the planet in the interval of the observations, without any regard to the error of adjustment, for the same reason as before. For if you take any point in the chord of a circle, half the difference of the two segments is manifestly the distance of the point from the middle of the chord; and as the planet runs along HR, the chord is parallel to the equator.\n\nIn like manner, the distances of their limbs may be measured in lines perpendicular to the equator, by bringing the micrometer into the position already described, (Art. 13.), and instead of bringing V to HR, separate the segments till the northernmost limbs coincide as at V; and in the same manner make their southernmost images to coincide, and half the difference of the two measures, allowing for the planet's motion, gives the difference of the declinations of their centres.\n\nHence the true place of a planet in the sun's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DISC\">disc</a> may at any time of its transit be found; and consequently the nearest approach to the centre and the time of ecliptic conjunction may be deduced, although the middle should not be observed.\n\n16. But however valuable the object-glass micrometer undoubtedly is, difficulties sometimes have been found in its use, owing to the alteration of the focus of the object-glass eye, which will cause it to give different measures of the same angle at different times. For instance, in measuring the sun's diameter, the axis of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> coming through the two segments from the contrary limbs of the sun, as PF, QF, fig. 3, crossing one another in the focus F under an angle equal to the sun's semidiameter, the union of the limbs cannot appear perfect, unless the eye be disposed to see objects distinctly at the place where the images were formed; for if the eye be disposed to see objects nearer to or further off than that place, in the latter case the limbs will\nwill appear separated, and in the former they will appear to lap over (c). This imperfection led Dr Maskelyne to inquire, whether some method might not be found of producing two distinct images of the sun, or any other object, by bringing the axis of each pencil to coincide, or very nearly so, before the formation of the images, by which means the limbs when brought together would not be liable to appear separated from any alteration of the eye; and this he found would be effected by the refraction of two prisms, placed either without or within the telescope; and on this principle, placing the prisms within, he constructed a new micrometer, and had one executed by Mr Dollond, which upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> answered as he expected. The construction is as follows.\n\n17. Let \\( A B \\) be the object-glass; \\( a b \\) the image, suppose of the sun, which would have been formed in the principal focus \\( Q \\); but let the prisms \\( P R, S R \\) be placed to intercept the rays, and let \\( E F, W G \\), be two rays proceeding from the eastern and western limbs of the sun, converging, after refraction at the lens, to \\( a \\) and \\( b \\); and suppose the refraction of the prisms to be such, that in fig. 8, the ray \\( E F R \\), after refraction at \\( R \\) by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a> \\( P R \\), may proceed in the direction \\( R Q \\); and as all the rays which were proceeding to \\( a \\) suffer the same refraction at the prism, they will all be refracted to \\( Q \\); and therefore, instead of an image \\( a b \\), which would have been formed by the lens alone, an image \\( Q c \\) is formed by those rays which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on the prism \\( P R \\); and for the same reason, the rays falling on the prism \\( S R \\) will form an image \\( Q d \\); and in fig. 9, the image of the point \\( b \\) is brought to \\( Q \\), by the prism \\( P R \\), and consequently an image \\( Q d \\) is formed by those rays which fall on \\( P R \\); and for the same reason, an image \\( Q c \\) is formed by the rays falling on \\( S R \\).\n\nNow in both cases, as the rays \\( E F R, W G R \\), coming from the two opposite limbs of the sun, and forming the point of contact of the two limbs, proceed in the same direction \\( R Q \\), they must thus accompany each other through the eye-glass and also through the eye, whatever refractive power it has, and therefore to every eye the images must appear to touch. Now the angle \\( a R b \\) is twice the refraction of the prism, and the angle \\( a C b \\) is the diameter of the sun; and as these angles are very small, and have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUBTENSE\">subtense</a> \\( a b \\), we have the angle \\( a R b : a C b :: C Q : R Q \\).\u2014Now as \\( C Q \\) is constant, and also the angle \\( a R b \\) being twice the refraction of the prism, the angle \\( a C b \\) varies as \\( R Q \\). Hence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the scale for measuring angles becomes the focal length of the object-glass, and the angle measured is in proportion to the distance of the prisms from the principal focus of the object-glass; and the micrometer can measure all angles (very small ones excepted, for the reason given in Art. 19.) which do not exceed the sum of the refractions of the prisms; for the angle \\( a C b \\), the diameter of the object to be measured, is always less than the angle \\( a R b \\), the micrometer sum of the refractions of the prisms, except when the prisms touch the object-glass, and then they become equal. The scale can never be out of adjustment, as the point \\( o \\), where the measurement begins, answers to the focus of the object-glass, which is a fixed point for all distant objects, and we have only to find the value of the scale answering to some known angle; for instance, bring the two limbs of the sun's images into contact, and measure the distance of the prisms from the focus, and look in the nautical almanac for the sun's diameter, and you get the value of the scale.\n\n18. In fig. 8, the limb \\( Q \\) of the image \\( Q c \\), is illuminated by the rays falling on the object-glass between \\( A \\) and \\( F \\), and of the image \\( Q d \\) by those falling between \\( B \\) and \\( G \\); but in fig. 9, the same limbs are illuminated by the rays falling between \\( B \\) and \\( F \\), \\( A \\) and \\( G \\) respectively, and therefore will be more illuminated than in the other case; but the difference is not considerable in achromatic telescopes, on account of the great aperture of the object-glass compared with the distance \\( F G \\).\n\nIt might be convenient to have two sets of prisms, one for measuring angles not exceeding \\( 36' \\), and therefore fit for measuring the diameters of the sun and moon, and the lucid parts and distances of the cusps in their eclipses; and another for measuring angles not much greater than \\( 1' \\), for the convenience of measuring the diameters of the planets. For as \\( Q : QR :: \\) sum of the refractions of the prisms : angle \\( a C b \\), the apparent diameter of the object, it is evident that if you diminish the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, you must increase the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> in the same ratio, in order to measure the same angle; and thus by diminishing the refractive angle of the prisms, you throw them further from \\( Q \\), and consequently avoid the inconvenience of bringing them near to \\( Q \\), for the reason in the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a>; and at the same time you will increase the illumination in a small degree. The prisms must be achromatic, each composed of two prisms of flint and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> glass, placed with their refracting angles in contrary directions, otherwise the images will be coloured.\n\n19. In the construction here described, the angle measured becomes evanescent when the prisms come to the principal focus of the object-glass, and therefore \\( o \\) on the scale then begins: but if the prisms be placed in the principal focus they can have no effect, because the pencil of rays at the junction of the prisms would then vanish, and therefore it is not practicable to bring the two images together to get \\( o \\) on the scale. Dr Maskelyne, therefore, thought of placing another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of prisms within, to refract the rays before they came to the other prisms, by which means the two images would be formed into one before they came to the principal focus, and therefore \\( o \\) on the scale could be determined. But to avoid the error arising from the\n\n(c) For if the eye can see distinctly an image at \\( F \\), the pencils of rays, of which \\( P F, Q F \\) are the two axes, diverging from \\( F \\), are each brought to a focus on the retina at the same point; and therefore the two limbs appear to coincide: but if we increase the refractive power of the eye, then each pencil is brought to a focus, and they cross each other before the rays come to the retina, consequently the two limbs on the retina will lap over; and if we diminish the refractive power of the eye, then each pencil being brought to a focus beyond the retina, and not crossing till after they have passed it, the two limbs on the retina must be separated.\nthe multiplication of mediums, he, instead of adding another pair of prisms, divided the object-glass through its centre, and sliding the segments a little it separated the images, and then by the prisms he could form one image very distinctly, and consequently could determine o on the scale; for by separating the two segments you form two images, and you will separate the two pencils so that you may move up the two prisms, and the two pencils will fall on each respectively, and the two images may be formed into one. In the instrument which Dr. Maskelyne had made, o on the scale was chosen to be about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the focal length of the object-glass, and each prism refracted 27'. By this means all angles are measured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to o.\n\n20. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1779, Mr. Ramsden has described two new micrometers, which he contrived with a view of remedying the defects of the object-glass micrometer.\n\n21. One of these is a catoptric micrometer, which, beside the advantage it derives from the principle of reflection, of not being disturbed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HETEROGENEITY\">heterogeneity</a> of light, avoids every defect of other micrometers, and can have no aberration, nor any defect arising from the imperfection of materials or of execution; as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> simplicity of its construction requires no additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRRORS\">mirrors</a> or glasses to those required for the telescope; and the separation of the images being effected by the inclination of the two specula, and not depending on the focus of any lens or mirror, any alteration in the eye of an observer cannot affect the angle measured. It has peculiar to itself the advantages of an adjustment, to make the images coincide in a direction perpendicular to that of their motion; and also of measuring the diameter of a planet on both sides of the zero, which will appear no inconsiderable advantage to observers who know how much easier it is to ascertain the contact of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> edges of two images than their perfect coincidence.\n\n22. A represents the small speculum divided into two equal parts; one of which is fixed on the end of the arm B; the other end of the arm is fixed on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> axis X, which crosses the end of the telescope C. The other half of the mirror A is fixed on the arm D, which arm at the other end terminates in a socket y, that turns on the axis X; both arms are prevented from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> by the braces a a. G represents a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> screw, having one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> e cut into double the number of threads in an inch to that of the part g: the part e having 100 threads in one inch, and the part g 50 only. The screw e works in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> F in the side of the telescope, while the part g turns in a nut H, which is attached to the arm B; the ends of the arms B and D, to which the mirrors are fixed, are separated from each other by the point of the double screw pressing against the stud h fixed to the arm D, and turning in the nut H on the arm B. The two arms B and D are pressed against the direction of the double screw e g by a spiral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> within the part n, by which means all shake or play in the nut H, on which the measure depends, is entirely prevented.\n\nFrom the difference of the threads on the screw at e and g, it is evident, that the progressive motion of the screw through the nut will be half the distance of the separation of the two halves of the mirror; and consequently the half mirrors will be moved equal ly in contrary directions from the axis of the telescope C.\n\n23. The wheel V fixed on the end of the double screw had its circumference divided into 100 equal parts, and numbered at every fifth division with 5, 10, &c., to 100, and the index I shows the motion of the screw with the wheel round its axis, while the number of revolutions of the screw is shown by the divisions on the same index. The steel screw at R may be turned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">key</a> S, and serves to incline the small mirror at right angles to the direction of its motion. By turning the finger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> T, the eye-tube P is brought nearer or farther from the small mirror, to adjust the telescope to distinct vision; and the telescope itself hath a motion round its axis for the convenience of measuring the diameter of a planet in any direction. The inclination of the diameter measured with the horizon is shown in degrees and minutes by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> and vernier on a graduated circle, at the breech of the telescope.\n\n24. Besides the table for reducing the revolutions and parts of the screw to minutes, seconds, &c., it will require a table for correcting a small error which arises from the eccentric motion of the half mirrors. By this motion their centre of curvature will approach a little towards the large mirror: the equation for this purpose in small angles is insensible; but when angles to be measured exceed ten minutes, it should not be neglected. Or, the angle measured may be corrected by diminishing it in the proportion the versed sine of the angle measured, supposing the eccentricity radius, bears to the focal length of the small mirror.\n\n25. Mr. Ramsden preferred Cassgrain's construction of the reflecting telescope to either the Gregorian or Newtonian; because in the former, the errors of one speculum are corrected by those of the other. From a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the reflecting telescope, not generally known, that the apertures of the two specula are to each other very nearly in the proportion of their focal lengths, it follows, that their aberrations will be in the same proportion; and these aberrations will be in the same direction, if the two specula are concave; or in contrary directions if one speculum is concave and the other convex. In the Gregorian telescope, both specula being concave, the aberration at the second image will be the sum of the aberrations of the two mirrors; but in the Cassgrainian telescope, one mirror being concave and the other convex, the aberration at the second image will be the difference between the two aberrations. By assuming such proportions for the focii of the specula as are generally used in the reflecting telescope, which is about as 1 to 4, the aberration in the Cassgrainian construction will be to that in the Gregorian as 3 to 5.\n\n26. The other is a dioptric micrometer, or one suited to the principle of refraction. This micrometer is applied to the erect eye-tube of a refracting telescope, glass micrometer, and is placed in the conjugate focus of the first eyeglass: in which position, the image being considerably magnified before it comes to the micrometer, any imperfection in its glass will be magnified only by the remaining eyeglasses, which in any telescope seldom exceeds five or six times. By this position also the size of the micrometer glass will not be the \\( \\frac{1}{100} \\) part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> which would be required if it was placed in the object-glass; and, notwithstanding this great proportion...\nproportion of size, which is of great moment to the practical optician, the same extent of scale is preserved, and the images are uniformly bright in every part of the field of the telescope.\n\n27. Fig. 12 represents the glasses of a refracting telescope; \\(xy\\), the principal pencil of rays from the object-glass \\(O\\); \\(tt\\) and \\(uu\\), the axis of two oblique pencils; \\(a\\), the first eye-glass; \\(m\\), its conjugate focus, or the place of the micrometer; \\(b\\) the second eye-glass; \\(c\\) the third; and \\(d\\) the fourth, or that which is nearest the eye. Let \\(p\\) be the diameter of the object-glass, \\(e\\) the diameter of a pencil at \\(m\\), and \\(f\\) the diameter of the pencil at the eye; it is evident, that the axis of the pencils from every part of the image will cross each other at the point \\(m\\); and \\(e\\), the width of the micrometer-glass, is to \\(p\\) the diameter of the object-glass, as \\(ma\\) is to \\(go\\), which is the proportion of the magnifying power at the point \\(m\\); and the error caused by an imperfection in the micrometer-glass placed at \\(m\\) will be to the error, had the micrometer been at \\(O\\), as \\(m\\) is to \\(p\\).\n\n28. Fig. 13 represents the micrometer; \\(A\\), a convex or concave lens bisected by a plane across its centre; one of these semi-lenses is fixed in a frame \\(B\\), and the other in the frame \\(E\\); which two frames slide on a plate \\(H\\), and are pressed against it by thin plates \\(a\\): the frames \\(B\\) and \\(E\\) are moved in contrary directions by turning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTON\">button</a> \\(D\\): \\(L\\) is a scale of equal parts on the frame \\(B\\); it is numbered from each end towards the middle with 10, 20, &c. There are two verniers on the frame \\(E\\), one at \\(M\\) and the other at \\(N\\), for the convenience of measuring the diameter of a planet, &c., on both sides the zero. The first division on both these verniers coincides at the same time with the two zeros on the scale, \\(L\\); and, if the frame is moved towards the right, the relative motion of the two frames is shown on the scale \\(L\\) by the vernier \\(M\\); but if the frame \\(B\\) be moved towards the left, the relative motion is shown by the vernier \\(N\\).\u2014This micrometer has a motion round the axis of vision, for the convenience of measuring the diameter of a planet, &c., in any direction, by turning an endless screw \\(F\\); and the inclination of the diameter measured with the horizon is shown on the circle \\(g\\) by a vernier on the plate \\(V\\). The telescope may be adjusted to distinct vision by a screw, which moves the whole eye-tube with the micrometer nearer or farther from the object-glass, as telescopes are generally made; or the same effect may be produced without moving the micrometer, by sliding the part of the eye tube \\(m\\) on the part \\(n\\), by help of a screw or pinion.\n\n29. Notwithstanding these improvements on micrometers, they are still liable to many sources of error. The imperfections of the wire micrometer, (which was still the most correct instrument for measuring small angles) when employed to determine the distance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> double stars, have been ably pointed out by Dr Herschel.\n\n30. When two stars are taken between the parallel wires the diameters must be included. Dr Herschel* has in vain attempted to find lines sufficiently thin to extend them across the centres of the stars so that their thickness might be neglected. The threads of the silk-worm, with such lenses as he uses, are so much magnified that their diameter is more than that of many of the stars. Besides, if they were much smaller, the deflection of light would make the attempt to measure the distance of the centres this way fruitless; for he has always found the light of the stars to play upon those lines and separate their apparent diameters into two parts. Now since the spurious diameters of the stars thus included, are continually changing with the state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and the length of time we look at them, we are, in some respect, left at an uncertainty; and our measures taken at different times, and with different degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, will vary on that account. Nor can we come at the true distance of the centres of any two stars, unless we know the semidiameters of the stars themselves; for different stars have different apparent diameters, which, with a power of 227, may differ from each other as far as two seconds (D).\n\n31. The next imperfection arises from a deflection of light upon the wires when they approach very near to each other; for if this be owing to a power of repulsion lodged at the surface, it is easy to see that such powers must interfere with each other, and give the measures larger in proportion than they would have been if the repulsive power of one wire had not been opposed by a contrary power of the other wire.\n\n32. Another disadvantage of these micrometers is an uncertainty of the real zero. The least alteration in the situation and quantity of light will affect the zero; and a change in the position of the wires will sometimes produce a difference. To remove this difficulty Dr Herschel always found his zero while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> preserved the situation which it had when his observations were made; but this introduces an additional observation.\n\n33. The next imperfection, is that every micrometer hitherto used requires either a screw, or a divided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> and pinion, to measure the distance of the wires or the two images. Those acquainted with works of this kind are sensible how difficult it is to have screws perfectly equal in every thread or revolution of each thread; or pinions and bars that shall be so evenly divided as to be depended upon in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> and tooth to the two or three thousandth part of an inch: and yet, on account of the small scale of those micrometers, these quantities are of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>; an error of a single thousandth part inducing in most instruments a mistake of several seconds.\n\n34. The greatest imperfection of all is, that the wires require to be illuminated; and when Dr Herschel had double stars to measure, one of which was very obscure, he was obliged to be content with less light than is necessary to make the wires distinct; and several stars on this account could not be measured at all, though not too close for the micrometer.\n\nDr Herschel, therefore, was led to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> his attention to the improvement of these instruments; and the result of his endeavours has been a very ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>-micrometer, which is not only free from the imperfections above specified, but also possesses the advantages of a large scale.\n\n35. It is represented in fig. 14, where \\(ABGCFE\\) is a Dr Herschel's lamp micrometer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, upon which a semicircular board is movable upwards or downwards, and is held in its situation by a peg \\(p\\) put into any one of the holes of\n\n(d) These imperfections are remedied in the instrument described in p. 801.\nof the upright piece AB. This board is a segment of a circle of fourteen inches radius, and is about three inches broader than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a>, to give room for the handles r D, e P, to work. The use of this board is to carry an arm L, thirty inches long, which is made to move upon a pivot at the centre of the circle, by means of a string, which passes in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> upon the edge of the semicircle p g o h q; the string is fastened to a hook at o (not expressed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, being at the back of the arm L), and passing along the groove from o h q is turned over a pulley at q, and goes down to a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> c, within the plane of the circular board, where a double-jointed handle e P commands its motion. By this contrivance, we see, the arm L may be lifted up to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> from the horizontal position to the perpendicular, or be suffered to descend by its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> below the horizontal to the reverse perpendicular situation. The weight of the handle P is sufficient to keep the arm in any given position; but if the motion should be too easy, a friction spring applied to the barrel will moderate it at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>.\n\n36. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the arm L a small slider, about three inches long, is moveable in a rabbet from the end L towards the centre backwards and forwards. A string is fastened to the left side of the little slider, and goes towards L, where it passes round a pulley at m, and returns under the arm from m, n, towards the centre, where it is led in a groove on the edge of the arm, which is of a circular form, upwards to a barrel (raised above the plane of the circular board) at r, to which the handle r D is fastened. A second string is fastened to the slider, at the right side, and goes towards the centre, where it passes over a pulley n; and the weight w, which is suspended by the end of this string, returns the slider towards the centre, when a contrary turn of the handle permits it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a>.\n\n37. By a and b are represented two small lamps, two inches high, 1\u00bd in breadth by 1\u00bd in depth. The sides, back, and top, are made so as to permit no light to be seen, and the front consists of a thin brass sliding door. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> in the lamp a is placed three-tenths of an inch from the left side, three-tenths from the front, and half an inch from the bottom. In the lamp b it is placed at the same height and distance, measuring from the right side. The wick of the flame consists only of a single very thin lamp cotton-thread; for the smallest flame being sufficient, it is easier to keep it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> in so confined a place. In the top of each lamp must be a little slit lengthways, and a small opening in one side near the upper part, to permit the air to circulate to feed the flame. To prevent every reflection of light, the side opening of the lamp a should be to the right, and that of the lamp b to the left. In the sliding door of each lamp is made a small hole with the point of a very fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> just opposite the place where the wicks are burning, so that when the sliders are shut down, and everything dark, nothing shall be seen but two fine lucid points of the size of two stars of the third or fourth magnitude. The lamp a is placed so that its lucid point may be in the centre of the circular board where it is fixed. The lamp b is hung to the little slider which moves in the rabbet of the arm, so that its lucid point, in an horizontal position of the arm, may be on a level with the lucid point in the centre. The moveable lamp is suspended upon a piece of brass fastened to the slider by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> exactly behind the flame, upon which it moves as a pivot. The lamp is balanced at the bottom by a leaden weight, so as to remain upright, when the arm is either lifted above or depressed below the horizontal position. The double-jointed handles r D, e P, consist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> rods, 10 feet long, and the lowest of them may have divisions, marked upon it near the end P, expressing exactly the distance from the central lucid point in feet, inches, and tenths.\n\n38. Hence we see, that a person at a distance of 10 feet may govern the two lucid points, so as to bring them into any required position south or north preceding or following from o to 90\u00b0 by using the handle P, and also to any distance from six-tenths of an inch to five or six and twenty inches by means of the handle D. If any reflection or appearance of light should be left from the top or sides of the lamps, a temporary screen, consisting of a long piece of pasteboard, or a wire frame covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> cloth, of the length of the whole arm, and of any required breadth, with a slit of half an inch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> in the middle, may be affixed to the arm by four bent wires projecting an inch or two before the lamps, situated so that the moveable lucid point may pass along the opening left for that purpose.\n\nFig. 15. represents part of the arm L, half the real size; S the slider; m the pulley, over which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> x t y z is returned towards the centre; v the other cord going to the pulley n of fig. 14.; R the brass piece moveable upon the pin c, to keep the lamp upright. At R is a wire rivetted to the brass piece, upon which is held the lamp by a nut and screw. Fig. 16. 17. re-Fig. 16. 17. present the lamps a, b, with the sliding doors open, to show the situation of the wick. W is the leaden weight with a hole d in it, through which the wire R of fig. 15. is to be passed when the lamp is to be fastened to the slider S. Fig. 18. represents the lamp a Fig. 18. with the sliding door shut; l the lucid point; and i k the openings at the top, and s at the sides, for the admission of air.\n\n39. The motions of this micrometer are capable of great improvement by the application of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> and pinions, and other mechanical resources; but as the principal object is only to be able to adjust the two lucid points to the required position and distance, and to keep them there for a few minutes, while the observer measures their distance, it will be unnecessary to say more upon the subject.\n\n40. It is well known that we can with one eye look into a telescope, and see an object much magnified, while the other eye may see a scale upon which the magnified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> is thrown. In this manner Dr Herschel generally determined the power of his telescopes; and any one who has been accustomed to make such observations will seldom mistake so much as one in fifty in determining the power of an instrument, and that degree of exactness is fully sufficient for the purpose.\n\n41. When Dr Herschel uses this instrument he puts it Method of applying at ten feet distance from the left eye, in a line perpendicular to the tube of his Newtonian telescope, and raises microme- the moveable board to such a height that the lucidter point of the central lamp may be upon a level with the eye. The handles, lifted up, are passed through two loops fastened to the tube, just by the observer, so as to be ready for his use. The end of tube is cut away,\nso as to leave the left eye entirely free to see the whole micrometer.\n\n42. The telescope being directed to a double star, it is viewed with the right eye, and at the same time with the left it is seen projected upon the micrometer; then, by the handle P, the arm is raised or depressed so as to bring the two lucid points to a similar situation with the two stars; and, by the handle D, the moveable lucid point is brought to the same distance of the two stars, so that the two lucid points may be exactly covered by the stars.\n\n43. With a rule, divided into inches and fourtieth parts, the distance of the lucid points is thus determined with the greatest accuracy; and the measure thus obtained is the tangent of the magnified angle under which the stars are seen to a radius of ten feet; therefore, the angle being found and divided by the power of the telescope, the real angular distance of the centres of a double star is ascertained. On September 25, 1781, Dr Herschel measured \u03b7 Herculis with this instrument. Having caused the two lucid points to coincide with the stars, he found the radius or distance of the central lamp from the eye 10 feet 4.15 inches; the tangent or distance of the two lucid points 50.6 fourtieth parts of an inch; this gives the magnified angle 35', and dividing by the power 465, we obtain 4\" 34\"' for the distance of the centres of the two stars. The scale of the micrometer at this convenient distance, with the power of 465, is above a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an inch to a second; and by putting on a power of 932, we obtain a scale of more than half an inch to a second, without increasing the distance of the micrometer; whereas the most perfect micrometers, with the same instrument, had a scale of less than the two thousandth part of an inch to a second.\n\n44. Mr Brewster has lately directed his attention to the improvement of micrometers, and has invented one in particular which appears to be highly deserving of notice in this place. In this instrument a pair of fixed wires is made to subtend different angles by varying the magnifying power of the telescope, by sliding one tube within another; whereas in all other micrometers with wires this effect is produced by mechanical contrivances. Mr Brewster's method of shutting and opening the wires optically is therefore free from all those sources of error to which other micrometers are subject, and renders it particularly useful to the practical astronomer; while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of changing the magnifying power by the motion of a second object-glass affords a length of scale equal to the local distance of the principal object-glass. The same principle is peculiarly applicable to the Gregorian telescope; for the magnifying power of this instrument can be changed by merely increasing or diminishing the distance of the eye-piece from the large speculum.\n\n45. In the common micrometer, which can manifestly, as well as Mr Cavallo's and Mr Brewster's, be used in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENSURATION\">mensuration</a> of distances, the focal length of the telescope to which it is attached remains always the same; so that a correction computed from an optical theorem must be applied to every angle that is measured: but in Mr Brewster's telescope and micrometer, the focal length varies in the same proportion as the distance of the object; and consequently no correction of the angles can be necessary. To obviate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of having a stand for the instrument, which would prevent its usefulness at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, Mr Brewster divides the second or moveable object-glass into two, as in the divided object-glass micrometer. By this contrivance two images are formed, and these images are separated or made to form different angles at the eye, by bringing the moveable object-glass nearer to the fixed one. In determining the angle, therefore, we have only to bring the two images of the object into contact; and such contact the eye is capable of ascertaining even during the agitation of a carriage, as the two images retain the same relative position whatever be their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> motion.\n\nThis ingenious instrument, being formed with sliding tubes, is very portable and convenient; and will be found extremely useful to medical gentlemen, and others who may wish to ascertain distances without a more cumbersome apparatus. *Haidy's Nat. Phil. by Gregory*, vol. ii. p. 427.\n\n46. Mr Brewster, we understand, still continues to direct his attention to the subject of micrometers, keeping in view the improvement of these instruments, not only in greater accuracy of construction, but also in their more extensive application to various practical purposes. An account of those uses and improvements is to form the subject of an appropriate publication; and, if we are rightly informed, the author deems them of sufficient importance to secure to himself, by patent, the exclusive right to the advantages which he thinks will arise from using them.\n\n47. A very simple micrometer for measuring small an-Cavallo's glies with the telescope has been invented by Mr Cavallo*. It consists of a thin and narrow slip of mother-of-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a> micrometer, finely divided, and situated in the focus of the eye-glass of a telescope, just where the image of the object is formed. It is immaterial whether the telescope be a refractor or a reflector, provided the eye-glass be a convex lens.\n\nThe simplest way of fixing it is to stick it upon the diaphragm, which generally stands within the tube, in the focus of the eye-glass. When thus fixed, the divisions of the micrometrical scale will appear very distinct, unless the diaphragm is not exactly in the focus; in which case, the scale must be placed accurately in the focus of the eye-glass, either by moving the diaphragm, or by interposing any thin substance, such as paper or card between it and the scale. This construction is fully sufficient, when the telescope is always to be used by the same person; but when different persons are to use it, then the diaphragm which supports the micrometer must be constructed so as to be easily moved backwards or forwards, though that motion need not be greater than about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch.\n\nThe scale of the micrometer is represented in fig. 19. Fig. 19, which is about four times greater than one which Mr Cavallo has adapted to a three-feet achromatic telescope that magnifies about 84 times. It is something less than the 24th part of an inch broad; its thickness is equal to that of common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> paper; and the length of it is determined by the breadth of the field of view. The divisions are 200ths of an inch, and the lines which form them reach from one edge of the scale to about the middle of it, excepting every fifth and tenth division, which are longer. Two divisions of the scale in the telescope already mentioned are very nearly equal to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>; and as a quarter of one of those divisions may be easily distinguished by the eye, an angle of one-eighth part of a minute, or of \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), may be measured with it.\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> through a telescope furnished with such a micrometer, the field of view appears divided by the micrometer scale, the breadth of which occupies about 1/4th of the aperture; and as the scale is semitransparent, that part of the object which is behind it may be discerned sufficiently well to ascertain the division, with which its borders coincide. Fig. 20 shows the appearance of the field of the telescope with the micrometer, when directed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> page of the Philosophical Transactions, in which it appears that the thickness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> C is equal to three-fourths of a division, the diameter of the O is equal to three divisions, and so on.\n\n48. After having adapted this micrometer to the telescope, we must then ascertain the value of the divisions. It is hardly necessary to mention in this place, that though those divisions measure the chords of the angles, and not the angles or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> themselves, and the chords are not as the arches, yet in small angles the chords, arches, sines, and tangents, follow the same proportion so very nearly, that the difference may be safely neglected: so that if one division of this micrometer is equal to one minute, we may conclude that two divisions are equal to two minutes, three divisions to three minutes, and so on. In order to ascertain the value of the divisions of this micrometer, the following simple and accurate method may be adopted,\n\nMark upon a wall the length of six inches, by making two dots or lines six inches asunder, or by fixing a six-inch ruler upon a stand; then place the telescope before it so that the ruler or six-inch length may be at right angles with the direction of the telescope, and just 57 feet 3\u00bd inches distant from the object-glass of the telescope: done, look through the telescope at the ruler or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of six inches, and observe how many divisions of the micrometer are equal to it, and that same number of divisions is equal to half a degree, or 30', as it may be shewn by plane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a>.\n\n49. When this value has been once ascertained, any other angle measured by any other number of divisions is determined by simple proportion. Thus, if the diameter of the sun seen through the same telescope, be equal to 12 divisions, say as 11\u00bd divisions are to 30 minutes, so are 12 divisions to \\(\\frac{12' \\times 30'}{11.5}\\) = 34'.3, which is the required diameter of the sun.\n\nNotwithstanding the facility of this calculation, a scale may be made answering to the divisions of a micrometer, which will show the angle corresponding to any number of divisions by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> inspection. Thus, for the above-mentioned small telescope, the scale is represented in fig. 21. AB is a line drawn at pleasure; it is then divided into 23 equal parts, and those divisions which represent the divisions of the micrometer that are equal to one degree, are marked on one side of it. The line is then divided again into 60 equal parts, which are marked on the other side of it; and these divisions represent the minutes which correspond to the divisions of the micrometer: thus the figure shows, that six divisions of the micrometer are equal to 15\u00bd minutes, 11\u00bd divisions are nearly equal to 29 minutes, &c. What has been said of minutes may be said of seconds also, when the scale is to be applied to a large telescope.\n\n50. We shall therefore add some practical rules to render this micrometer useful to persons unacquainted with trigonometry and the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a>.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">Problem</a> I.** The angle, not exceeding one degree, which is subtended by an extension of one foot perpendicular to the axis of the telescope being given, to find its distance from the object-glass of the telescope.\n\nRule 1. If the angle be expressed in minutes, say, as the given angle is to 60, so is 687.55 to a fourth proportional, which gives the answer in inches.\u20142. If the angle be expressed in seconds, say, as the given angle is to 3600, so is 687.55 to a fourth proportional, which expresses the answer in inches.\n\nExample. At what distance is a globe of one foot diameter when it subtends an angle of two seconds?\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2''}{3600''} :: \\frac{687.55}{x}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2''}{3600''} \\times \\frac{3600''}{687.55} = 1237590\n\\]\n\ninches, or 1031.325 feet, which is the answer required.\n\n**Problem II.** The angle, not exceeding one degree, which is subtended by any known extension, being given, to find its distance from the object-glass of the telescope.\n\nRule. Proceed as if the extension were of one foot by Problem I. and call the answer B; then, if the extension in question be expressed in inches, say, as 12 inches are to that extension, so is B to a fourth proportional, which is the answer in inches; but if the extension in question be expressed in feet, then you need only multiply it by B, and the product is the answer in inches.\n\nExample. At what distance is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> six feet high, when he appears to subtend an angle of 30\"\u2014\n\nBy Problem I. if the man were one foot high, the distance would be 82506 inches; but as he is six feet high, therefore multiply 82506 by 6, and the product gives the required distance, which is 495036 inches, or 41253 feet.\n\nFor greater conveniency, especially in travelling, or in such circumstances in which one has not the opportunity of making even the easy calculations required in those problems, the following two tables have been computed; the first of which shows the distance answering to any angle from one minute to one degree, which is subtended by a man, the height of which has been called an extension of six feet; because, at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>, such is the height of a man when dressed with a hat and shoes on.\n\nThus, if it is required to measure the extension of a street, let a foot ruler be placed at the end of the street; measure the angle it subtends, which suppose to be 36', and in the table you will have the required distance opposite 36', which is 95.5 feet. Thus also a man who appears to be 49' high, is at the distance of 421 feet.\n\n### Angles subtended by an extension of one Foot at different Distances\n\n| Angles | Distances in Feet | Angles | Distances in Feet |\n|--------|-------------------|--------|------------------|\n| Min. 1 | 3437.7            | Min. 11| 312.5            |\n| 2      | 1718.9            | 12     | 286.5            |\n| 3      | 1145.9            | 13     | 204.4            |\n| 4      | 859.4             | 14     | 245.5            |\n| 5      | 687.5             | 15     | 229.2            |\n| 6      | 572.9             | 16     | 214.8            |\n| 7      | 491.1             | 17     | 202.2            |\n| 8      | 429.7             | 18     | 191.0            |\n| 9      | 382.0             | 19     | 180.9            |\n| 10     | 343.7             | 20     | 171.8            |\n\nVol. XIII.

We shall give Micrometer in his own words *.\n\n\"In the winter of 1805 (he observes), when I was employed in delineating the surface of the moon, I wished to measure the diameter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> spots by jar mother-applying Mr Cavallo's micrometer to a thirty-inch-of-pearl micrometric telescope made by Berge. But as the eye-piece was moved by a rack and pinion, and consequently could not turn round its axis, the micrometer must have remained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, and could only measure angles in one direction. This difficulty, indeed, might have been surmounted by a mechanical contrivance for turning the diaphragm about its centre, or more simply by giving a motion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> to the tube which contains the third and fourth eye-glasses. Such a change in the eye-piece, however, was both inconvenient and difficult to be made. Mr Cavallo's micrometer, therefore, has this great disadvantage, that it cannot be used in reflecting telescopes, or in any achromatic telescope where the adjustment of the eye-piece is effected by rackwork, unless the structure of these instruments is altered for the purpose. Another disadvantage of this micrometer arises from the slip of mother-of-pearl passing through the centre of the field. The picture in the focus of the eye-glass is broken into two parts, and the view is rendered still more unpleasant by the inequality of the segments into which the field is divided. In addition to these disadvantages, the different divisions of the micrometer are at unequal distances from the eye-glass which views them, and therefore can neither appear equally distinct nor subtend equal angles at the eye.\n\n\"Finding that Mr Cavallo's instrument laboured under these imperfections, I thought of a circular mother-of-pearl micrometer which is free from them all, and has likewise the advantage of a kind of diagonal scale, increasing in accuracy with the angle to be measured. This micrometer, which I got executed by Miller and Adie, optical instrument-makers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, and which I have often used, both in determining small angles in the heavens and such as are subtended by terrestrial objects, is represented in fig. 27, which exhibits its appearances in the focus of the fourth eye-glass. The black ring, which forms part of the figure, is the diaphragm, and the remaining part is a ring of mother-of-pearl, having its interior circumference divided into 360 equal parts. The mother-of-pearl ring, which appears connected with the diaphragm, is completely separate from it, and is fixed at the end of a brass tube which is made to move between the third eye-glass and the diaphragm, so that the divided circumference may be placed exactly in the focus of the glass next the eye. When the micrometer is thus fitted into the telescope, the angle subtended by the whole field of view, or by the diameter of the innermost circle of the micrometer, must be determined either by measuring a base or by the passage of an equatorial star, and the angles subtended by any number of divisions or degrees will be found by a table constructed in the following manner.\n\n52. \"Let A m p n B, fig. 28, be the interior circumference of the micrometer scale, and let m n be the object to be measured. Bisect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> m n in p, and draw C m, C p, C n. The line C p will be at right angles to m n, and therefore m n will be twice the sine of half the arch m n. Consequently, A B : m n = rad. sine of \\( \\frac{1}{2} m p n \\).\nMicrometer.\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} m p n; \\text{ therefore } mn \\times R = \\sin \\frac{1}{2} m p n \\times AB, \\text{ and} \\]\n\n\\[ m p n = \\frac{\\sin \\frac{1}{2} m p n \\times AB}{R} = \\frac{\\sin \\frac{1}{2} m p n}{R} \\times AB; \\text{ a formula by which the angle subtended by the chord of any number of degrees may be easily found. The first part of the formula, viz. } \\frac{\\sin \\frac{1}{2} m p n}{R} \\text{ is constant, while } AB \\]\n\nvaries with the size of the micrometer and with the magnifying power which is applied. We have therefore computed the following table, containing the value of the constant part of the formula for every degree or division of the scale.\n\n| Deg. | Constant Part of the Formula | Deg. |

formula corresponding to that number in the table by \\(AB\\), or the angle subtended by the whole field. Thus if \\(AB\\) is 30 minutes, as it happens to be in the micrometer which I have constructed, the angle subtended by 1 degree of the scale will be \\(30' \\times 0.009 = 16.2\\) seconds, and the angle subtended by 40 degrees will be \\(30' \\times 0.342 = 10' 15.6''\\); and by making the calculation it will be found that as the angle to be measured increases, the accuracy of the scale also increases; for when the arch is only 1 or 2 degrees, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of 1 degree produces a variation of about 16 seconds in the angle; whereas when the arch is between 170 and 180, the variation of a degree does not produce a change much more than one second in the angle. This is a most important advantage in the circular scale, as in Cavallo's micrometer a limit is necessarily put to the size of the divisions.\n\n\"It is obvious, from an inspection of fig. 27, that there is no occasion for turning the circular micrometer round its axis, because the divided circumference lies in every possible direction. In fig. 2, for example, if the object has the direction \\(ab\\) it will be measured by the arch \\(aob\\), and if it lies in the line \\(cd\\) it will be measured by the arch \\(crd\\).\n\n\"In the circular micrometer which I have been in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of using, \\(AB\\), or the diameter of the field of view, is exactly half an inch, the diameter of the brass tube in which it is fixed is one inch, the length of the tube half an inch, and the degrees of the divided circumference \\(3 \\frac{1}{10}\\) of an inch.\n\n54. II. The micrometer has not only been applied to Application telescopes, and employed for astronomical purposes; but of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a> there have also been various contrivances for adapting it to microscopical observations. Mr Leeuwenhoek's method of estimating the size of small objects was by comparing them with grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, of which 100 in a line took up an inch. These grains he laid upon the same plate with his objects, and viewed them at the same time. Dr Jurin's method was similar to this; for he found the diameter of a piece of fine silver wire, by wrapping it as close as he could about a pin, and observing how many rings made an inch; and he used this wire in the same manner as Leeuwenhoek employed his sand. Dr Hooke looked upon the magnified object with one eye, while at the same time he viewed other objects placed at the same distance with the other eye. In this manner he was able, by the help of a ruler, divided into inches and small parts, and laid on the pedestal of the microscope, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> as it were the magnified appearance of the object upon the ruler, and thus exactly to measure the diameter which it appeared to have through the glass; which being compared with the diameter as it appeared to the naked eye, showed the degree in which it was magnified.\n\n55. Mr Martin* recommended such a micrometer for * Martin's microscope as had been applied to telescopes: for he advises to draw a number of parallel lines on a piece of glass, with the fine point of a diamond, at the distance of one-fortieth of an inch from one another, and to place it in the focus of the eye-glass. By this method, Dr Smith contrived to take the exact draught of objects viewed by a double microscope; for he advises\nto get a lattice, made with small silver wires or squares drawn upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> glass by the stroke of a diamond, and to put it into the place of the image, formed by the object-glass; then by transferring the parts of the object, seen in the squares of the glass or lattice upon similar corresponding squares drawn on paper, the picture may be exactly taken. Mr Martin also introduced into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> microscopes another micrometer, consisting of a screw.\n\n56. The mode of actual admeasurement (Mr Adams observes\u2020) is without doubt the most simple that can be used; as by it we comprehend, in a manner, at one glance, the different effects of combined glasses; and as it saves the trouble, and avoids the obscurity of the usual modes of calculation: but many persons find it exceedingly difficult to adopt this method, because they have not been accustomed to observe with both eyes at once. To obviate this inconvenience, the late Mr Adams contrived an instrument called the Needle-Micrometer, which was first described in his Micrographia Illustrata; and of which, as now constructed, we have the following description by his son Mr George Adams in the ingenious Essays above quoted.\n\nThis micrometer consists of a screw, which has 50 threads to an inch; this screw carries an index, which points to the divisions on a circular plate, which is fixed at right angles to the axis of the screw. The revolutions of the screw are counted on a scale, which is an inch divided into 50 parts; the index to these divisions is a flower-de-luce marked upon the slider, which carries the needle point across the field of the microscope. Every revolution of the micrometer screw measures \\( \\frac{1}{50} \\)th part of an inch, which is again subdivided by means of the divisions on the circular plate, as this is divided into 20 equal parts, over which the index passes at every revolution of the screw; by which means we obtain with ease the measure of \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\)th part of an inch: for 50, the number of threads on the screw in one inch, being multiplied by 20, the divisions on the circular plate are equal to 1000; so that each division on the circular plate shows that the needle has either advanced or receded \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\)th part of an inch.\n\n57. To place this micrometer on the body of the microscope, open the circular part FKH, fig. 25, by taking out the screw G, throw back the semicircle FK, which moves upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> at K; then turn the sliding tube of the body of the microscope, so that the small holes, which are in both tubes, may exactly coincide, and let the needle g of the micrometer have a free passage through them; after this, screw it fast upon the body by the screw G. The needle will now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> the field of the microscope, and measure the length and breadth of the image of any object that is applied to it. But further assistance must be had, in order to measure the object itself, which is a subject of real importance; for though we have ascertained the power of the microscope, and know that it is so many thousand times, yet this will be of little assistance towards ascertaining an accurate idea of its real size; for our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of bulk being formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of one object with another, we can only judge of that of any particular body, by comparing it with another whose size is known: the same thing is necessary, in order to form an estimate by the microscope; therefore, to ascertain the real measure of the object, we must make the point Micrometer of the needle pass over the image of a known part of an inch placed on the stage, and write down the revolutions made by the screw, while the needle passed over the image of this known measure; by which means we ascertain the number of revolutions on the screw, which are adequate to a real and known measure on the stage. As it requires an attentive eye to watch the motion of the needle point as it passes over the image of a known part of an inch on the stage, we ought not to trust to one single measurement of the image, but ought to repeat it at least six times; then add the six measures thus obtained together, and divide their sum by six, or the number of trials; the quotient will be the mean of all the trials. This result is to be placed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of a table next to that which contains the number of the magnifiers.\n\n58. By the assistance of the sectoral scale, we obtain with ease a small part of an inch. This scale is shown at fig. 22, 23, 24, in which the two lines c a, c b, with Fig. 22, 23, the side a b, form an isosceles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>; each of the sides is two inches long, and the base still only of one-tenth of an inch. The longer sides may be of any given length, and the base still only one-tenth of an inch. The longer lines may be considered as the line of lines upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECTOR\">sector</a> opened to one-tenth of an inch. Hence whatever number of equal parts c a, c b are divided into, their transverse measure will be such a part of one-tenth as is expressed by their division. Thus if it be divided into ten equal parts, this will divide the inch into 100 equal parts; the first division next c will be equal to \\( \\frac{1}{100} \\)th part of an inch, because it is the tenth part of one-tenth of an inch. If these lines are divided into twenty equal parts, the inch will be by that means divided into 200 equal parts. Lastly, if a b, c a, are made three inches long, and divided into 100 equal parts, we obtain with ease the 1000th part. The scale is represented as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> at fig. 23, but as perforated at fig. 22, and 24, so that the light passes through the aperture, when the sectoral part is placed on the stage.\n\n59. To use this scale, first fix the micrometer, fig. 25, to the body of the microscope; then fit the sectoral scale, fig. 24, in the stage, and adjust the microscope to its proper focus or distance from the scale, which is to be moved till the base appears in the middle of the field of view; then bring the needle point g, fig. 25, (by turning the screw L) to touch one of the lines c a, exactly at the point answering to 20 on the sectoral scale. The index a of the micrometer is to be set to the first division, and that on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a> plate to 20, which is both the beginning and end of its divisions; we are then prepared to find the magnifying power of every magnifier in the compound microscope which we are using.\n\n60. Example. Everything being prepared agreeable to the foregoing directions, suppose you are desirous of ascertaining the magnifying power of the lens marked No 4, turn the micrometer screw until the point of the needle has passed over the magnified image of the tenth part of one inch; then the division, where the two indices remain, will show how many revolutions, and parts of a revolution, the screw has made, while the needle point traversed the magnified image of the one-tenth of an inch; suppose the result to be 26 revolutions.\nMicrometer\n\nMicrometers of the screw, and 14 parts of another revolution, this is equal to 26 multiplied by 20, added to 14; that is, 534,000 parts of an inch. The 26 divisions found on the straight scale of the micrometer, while the point of the needle passed over the magnified image of one-tenth part of an inch, were multiplied by 20, because the circular plate CD, fig. 25, is divided into 20 equal parts; this produced 520; then adding the 14 parts of the next revolution, we obtain the 534,000 parts of an inch, or five-tenths and 3400 parts of another tenth, which is the measure of the magnified image of one-tenth of an inch, at the aperture of the eye-glasses or at their foci. Now if we suppose the focus of the two eye-glasses to be one inch, the double thereof is two inches; or if we reckon on the 1000th part of an inch, we have 2000 parts for the distance of the eye from the needle point of the micrometer. Again, if we take the distance of the image from the object at the stage at 6 inches, or 6000, and add thereto 2000, double the distance of the focus of the eye-glass, we shall have 8000 parts of an inch for the distance of the eye from the object; and as the glasses double the image, we must double the number 534 found upon the micrometer, which then makes 1068; then, by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>, we shall obtain the number of times the microscope magnifies the diameter of the object; say, as 240, the distance of the eye from the image of the object, is to 800, the distance of the eye from the object; so is 1068, double the measure found on the micrometer, to 3563, or the number of times the microscope magnifies the diameter of the object. By working in this manner, the magnifying power of each lens used with the compound microscope may be easily found, though the result will be different in different compound microscopes, varying according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the lenses, their distance from the object and one another, &c.\n\n61. Having discovered the magnifying power of the microscope, with the different object-lenses that are used therewith, our next subject is to find out the real size of the objects themselves, and their different parts: this is easily effected, by finding how many revolutions of the micrometer screw answer to a known measure on the sectoral scale or other object placed on the stage; from the number thus found, a table should be constructed, expressing the value of the different revolutions of the micrometer with that object lens, by which the primary number was obtained. Similar tables must be constructed for each object lens. By a set of tables of this kind, the observer may readily find the measure of any object he is examining; for he has only to make the needle point traverse over this object, and observe the number of revolutions the screw has made in its passage, and then look into his table for the real measure which corresponds to this number of revolutions, which is the measure required.\n\n62. Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVENTRY\">Coventry</a> of Southwark has favoured us with the description of a micrometer of his own invention; the scale of which, for minuteness, surpasses every instrument of the kind of which we have any knowledge, and of which, indeed, we could scarcely have formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, had he not indulged us with several of these instruments, graduated as underneath.\n\nThe micrometer is composed of glass, ivory, silver, &c., on which are drawn parallel lines from the 10th to the 10,000th part of an inch. But an instrument thus divided, he observes, is more for curiosity than use; but one of those which Mr Coventry has sent us is divided into squares, so small that sixteen millions of them are contained on the surface of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> inch, each square appearing under the microscope true and distinct; and though so small, it is a fact, that animalcula are found which may be contained in one of these squares.\n\nThe use of micrometers, when applied to microscopes, is to measure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> size of the object, and how much that object is magnified. To ascertain the real size of an object in the single microscope, nothing more is required than to lay it on the micrometer, and adjust it to the focus of the magnifier, noticing how many divisions of the micrometer it covers. Suppose the parallel lines of the micrometer to be the 1000th of an inch, and the object covers two divisions; its real size is 500ths of an inch; if five, 200ths, and so on.\n\nBut to find how much the object is magnified, is not mathematically determined so easily by the single as by the compound microscope: but the following simple method (says Mr Coventry) I have generally adopted, and think it tolerably accurate. Adjust a micrometer under the microscope o, say the 100th of an inch of divisions, with a small object on it; if square, the better: notice how many divisions one side of the object covers, suppose 10: then cut a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> paper something larger than the magnified appearance of the object: then fix one eye on the object through the microscope, and the other at the same time on the paper, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> it down till the object and the paper appear level and distinct: then cut the paper till it appear exactly the size of the magnified object; the paper being then measured, suppose an inch square: Now, as the object under the magnifier, which appeared to be one inch square, was in reality only ten hundredths, or the tenth of an inch, the experiment proves that it is magnified ten times in length, one hundred times in superfices, and one thousand times in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>, which is the magnifying power of the glass; and, in the same manner, a table may be made of the power of all the other glasses.\n\nIn using the compound microscope, the real size of the object is found by the same method as in the single: but to demonstrate the magnifying power of each glass to greater certainty, adopt the following method.\u2014Lay a two-feet rule on the stage, and a micrometer level with its surface (an inch suppose, divided into 100 parts): with one eye see how many of those parts are contained in the field of the microscope, suppose 50; and with the other, at the same time, look for the circle of light in the field of the microscope, which with a little practice will soon appear distinctly; mark how much of the rule is intersected by the circle of light, which will be half the diameter of the field. Suppose eight inches; consequently the whole diameter will be sixteen. Now, as the real size of the field, by the micrometers, appeared to be only 50 hundredths, or half an inch, and as half an inch is only one 32d part\npart of 16 inches, it shows the magnifying power of the glass to be 32 times in length, 1024 surfaces, and 32,768 cube (E).\n\n63. Another way of finding the magnifying power of compound microscopes, is by using two micrometers of the same divisions; one adjusted under the magnifier, the other fixed in the body of the microscope in the focus of the eye-glass. Notice how many divisions of the micrometer in the body are seen in one division of the micrometer under the magnifier, which again must be multiplied by the power of the eye-glass.\n\nExample: Ten divisions of the micrometer in the body are contained in one division under the magnifier; so far the power is increased ten times: now, if the eye-glass be one inch focus, such glass will of itself magnify about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> times in length, which, with the ten times magnified before, will be seven times ten, or 70 times in length, 4900 surfaces, and 343,000 cube.\n\n\"If (says Mr Coventry) these micrometers are employed in the solar microscope, they divide the object into squares on the screen in such a manner as to render it extremely easy to make a drawing of it. And (says he) I apprehend they may be employed to great advantage with such a microscope as Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a>'s lucernal; because this instrument may be used either by day or night, or in any place, and gives the actual magnifying power without calculation.\"\n\nThe case with which we have been favoured by Mr Coventry contains six micrometers, two on ivory and four on glass. One of those on ivory is an inch divided into one hundred parts, every fifth line longer than the intermediate ones, and every tenth longer still, for the greater ease in counting the divisions under the microscope, and is generally used in measuring the magnifying power of microscopes. The other ivory one is divided into squares of the 50th and 100th of an inch, and is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> employed in measuring opaque objects.\n\nThose made of glass are for transparent objects, which, when laid on them, show their natural size.\u2014That marked on the brass 100, are squares divided to the 100th of an inch: that marked 5000 are parallel lines forming nine divisions, each division the 1000th of an inch; the middle division is again divided into 5, making divisions to the 5000th of an inch. That marked 10,000 is divided in the same manner, with the middle division divided into 10, making the 10,000th of an inch. Example:\n\nThe glass micrometer without any mark is also divided, the outside lines into 100th, the next into 1000th, and the inside lines into the 4000th of an inch: these are again crossed with an equal number of lines in the same manner, making squares of the 100th, 1000th, and 4000th of an inch, thus demonstrating each other's size. The middle square of the 1000th of an inch (see fig. 26.) is divided into sixteen squares; now as 1000 squares in the length of an inch, multiplied by 1000, gives one million in an inch surface; by the same rule, one of those squares divided into 16 must be the sixteen millionth part of an inch surface. See fig. 26. which is a diminished view of the apparent surface exhibited under the magnifier No. 1. of Wilson's microscope. In viewing the smallest lines, Mr Coventry uses No. 2. or 3.; and they are all better seen, he says, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> than by day-light.","sp":842,"ep":856},{"h":"MICROPUS","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BASTARD\">BASTARD</a> CUDWEED; a genus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the syngenesia class, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> method ranking under the 49th order, Compositae.

In some notices concerning this subject which we have seen, it is observed that this science is more intimately connected with the Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a> than is generally thought, and that this connection may help to explain them. In Germany this art has been revived by M. Aretin; and a pupil of his, M.

This seems to be a singular, and we may add a silly prohibition. The following account is given of this art in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in the beginning of 1807.\n\n\"During my residence, says the writer, in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> I heard a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of a new method of mnemonique, or of a method to assist and fix our memory, invented by Gregor de Feinaigle. Notwithstanding the simplicity with which he announced his lectures in the papers, I could not determine myself to become a pupil of his, as I thought to find a quack or mountebank, and to be laughed at by my friends for having thrown away my cash in such a foolish manner. Perhaps I should hesitate to this moment about the utility of this newly invented method to assist our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> memory, had I not had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of dining at his excellency's the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of Metternich, the Austrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a>, who followed, with all his secretaries, the whole course of lectures; they all spoke very advantageously of it, likewise several other persons of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> I met there: in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this I was inserted into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of pupils, and I follow at this moment the lectures. All I can tell you about this method is, it is a very simple one, and easy to be learned, adapted to all ages and sexes: all difficulties in such sciences as require an extraordinary good memory, for instance, the names and epochs in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, are at once overcome and obviated. There is not one branch of science to which this method cannot be applied. It is easy to be perceived that such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> without some critique, and even sarcasms, in the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a>: some of them were very injurious, and plausible enough to mislead the public, who, knowing nothing of the method, are always more ready to condemn than to assist. M. Feinaigle, to answer all these critics at once, adopted a method not less public for Paris than the public papers, but less public for the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>: he gave, the 22d of last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> to about 2000 spectators, in which he did not appear at all, only about 12 or 15 of his pupils: each of them made such an application of the method as his situation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> required.

Some manufactures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> have since been introduced; and, in general, all the manufactures, the finer sorts especially, had increased considerably, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the interruption of foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">Tobacco</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> are royal manufactures and monopolies; and the former brings in to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> a clear revenue of four millions of dollars annually. The Mexican tradesmen are remarkably skilful in works of plate and jewellery; and, like some of the eastern nations, they have a singular turn for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>. Very good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> are made in Mexico, though the best coaches come from England.\n\nThe commerce of New Spain has increased greatly since 1765, and especially since 1778. From the first of these periods to 1789, various new edicts were issued, all tending to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the monopoly which a few opulent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADIZ\">Cadiz</a> and Mexico had previously enjoyed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> from Vera Cruz, before the year 1778, when the old system subsisted, was about 617,000 piastres annually; but from\nCommerce, 1787 to 1792, under the new system, it amounted to Revenue, 2,840,000 piastres annually. The commerce of Mexico with the mother country, is almost entirely carried on through Vera Cruz. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of peace, Mr Humboldt estimates the annual value of the exports in that commerce at 22,000,000 piastres, and the imports at 15,000,000. Of the former, about 17,000,000 consists of gold and silver, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULLION\">bullion</a>, and plate; the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COCHINEAL\">cochineal</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, flour, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>, salted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, tanned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a>, sarsaparilla, vanilla, jalap, &c. Of the imports, 9,000,000 consists of bale goods, including woollens, cottons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, and silk. The other articles are, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, brandy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CACAO\">cacao</a>, quicksilver, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>, wine, and bees-wax. This estimate does not include the imports in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRABAND\">contraband</a> trade, which, in time of peace, are supposed to be about a fourth of the whole. The temptations to engage in this trade are very great, as the value of commodities imported in Spanish vessels is increased 35 or 40 per cent. by the duties. Mexico also carries on a considerable trade with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBA\">Cuba</a>, Porto-Rico, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORIDA\">Florida</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANILLA\">Manilla</a>. The whole exports are estimated at 31,500,000 piastres, including specie, and the imports at 22,000,000. The demand for foreign merchandise in New Spain and Guatemala, amounts nearly to seven millions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>.\n\nThe revenue of New Spain has augmented with the progress of industry. In 1712 the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> revenue amounted to 3,668,400 piastres; in 1765 to 6,141,981; in 1780 to 15,010,974; and in 1802 to 20,200,000. It is derived chiefly from the following sources. From the produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>, consisting of duties, profits on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COINAGE\">coinage</a>, and on the sale of mercury, about 5,500,000 piastres. From the manufacture of tobacco, 4,000,000 to 4,500,000. From the alcavala, or duty on every sale of goods, nearly 3,000,000. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a>, 1,300,000. From the duty on pulque, 800,000. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> produce of the duty on imports and exports, 500,000. From the sale of papal indulgences, 270,000. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>, net produce 250,000. From the sale of powder, 150,000. From clerical benefices, 100,000. From the sale of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a>, 120,000. Stamp duties, 82,000. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> of cock-fighting, 45,000. From the farm of snow, 30,000. The expense of collection is estimated by Humboldt, on an average, at 16 or 18 per cent. of the gross receipts. Of this revenue of 20,000,000 piastres, 10,500,000 are consumed by the internal expenses of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>; 3,500,000 are remitted to other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> to supply deficiencies in their revenues; and the remainder consisting of about 6,000,000, is the clear revenue derived by the mother country from the colony. The value of the specie circulating in Mexico is estimated at fifty-five or sixty millions of piastres, which is nearly ten piastres a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> for the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>. The national wealth of Mexico is supposed to be equal to two fifths of the whole Spanish continental colonies.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> force of the colony in 1804 consisted of 9,919 regular troops, and 22,277 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a>, one half of both being cavalry. The military spirit in the militia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> is partly kept up by the vanity of some families, who aspire to the titles of colonels and brigadiers. And the distribution of these titles has become a source of revenue to those individuals who have influence with the ministry. Here, as in the United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">States</a>, merchants in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> are transformed into colonels and majors. The petty warfare continually carried on with the wandering Indians, in the provincias externas, and the maintenance of the presidios or military posts, require a considerable expense. The state of the eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the country, facilitate its defense against any attempt by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> power.\n\nIn the year 1776, the old provincial divisions were laid aside, and the country was divided anew into twelve intendancies, to which must be added three districts, very remote from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, which have preserved the simple denomination of provinces. The whole of New Spain, in 1803, contained 118,478 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> leagues, and 5,837,100 inhabitants. The population of the twelve intendancies was as follows:\n\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">Province</a>          | Population |\n|-------------------|------------|\n| Mexico            | 1,511,000  |\n| Puebla           | 813,300    |\n| Vera Cruz        | 156,000    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OAXACA\">Oaxaca</a>           | 534,800    |\n| Merida           | 463,800    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-VALLADOLID\">Valladolid</a>       | 467,400    |\n| Guadalajara      | 632,500    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-ZACATECAS\">Zacatecas</a>        | 153,300    |\n| Guanajuato       | 517,300    |\n| San Luis Potosi  | 230,000    |\n| Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALIFORNIA\">California</a>   | 9,000      |\n| New California   | 15,600     |\n\nAdd the population of the Provincias Internas,\n\nThis population is distinguished into different classes:\n\n- Whites, of whom 70,000 are European Spaniards,\n- Indians,\n- Mestizos, or mixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>,\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">Negroes</a>,\n\nOf all the circumstances in the state of Spanish America, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of its inhabitants into casts, marked by nature with differences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and distinguished in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAW\">law</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> by differences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> or privilege, is the most adverse to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> and prosperity. The first class is divided within itself. Though the Gachepines, or European Spaniards, and the Creoles, or American Spaniards, have in law equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to preferment, the former enjoy almost all places of trust or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a>. One cause of this partiality is, that the needy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MADRID\">Madrid</a>, which has been in the practice of raising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> by the sale of colonial offices, fills up even the most inferior situations. A keen spirit of jealousy is thus kept up between the parties, and the government, by showing favour to the one, has made enemies of the other.\n\nThe Mestizos, or descendants of Spaniards and Indians, form the class next in rank after the whites. In colour they hardly differ from the Creoles; but the scantiness of their beards, the smallness of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> and feet, and a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> of their eyes, betray their Indian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>. Some consider them as a superior race of men to the Creoles both in bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> and mental endowments. In rank they follow the condition of their fathers. The Creoles and Mestizos...\nMestizoes form by their union, their numbers, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> force, and the most respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the Spanish colonists. As they have the same interests to maintain, and the same grievances to redress, it is probable that in the event of any civil dissensions, they would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACT\">act</a> together, whether against Indians or Europeans.\n\nThe fate of the Indians living under the Spanish government, is a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the inefficacy of law to afford protection, where those who are the objects of its care have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> control over the persons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with its execution. The Indians are fenced by the strictest provisions against the tyranny and injustice of their rulers, and yet no people have suffered more from rapacity and oppression. They are born free, and exempt from all sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> service; they are admissible into all incorporated trades, in the same manner as Spaniards; and their caciques have the privileges of Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>. Those who live in separate villages are governed by alcaldes and regidores of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, and no Spaniards or mixed races are permitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> among them, or encroach on their lands. To prevent their facility from being abused by the fraudulent and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGNING\">designing</a>, they cannot dispose of their real property without the intervention of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, nor enter into contracts, nor conclude bargains for a greater sum than three dollars. They are exempt from the alcavala, and pay only a moderate tribute,\u2014not exceeding two dollars for every person from 10 to 50 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. These anxious provisions for their protection have undoubtedly operated against their progress in civilization. Their living in separate communities deprives them of the means of instruction. The state of pupilage in which they are kept destroys the energy of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, and detains them in perpetual childhood. The multiplicity of laws in their favour, enables the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> or magistrate to interfere when he pleases in their concerns, and, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> of serving them, to become their worst oppressor. The produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> lands of their villages, which they are bound to cultivate, is withheld from the beneficial purposes to which it is applicable by law, and openly diverted to other uses in which they have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> or concern. The privileges of their caciques are almost illusory.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">Climate</a> has little effect on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> of the Indians. Those who live on the Rio Negro are darker than those who inhabit the banks of the Lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORINOCO\">Orinoco</a>, though they enjoy a much cooler temperature. Their children, contrary to the testimony of some authors, have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> colour at birth. The Indians are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> lived race, when their days are not shortened by intoxication. Pulque, a fermented liquor from the juice of the agave americana, which is their native liquor, is less prejudicial to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> than rum or brandy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of which they have learned from Europeans. They have little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of body, and suffer less from wounds and injuries than other races, and they are also less subject to personal deformities. A crooked spine is never seen among them, and very few of them are squint-eyed or lame. In the provinces afflicted with the goitre, the Indians are totally exempt, and even the Mestizoes rarely suffer from that malady. Of all the races in the old world they have the greatest resemblance to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOGULS\">Moguls</a>, but they have a smaller facial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, though greater than the negro. Their skull is thicker than that of the European, the frontal bone more depressed, the occiput less protuberant, and the brain smaller. The Mexican Indian is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>, melancholy, and silent, unless when under the influence of spirituous liquors. He affects an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of mystery in the most unimportant transactions, and no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> is to be seen in his countenance of the most violent passions that agitate him. He is obstinately attached to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> customs, manners, and opinions. He seems to be destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, and to have little feeling; but when properly educated, has a clear head, an acute and logical understanding. The Indians are generally excessively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, but some of them under an appearance of wretchedness conceal considerable wealth. In every village there are eight or ten individuals who live in idleness at the expense of the others, on pretence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> of their birth.\n\nThe Toltecas, who first inhabited Mexico, were counted much more polished than those who came after them, insomuch that in after ages it was customary to distinguish people of ingenuity and learning by the name of Toltecas. They always lived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, collected into cities, under the government of kings, and had regular laws. They were more addicted to the arts of peace than of war; and it was to them that the succeeding nations owed themselves indebted for their knowledge of the culture of grain, cotton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, &c. They understood the art of casting gold and silver, and melting them in whatever forms they pleased, acquiring also great reputation from their skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> gems of all kinds; and they were besides well versed in the sciences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a>.\n\nAccording to the ancient histories of these people, they observed, about a hundred years before the Christian era, how far the solar year exceeded the civil one; supplying the defect, as we do, by the addition of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> once in four years. In the year 660, while their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TULA\">Tula</a>, a celebrated astronomer named Hueamatzin, assembled with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s consent all the wise men of the nation; and with their assistance painted a famous book named Teocanoxtli, or \"divine book,\" in which were represented, in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> figures, the origin of the Indians, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a> after the confusion of tongues at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BABEL\">Babel</a>, their journey in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, their first settlements in America, the founding of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Tula, and their progress till that time: but these, and other accounts of their great knowledge and accuracy, savour too much of exaggeration, or perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, from both which it is impossible to clear the Spaniards when speaking of American affairs.\n\nThe Chichimecas derived their knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> from the Toltecas, and of consequence the Mexicans in aieans also. Being destitute of ploughs or animals of agriculture, sufficient strength to assist them in their labour, they made use of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of hard copper, which they called coatl or coa, but differing in shape either from a spade or mattock. They used copper axes to cut trees, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of which was the same with ours; only that they put the axe into the eye of the handle, instead of putting the handle into the eye of the axe as we do. They had several other instruments of agriculture, but the forms of them are not mentioned by historians. They watered their fields by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>.\nrivers and small torrents which came from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>; raising dams to collect them, and forming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> to conduct them properly to the places which required moisture. They used enclosures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, as well as hedges for the fields, using for their hedges the aloe plant, which is well calculated for the purpose; and what reparations were necessary they gave in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>. They dibbled their maize: a method of sowing more slow indeed than the ordinary one, but which certainly repays the trouble by a vastly larger crop, as well as by saving a very considerable quantity of seed. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">Close</a> to the newly sown fields they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> erected a small tower of wood, where a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> kept watch, in order to drive away the birds that came to feed upon the grain; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> still preserved among the Spaniards.\n\nIn the cultivation of their gardens, the Mexicans were extremely skilful and magnificent; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> in them not only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> herbs, but fruit trees, medicinal herbs, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and regularity. Some of the royal gardens excited the admiration of the Spaniards so much, that Cortes, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. informed him that the garden at Huaxtepec was the most extensive, the most beautiful, and most delightful, that had ever been beheld. It was for many years preserved by the Spaniards.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> most cultivated, next to maize, were cotton, cocoa, and aloe; which last served a great many useful purposes. See ALOE.\n\nThough they had not the advantage of the larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a>, as horses, oxen, or sheep, they bred up an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of quadrupeds unknown in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. Private persons brought up the small quadrupeds already mentioned, resembling little dogs; as well as turkeys, quails, geese, ducks, and other kinds of fowl. In the houses of the great men were bred fish, deer, rabbits, and a variety of birds; and in the royal palaces, almost all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of quadrupeds and winged animals to be found in these kingdoms were kept, as well as a great number of aquatic animals and reptiles. According to Clavigero, Montezuma II. surpassed all the kings in the world in this kind of magnificence; and there never was a nation equal to the Mexicans in the care they took in taming animals.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">Painting</a> was an art in great request among the Mexicans, and one of very great use; as it was only by means of paintings that they recorded their histories. This art they derived, like others, from the Toltecas. Some of these paintings were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> images of their gods, kings, heroes, or terrestrial objects. Others were historical, containing an account of particular events; others mythological, of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> is preserved in the great library of the order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>: others were codes of law, civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>; while some were chronological, astronomical, or astrological; in which were represented their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a>, the position of the stars, changes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, eclipses, and prognostications and variations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. Great numbers of these were burned by the superstitious Spaniards, who imagined that they contained some emblems of heathen worship. They had likewise geographical paintings, which served not only to show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> and boundaries of their possessions, but likewise the situation of places, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the coasts, and the course of the rivers. In his first letter to Charles V. Cortes says, that having made inquiries <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> there was any secure harbour for vessels on the Mexican coast, Montezuma presented him with a painting of the whole coast, from the port of Vera Cruz, at that time called Chalchihuacan, to the river Coatzacualco. Another author informs us also, that Cortes, in a long and difficult voyage which he made to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONDURAS\">Honduras</a>, made use of a chart presented to him by the lords of Coatzacualco, in which all the places and rivers were marked from the coast of Coatzacualco to Huejacallan.\n\nThe cloth on which paintings were done was made of the thread of the aloe or a kind of palm; or they painted on sheep's skins or upon paper. This last was made of the leaves of a certain kind of aloe, steeped like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>, and afterwards washed, stretched, and smoothed. They used also the bark of other trees, prepared with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>: but we are ignorant of the method they used in the manufacture. This paper is similar in thickness to the European pasteboard, but softer, smoother, and more easy for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>. In general it was made up in very long sheets, which they preserved in rolls, or folded like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>-screens. The volume of Mexican paintings, preserved in the library of Bologna, is a thick skin, ill dressed, composed of different pieces painted all over, and folded up in that manner. The beautiful colours which they employed both in their paintings and in their dyes, were obtained from wood, leaves, and the flowers of different plants, as well as from various animal substances. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> was made from a kind of stone which burns into a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a>; or from a mineral, which after being made into a paste worked like clay, and formed into small balls, turns white in the fire like Spanish white. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> was got from another mineral, which has a disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, or from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOOT\">soot</a> of a kind of pine collected in small earthen vessels. They obtain blue and azure colours from indigo; but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of obtaining these was very different from that used by the moderns. They put the branches of the plant into hot, or rather lukewarm, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; and after having stirred them about for a sufficient time with a stick or ladle, they passed the water, when impregnated with the dye, into certain pots or cups, in which they let it remain until the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> part of the dye was deposited; after which they poured off the water. This sediment was first dried in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, and afterwards put between two plates before a fire until it grew hard. They had another plant which likewise afforded a blue colour, but inferior to the indigo. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> was obtained from the seeds of the achiot or rocou, and purple from cochineal. Their yellows were ochre, and a colour extracted from the beautiful flower of a plant resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTEMISIA\">artemisia</a>. With nitre these flowers afforded a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> colour; and by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a> they extracted other colours.","sp":826,"ep":829},{"h":"NETTLE-RASH","t":"Febris urticata, Vog. 40.\nUredo, Lin. 8.\nPurpura urticata, Junck. 75.\nScarlatina urticata, Sauv. sp. 2.\nErysipelatis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> altera, Sydenham, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. vi. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 6.\nFebris scarlatina, et febris urticata, Meysercy, Mal. des arm\u00e9es, 291 et seq.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> has its English name of nettle-rash from the resemblance of its eruption to that made by the stinging of nettles. These little elevations upon the skin in the nettle-rash often appear instantaneously, especially <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the skin be rubbed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> scratched, and seldom stay many hours in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and sometimes not many minutes. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the body is exempt from them; and where many of them rise together, and continue an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> or two, the parts are often considerably swelled; which particularly happens in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, arms, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. These eruptions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> continue to infest the skin, sometimes in one place and sometimes in another, for one or two hours at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, two or three times every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, or perhaps for the greatest part of the 24 hours.\u2014In some persons they last only a few days, in others many months; nay, sometimes the disease has lasted for years with very short intervals.\n\nBut though the eruption of the urticaria resembles, as already observed, that produced by the stinging of nettles,\nwill produce something like this effect on the parts Urticaria, which they touch; and undoubtedly from the same cause.\n\nDr Heberden asks, Is it impossible that the nettle-rash should arise from the same causes, or from others similar, which we miss by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> too deeply for them in the blood and humours? Such, says he, may have been its origin in some instances, where it has lasted only a few days; but where this affection has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for some years, in persons who change their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> every day, and who bathe frequently all the time, it can hardly be ascribed to such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> cause. He has observed it frequently to arise from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTHARIDES\">cantharides</a>: but though it has continued many weeks after the removal of the blister, yet it might be suspected that this arose from the fine spicules of the cantharides sticking all this time about the skin; it being customary to strew much of the dry powder of the cantharides over the blister-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a>, whence it may readily be carried to other parts of the body. But it is certain that similar effects will sometimes follow the internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of wild valerian root, or the eating of fish not sufficiently dressed; muscles, shrimps, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, and the kernels of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, will also sometimes produce symptoms of a similar kind. But whatever be its cause, Dr Heberden never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> any reason to suppose that the nettle-rash had in any way vitiated the humours to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> as to require the use of internal remedies; and if the itching could be certainly and expeditiously allayed, there would be no occasion for any farther cure. He concludes this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the disorder with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> communicated to him by Dr Monsey, physician of Chelsea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, and in which the disease appeared with uncommon violence.\n\nW. A., aged near 30, of a thin spare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, was seized with a disorder attended with symptoms of a very uncommon kind. Whenever he went into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> shined bright, he was seized with a tickling of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> on those parts exposed to the sun; this tickling, by his continuing in the air, increased to a violent itching, attended with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and pain; the skin would then be almost as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMILION\">vermilion</a>, and thicken like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>; and this remained till he went out of the open air, and then abated in about 15 or 20 minutes. This happened only when the sun was above the horizon; at other times he was what he called quite well.\u2014But it was not owing to the heat of the sun; for the sun in winter affected him full as much, if not more, and the heat of the fire had no such effect. Thus he was confined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> for 10 years. He tried several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, and had advices from many physicians, without the least abatement of his complaints. At last it was agreed by a consultation of physicians, that he should try <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; which he did at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YARMOUTH\">Yarmouth</a> for 13 weeks, without any visible amendment. One hot day, having pulled off his clothes and gone into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> in the middle of the day, the heat diffused itself so violently all over his body, that, by the time he had put on his clothes, his eyesight began to fail, and he was compelled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> upon the ground to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> himself from falling. The moment he lay down, the faintness went off; upon this he got up again; but had no sooner arisen, than he found himself in the former condition; he therefore lay down\nExanthemata.\n\ndown again, and immediately recovered. He continued alternately getting up and lying down, till the disorder began to be exhausted, which was in about half an hour; and he was frequently obliged to have recourse to the same expedient.\n\nHaving at last accidentally met with Dr Monsey, this physician questioned him concerning the cause of the disorder; but nothing could be guessed at, excepting that the patient had owned he had one winter lived entirely upon bullock's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> and porter, from inability to purchase better victuals. A comrade lived with him at that time, on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>; and he also was affected in a similar manner, though in a less degree, and had recovered. The patient was then first put upon a course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a>'s sweating powder without any effect, and afterwards tried a course of nitrous ones with the same bad success. At last Dr Monsey determined to try the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, which happily proved effectual in removing this obstinate and uncommon distemper. The patient began with taking five grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALOMEL\">calomel</a> for three nights running, and a cathartic next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. In this course he went on for near a fortnight, at the end of which he found himself very sensibly relieved. This encouraged him to go on rather too boldly, by which means a slight salivation ensued; however, that went off soon, and in about six weeks he was quite well.\u2014Some time after, he was threatened with a return of his disorder; but this was effectually relieved by a dose of calomel, which he had afterwards occasion to repeat for the same reason, and with the same success; but at last the disorder seemed to be radically cured, by his having no further symptoms of a relapse.\n\nGENUS XXXIV.

He declines taking the descriptions of foreign physicians: we shall therefore content ourselves with giving an instance of this very uncommon distemper, as it was observed in the Infirmary at Aberdeen, and was treated by the late Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Stuart, then physician to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>, who soon after published an account of it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Medical Commentaries. A private soldier of the 73d regiment, aged eighteen years, formerly a pedlar, and naturally of a healthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, was received into the hospital at Aberdeen on the 25th of April. About twenty days before that, he had been seized with the measles when in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and, in marching to town, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> day of their eruption, he was exposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>; upon which they suddenly disappeared.\n\nHaving arrived at Aberdeen, he was quartered in a damp, ill-aired, under-ground apartment. He then complained of sickness at stomach, great oppression about the precordia, headache, lassitude, and weariness, on the least exertion; with stiffness and rigidity of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a> and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>. The surgeon of the regiment visited him: he was purged, but with little benefit. About ten days before, he observed on the inside of his thighs a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of very small, distinct, red spots, a little elevated above the surface of the skin, and much resembling the first appearance of smallpox. This eruption gradually spread itself over his whole body, and the pustules continued every day to increase in size.\n\nUpon being received into the hospital, he complained of headache, sickness at stomach, oppression about the precordia, thirst, sore throat, with difficulty of swallowing; his tongue was foul, his skin felt hot and feverish; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> from 110 to 122, rather depressed; belly costive; eyes dull and languid, but without delirium. The whole surface of his skin was interspersed with vesicles, or phlyctenae, of the size of an ordinary walnut; many of them were larger, especially on the arms and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>. In the interstices, between the vesicles, the appearance of the skin was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>, nor was there any redness round their base; the distance from one to another was from half an inch to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>-breadth or more. In some places two or three were joined together, like the pustules in the confluent smallpox. A few vesicles had burst of themselves, and formed a whitish scab or crust. Those were chiefly on the neck and face; others showed a tolerably laudable pus. However, by far the greatest number were perfectly entire, turgid, and of a bluish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. Upon opening them, it was evident that the cuticle elevated above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CUTIS\">cutis</a>, and distended with a thin, yellowish, semipellucid serum, formed this appearance. Nor was the surface of the cutis ulcerated or livid; but of a red florid colour, as when the cuticle is separated by a blister, or superficial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>. No other person labouring under a similar disease, either in the part of the country from which he came, or when he resided in Aberdeen.\n\nThis case was treated in the following manner. The largest of the vesicles were snipped, and dressed with unguent, e lap. calamarii. In the evening he was vomited with a solution of tartar emetic, given in small quantities and at intervals. This also procured two loose stools. And he was ordered for drink, water-gruel acidulated with lemon juice.\n\n\"April 16. He still complained of sickness, some oppression about his breast, and sore throat; he had slept little during the night; his tongue was foul and blackish; his skin, however, was not so hot as the preceding day; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>-coloured, but had the appearance of separation; his pulse 90, and soft; most of the sores on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of the body looked clean. Others, particularly where the vesicles were confluent, seemed beginning to ulcerate, and to have a bluish sublivid appearance. They were dressed afresh with cerate, and he was ordered the following medicines:\n\nRp Decoct. Cort. Peruvian, 3vj. Vini rubr. Lusitan. 3ijj. M. Hujus mixture capiat 3B, tertia quaque hora.\n\n* His\nHis acidulated drink was continued; and on account of the very offensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> on approaching near him, some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a> was placed in a basin before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, and sprinkled on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>; and the room was kept properly aired.\n\nApril 17. His sores looked tolerably clean, unless on his arms and thighs; where they were livid, a little ulcerated, and discharged a bloody ichor.\n\nHis headache, sickness, &c. were almost gone; his tongue was rather cleaner; pulse 68, and soft. As the decoction of the bark sat easily on his stomach, the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESCRIPTION\">prescription</a> was ordered:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rp. Pulv. subtiliss. Cort. Peruv. 3S. Vini rubri Lusitan. Aque fontan. ad 3ss. M. ft. Haust. tertia quaque hora repetend.} \\]\n\nThe acidulated drink was continued, and fresh dressings applied to the sores.\n\nApril 18. The little ulcers in his arms and thighs still discharged a bloody ichor, and looked ill; his other complaints were better; pulse 82. The bark had not nauseated him, and it was continued as well as his former drink.\n\nApril 19. His sores looked much cleaner and better; the fever was gone, his pulse natural, and he had no complaint but weakness and a troublesome itching of the skin: The Peruvian bark, &c. were continued.\n\nApril 20. Some of the ulcers still poured forth a bloody ichor; most of them, however, looked well, and had begun to heal\u2014fever gone\u2014medicines continued.\n\nFrom the 21st of April, he went on gaining strength, and his sores appeared to heal fast; he was desired to take only four doses every day; and by the 27th his sores, &c. were totally dried up\u2014he had no complaint, and was dismissed cured.\"\n\nSince the publication of this case of pemphigus by Dr Stuart, observations on this disease have been published by Dr Stephen Dickson of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, in the Transactions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Irish Academy. In these observations, an account is given of six different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> which Dr Dickson has had an opportunity of seeing. Judging from these, Dr Dickson thinks that Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of this disease requires correction; and that it ought to be defined, \"a fever accompanied with the successive eruption, from different parts of the body, internal as well as external, of vesicles about the size of an almond, which become turgid with a faintly yellowish serum, and in three or four days subside.\"\n\nFrom the cases which have fallen under Dr Dickson's observation, he concludes, that the disease varies considerably as to its mildness or malignity. In three of the cases which he has seen, the symptoms were extremely mild, but in the other three strong symptoms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> were manifested, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of the patient was in great danger. With respect to the method of cure, he is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the general symptoms of weakness, and tendency to putrefaction, obviously point out the proper treatment. Nourishment must be supplied, and the Peruvian bark and wine carefully administered; and when vesicles appear on internal parts, irritation must be guarded against by opiates, demulcents, and gentle laxatives.\n\nSome additional observations on the subject of pem-\n\nphigus have lately been published in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> Medical Journal by Mr Thomas Christie. From a case which Mr Christie describes, he is disposed to agree with Mr Dickson in thinking that sometimes at least pemphigus is not contagious. He remarks, however, that the pemphigus described by some foreign writers was extremely infectious; which he thinks may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the disease into two species, the pemphigus simplex and complicatus: both of which, but especially the last, seem to vary much with respect to mildness and malignity.\n\nGENUS XXXV. APHTHA.\n\nThe Thrush.\n\nAphtha, Sauv. gen. 100. Lin. 9. Sag. 298. Boerh. 978. Hoffm. II. 478. Junck. 137. Febris aphthosa, Vog. 44.\n\nThe only idiopathic species is the thrush to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> are subject; (Aphtha lactucimen, Sauv. sp. i.)\n\nThe aphthae are whitish or ash-coloured pustules, invading the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-UVULA\">uvula</a>, fauces, palate, tonsils, inside of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, tongue, and lips. They for the most part begin at the uvula, sending forth a glutinous mucus, and the pustules covering all or the greatest number of the parts above mentioned, with a thick whitish crust adhering most tenaciously. This crust does not induce an eschar on the parts on which it lies by eating into them, but comes off in whole pieces after the pustules have arrived at maturity. This will often happen in a short time, so that the throat and internal parts of the mouth are frequently observed to be clean, which a few hours before were wholly covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> crusts. Neither is this disease confined to the throat and fauces, but is said to affect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OESOPHAGUS\">oesophagus</a>, stomach, and all parts of the alimentary canal. Of this indeed there is no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, than that, after a great difficulty of swallowing, there is sometimes an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of aphthae evacuated by stool and vomiting, such as the mouth could not be thought capable of containing.\n\nCauses, &c. The aphthous fever seems to be produced by cold and moisture, as it is found only in the northern countries, and especially in marshy places; and in them the aphthae often appear without any fever at all.\n\nPrognosis. There is no symptom by which the coming out of aphthae can be foretold, though they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in many fevers; but they themselves are in general a bad symptom, and always signify a very tedious disorder: the danger denoted by them is in proportion to the difficulty of deglutition; and a diarrhoea accompanying them is likewise bad. This indeed generally carries off old people when they become affected with aphthae. The dark-coloured aphthae also are much more dangerous than such as are of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> or ash colour; but it is a good sign when the appetite returns, and the dark-coloured ones are succeeded by others of a whiter colour. Neither are those which are unaccompanied with fever so dangerous as the other kind.\n\nCure. As the aphthae are seldom a primary disease, we must generally endeavour to remove the disorder upon which they depend, after which they will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> off;\noff; but in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time we are not to neglect applications to the aphthae themselves, such as detergent and softening gargles made of the decoction of figs, with the addition of honey of roses, a little vinegar, and some tincture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYRRH\">myrrh</a>.\n\n**ORDER IV.

These are, congestions of the blood sometimes in one part, and sometimes in another, and which are often very troublesome in the sides of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>: there is a redness of the cheeks; an inflation of the face, and of the vessels of the neck and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>; a tinnitus aurium; a heavy pain of the eyes, with a prominence, dryness, and sparks; there is a vertiginous affection of the head, with an itching of the nostrils, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, especially about the root of the nose. In some the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> is disturbed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> about blood, fire, &c. Frequently the belly is costive, there is a diminution of the quantity of urine, a suppression of sweat, coldness of the lower extremities, and tension of the hypochondria, especially the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> one.\n\n**Causes, &c.** This hemorrhage may occur at any time of life; but most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> happens to young persons, owing to the peculiar state of the system at that time. Sometimes, however, it happens after the azura and during the state of manhood, at which time it is to be imputed to a plethoric state of the system; to a determination of the blood, by habit, to the vessels of the nose; or to the particular weakness of these vessels.\n\nIn all these cases the disease may be considered as an arterial hemorrhage, and depending upon an arterial plethora; but it sometimes occurs in the decline of life, and may then be considered as the sign of a venous plethora in the vessels of the head. It often happens at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of life in certain febrile diseases, which are altogether or partly of an inflammatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and which show a particular determination of the blood to the vessels of the head. As by this evacuation, other diseases are often removed, it may on these occasions be deemed truly critical. It happens to persons of every constitution and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a>; but most frequently to the plethoric and sanguine, and more commonly to men than women.\n\n**Prognosis.** In young people, the bleeding at the nose may be considered as a slight disease, and scarce worth notice. But, even in young persons, when it recurs frequently and in great quantity, it is alarming; and is to be considered as a mark of an arterial plethora, which in the decline of life may give the blood a determination to parts from which the hemorrhage would be more dangerous; and this will require more particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, as the marks of plethora and congestion preceding the hemorrhage are more considerable, and as the flowing of the blood is attended with a more considerable degree of febrile disorder. These consequences are more especially to be dreaded, when the epistaxis happens to persons after their azura, returning frequently and violently. Even in the decline of life, however, it may be considered as in itself very salutary; but at the same time it is a mark of a dangerous state of the system, i.e., of a strong tendency to venous plethora in the head, and it has accordingly been often followed by apoplexy, palsy, &c. When it happens in febrile diseases, and is in pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quantity, it may generally be considered as critical and salutary; but it is very apt to be too profuse, and thus becomes dangerous. It sometimes occurs during the eruptive fever of some exanthemata, and is in such cases sometimes salutary; but if these exanthemata be accompanied with any putrid disposition, this hemorrhage, as well as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> bloodlettings, may have a very bad tendency.\n\n**Cure.** The treatment in cases of epistaxis may be referred to two heads. 1st, The treatment during the time of the discharge; and, 2dly, The treatment after the discharge is stopped, with the view of preventing the return of it. During the former of these periods, it is necessary in the first place to consider whether the discharge should be left to its natural course, or stopped by artificial means. In determining this question, regard must be paid to the quantity of the discharge; the appearance of the blood; the constitution with which epistaxis occurs; the former habit of the patient; and the consequences which result from the discharge. When, from due consideration of these circumstances, there is reason to fear that further evacuation would be attended with bad consequences, though this disease has been generally thought very slight, it should seldom be left to the conduct of nature; and in all cases it should be moderated by keeping the patient in cool air, by giving cold drink, by keeping the body and head erect, by avoiding any blowing of the nose, speaking, or other irritation; and if the blood has flowed for some time without showing any tendency to stop, we are to attempt the suppression of the hemorrhage, by pressing the nostril from which the blood flows, washing the face with cold water, or applying this to some other parts of the body. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> Dr Cullen judges to be proper even on the first attacks, and even in young persons where the disease is in the least hazardous; but they will still be more requisite if the disease frequently recurs without any external violence; if the returns happen to persons not disposed...\ndisposed to a plethoric habit; and more particularly if no signs of plethora appear in the symptoms preceding the discharge.\n\nWhen the bleeding is so profuse that the pulse becomes weak and the face <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a>, every means must be used to put a stop to it, and that whether the patient be young or old. Besides those methods above mentioned, we must use astringents both internal and external; but the latter are the most powerful, and the choice of these may be left to the surgeon. The internal astringents are either vegetable or fossil; but the vegetable astringents are seldom powerful in the cure of any haemorrhages except those of the alimentary canal. The fossil astringents are more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, but differ considerably in strength from one another.\u2014The chalybeates appear to have little strength: the preparations of lead are more powerful; but cannot be employed, on account of their pernicious qualities, unless in cases of the utmost danger. The tinctura saturnina, or antiphthisica, is a medicine of very little efficacy, either from the small quantity of lead it contains, or from the particular state in which it is. The safest and at the same time the most powerful astringent, seems to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>.\n\nFor suppressing this and other haemorrhages, many superstitious remedies and charms have been used, and said to have been employed with success. This has probably been owing to the mistake of the bystanders, who have supposed that the spontaneous cessation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HAEMORRHAGE\">haemorrhage</a> was owing to their remedy. At the same time Dr Cullen is of opinion, that such remedies have sometimes been useful, by impressing the mind with horror or dread. Opiates have sometimes proved successful in removing haemorrhages; and when the fulness and inflammatory diathesis of the system have been previously taken off by bleeding, they may, in Dr Cullen's opinion, be used with safety and advantage. Ligatures have been applied upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, for retarding the return of the venous blood from the extremities; but their use seems to be ambiguous. In the case of profuse haemorrhages, no care is to be taken to prevent the patient from fainting, as this is often the most certain means of stopping them.\n\n**GENUS XXXVII.

Immediately before the appearance of blood, a degree of irritation is felt at the top of the larynx. The person attempts to relieve this by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAWKING\">hawking</a>, which brings up a little florid and somewhat frothy blood. The irritation returns; and in the same manner blood of a similar kind is brought up, with some noise in the windpipe, as of air passing through a fluid. Sometimes, however, at the very first, the blood comes up with coughing, or at least somewhat of coughing, and accompanies the hawking above mentioned.\n\nThe blood is often at first in very small quantity, and soon disappears; but in other cases, especially when it frequently recurs, it is in greater quantity, and often continues to appear at times for several days together. It is sometimes profuse, but rarely in such quantity as either by its excess or by a sudden suffocation to prove immediately mortal.\n\nIt is not always easy to discover whether the blood evacuated by the mouth proceeds from the internal surface of the mouth itself, from the fauces or adjoining cavities of the nose, from the stomach, or from the lungs. It is, however, very necessary to distinguish these different cases; and for this Dr Cullen offers the following considerations.\n\n1. When the blood proceeds from some part of the internal surface of the mouth, it comes out without any hawking or coughing; and generally, upon inspection, the cause is evident.\n\n2. When blood proceeds from the fauces, or adjoining cavities of the nose, it may be brought out by hawking, and sometimes by coughing. In this case, there may be a doubt concerning its real source, and the patient may be allowed to please himself with the thoughts that the blood does not come from the lungs. But the physician must remember that the lungs are much more frequently the source of a haemorrhage than the fauces. The latter seldom happens but to persons who have before been liable to a haemorrhage from the nose, or to some evident cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EROSION\">erosion</a>; and in most cases, by looking into the fauces, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> of the blood from thence will be perceived.\n\n3. When blood proceeds from the lungs, the manner in which it is brought up will commonly show from whence it comes; but, independent of that, it may also be known from the causes of h\u00e6moptysis from the lungs, to be afterwards mentioned, having preceded.\n\n4. When vomiting accompanies the throwing out of blood from the mouth, we may generally know the source from whence it proceeds, by considering that blood does not proceed so frequently from the stomach as from the lungs: that blood proceeding from the stomach commonly appears in greater quantity than from the lungs. The pulmonary blood also is usually of a florid colour, and mixed with a little frothy mucus.\nmucus only; but the blood from the stomach is of a darker colour, more grumous, and mixed with the other contents of the stomach. The coughing or vomiting, as the one or the other happens first to arise, may sometimes point out the source of the blood; and this has also its peculiar antecedent signs and causes.\n\nCauses, &c. A haemoptysis may be produced at any time of life by external violence; and, in adult persons, while the arterial plethora prevails in the system, i.e., from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 16 to 35, a haemoptysis may at any time be produced merely by a plethoric state of the lungs. More frequently, however, it arises from a faulty proportion between the capacity of the lungs and that of the rest of the body. Thus it is often an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> disease, which implies a peculiar and faulty conformation.\n\nThis disease especially happens to persons, who discover the smaller capacity of their lungs by the narrowness of their chest, and by the prominence of their shoulders; which last is a mark of their having been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> liable to a difficulty of respiration. In such cases, too, the disease very frequently happens to persons of a sanguine temperament, in whom particularly the arterial plethora prevails. It happens also to persons of a slender delicate make, of which a long neck is a mark; to persons of much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a>, and therefore of quick parts; to persons who have formerly been liable to hemorrhages from the nose; to those who have suffered a suppression of any usual haemorrhage, the most frequent instance of which is in females who have suffered a suppression of their menstrual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a>; and, lastly, to persons who have suffered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMPUTATION\">amputation</a> of a limb.\n\nAll this constitutes the predisponent cause of haemoptysis; and the disease may happen merely from the predisponent cause arising to a considerable height. But in those who are already predisposed, it is often brought on by the concurrence of various occasional and exciting causes. One of these, and perhaps a frequent one, is external heat; which, even when in no great degree, brings on the disease in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, and the beginning of summer, while the heat rarifies the blood more than it relaxes the solids, which had before been contracted by the cold of winter. Another exciting cause is a sudden diminution of the weight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, especially when concurring with any effort in bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>. The effort alone, may often be the exciting cause in those who are already predisposed; and more particularly any violent exercise of respiration. In the predisposed, also, the disease may be occasioned by any degree of external violence.\n\nPrognosis. Haemoptysis may sometimes be no more dangerous than a hemorrhage from the nose; as when it happens to females, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of a suppression of their menses; when, without any marks of predisposition, it arises from external violence; or, from whatever cause it may proceed, when it leaves no cough, dyspnoea, or other affection of the lungs, behind it. But, even in these cases, a danger may arise from too large a wound being made in the vessels of the lungs, from any quantity of red blood being led to stagnate in the cavity of the bronchiae, and particularly from any determination of the blood being made into the vessels of the lungs, which by renewing the haemorrhage may have these consequences.\n\nCure. In the treatment of this disease, with a view of stopping the discharge, it is first necessary to have recourse to those measures which tend to diminish the impetus by which the blood is expelled. This is to be effected by a removal of plethora when it exists; by diminishing the general impetus of circulation; by diminishing local increased <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> when it takes place in the vessels of the lungs; and by producing a determination of blood to other parts of the system remote from the lungs. But besides practices diminishing impetus, it is often also necessary to employ such as augment the resistance to the passage of blood through the ruptured vessels of the lungs. With these views a variety of practices may be employed, particularly blood-letting, refrigerants, sedatives, astringents, and the like.\n\nOn this subject Dr Cullen differs from those who prescribe chalybeates and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a> in the cure of haemoptysis. Both of these, he observes, contribute to increase the phlogistic diathesis then prevailing in the system, and the haemoptysis from predisposition is always accompanied with such a diathesis. Instead of these, therefore, he recommends blood-letting in greater or smaller quantity, and more or less frequently repeated as the symptoms shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a>. At the same time cooling purgatives are to be employed, and every part of the antiphlogistic regimen is to be strictly enjoined. In the London Medical Observations, the use of nitre is greatly recommended by Dr Dickson, to whom its efficacy was made known by Dr Letherland, physician to St Thomas's Hospital. The most commodious method of exhibiting it he found was in an electuary. Four ounces of conserve of roses were made into an electuary with half an ounce of nitre; of which the bulk of a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUTMEG\">nutmeg</a> was directed to be given, four, six, or eight times a day, according to the urgency of the case. The good effects of this, he tells us, have often astonished him: and when given early in the disease, he says he can depend as much upon it for the cure of an haemoptysis, as on cinchona for the cure of an intermittent. He agrees with Dr Cullen, however, that in those cases where there is any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> in the pulse, and which almost always happens, there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for venesection. A cool regimen, and quiet of body and mind, are certainly useful; but Dr Cullen observes that some kinds of gestation, such as sailing, and travelling in an easy carriage on smooth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, have often proved a remedy. When the cough is very troublesome, it is absolutely necessary to exhibit frequently a small dose of an opiate. Dr Dickson also informs us, that the nitre joined with spermaceti, or pulv. & traga-canthis comp., has produced equally good effects with the electuary above mentioned; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of which he at first considered the conserve only as a vehicle for the nitre, though he means not to insinuate that the former is totally destitute of efficacy.\n\nWhen this hemorrhage has resisted other modes of cure, and there is reason to apprehend, even from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> quantity of blood evacuated, that the patient may sink under the discharge, blisters, particularly when applied to the breast, are often had recourse to with great advantage; and the sulphuric acid, properly diluted,\nluted, both as an astringent and refrigerant, is often employed with very good effects.\n\n**PHTHISIS.**\n\n**PULMONARY CONSUMPTION.**\n\n*Phthisis, Sauv. gen. 276. Lin. 208. Vog. 319.*\n*Sag. 101. Junck. 33.*\n*Phthisis pulmonis, Boerh. 1196.*\n*Affectio phthisica, sive tabes pulmonalis, Hoffm. II. 284.*\n\n**Sp. I.

The Confirmed Phthisis,** with an expectoration of *Pus.*\n\n*Phthisis confirmata auctorum.*\n*Phthisis humida, Sauv. sp. 2.*\n\nSometimes, notwithstanding all the care that can be taken, the haemoptysis will degenerate into a phthisis pulmonalis, or consumption of the lungs; and sometimes haemoptysis will be the consequence of this dangerous disorder. It has indeed been supposed, that an ulceration of the lungs, or phthisis, was the natural and almost necessary consequence of haemoptysis: but according to Dr Cullen, this is in general a mistake; for there are many instances of a haemoptysis from external violence without being followed by any ulceration. The same thing has often been observed where the haemoptysis arose from an internal cause; and this not only in young persons, when the disease returned for several times, but when it has often recurred during the course of a long life; and it may easily be conceived, that a rupture of the vessels of the lungs, as well as of the vessels of the nose, may be sometimes healed. The causes of phthisis, therefore, Dr Cullen reduces to five heads. 1. A haemoptysis. 2. A suppuration of the lungs in consequence of a pneumonia. 3. A catarrh. 4. An asthma; and, 5. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">Tubercles</a>.\n\n1. When a phthisis arises from a haemoptysis, it is probable that it is occasioned by particular circumstances; and what these circumstances are, may not always be easily known. It is possible, that merely the degree of rupture, or frequently repeated rupture, preventing the wound from healing, may occasion an ulcer; or it is possible, that red blood effused, and not brought up entirely by coughing, may, by stagnating in the bronchiae, become acid, and erode the parts. But these hypotheses are not supported by any certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>; and from many observations we are led to think, that several other circumstances must concur in producing the disease from haemoptysis.\n\n2. The second cause of an ulceration of the lungs mentioned above is a suppuration formed in consequence of pneumonia. When a pneumonia, with symptoms neither very violent nor very slight, has continued for many days, it is to be feared it will end in a suppuration; but this is not to be determined by the number of days; for, not only after the fourth, but even after the tenth day, there have been examples of a pneumonia ending by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>; and if the disease has suffered some intermission, and again recurred, there may be instances of a resolution happening at a much later period from the beginning of the disease than that now mentioned. But if a moderate disease, in spite of proper remedies employed, be protracted to the 14th day without any considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a>, a suppuration is pretty certainly to be expected; and it will be more certain still, if no signs of resolution have appeared, or if an expectoration which had appeared shall have again ceased, and the difficulty of breathing has continued or increased, while the other symptoms have been rather abated.\n\nThat in a pneumonia, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> is made which may lay the foundation of a suppuration, may be concluded from the difficulty of breathing becoming greater when the patient is in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> posture, or when the patient can lie more easily on the affected side. That, in such cases, a suppuration is actually begun, may be inferred from the patient's being frequently affected with slight cold shiverings, and with a sense of cold felt sometimes in one sometimes in another part of the body. We form the same conclusion also from the state of the pulse, which is commonly less frequent and softer, but sometimes quicker than before. That a suppuration is already formed, may be inferred from there being a considerable remission of the pain which had before subsisted; while with this the cough, and especially the dyspnoea, continue, and are rather increased. At the same time the frequency of the pulse is rather increased, the feverish state suffers considerable exacerbations every evening, and by degrees a hectic fever in all its circumstances comes to be formed.\n\nIn this state of symptoms, we conclude very confidently, that an abscess, or, as it is called, a vomica, is formed in some part of the pleura, and most frequently in that portion of it investing the lungs. Here purulent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> frequently remains for some time, as if enclosed in a cyst; but commonly not long before it comes to be either absorbed and transferred to some other part of the body, or breaks through into the cavity of the lungs, or into that of the thorax. In the latter case it produces the disease called empyema; but it is when the matter is poured into the cavity of the bronchi\u00e6 that it properly constitutes the phthisis pulmonalis. In the case of empyema, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> circumstances of a phthisis are indeed also present: but we shall here consider only that case in which the abscess of the lungs gives occasion to purulent expectoration.\n\nAn abscess of the lungs, in consequence of pneumonia, is not always followed by a phthisis: for sometimes a hectic fever is not formed; the matter poured into the bronchie is a proper and benign pus, which frequently is coughed up very readily, and spit out; and though this purulent expectoration should continue for some time, if it be without hectic fever, the ulcer soon heals, and every morbid symptom disappears. This has so frequently happened, that we may conclude, that neither the access of the air, nor the constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the lungs, will prevent an ulcer of these parts from healing, if the matter of it be well-conditioned. An abscess of the lungs, therefore, does not necessarily produce phthisis pulmonalis; and if it be followed by such a disease, it must be in consequence of particular circumstances which corrupt the purulent\npurulent matter; produced, render it unsuitable to the healing of the ulcer, and at the same time make it afford an acrimony, which, absorbed, produces a hectic fever and its consequences.\n\nThe corruption of the matter of such abscesses may be owing to several causes; as, 1. That the matter effused during the inflammation had not been a pure serum fit to be converted into a laudable pus, but had been joined with other matters which prevented that, and gave a considerable acrimony to the whole. Or, 2. That the matter effused and converted into pus, merely by long stagnation in a vomica, or by its connexion with an empyema, had been so corrupted as to become unfit for the purpose of pus in the healing of the ulcer. These seem to be possible causes of the corruption of matter in abscesses, so as to make it the occasion of a phthisis in persons otherwise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>; but it is probable that a pneumonic abscess especially produces phthisis when it happens to persons previously disposed to that disease, and therefore only as concurring with some other causes of it.\n\n3. The third cause supposed to produce a phthisis is a catarrh; which, in many cases, seems in length of time to have the expectoration of mucus proper to it gradually changed to an expectoration of pus; and at the same time, by the addition of a hectic fever, the disease, which was at first a pure catarrh, is changed into a phthisis. But this supposition is, in the opinion at least of some physicians, liable to several difficulties. The catarrh is properly an affection of the mucous glands of the trachea and bronchiae, analogous to the coryza and less violent kinds of cynanche tonsillaris, which very seldom end in suppuration. And although a catarrh should be supposed to do so, the ulcer produced might readily heal up, as it does in the case of a cynanche tonsillaris; and therefore should not produce a phthisis.\n\nFarther, The catarrh, as purely the effect of cold, is generally a mild disease as well as of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>; and, according to Dr Cullen, there are at most but very few of the numerous cases of it, which can be said to have ended in a phthisis. In all these cases in which this seems to have happened, he thinks it probable that the persons affected were peculiarly predisposed to phthisis; and the beginning of phthisis so often resembles a catarrh, that it may have been mistaken for such a disease. It often happens also, to increase the fallacy, that the application of cold, which is the most frequent cause of catarrh, is also frequently the exciting cause of the cough, which proves to be the beginning of a phthisis.\n\nMany physicians have supposed that an acrimony of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> eroding some of the vessels of the lungs is a frequent cause of ulceration and phthisis; but this appears to Dr Cullen to be a mere supposition. He acknowledges, that in many cases in acrimony subsisting in some part of the fluids is the cause of the disease; but observes that it is at the same time probable, that this acrimony operates by producing tubercles, rather than by any direct erosion.\n\nBut, notwithstanding these objections, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> affords numerous examples of cases in which a disease long subsisting under the form of catarrh has at last degenerated into phthisis, and proved fatal from supervening hectic fever. It must, however, at the same time be allowed, that catarrh, degenerating into a phthisis chronic state after subsisting for many years, has of itself often proved fatal without inducing phthisis.\n\n4. If phthisis does not frequently follow catarrh, it is still more rarely a consequence of asthma. Innumerable examples are unquestionably afforded of that disease subsisting for many years without any symptom whatever of phthisis as a consequence of it. But, at the same time, there are unquestionable examples of phthisis deriving its origin from asthma; which, however, probably happens only in cases where a peculiar state of the lungs at the same time takes place. But, without the concurrence of asthma, this state would not of itself have been sufficient for inducing the affection.\n\n5. Of all the causes formerly mentioned, phthisis most frequently arises from tubercles. Dr Simmons informs us, that he has had opportunities of inspecting the bodies of many people who died in this way, and never found them totally absent. He has likewise seen them in subjects of different ages, who had been troubled with no symptoms of an affection of the breast during their lifetime. In these, however, they were small, and few in number. This proves that they may exist without inconvenience till they begin to disturb the functions of the lungs by their size and number; or till some degree of inflammation be excited, either by accidental causes, or by certain changes that take place within their substance; for as yet we know but little of their true nature. These little tumours vary in their consistence; in some they are composed of a pulpy substance, and in others approach more to the nature of scirrhus. They are most commonly formed in consequence of a certain constitutional predisposition; but whatever is capable of occasioning a morbid irritability of the lungs seems also to be capable of generating them. Thus the spasmodic asthma frequently ends in tubercles and consumption; and it is not unusual for millers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>-cutters, and others, to die consumptive, from their being so constantly exposed to dust, which in these cases probably acts by producing similar concretions: Dr Kirkland observes, that scythe-grinders are subject to a disease of the lungs, from particles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> mixing with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> dust, which among themselves they call the grinders rot. Tubercles, however, in by much the greater number of instances, have their source from a scrophulous disposition; and some eminent physicians have supposed that the generality of pulmonary consumptions are of this kind. This notion, however, they have perhaps carried too far: they have probably been misled by those tuberculous concretions which, without good reason, have been supposed to be diseased glands, and of course analogous to the glandular affections we meet with in the scrophula. Tubercles may likewise sometimes be owing to the sudden repulsion of cutaneous eruptions, or of the matter of exanthemata, &c. or to other causes.\n\nThe persons who are most liable to consumption are those of a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>, fine and soft skin, florid cheeks, and a slender make; with high cheek-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, hollow temples, long neck, shoulders standing out like wings, narrow chest, and a remarkable prominence of the processes of the os sacrum. To these marks we may add, that of sound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, which, as the disease advances,\nvances, usually become of a milky white colour, and more or less transparent. Of those who are carried off by this disease, Dr Simmons asserts, the greater number will be found never to have had a carious tooth. This circumstance, however, does not seem to us to hold so generally as Dr Simmons is disposed to imagine: and instances not unfrequently occur of patients dying of phthisis, although they have had many teeth subjected to caries; and some of these beginning even at an early period of life.\n\nPersons of the above description often remain for a long time without feeling any other inconvenience than some oppression at the breast in moist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, or in hot apartments. Their breathing is easily hurried, sometimes by the slightest motion; and they become languid, paler, and thinner. All this time, however, they feel no heat or painful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> in the breast. As the evil increases, the patient begins to be attacked with a slight, frequent, and dry cough, which is most troublesome in the night time. But this, by proper care, is often relieved; and the patient remains in this state for a considerable time, and even for many years, if he be sensible of his danger, and careful to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against it by a suitable manner of living. More commonly, however, we find the cough increasing, and sometimes accompanied with more or less catarrh. This is usually ascribed to cold; and but too generally neglected, till the disease becomes alarming by its obstinacy and its effects. This may be considered as the beginning, or first period, of the disease. During this stage, the cough is sometimes dry from the first; and sometimes when it begins in the form of a catarrh, is attended with more or less expectoration of mucus.\n\nWhen the cough begins in the form of a catarrh, and appears to be occasioned by an increased secretion of a thin saltish mucus irritating the membrane of the trachea, all judicious practitioners agree in recommending an attention to regimen, the free use of diluting liquors, bland emulsions, small doses of nitre, the taking away a few ounces of blood if there be much inflammation, the inhaling the steams of warm water by means of the machine contrived for that purpose, and the occasional use of such a dose of elixir paregoricum as will be sufficient to allay the irritation of the bronchia, and to promote a general moisture on the skin. These methods will generally be found to be efficacious, especially if the patient's chamber be of a moderate temperature, and he carefully avoid exposure to a cold, damp, or raw air, till the complaint be removed. In cases in which the cough has been obstinate, and the inflammatory symptoms considerable, Dr Simmons has often experienced the great advantages of the warm bath, the heat of which did not exceed 92\u00b0. When this is had recourse to, the patient should remain in it only a very few minutes, and go soon afterwards to bed; but not with a view to force a sweat by an increased weight of bedclothes, as is too often injudiciously practised.\n\nPatients of a consumptive habit, who have had an attack of this kind at the beginning of winter, are particularly liable to a return of the complaint during the continuance of the cold season, on the slightest occasion and with greater violence. A relapse is therefore to be carefully guarded against; and nothing will be found to do this more effectually than the use of socks and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> under-waistcoat. The use of flannel has been condemned by several medical writers as increasing the insensible perspiration; but in the present case, to say nothing of some others in which it may be useful, it will in general be found to have the best effects. It will prevent a too great determination to the lungs, and should not be left off till the approach of summer. In some few instances in which flannel was found to have a disagreeable effect, a piece of dimity worn over the breast next the skin, will prevent the return of colds and coughs in persons of a delicate habit, who had before been liable to them on the slightest occasions. Shirts made of cotton cloth are much more effectual than linen in preserving an equable temperature of the surface, and guarding against the action of external cold; while at the same time they are much more pleasant to most people than even the finest flannel. In these cases, circumstances that are seemingly of the most trifling nature become of importance.\n\nSometimes the cough is occasioned by an immediate inflammation of some part of the lungs, from some of the usual causes of inflammation; and when this happens, no time is to be lost in removing it. To do this will perhaps require more than one bleeding, together with a strict attention to a cooling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of diet, diluting drinks, the inhalation of warm steams, and if convenient, the use of the warm bath; but, above all, the speedy application of a large blister as near as may be to the supposed seat of the inflammation. The cough, in this case, will often remain after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> complaint is abated. A prudent use of opiates at bedtime, either by themselves or combined with gummy and mucilaginous medicines, will then generally be useful as a sedative and antispasmodic.\n\nIn this, as well as in the catarrhal cough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> now mentioned, many practitioners are too eager to administer cinchona, with the view, as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> it, of bringing up the patient: but this never fails to increase the cough, and of course to do great and very irreparable mischief.\n\nAnd here it will not be foreign to our subject to observe, that a symptomatic cough, which has its rise not from catarrh, or from an immediate inflammation of the lungs, but from their sympathy with the stomach, has sometimes laid the foundation of phthisis, from its having been mistaken, and of course improperly treated. It seems to be owing to a redundancy or vitiated state of the bile, or to some affection of the stomach, which it is perhaps not easy to define. It is sometimes a concomitant of other bilious symptoms; and when this happens to be the case, it cannot easily be mistaken; but we sometimes find it occurring singly, and in general attacking persons of a sedentary life. Dr Stoll of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, who has noticed this cough, has very properly given it the name of tussis stomacchica. This complaint is so far from being relieved by bleeding, that it constantly grows worse after it, especially if the evacuation be in any considerable quantity. The oily remedies seldom fail to exasperate this cough, which at first is dry, frequent, and often extremely violent, but which seldom fails to give way to one or two gentle pukes, and the occasional use of mild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a>. The cough, as in other cases, often continues from habit after the cause\nthat gave rise to it has been removed, and may then be checked by opiates.\n\nWhen the disease has been neglected, or our attempts to remove it in the beginning have failed, both of which circumstances but too frequently happen, the patient begins to complain of a soreness, and of slight lancinating pains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> through the breast, sometimes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the mediastinum, and sometimes confined chiefly to one side. The soreness is pretty constant, and much increased by the cough. The pain in the side often prevents the patient from lying on the side affected; and this inability of lying except on one side, frequently occurs even when no such pain is felt. In this stage of the disease, flushing heats are felt on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet: the breathing is short and laborious; and it is not long before the patient begins to expectorate a thin and frothy phlegm, at first in small quantities, coughed up with difficulty, and some pain of the breast, and now and then streaked with blood: this may be considered as the inflammatory period of the disease, to which succeeds the suppurative stage. In the latter, the expectoration becomes more copious and purulent, the breath proportionably offensive, and the exacerbations of the hectic fever more considerable: an increased quickness of the pulse comes on about the middle of the day; but the most considerable paroxysm of the fever is at night, and at first continues till towards morning, commonly till three or four o'clock, when it terminates in a sweat, which usually begins upon the breast. As the disease advances, these sweats become more profuse, and sometimes come on almost as soon as the pulse begins to quicken, but without affording any relief to the patient. During the exacerbations, we observe a circumscribed redness of the cheeks, while the rest of the face is pale, and appears as if it were not clean washed. The costiveness that commonly accompanies the beginning of the disease is usually succeeded by a diarrhoea; the spitting lessens, and all the purulent matter seems to be carried downwards. The wasting of the fat and the loss of nourishment occasion the nails to curve inwards, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> to fall off, and the eyes to sink in their sockets. In the mean time, the legs commonly swell; till at length <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> closes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> which is melancholy to all but the patient himself, who in general continues sensible to the last moment, and even then indulges a vain hope of prolonging a miserable existence. In some cases, and that not unfrequently, a delirium comes on towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the disease.\n\nThe hectic fever that attends this and some other chronic diseases, is evidently the effect of acrimony, and most commonly of pus absorbed and carried into the circulation. The nature of this acrimony, and the different irritability of different patients, are probably the sources of the variety we observe in fevers of this denomination; a variety which is doubtless much greater than we are aware of. Thus we find that the matter of the smallpox excites a fever of this kind; but this secondary fever, as it is called, differs from the hectic attendant on consumptions; nor does the latter correspond with that which sometimes accompanies the suppuration of a cancerous ulcer. In the pulmonary consumption, or at least in the third stage of it, the fever induced often appears to be of the putrid kind, and has been denominated febris hectica putrida by the judicious Morton, who considers it as being combined with a peri-pneumonic or inflammatory fever, which recurs as often as fresh tubercles begin to inflame. For although we have named one period of the disease the inflammatory, and another the suppurative period, yet we are not to suppose that the latter is exempt from inflammation. While matter is poured into the bronchiae, or absorbed and carried into the system from one part of the lungs, other parts are in a crude state of inflammation, or advancing towards suppuration; so that, on examining the lungs of persons who die consumptive, we find some tubercles that are small and just formed, some that are large and full of matter, and others that are in a state of ulceration. This easily accounts for the occasional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of inflammatory symptoms with those of the putrid hectic. When the matter absorbed is a laudable pus, as in the case of the psoas abscess, we find the form of the hectic fever differing from either of those we have mentioned.\n\nCure. In these different periods of the disease, the curative indications are sufficiently obvious. To prevent the formation of fresh tubercles; to obviate the inflammation of those already formed; to promote their resolution; to allay morbid irritability, the cough, and other troublesome symptoms; and, above all, to check the tendency to the hectic state, are the views that every rational physician proposes to himself in the treatment of the genuine consumption. We know of no medicines that can exert their specific effects upon the lungs by dissolving tuberculous concretions; nor is it probable, from what we know of the animal economy, that any such will ever be discovered. Yet medicines that operate in a general manner upon the system, may, by promoting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a>, and diminishing the determination to the lungs, tend to disperse tubercles, or to prevent their formation. There are not wanting instances of wonderful recoveries, in cases where the evil was supposed to be beyond the power of physic; and in some, where nature was left to herself; so that a physician who has observed the various and powerful resources nature has within herself, will be very cautious how he asserts, that a disease is incurable.\n\nThe most formidable effects of ulcerated lungs are the absorption and consequent hectic. It seems evident, that, in many cases, death is brought on by this, rather than by the lungs themselves being rendered unfit for the purposes of respiration. So that if we can obviate the effects of the absorption, diminish the preternatural determination to the lungs, and fulfil the other general indications just now mentioned, we may very often enable nature to recover herself. It may be alleged, indeed, that the physicians art has hitherto proved very unsuccessful in these cases; but may not this be owing to the remedies that are employed being very often such as are inimical to the cure?\n\nThe cinchona is, perhaps, the most commonly employed of any, and often confided in as an ultimate resource in these cases. But besides this, the sulphuric acid, the balsams, and frequent bleeding, have each had their partizans. The use of blisters and issues, opiates, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> and vegetable diet, exercise, and change of air, are pretty generally recommended by all. Concerning cinchona, Dessault long ago observed, that it had been productive...\nproductive of great mischief in consumptive cases; and Dr Fothergill, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> lately published by him on this subject, very judiciously remarks, that it is so far from curing the hectic fever arising from distempered lungs, that according to the best of his observations, it not only takes up that time which might probably have been better employed in the use of other medicines, but for the most part aggravates the disease beyond remedy. Indeed it has been the opinion of several attentive observers, that whenever pus or any kind of matter excites an hectic fever, by being absorbed and carried into the circulation, the cinchona will never fail to exasperate the complaint, especially if it be accompanied with any degree of inflammatory diathesis, unless the matter has a free outlet from the system; as in the case of abscesses, for instance, in which we often find it productive of excellent effects. It is likewise well known to be used as a tonic, to obviate the effects of fluor albus, or any other immoderate evacuation in delicate persons, which, by enfeebling the system, very often lays the foundation of phthisis: but the moment we have reason to suspect that the lungs are ulcerated, especially if this ulceration be attended with an inflammatory disposition; or if the separation of vitiated pus be the consequence of a peculiar increased morbid action of the vessels at the part, it ought to be laid aside; and in the genuine tuberculous consumption, perhaps, it is rarely admissible.\n\nDr Fothergill, however, observes, that there are two causes of consumption, which often produce symptoms so similar to those of the genuine phthisis, as sometimes to have led him to make use of cinchona, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> tendencies to a genuine pulmonary consumption, with advantage.\n\nOne of the causes is, the suckling of children longer than is consistent with the mother's ability. This case frequently occurs among the middling and lower classes of females, of constitutions naturally delicate and tender. In such a state of weakness, some slight cold brings on a cough, which increases gradually, till at length it produces the true pulmonary consumption. Here, cinchona given early, in moderate doses, and merely as a tonic remedy, is often of excellent use.\n\nAnother cause, is any weakening discharge, either from abscesses, the greater operations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SURGERY\">surgery</a>, a copious and constant fluor albus, or similar enfeebling evacuations. That cinchona is, for the most part, of use in these cases, when the lungs are not inflamed, is indubitable; and if they be so affected, but not beyond a certain degree, it is also efficacious in preventing the progress of the consumption.\n\nIn phthisical complaints succeeding such situations, a prudent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of cinchona seems necessary. Small doses of the decoction, either alone, or joined with the saline mixture or such other additions as the physician thinks proper, may be given. But if the breath becomes more tight and oppressed, the cough dry, the pulse more quick and hard, and especially if slight transitory pains or stitches about the thorax are more frequently complained of, a perseverance in the use of cinchona will increase the disease. If such also should be the appearances in the progress of the disease, or, from whatever cause, if cinchona be accompanied with such effects, the use of it ought to be withheld.\n\nIf, on the other hand, no pain, tightness, or oppression, is perceived, and there appear a manifest abatement of the symptoms, it will be advisable to proceed. The administration of this medicine, however, requires a judicious observer; and it ought neither to be given in the early inflammatory stage of this disease, nor be continued in any subsequent period, if it produce the effects above mentioned.\n\nBy its tonic virtues it will often enable nature to conquer many difficulties. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of this remark, Dr Fothergill farther observes, that he has seen it of use in promoting expectoration, when this became deficient from want of strength towards the end of peri-pneumonic fevers; but that it stops this discharge, changes slight wandering pains into such as are fixed, and increases them with all their consequences, in a variety of cases.\n\nThe elixir of vitriol, or the sulphuric acid properly diluted, though in many instances a highly useful remedy, is often exhibited in consumptive cases with no less impropriety than cinchona. This medicine, from its astringency, is obviously improper in the inflammatory state of the disease. But in the latter stage, when a general tendency to putrefaction takes place, it is serviceable in resisting the effect; it restrains the colliquative sweats; and if the lungs be not injured past reparation, it is allowed to be a very useful auxiliary.\n\nVarious are the opinions concerning the efficacy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a> water in this disease. The experienced author last mentioned informs us, that he has seen many persons recover from pulmonary diseases after drinking these waters, whose cure seemed to be doubtful from any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>; and he thinks this circumstance, added to the general reputation of Bristol waters in phthisical cases, affords sufficient inducement to recommend the trial of them in the early stages of such complaints. It is, however, before the approach of a confirmed phthisis that patients ought to repair to Bristol; otherwise a journey thither will not only be without benefit, but may even prove detrimental.\n\nSome have imagined, that the journey, a better air, change of situation and of objects, have contributed to the patient's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>; and these may doubtless be of advantage. It seems, however, that the water drank fresh at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>, actually contains principles conducive to the recovery of patients affected with phthisical complaints. It seems to possess a slight calcareous stypticity, and perhaps the air it contains may also have an antiseptic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. On the whole, it appears to be an efficacious medicine, and is often found of remarkable benefit to consumptive patients.\n\nChange of air, particularly from bad to good, is of great consequence to all chronic diseases of the lungs. In consumptive cases, the air of all large cities is found to be particularly injurious.\n\nA sea voyage has been much recommended in the cure of this disease. The benefit of exercise has also been strongly urged by many writers; but, however salutary when properly used, it certainly ought to be regulated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>. Dr Dickson declares himself of opinion, that riding on horseback in consumptive cases is most commonly hurtful, without such regulations\nas in general have been little regarded. For instance, he has known a person who, by a ride of an hour or two in the morning, was very much recruited, and who, at another time, in the afternoon and evening, without undergoing more bodily motion, has returned faint and languid, and apparently worse. This observation on the same person has been so frequently made, as to point out clearly the times when this exercise shall not do hurt in consumptive cases. In this disease, the pulse, however calm in the morning, becomes more frequent in the afternoon and night, attended with heat and other feverish symptoms. Exercise therefore, at this time, can only add to the mischief of the fever. For this reason he prudently recommends to all hectic persons, especially those who shall travel to distant places on account of a better air, or the benefit expected from any particular water, that their travelling should be slow, confined to a very few hours, and only in the morning.\n\nExercise on horseback seems to be chiefly beneficial in those cases where consumption is a secondary disease. For example, in the nervous atrophy; in the hypochondriacal consumption; or when it is the effect of long-continued intermittents, or of congestions in any of the abdominal viscera; or, in a word, whenever the consumption is not attended with an inflamed or ulcerated state of the lungs, long journeys on horseback will be beneficial. Such a practice may likewise be highly useful in obviating an attack of phthisis, or in carrying off a dry husky cough in a person of a consumptive habit, when there is reason to suppose that no tubercles are as yet formed. On the other hand, in the confirmed phthisis, when the lungs are inflamed or ulcerated, much or violent exercise will be improper; and there have been instances where the death of the patient was evidently accelerated by it. The exercise therefore should be gentle, proportioned to the strength of the patient, and employed only in the morning. In fine weather, an easy open carriage is perhaps the most eligible, not only on account of its being open to the air, but because it affords that kind of agitation which is most wanted in these cases. For if we consider the different modes of exercise, we shall find that walking, though the best exercise in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, as it employs the most muscles, is the worst for the sickly, who should have the benefit of exercise without fatigue. Riding on horseback agitates the viscera more than walking, and is therefore preferable to it in many chronic diseases; but when a premature determination to the lungs has taken place, it will be liable to increase the evil, and may likewise be hurtful by the fatigue that attends it. For these reasons it will be prudent to begin with a carriage; and if the patient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> strength, and the disease abates, recourse may afterwards be had to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-exercise.\n\nThe gentle motion of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COACH\">coach</a> has been often found of great utility in pulmonary complaints. Its efficacy seems to depend chiefly on its increasing the determination to the surface of the body. The nausea which this motion excites in some persons is an effect of this increased determination. It has therefore been found beneficial in haemoptysis; and Dr Simmons mentions the case of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, who, after trying various remedies to no purpose, was cured of this complaint by travelling several hundred miles through different parts of England in her own coach. At first, whenever she remained three or four days in any place, the disorder began to return again; but at length by persevering in her journeys, it gradually went off. Dessault, who practised at Bordeaux about 40 years ago, tells us, he sent several consumptive patients to Bareges, and with good success; but that in these cases his reliance was not so much upon the Bareges waters, as upon the motion of the carriage and the change of air in a journey of more than 100 leagues.\n\nIt is now pretty generally acknowledged, that the good effects of sea voyages in consumptive cases depend more upon the constant and uniform motion of the ship, than upon any particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">impregnation</a> of the sea air; although this from its coolness and purity may likewise be of great use, especially in the hot months, when sea voyages are generally undertaken by consumptive patients. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> were no strangers to this remedy; and amongst the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> it was no unusual thing for consumptive persons to sail to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>. Pliny observes, that this was not done for the sake of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, but merely on account of the length of the voyage.\n\nMany of our English physicians have recommended a voyage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a> in these cases. When this is done, the proper season of the year should be carefully attended to. Dr Simmons knew a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who went thither with symptoms of incipient phthisis, and who experienced some relief during the course of the voyage; but happening to arrive at Lisbon at the beginning of the rainy season, the disease was soon greatly increased, and terminated fatally.\n\nAnother species of motion has of late been extolled as highly useful in consumptive cases. Dr James Carmichael Smyth of London, has lately published an account of the effects of swinging, employed as a remedy in the pulmonary consumption and hectic fever. In this treatise Dr Smyth contends, that sea air, in place of being of advantage, is constantly prejudicial to hectic and consumptive patients, and even to those who have a tendency to such complaints. He thinks, therefore, that the benefit derived from sea voyages must certainly be referred to some other cause. In stating his sentiments on this subject, he attempts to establish a distinction between exercise and motion. By exercise, he understands muscular action, or the exertion of the locomotive powers of the body either alone or combined. This he represents as increasing the force and frequency of the heart's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a>, the velocity and momentum of the blood, the quickness of breathing, the heat, the irritability, and the transpiration of the whole body. By motion, in contradistinction to exercise, he means such motion as is not necessarily accompanied with any agitation or succussion of the body, and which is totally independent of any muscular exertion. The effects of this, both on the heart, the lungs, and indeed on the system in general, he considers as of the sedative kind; thus it suspends the action of coughing, and lessens the frequency of the pulse. He is, therefore, led to refer the good effects of sea voyages entirely to this cause. And on these grounds he was led to conclude, that the motion given by swinging might be of equal if not greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. This conclusion, we are told, in the treatise above alluded to, experience in many cases\ncases has fully confirmed; and he recommends it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of cure which may be employed with advantage in every stage of phthisis. While, however, the reasoning of Dr Smyth on this subject seems to be liable to many objections, we are sorry to add, that his observations in practice have by no means been confirmed by those of others, who have had recourse to this mode of cure.\n\nThe best adapted diet in consumptive cases is milk; the milk of asses, both as an article of diet and as a medicine, has in particular been highly extolled. It may however be remarked, that there are constitutions in which this salutary nutriment seems to disagree. A propensity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> bile, or too strong a disposition to ascendency from a weakness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGESTIVE\">digestive</a> organs, both merit attention. Whey, either from cows or goats milk, appears to be more suitable in the former case; and for correcting acidity, lime water may be added to the milk. The method of adding rum or brandy to asses or cows milk, should be used with great caution: for when added beyond a certain quantity, as is often the case, they not only coagulate the milk, but heat the body; by which means the milk disagrees with the patient, and the spirit augments the disease.\n\nIn consumptive cases, Dr Simmons observes, that the patient's taste should be consulted; and says that a moderate use of animal food, where the salted and high-seasoned kinds are avoided, is not to be denied. Shellfish, particularly oysters, are useful, as well as snails swallowed whole, or boiled in milk.\n\nRepeated bleedings, in small quantities, are by some considered in consumptive cases as highly advantageous; and in particular circumstances they undoubtedly are so; for instance, when the constitution apparently abounds with blood; when the fluid drawn off is extremely sity; when there is much pain in the breast; and when venesection is followed by an abatement of every symptom. In these cases, bleeding is certainly proper, and ought to be repeated so long as it seems to be attended with advantage. In very delicate constitutions, however, even where the pulse is quick, with some degree of fulness, and the blood last drawn considerably sity, it may not prove serviceable.\n\nIt deserves to be remarked, that the inflammatory appearance of the blood is not alone a sufficient reason for bleeding; but, in determining the propriety of this evacuation, all other circumstances should be considered; such as the patient's age, strength, habit, and the state of the disease.\n\nA remark which has been judiciously made by Dr Fothergill, ought not to be omitted in the account of this disease. It is, that young delicate females, about the age of 15 or 16, and upwards, are often subject to consumptions. When the disease has advanced considerably, the menses, if they have made their appearance, most generally cease. This alarms their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> friends, and they call upon the physician to use his utmost endeavours for restoring the discharge; believing the cessation of it to be the immediate cause of the phthisical complaint. Induced by their solicitations, medicines have sometimes been administered, which, without obtaining this end, have tended to aggravate the distemper. This deficiency is often of no real disadvantage in those cases; and in many the evacuation would prove injurious, by diminishing the strength, which is already too much impaired. Even small bleedings at the regular periods have often done more harm than good. A sudden suppression may require bleeding; but when the evacuation fails through want of strength, and from poverty of blood, the renewal of it increases the disease.\n\nBesides these remedies, Dr Simmons strongly recommends a frequent repetition of vomits. Many physicians have supposed, that where there is any increased determination to the lungs, vomits do mischief; but Dr Simmons is persuaded, that instead of augmenting, they diminish this determination; and that much good may be expected from a prudent use of this remedy, than which none has a more general or powerful effect on the system. If any remedy be capable of dispersing a tubercle, he believes it to be emetics. The affections of the liver, that sometimes accompany pulmonary complaints, give way to repeated emetics sooner than to any other remedy. In several cases where the cough and the matter expectorated, the flushing heats, loss of appetite, and other symptoms, threatened the most fatal event; the complaints were greatly relieved, and in others wholly removed, by the frequent use of emetics. Other suitable remedies were indeed employed at the same time; but the relief the patients generally experienced after the emetic, was a sufficient proof of its salutary operation. By this, however, he does not mean that vomits will be useful in every period of the disease, or in every patient. In general, it will be found that the earlier in the disease emetics are had recourse to, the more likely they will be to do good, and the less likely to do harm. The cases in which emetics may be reckoned improper, are commonly those in which the disease is rapid in its progress; or in that stage of it when there is great debility, with profuse colliquative sweats.\n\nIn these cases, when an emetic has been administered twice a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, and the cough is mitigated, the expectoration facilitated, and the other symptoms relieved, both the patient and the physician will be encouraged to proceed, and to repeat the vomit every second day, or even every day, for several days together, as Dr Simmons has sometimes done when the good effects of it were obvious.","sp":388,"ep":401},{"h":"ROMAN COINS","t":"A\n\nA.

If they be desirous of drinking, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of odd gesticulations before they can bring the cup to their mouths, because their arms are drawn this way and that by the convulsions which affect them.\n\nCauses, &c. The general cause of St Vitus's dance is a debility of the system; and hence we find it attacks only weakly boys, and more especially girls, when under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of puberty. But the particular causes determining the muscles to be affected in such and such a manner are entirely unknown.\n\nPrognosis. As this disorder scarce ever attacks any persons but such as are under the age of puberty, there is almost a certain prospect of its being then cured, though generally the disorder is easily removed before that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>.\n\nChorea, however, in some instances, proves an obstinate affection; but is hardly in any instance attended with danger.\n\nCure. It has hitherto been almost universally the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> practice to treat this disease with antispasmodics and tonics, particularly opium, hyoscyamus, valerian, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a>, preparations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>; and under the use of these the disease has, in general, been removed. But Dr James <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, senior physician to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Infirmary of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, in a treatise which he has lately published on the use of purgative medicines, has recommended a very different practice in this disease, the use, viz. of brisk <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a>: these he advises to be repeated daily for some time. The great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, however, which he has in view, is not to evacuate from the system, but to produce a thorough and complete evacuation of the intestinal canal. He finds, that by the first doses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>-coloured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> are discharged; and he recommends that the use of the purgatives should be persisted in till the stools assume a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> appearance. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of the utility of this practice, he has related several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> in which it produced a speedy and complete cure; and equal success has attended this practice when directed by several others. There can therefore be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> hesitation in recommending it at least in every obstinate instance of chorea.\n\nGENUS LII.

According to Sauvages, this distemper begins with a lassitude of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, transient colds and shiverings, pain of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and anxieties of the precordia. Then come on spasmodic startings of the fingers and feet; also of the tendons and muscles, conspicuous below the skin. The disease is attended with hiccup, fever, delirium, stupor, constriction of the breast, suffocating dyspnoea, loss of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, horrid convulsions of the limbs, preceded by a formication, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> as of ants or other small insects creeping on the parts. In this state of the disease, the convulsive paroxysms are attended with most violent pains in the limbs, vomiting, or diarrhoea, with the passing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, thirst, and in young people an unnatural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>. It continues from ten days to three months. About the eleventh or twentieth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, some are relieved by copious sweats, or purple exanthemata: while others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into a tabes, with stupor, or stiffness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>.\n\nCauses, &c. This disease is frequently epidemic in Swabia and other parts of Germany; where it is said to be produced by seeds of radishes, which are often mixed with rye in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and from this supposed cause the disease takes its name. It is also, however, a very common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that this disease depends on the rye used in diet being of a bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, and particularly containing a large proportion of what is called spurred rye.\n\nCure. In this affection, the cure, as far as it has yet been discovered, is very much the same with that of epilepsy, the disease next to be considered. But from what has been said of the advantages derived from the use of purgatives in chorea, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of them also in cases of raphania.\nGENUS LIII. EPILEPSIA.","sp":432,"ep":433},{"h":"THESE WERE THE ONLY","t":"e were the only means recommended by the practitioners mentioned above for opposing this formidable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>: but Dr Smyth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> has, we are told, discovered that it may be certainly cured by issues, of which Dr Macbride gives the following instance.\n\n\"A. B. a tall well-made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> than otherwise; of healthy parents, except that there had been a little gout in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>; temperate; being very attentive to the business of his trade (that of a watchmaker), led a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> uncommonly sedentary; had, from his boyhood upwards, been remarkably subject to alarming inflammations of his throat, which seized him, at least, once in the course of the year; in all other respects well.\n\n\"In 1767, (then 48 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a>), he was taken, without any evident cause, with a sudden and very dispiriting throbbing under the sternum. It soon afterwards increased, and returned upon him every third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, accompanied with great anxiety; very laborious breathing, choking, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> of fulness and distention in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, a bloated and flushed countenance, turgid and watery eyes, and a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and unequal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>. The paroxysm invaded...\"\nvaded, almost constantly, while he was sitting at dinner: now and then he was seized with it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, when walking a little faster than usual; and was then obliged to stop, and rest on any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. Once or twice it came on in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>; but did not oblige him to sit up, as it was then attended with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great difficulty in breathing. In the afternoon fits, his greatest ease was from a supine posture; in which he used to continue motionless for some hours, until quite spent and worn out with anguish, he dropt into a slumber. In the intervals between these attacks, which at length grew so frequent as to return every fourth or fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, he was to appearance in perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>.\n\nThus matters <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for more than two years; and various antispasmodics were ineffectually tried for his relief. In 1769, there supervened a very sharp constrictory pain at the upper end of the sternum, stretching equally on each side, attended with the former symptoms of anxiety, dyspnea, choking, &c., and with an excruciating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRAMP\">cramp</a>, as he called it, that could be covered with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>-piece, in each of his arms, between the elbow and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WRIST\">wrist</a>, exactly at the insertion of the pronator teres; the rest of the limb was quite free. The fits were sometimes brought on, and always exasperated, by any agitation of mind or body. He once attempted to ride on horseback during the paroxysm; but the experiment was near proving fatal to him. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of season or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> made no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> upon him. Still, in the intervals, his health was perfectly good; except that his eyes, which before his illness were remarkably strong and clear, were now grown extremely tender: and that his sight was much impaired. He had no flatulence of stomach, and his bowels were regular.\n\nIn this situation, February 22, 1770, he applied to me for assistance. I had seen, I believe, eight or ten of these frightful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> before. Two of the patients dropt dead suddenly. They were men between 40 and 50 years of age, and of a make somewhat fleshy. The fate of the others I was not informed of; or, at least cannot now recollect.\n\nHaving found the total inefficacy of blisters and the whole class of nervous medicines in the treatment of this anomalous spasm, I thought it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to attempt the correcting or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-DRAINING\">draining</a> off of the irritating fluid in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> now before us. To this purpose, I ordered a mixture of lime-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> with a little of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> juniper-water, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> proportion of Huxham's antimonial wine: I put the patient on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, perspirable diet; and restrained him from all viscid, flatulent, and acrimonious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>. By pursuing this course, he was soon apparently mended; but after he had persisted regularly in it for at least two months, he kept for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> at a stand. I then ordered a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> to be opened on each of his thighs. Only one was made. However, as soon as it began to discharge, his amendment manifestly increased. The frequency and severity of the fits abated considerably; and he continued improving gradually, until, at the end of 18 months he was restored to perfect health: which he has enjoyed, without the least interruption, till now, except when he has been tempted (perhaps once in a twelvemonth) to transgress rules, by making a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a> on salted meat, or indulging himself in ale or rum-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNCH\">punch</a>, each of which never failed to disorder him from the beginning of his illness: and even on these occasions, he has felt no more than the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of his former sufferings; insomuch that he would despise the attack, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it did not appear to be of the same stock with his old complaint. No other cause has had the least ill effect on him.\n\nThough rum was constantly hurtful, yet punch made with a maceration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> currants in our vulgar corn-spirit, is a liquor that agrees remarkably well with him.\n\nHe never took any medicine after the issue began to discharge; and I have directed that it shall be kept open as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as he lives. The inflammations of his throat have disappeared for five years past; he has recovered the strength and clearness of his sight; and his health seems now to be entirely re-established.\"\n\nDr Macbride, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Dr Duncan, published in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Medical Commentaries, gives the following additional observations on this disease.\n\nWithin these few weeks I have, at the desire of Dr Smyth, visited, three or four times, a very ingenious man who keeps an academy in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, of about 34 years of age, who applied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> for his advice in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> last.\n\nI shall give you his symptoms as I had them from his own mouth, which appear to me to mark his case to be an angina pectoris, and as deplorable as any that I have read of. It was strongly distinguished by the exquisite constrictory pain of the sternum, extending to each of his arms as far as the insertion of the deltoid muscle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> anxiety, laborious breathing, strangling, and violent palpitation of the heart, with a most irregular pulse. The paroxysms were so frequent, that he scarcely ever escaped a day, for six or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years, without one. They were usually excited by any agitation of mind or body, thought slight. He had clear intervals of health between the fits. The distemper seems <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> in him, as he says his father was affected in the same manner some years previous to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. He has a strong gouty taint, which never showed itself in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>; and he has led a life of uncommon sedentariness, from intense application to mathematical studies, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of mind, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, even from his boyish years. These circumstances may, perhaps, account for his having been taken with this disease at so early an age as 17.\n\nA large issue was immediately opened in each of his thighs. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> afterwards he began to mend, and has gone on improving gradually. He can now run up stairs briskly, as I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> him do no later than yesterday, without hurt; can bear agitation of mind; and has no complaint, excepting a slight oppression of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, under the sternum, which he feels sometimes in a morning, immediately after dressing himself, and which he thinks is brought on by the motion used in putting on his clothes; though for a complete week preceding the day on which I saw him last, he told me that he had been entirely free from all uneasiness, and was exulting that he had not had such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of ease for these last seven years.\n\nDoctor Smyth also showed me, in his adversaria, the case of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who had been under his care in 1762, which he had forgotten when my book went\nPuerperal went to the press, and which he was reminded of the fever. other day by a visit from his patient. It was a genuine angina pectoris, brought on by a very sedentary life, and great vexation of mind, clearly marked by the exquisite pain under the sternum, that extended acutely to the upper extremities, particularly along the left arm, together with the other symptoms of dyspnoea, anxiety, palpitation of the heart, &c. recited in the case above. The disorder went off in 1762, by large spontaneous discharges from the piles, but returned upon him severely in 1765. Issues in his thighs were then recommended to him, but not made. But, whether it was by the persuasion of some friend, or of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a>, he went into a course of James's powder, in small alternative doses, combined with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASTOR\">castor</a> and asafoetida. This he persisted in for about six weeks; in the meanwhile, he had large acrimonious gleecings from the scrotum, and a plentiful discharge of ichor from the anus.\u2014From this time he began to find his complaints grow less and less distressing, and he has now been totally free from them for six years past.\n\nThe Puerperal or Childbed Fever.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of fever, as its name imports, is peculiar to women in childbed; and is usually the most fatal of all the disorders to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> is liable. But, notwithstanding the prevalence of it in all ages, its real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> has remained, to the present time, a subject of much dispute and uncertainty. The critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of its invasion, when febrile convulsions are apt to be excited by various accidents, and the equivocal symptoms which accompany it, have even afforded room for questioning whether it be a primary or a secondary disease. Some writers have considered it as proceeding entirely from an inflammation of the uterus; others have imagined it to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of an obstruction to the secretion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>; while the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> has been inclined, for reasons equally if not more plausible, to impute it to a suppression of the lochia. If we examine this fever attentively, however, according to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> course, and independently of all the accidental concomitant symptoms with which it is not essentially connected, we may safely pronounce it to be a primary disease of a particular nature, and perhaps not the necessary consequence of any of the causes above mentioned.\n\nThis fever is most generally incident to women within 48 hours after delivery, though it may supervene on the fourth or fifth day, and sometimes considerably later. It is preceded, like other fevers, by a rigor, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> violent; and when happening during the time of labour, may be confounded with the pains of parturience. In its earlier stage it is attended with the signs of inflammation. A great pain is felt in the back, hips, and the region of the uterus; which, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> last mentioned, is accompanied with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and throbbing. A sudden change in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the lochia now also takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; the patient is frequently troubled with a tenesmus; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, which is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>-coloured, is discharged in small quantity and with pain. At the first attack of the fever, the woman is generally seized with a vomiting of porraceous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, as in the cholera morbus, to which disease it then bears a strong resemblance.\u2014Puerperal fever instead of this symptom, there is sometimes only a nausea, or loathing at the stomach, with a disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> in the mouth. The belly swells to a considerable bulk, and becomes susceptible of painful sensations from the slightest impression. The tongue is generally dry, though sometimes moist, and covered with a thick brownish fur. When the fever has continued a few days, the symptoms of inflammation usually subside, and the disease acquires a more putrid form. At this period, if not at the very beginning of the disorder, a bilious or putrid diarrhoea, of a dangerous and obstinate nature, supervenes, and accompanies it through all its future progress; each motion to stool being preceded by a temporary increase, and followed by an alleviation of pain. The patient usually nauseates all kind of food and drink, except what is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and acidulated. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> or blackish sordes, the consequence of putrid exhalations, adheres to the edges of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>; a troublesome hiccup is at length produced, which greatly exacerbates the pains of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>; petechiae or vibices also appear, with sometimes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> eruption, but which produces no mitigation of the disease. Through the whole course of the fever, the patient is affected with great anxiety and dejection of spirits.\n\nSuch in general is the course of the puerperal fever; the symptoms of which, however, may be often varied, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the patient, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of the disease, and its earlier or later invasion. When the woman is naturally weak, or her strength has been greatly reduced by immoderate evacuations after delivery; when the disease is violent, and immediately follows that period; its progress and termination are proportionally rapid and fatal. In such unfortunate circumstances, many have been known to expire within 24 hours from the first attack of the disease; nay, there are some instances where the rigor has concluded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>. The catastrophe, however, is most generally suspended for some days; and the number of these is variable, though the 11th from the commencement of the fever may justly be fixed as the period which is usually decisive. In whatever stage of the disease an unfavourable termination may happen, it would seem as if the commencement of the patient's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> were not marked by any critical revolution of the fever, as depending on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of the humours; but that the cure is gradually effected, either by a spontaneous vomiting, or a long-continued discharge by stool of that porraceous matter, the existence of which in the stomach is usually evinced at the first attack of the disease. The most unfavourable prognostic, therefore, arises from such a weakness of the patient as renders her unable to support so tedious an evacuation as that by which the fever is overcome. When the lochia return to their former state, when the swelling and tenderness of the abdomen abate, and there is a moisture on the skin, we have reason to hope for a happy termination of the disease.\n\nThough the puerperal fever may generally be ascertained from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> which has been given, and chiefly by that remarkable tenderness of the abdomen which particularly distinguishes it; yet, as some of its symptoms may be confounded with those arising from other diseases, and which require a different method\nAppendix.","sp":504,"ep":507},{"h":"WHEN THE PATIENT CAN BY NO OTHER","t":"n the patient can by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other means be relieved, the operation of paracentesis must be had recourse to, which is described under the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SURGERY\">Surgery</a>.\n\nGENUS LXXX.

In the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, as the viscera are generally seirrhouss and indurated, the distemper is for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> incurable; neither is the prospect much better where the disease is occasioned by a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of fat.\n\nGENUS LXXXIII.

Glisson de Rachitide.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a>. This is one of the diseases peculiar to infancy. It seldom attacks children till they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> months, nor after they are two years old; but it frequently happens in the intermediate space between these two periods. The disease shows itself by a flaccid tumor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, a loose flabby skin, a swelling of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>, and falling away of the other parts, especially of the muscles. There are protuberances of the epiphyses of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>; the jugular veins swell, while the rest decrease; and the legs grow crooked. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the child has begun to walk before he be seized with this disease, there is a slowness, debility, and tottering in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, which soon brings on a constant desire of sitting, and afterwards of lying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>; insomuch that nothing at last is moveable but the neck and head. As they grow older, the head is greatly enlarged, with ample sutures; the thorax is compressed on the sides, and the sternum rises up sharp, while the extremities of the ribs are knotty. The abdomen is protuberant, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> and carious. In such patients as have died of this disease, all the solids appear soft and flaccid, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> dissolved and mucous.\n\nCauses. The rickets may proceed from scrophulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> venereal taints in the parents, and may be increased by those of the nurse. It is likewise promoted by feeding the child with aqueous and mucous substances, crude <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, fish, unleavened farinaeuous aliment; and too great a quantity of sweet things.\u2014Sometimes it follows intermittent fevers and chronic disorders; and in short, is caused by any thing which tends to debilitate the body, and induce a viscid and unhealthy state of the juices.\n\nPrognosis. The rickets do not usually prove fatal by themselves, but if not cured in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, they make the person throughout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> deformed in various ways; and often produce very pernicious disorders, such as carious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> in different parts of the body.\n\nCure. This is to be effected by mild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a>, alteratives, and tonics, such as are used in other diseases attended with a debility of the system and a vitiated state of the blood and juices. In the Western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of Scotland, the medicine used for the cure of the rickets is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> extracted from the liver of the skate-fish. The method of application is as follows: First, the wrists and ankles are rubbed with the oil in the evening; this immediately raises a fever of several hours <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. When the fever from the first rubbing subsides, the same parts are rubbed again the night following; and repeatedly as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as the rubbing of these parts continues to excite the fever.\u2014When no fever can be excited by rubbing the wrists and ankles alone, they are rubbed again along with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a> and elbows. This increased unction brings on the fever again; and is practised as before, till it no longer has that effect. Then the vertebre and sides are rubbed, along with the former parts; and this unction, which again brings on the fever, is repeated as the former. When no fever can be any longer excited by this unction, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> shirt dipped in the oil is put upon the body of the patient: this brings on a more violent and sensible fever than any of the former unctions; and is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the cure be completed, which it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> is in a short time.\n\nA German physician, Dr Strack, has lately published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, in which he recommends the filings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> as a certain remedy in the rickets. This disease, he observes, in general begins with children when they are about 16 months old. It is seldom observed with children before they be one year old, and seldom attacks them after they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> two; and it is very generally worse where it begins early than where it begins late.\nFor effecting a cure, it is, he affirms, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to be able to distinguish very early, whether a child <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be afflicted with rickets or not. And this, he assures us, may be determined by the following symptoms: Paleness and swelling of the countenance; and in that part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> which should naturally be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> approaching to that of sulphur. When that is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, he directs that a medicine should be immediately had recourse to which will retard the further progress of the disease, and remove what has already taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. For this purpose, he advises that five grains of the filings of iron, and as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a>, should be rubbed up with ten grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, and given for a dose every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> fasting, and every evening an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>. But if considerable looseness should be produced, it will be necessary, at first, to persist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of one dose only every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nAfter a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>'s continuance in this course, according to Dr Strack, there in general ensues a keen appetite for food, quick digestion, and a copious flow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>; by means of which the fulness of the face and yellowness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> are by degrees removed, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> colour of the countenance and firmness of the body in general are gradually restored. This practice, he assures us, has never failed of success in any one instance; not even in those children born of parents greatly afflicted with the rickets.\n\nIn addition to the use of chalybeates, great benefit is often also obtained in this disease from the use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> bath; which under prudent administration, is perhaps one of the most effectual remedies for this complaint with which we are yet acquainted.\n\nMr Bonhome de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, in a late treatise on the subject of rachitis, has endeavoured to prove, that the disease arises from a peculiar acid, and in the cure he particularly recommends phosphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SODA\">soda</a>, phosphate and muriate of lime; but above all other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> alkaline lotions. The efficacy of these remedies, however, is not yet confirmed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. And we may conclude with observing, that both in the prevention and cure nothing has been found so successful as cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>.\n\nWhen the bones of rickety children begin to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a>, they may sometimes be restored to their natural shape by compresses, bolsters, and proper supports. See the article Surgery.\n\nORDER III. IMPETIGINES.\n\nImpetigines, Sauv. Class X. Ord. V. Sag. Class III. Ord. V.\n\nGENUS LXXXIV. SCROPHULA.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s Evil.\n\nScrophula, Sauv. gen. 285. Vog. 397. Sag. 121. Struma, Lin. 284.\n\nDescription. This disease shows itself by hard, scirrhouss, and often indolent tumors, which arise by degrees in the glands of the neck, under the chin, armpits, and different parts of the body, but most commonly in the neck, and behind the ears. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time, the cellular substance, ligaments of the joints, and even the bones themselves, are affected. In scrophula the swellings are much more moveable than those of the scirrhous kind; they are generally softer, and seldom attended with much pain; they are tedious in coming to suppuration; are very apt to disappear suddenly, and again to rise in some other part of the body. We may likewise mention as characteristic circumstances of this disease, a remarkable softness of the skin, a kind of fulness of the face, generally with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> eyes, and a very delicate complexion.\n\nCauses. A variety of causes have been mentioned as tending to produce scrophula, viz. a crude indigestible food; bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; living in damp, low situations; its being an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> disease, and in some countries endemic, &c. But whatever may in different circumstances be the exciting or predisposing causes of the scrophula, the disease itself either depends upon, or is at least much connected with, a debility of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> in general, and probably of the lymphatic system in particular, the complaint always showing itself by some affections of the latter. And that debility has at least a considerable influence in its production is probable, not only from the manifest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of some of the causes said to be productive of scrophula, but likewise from such remedies as are found most serviceable in the cure, which are all of a tonic invigorating nature.\n\nPrognosis. The scrophula is a distemper which often eludes the most powerful medicines, and therefore physicians cannot with any certainty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> a cure. It is seldom, however, that it proves mortal in a short time, unless it attacks the internal parts, such as the lungs, where it frequently produces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a> that bring on a fatal consumption. When it attacks the joints, it frequently produces ulcers, which continue for a long time, and gradually waste the patient; while in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time the bones become foul and corroded, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> ensues after a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of misery. The prognosis in this respect must be regulated entirely by the nature of the symptoms.\n\nCure. It was long supposed that scrophula depended upon an acid acrimony of the fluids; and this, it is probable, gave rise to the use of burnt sponge, different kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, and other alkaline substances, as the best remedies for acidity. But although a sourness of the stomach and prima via does no doubt frequently occur in these complaints, yet this symptom seems to be entirely the consequence of that general relaxation which in scrophula so universally prevails, and which does not render it in the least necessary to suppose a general acescence of the fluids to take place; as the one very frequently, it is well known, even in other complaints, occurs without the least suspicion of any acid acrimony existing in the other. This is also rendered very probable from the indolent nature of scrophulous tumors, which have been known to subsist for years without giving any uneasiness; which could not have been the case, if an acid, or any other acrimony, had prevailed in them.\n\nIn the treatment of scrophula, different morbid conditions, existing in different parts, require, according to circumstances, various means of cure: but, upon the whole, the remedies directed may be considered as used with a view either to the tumors, to the ulcerations, or to the general state of the system.\nGentle mercurials are sometimes of use as resolvents in scrophulous swellings; but nothing has such considerable influence as a frequent and copious use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a>. Cold bathing too, especially in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, together with frequent moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, is often of singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> here; as is likewise change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, especially to a warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>.\n\nIn the scrophulous inflammation of the eyes, or ophthalmia strumosa, the cinchona has also been given with extraordinary advantage: and we meet with an instance of its having cured the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUTTA\">gutta</a> rosacea in the face; a complaint which it is often difficult to remove, and which is extremely disagreeable to the fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>.\n\nFrom the various cases related of tumefied glands, it appears, that when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> is relaxed and the circulation weak, either from constitution or accident, cinchona is a most efficacious medicine, and that it acts as a resolvent and discutient. It will not, however, succeed in all cases; but there are few in which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> can be attended with much detriment. Dr Fothergill observes, that he has never known it avail much where the bones were affected, nor where the scrophulous tumor was so situated as to be accompanied with much pain, as in the joints, or under the membranous coverings of the muscles; for when the disease attacks those parts, the periosteum seldom escapes without some injury, by which the bone will of course be likewise affected. Here cinchona is of no effect: instead of lessening, it rather increases the fever that accompanies those circumstances: and, if it do not really aggravate the complaint, it seems at least to accelerate the progress of the disease.\n\nVarious are the modes in which cinchona is administered: Dr Fothergill makes use of a decoction, with the addition of some aromatic ingredients and a small quantity of liquorice-root, as a form in which a sufficient quantity may be given without exciting disgust. But where it is easily retained in the stomach in substance, perhaps the best form of exhibiting it is that of powder; and in this state it is often advantageously conjoined with powder of cicuta, an article possessing very great deobstruent powers.\n\nThe powder, however, soon becomes disagreeable to very young patients; and the extract seems not so much to be depended upon as may have been imagined. In making the extract, it is exposed to so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, as must have some effect upon its virtues, perhaps to their detriment. In administering it, likewise, if great care be not taken to mix it intimately with a proper vehicle, or some very soluble substance, in weak bowels it very often purges, and thereby not only disappoints the physician, but injures the patient. A small quantity of the cortex Winteranus added gives the medicine a grateful warmth; and a little liquorice, a few raisins, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> arabic or the like, added to the decoction before it be taken from the fire, by making the liquor viscid enables it to suspend more of the fine particles of the bark; by which process the medicine is not only improved in efficacy, but at the same time rendered less disagreeable.\n\nIn indolent swellings of the glands from viscid humours, sea-water has been strongly recommended by Dr Russell.\n\nDr Fothergill also acquaints us, that the cicuta even by itself is not without a considerable share of efficacy in removing scrophulous disorders. He mentions the case of a gentlewoman, about 28 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, afflicted from her infancy with scrophulous complaints, severe ophthalmies, glandular swellings, &c., cured by the extractum cicuta taken constantly for the space of a year. He observes, however, that when given to children, even in very small doses, it is apt to produce spasmodic affections; for which reason he rarely exhibits it to them when very young, or even to adults of very irritable habits.\n\nDr Fothergill gives several other instances of the success of cicuta in scrophulous cases, and even in one which seemed to be not far removed from a confirmed phthisis; but owns that it seldom had such good effects afterwards: yet he is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that where there are symptoms of tubercles forming, a strenuous habit, and a tendency to phthisis, the cicuta will often be serviceable. It is anodyne, corrects acrimony, and promotes the formation of good matter. With regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the medicine, he observes, that the extract prepared from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HEMLOCK\">hemlock</a> before the plant arrives at maturity, is much inferior to that which is made when the hemlock has acquired its full vigour, and is rather on the verge of decline: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> fade, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of the seeds become observable, and the habit of the plant inclines to yellow; this, he thinks, is the proper time to collect the hemlock. It has then had the full benefit of the summer heat; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> that grow in exposed places will generally be found more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> than those that grow in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>. The less heat it undergoes during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, the better. Therefore, if a considerable quantity of the dry powder of the plant gathered at a proper season be added, less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> will be necessary, and the medicine will be the more efficacious. But let the extract be prepared in what manner soever it may, provided it be made from the genuine plant, at a proper season, and be not destroyed by boiling, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> observable in using it is, that a larger quantity of one kind is required to produce a certain effect than of another. Twenty grains of one sort of extract have been found equal in point of efficacy to thirty, nay near forty, of another; yet both of them made from the genuine plant, and most probably prepared with equal fidelity. To prevent the inconveniences arising from this uncertainty, it seems always expedient to begin with small doses, and proceed step by step till the extract produces certain effects, which seldom fail to arise from a full dose. These effects are different in different constitutions. But, for the most part, a giddiness affecting the head, and motions of the eyes, as if something pushed them outwards, are first felt; a slight sickness, and trembling agitation of the body; a laxative stool or two. One or all of these symptoms are the marks of a full dose, let the quantity in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> be what it will. Here we must stop till none of these effects be felt; and in three or four days advance a few grains more. For it has been supposed by most of those who have used this medicine to any good purpose, that the cicuta seldom procures any benefit, though given for a long time, unless in as large a dose as the patient can bear without suffering any of the inconveniences above mentioned. There is however reason to believe, that its effects, as a discutient, are in no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> dependent on its narcotic powers: and\nand we are inclined to think, that recourse is often had to larger doses than are necessary; or at least that the same benefit might be derived from smaller ones continued for an equal length of time.\n\nPatients commonly bear a greater quantity of the extract at night than at noon, and at noon than in the morning. Two drams may be divided into thirty pills. Adults begin with two in the morning, two at noon, and three or four at night, with directions to increase each dose, by the addition of a pill to each, as they can bear it.\n\nBut, after all, the best form under which the cicuta can, we think, be exhibited, is that of powder from the leaves. This, either under the form of powder or made into pills, may be given at first to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of four or five grains, and the dose gradually rising till it amount to 15 or 20 grains twice or thrice a day. Given to this extent, particularly when conjoined with cinchona, it has often been found of great service in scrophulous cases. At the same time it must be allowed, that such patients, after resisting every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of cure, will have in some instances a spontaneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> in the progress of life, probably from the system acquiring additional vigour.\n\nDifferent mineral waters, particularly the sulphureous ones, as those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARROWGATE\">Harrowgate</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOFFAT\">Moffat</a>, and Gillsland, have been much recommended in scrofula, and sometimes productive of benefit. Recourse has sometimes also been had with advantage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>, iron, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARYTES\">barytes</a>, particularly muriate of barytes. But as well as in rachitis, no remedy has been found more efficacious in scrofula than cold bathing, especially sea-bathing.\n\n**GENUS LXXXV. SIPHYLIS.**\n\n*Lues Venerea,* or French Pox.\n\nSiphyllis, Sauv. gen. 3086. Lin. 6. Vog. 319. Sag. 126.\n\nLues venerea, Boerh. 1440. Hoffm. III. 413. Junck. 96. Astruc de Lue Venerea.\n\nDr Astruc, who writes a very accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the lues venerea, is fully convinced that it is a new disease, which never appeared in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> till some time between the years 1494 and 1496, having been imported from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> by the companions of Christopher Columbus; though this opinion is not without its opponents. Dr Sanches in particular has contended with much learning and ability, that it appeared in Europe at an earlier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>: But it is at least certain that it was altogether unknown to the medical practitioners of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome, and that it was a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> disease in America when the Europeans first visited that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. But at whatever period it may have been introduced into Europe, or from whatever source it may have been obtained, there can be no doubt that, as well as smallpox or measles, syphilis depends on a peculiar specific contagion; on a matter *sui generis*, which is alone capable of inducing this disease.\n\nThe venereal infection, however, cannot, like the contagious miasmata of the smallpox and some other diseases, be carried through the air, and thus spread from place to place: for unless it is transmitted from the parents to the children, there is no other way of contracting the disease but from actual contact with the infectious matter. Thus, when a nurse happens to labour under the disease, the infant that she suckles will receive the infection; as, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, when the child is infected, the nurse is liable to receive it: and there have even been instances known of lying-in women being infected very violently, from having employed a person to draw their breasts who happened to have venereal ulcers in the throat. It may be caught by touching venereal sores, if the cuticle be abraded or torn: and in this way accoucheurs and midwives have sometimes been infected severely. Dr Macbride says, the most inveterate pox he ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> was caught by a midwife, who happened to have a whitlow on one of her fingers when she delivered a woman ill of the lues venerea.\n\nBut by far the most ready way of contracting this disease is by coition, the genital parts being much more bibulous than the rest of the body. When the disorder is communicated, the places where the morbid matter enters are generally those where it first makes its appearance; and as coition is the most usual way of contracting it, so the first symptoms commonly appear on or near the pudenda.\n\nThe patient's own account will, for the most part, help us to distinguish the disease: but there are sometimes cases wherein we cannot avail ourselves of this information, and where, instead of confessing, the parties shall conceal all circumstances; while, on the other hand, there are now and then people to be met with, who persuade themselves that symptoms are venereal, which in reality are owing to some other cause: and therefore it is of the utmost importance to inform ourselves thoroughly of the nature of those symptoms and appearances which may be considered as pathognomic signs of lues venerea.\n\nIn the first place, when we find that the local symptoms, such as chancres, buboes, phymosis, and the like, do not give way to the usual methods; or when these complaints, after having been cured, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> out again without a fresh infection; we may justly suspect that the virus has entered the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of fluids: but if at the same time ulcers break out in the throat, and the face is deformed by callous tubercles, covered with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> or yellow scab, we may be assured that the case is now become a confirmed lues, which will require a mercurial course.\n\nWhen eruptions of the furfuraceous and superficial kind are venereal, they are not attended with itching; and the scale being picked off, the skin appears of a reddish brown, or rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> colour, underneath; whereas leprous eruptions are itchy, throw off a greater quantity of scales, and rise in greater blotches, especially about the joints of the knees and elbows. Venereal tubercles or pustules are easily distinguished from carbuncles of the face, by not occupying the cheeks or the nose, nor as having a purulent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a>, but are covered at top, either with a dry branny scurf like the superficial eruptions just now mentioned, or else with a hard dry scab of a tawney yellow hue; they particularly break out among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> or near to it, on the forehead or on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>.\n\nVenereal ulcers affecting the mouth are distinguishable from those which are scorbutic, in the following manner: 1. Venereal ulcers first affect the tonsils, fauces,\nces and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-UVULA\">uvula</a>; then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, but these very rarely: on the contrary, scorbutic ulcers affect the gums first of all; then the fauces, tonsils, and uvula. 2. Venereal ulcers frequently spread to the nose; scorbutic ones almost never. 3. Venereal ulcers are callous in the edges; scorbutic ones are not so. 4. Venereal ulcers are circumscribed, and, for the most part, are circular, at least they are confined to certain places; scorbutic ones are of a more regular form, spread wider, and frequently affect the whole mouth. 5. Venereal ulcers are for the most part hollow, and generally covered at bottom with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> or yellow slough; but scorbutic ones are more apt to grow up into loose fungi. 6. Venereal ulcers are red in their circumference, but scorbutic ones are always livid. 7. Venereal ulcers frequently rot the subjacent bones, the scorbutic ones seldom or never. 8. And lastly, Venereal ulcers are generally combined with other symptoms which are known to be venereal; scorbutic ones with the distinguishing signs of the scurvy, such as difficult breathing, listlessness, swelling of the legs, rotten gums, &c.\n\nAnother strong sign of the confirmed lues is often afforded from certain deep-seated nocturnal pains, particularly of the shins, arms, and head. As for any superficial wandering pains that have no fixed seat, and which affect the membranes of the muscles, and ligaments of the joints, they, for the most part, will be found to belong to the gout or rheumatism, and can never be considered as venereal, unless accompanied with some other evident signs; but with regard to the pains that are deeply-seated, and always fixed to the same place, and which affect the middle and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> part of the ulna, tibia, and bones of the cranium, and rage chiefly and with greatest violence in the forepart of the night, so that the patient can get no rest till morning approaches, these may serve to convince us that the disease has spread itself throughout the whole habit, whether they be accompanied with other symptoms of the lues or not. Gummata in the fleshy parts, nodes in the periosteum, ganglia upon the tendons, tophi upon the ligaments, exostoses upon the bones, and fisti at the verge of the anus, are all of them signs of the confirmed lues: these are hard indolent swellings; but as they sometimes arise independently of any venereal infection, and perhaps may proceed from a scrophulous taint, unless they be accompanied or have been preceded by some of the more certain and evident symptoms of the lues, we must be cautious about pronouncing them venereal. When these swellings are not owing to the siphilitic virus, they are very seldom painful, or tend to inflame and suppurate, whereas those that are venereal usually do, and if they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> upon a bone generally bring on a caries.\n\nThese carious ulcers are most commonly met with upon the ulna, tibia, and bones of the cranium; and when accompanied with nocturnal pains, we can never hesitate about declaring their genuine nature. Frequent abortions, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of scabby, ulcerated, half-rotten, and dead foetuses, happening without any manifest cause to disturb the foetus before its time, or to destroy it in the womb, may be reckoned as a sign that at least one of the parents is infected.\n\nThese then are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> and most evident signs of the confirmed lues. There are others which are more equivocal, and which, unless we can fairly trace them back to some that are more certain, cannot be held as signs of the venereal disease: Such are, 1. Obstinate inflammations of the eyes, frequently returning, with great heat, itching, and ulceration of the eyelids. 2. A singing and hissing noise in the ears, with ulcers or caries in the bones of the meatus auditorius. 3. Obstinate headaches. 4. Obstinate cutaneous eruptions, of the itchy or leprous appearance, not yielding to the milder methods of treatment. 5. Swellings of the bones; and, 6. Wandering and obstinate pains. None of these symptoms, however, can be known to be venereal, except they happen to coincide with some one or other of the more certain signs.\n\nIt may, perhaps, be considered as a singularity in this disease, that the diagnosis is often more difficult in the advanced than in the early periods of the affection. That is, with those who have been certainly subjected to siphylis, it is often very difficult to say whether certain symptoms, remaining after the ordinary modes of cure have been employed, be siphilitic or not. Very frequently, as appears from the sequel, nocturnal pains, ulcerations, and the like, remaining after a long course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> has been employed, are in no degree of a venereal nature, but are in reality to be considered as consequences rather of the remedy than the disease; and are accordingly best removed by nourishing diet, gentle exercise, and tonics. But as long as any symptoms of any kind remain, it is often impossible to convince some patients that they are cured; and it is often impossible for a physician with certainty to affirm that the disease is altogether overcome.\n\nUpon the whole, we are first to distinguish and consider the several symptoms apart; and then, by comparing them with each other, a clear judgment may be formed upon the general review.\n\nPrognosis. Being thoroughly convinced that the ease is venereal, we are to consider, first of all, whether it be of a longer or shorter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>; for the more recent it is, it will, ceteris paribus, be less difficult to remove. But there are other circumstances which will assist us in forming a prognostic as to the event. As,\n\n1. The age of the patient. This disorder is more dangerous to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> and old people, than to such as are in the flower and vigour of life, in whom some part of the virus may be expelled by exercise, or may be subdued in some degree by the strength of the constitution.\n\n2. The sex. Though women are for the most part weaker than men, and therefore should seem less able to resist the force of any disease, yet experience shows that this is easier borne by them than by men; perhaps owing to the menstrual and other uterine discharges, by which a good portion of the virus may be carried off immediately from the parts where it was first applied; for it is observable, that whenever these discharges are obstructed, or cease by the ordinary course of nature, all the symptoms of this disease grow worse.\n\n3. The habit of body. Persons who have acid juices will be liable to suffer more from the venereal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> than such as have their blood in a milder state; hence, when people of a scorbutic or scrophulous habit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> venereal disorders, the symptoms are always remarkably violent, and difficult to cure. And\nfor the same reasons, the confirmed lues is much more to be dreaded in a person already inclined to an asthma, phthisis, dropsy, gout, or any other chronic distemper, than in one of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> and healthy constitution. For as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> disease is increased by the accession of the venereal poison, so the lues is aggravated by being joined to an old disorder. The more numerous the symptoms, and the more they affect the bones, the more difficult the cure. Of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> the union of syphilis with scrofula is perhaps the most difficult to overcome; but if the acrimony should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> on the nobler internal parts, such as the brain, the lungs or the liver, then the disease becomes incurable, and the patient will either go off suddenly in an apoplectic fit, or sink under a consumption.\n\nCure. Viewing this disease as depending on a peculiar contagious matter introduced into the system, and multiplied there, it is possible to conceive that a cure may be obtained on one of three principles; either by the evacuation of the matter from the system, by the destruction of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, or by counteracting its influence in the system. It is not impossible that articles exist in nature capable of removing this complaint on each of these grounds; but we may venture at least to assert, that few such are yet discovered. Notwithstanding numbers of pretended infallible remedies for syphilis, mercury is perhaps the only article on which dependence is placed among European practitioners; and with regard to its mode of operation, all the three different opinions pointed out have been adopted and supported by different theorists.\u2014But although many ingenious arguments have been employed in support of each, we are, upon the whole, inclined to think it more probable that mercury operates by destroying the activity of the venereal virus, than that it has effect either by evacuating it, or by exciting a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> by which its influence is counteracted. Some practitioners have affirmed, that the disease may be totally extirpated without the use of mercury; but, excepting in slight cases, it appears from the most accurate observations, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> specific is indispensible; whether it be introduced through the pores of the skin, in the form of ointments, plasters, washes, &c.; or given by the mouth, disguised in the different shapes of pills, troches, powders, or solutions.\n\nFormerly it was held as a rule, that a salivation ought to be raised, and a great discharge excited. But this is now found to be unnecessary: for as mercury probably acts by some specific power in subduing and correcting the venereal virus, all that is required is to throw in a sufficient quantity of the medicine for this purpose: and if it can be diverted from the salivary glands so much the better, since the inconveniences attending a spitting are such as we should always wish to avoid.\n\nMercury, when combined with any saline substance, has its activity prodigiously increased; hence the great variety of chemical preparations which have been contrived to unite it with different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>.\n\nCorrosive sublimate, or the murias hydrargyri corrosivus, is one of the most active of all the mercurial preparations, insomuch as to become a poison even in very small doses. It therefore cannot safely be given in substance; but must be dissolved in order to render it capable of a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>. We may see, by Siph <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> into Wiseman, that this is an old medicine, though seldom given by regular practitioners. How it came to be introduced into so remote a part of the world as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, is not easily found out; but Dr Clerc, author of the Histoire Naturelle de l'Homme Malade, assures us, that the sublimate solution has been in use there time out of mind.\n\nIt appears to have been totally forgotten in other places, until of late years, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Van Swieten brought it into vogue; so that at one period, if we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> Dr Locker, they used no other mercurial preparation at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of patients cured by this remedy alone in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a> of St Mark, which is under the care of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, from 1754 to 1767 inclusive, being 4880.\n\nThe method of preparing the solution is, to dissolve as much sublimate in any kind of ardent spirit (at Vienna they use only corn brandy) as will give half a grain to an ounce of solution. The dose to a grown person is one spoonful mixed with a pint of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> pitan or barley water, and this is to be taken morning and evening: the patients should keep principally in a warm chamber, and lie in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> to sweat after taking the medicine; their diet should be light; and they ought to drink plentifully throughout the day, of whey, pitian, or barley water. If the solution does not keep the belly open, a mild purge must be given from time to time; for Locker observes, that those whom it purges two or three times a-day, get well sooner than those whom it does not purge: he also says, that it very seldom affects the mouth, but that it promotes the urinary and cutaneous discharges. This course is not only to be continued till all the symptoms disappear, but for some weeks longer. The shortest time in which Locker used to let the patients out was six weeks; and they were continued on a course of decoction of the woods for some weeks after they left off the solution.\n\nThis method has been introduced both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, though by no means to the exclusion of others; but it appears, that the solution does not turn out so infallible a remedy, either in these kingdoms, or in France, as they say it has done in Germany. It was seldom if ever found to perform a radical cure, and the frequent use of it proved in many cases highly prejudicial. It has therefore been succeeded in practice, even at Vienna, by mercury exhibited in other forms; and, among these, by a remedy first recommended by Dr Plenck, and since improved by Dr Saunders; consisting of mercury united with mucilage of gum arabic, which is said to render its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> perfectly mild and safe. For particulars, we refer to Dr Saunders's treatise.\n\nBut a late French writer, supposed to be Dr Petit, in a small book, entitled, A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> of the different methods of treating the venereal disease, insists, that there is neither certainty nor safety in any other method than the repeated frictions with mercurial ointment.\n\nIf, therefore, it is determined to have recourse to the mercurial frictions, the patient may with advantage be prepared by going into the warm bath some days successively; having been previously blooded if of a plethoric habit, and taking a dose or two of some proper cathartic.\nThe patient being fitted with the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> of flannels, is then to enter on the course.\n\nIf he be of a robust habit and in the prime of life, we may begin with two drams of the unguentum hydrargyri fortius, (Ph. Lond.) which is to be rubbed in about the ankles by an assistant whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> are covered with bladders: then having intermitted a day, we may expend two drams more of the ointment, and rest for two days; after which, if no soreness of the mouth comes on, use only one dram; and at every subsequent friction ascend till the ointment shall reach the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of the body; after which the rubbings are to be begun at the wrists, and from thence gradually extended to the shoulders. In order to prevent the mercury from laying too much hold of the mouth, it must be diverted to the skin, by keeping the patient in a constant perspiration from the warmth of the room, and by drinking plentifully of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-BARLEY_WATER\">barley-water</a>, whey, or pitan; but if, nevertheless, the mercury should tend to raise a spitting, then, from time to time, we are either to give some gentle cathartic, or order the patient into a vapour or warm bath; and thus we are to go on, rubbing in a dram of the ointment every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, third, or fourth night, according as it may be found to operate; and on the intermediate days either purging or bathing, unless we should choose to let the salivation come on; which, however, it is much better to avoid, as we shall thus be able to throw in a larger quantity of mercury.\n\nIt is impossible to ascertain the quantity of mercury that may be necessary to be rubbed in, as this will vary according to circumstances: but we are always to continue the frictions, for a fortnight at least, after all symptoms of the disease shall have totally disappeared; and when we have done with the mercury, warm bathing, and sudorific decoctions of the woods, are to be continued for some time longer.\n\nThis is a general sketch of the methods of treatment for the confirmed lues; but for a complete history of the disease, and for ample directions in every situation, we refer to Astrue, and his abridger Dr Chapman.\u2014We have to add, however, that a method of curing this disease by mercurial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUMIGATION\">fumigation</a> has been lately recommended in France, but it seems not to meet with great encouragement. One of the most recent proposals for the cure of the venereal disease is that of Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLARE\">Clare</a>, and consists in rubbing a small quantity of mercury under the form of the submuri\u00e6s hydrargyri, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALOMEL\">calomel</a> as it is commonly called, on the inside of the cheek; by which means it has been supposed that we will not only avoid the inconveniences of unction, but also the purgative effects that are often produced by this medicine when taken into the stomach. But after all, the introduction of mercury under the form of unction, as recommended by the latest and best writers in Britain on the venereal disease, Dr Swediaur, Mr John Hunter, and others, is still very generally preferred to any mode that has yet been proposed.\n\nWhere, after a long trial of mercury, distressing symptoms still remain, particularly obstinate ulcerations and severe pains, benefit has often been derived from the use of opium: but there is little reason to believe, as has been held by some, that of itself it affords an infallible cure of this disease; at least we are inclined to think, that all the facts hitherto brought in support of the cure of syphilis by opium are at the utmost very doubtful.\n\nThe same observation may perhaps be made with regard to another remedy which has of late been highly extolled in syphilis, viz. the nitric acid. This article seems to have been first introduced both against affections of the liver and venereal complaints by Dr Scott of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOMBAY\">Bombay</a>. It has since been highly extolled by Dr Beddoes and other writers in Britain. And there are many well authenticated cases on record in which it has produced a cure. But it is very rarely preferable to mercury; and it is chiefly useful when, from some peculiarity of constitution, mercury cannot be exhibited.\n\nIn obstinate ulcerations, remaining probably after the venereal virus has been overcome, and resisting the use of mercury, a complete cure has in many instances been obtained from the use of the root of the mezereon, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAPHNE\">daphne</a> mezereum of Linn\u00e6us. This article has been chiefly employed under the form of decoction; and it now appears that it is the basis of an article at one time highly celebrated in venereal complaints, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a> diet drink. But, upon the whole, these sequel\u00e6 of this disease are perhaps more readily overcome by country air, gentle exercise, and nourishing diet, particularly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> diet, than by the use of any medicine whatever. It must indeed be allowed, that for combating different sequel\u00e6, various practices accommodated to the nature of these will on particular occasions be requisite. But into the consideration of these we cannot here propose to enter.\n\nGenus LXXXVI. SCORBUTUS.\n\nScurvy.\n\nScorbatus, Sauv. gen. 391. Lin. 223. Vog. 318. Sag. 127. Boerh. 1148. Hoffm. III. 369. Junck. 91. Lind on the Scurvy. Hulme de Scorbuto. Rouppe de Morbis Navigantium.\n\nDescription. The first indication of the scorbutic diathesis is generally a change of colour in the face, from the natural and healthy look to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> and bloated complexion, with a listlessness, and aversion from every sort of exercise; the gums soon after become itchy, swell, and are apt to bleed on the slightest touch; the breath grows offensive; and the gums, swelling daily more and more, turn livid, and at length become extremely fungous and putrid, as being continually in contact with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air; which in every case favours the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> of substances disposed to run into that state, and is indeed in some respects absolutely requisite for the production of actual putridity.\n\nThe symptoms of the scurvy, like those of every other disease, are somewhat different in different subjects, according to the various circumstances of constitution; and they do not always proceed in the same regular course in every patient. But what is very remarkable in this disease, notwithstanding the various and immense load of distress under which the patients labour, there is no sickness at the stomach, the appetite keeps up, and the senses remain entire almost to the very last: when lying at rest, scorbutic patients make no complaints, and feel little distress or pain; but\nthe moment they attempt to rise or stir themselves, then the breathing becomes difficult, with a kind of straitness or catching, and great oppression, and sometimes they have been known to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into a syncope. This catching of the breath upon motion, with the loss of strength, dejection of spirit, and rotten gums, are held as the essential or distinguishing symptoms of the disease. The skin is generally dry, except in the very last stage, when the patients become exceedingly subject to faintings, and then it grows clammy and moist: in some it has an anserine appearance; but much oftener it is smooth and shining; and, when examined, is found to be spread over with spots, not rising above the surface, of a reddish, bluish, livid or purple colour, with a sort of yellow rim round them. At first these spots are for the most part small, but in time they increase to large blotches. The legs and thighs are the places where they are principally seen: more rarely on the head and face. Many have a swelling of the legs, which is harder, and retains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of the finger longer than the common dropsical or truly oedematous swellings. The slightest wounds and bruises, in scorbutic habits, degenerate into foul and untoward ulcers; and the appearance of these ulcers is so singular and uniform, that they are easily distinguished from all others. Scorbutic ulcers afford no good digestion, but give out a thin and fetid ichor mixed with blood, which at length has the appearance of coagulated gore lying caked on the surface of the sore, not to be separated or wiped off without some difficulty. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> underneath these sloughs feels to the probe soft and spongy, and is very putrid. Neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERGENTS\">detergents</a> nor escharotics are here of any service; for though such sloughs be with great pains taken away, they are found again at the next dressing, where the same sanguineous putrid appearance always presents itself. Their edges are generally of a livid colour, and puffed up with excrescences of proud flesh arising from below the skin. As the violence of the disease increases, the ulcers shoot out a soft bloody fungus, which often rises in a night's time to a monstrous size; and although destroyed by cauteries, actual or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POTENTIAL\">potential</a>, or cut away with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, is found at next dressing as large as ever. It is a considerable time, however, before these ulcers, bad as they are, come to affect the bones with rottenness. These appearances will always serve to assure us that an ulcer is scorbutic; and should put us on our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> with respect to the giving mercurials, which are very generally pernicious in these cases.\n\nScorbutic people, as the disease advances, are seldom free from pains; though they have not the same seat in all, and often in the same person shift their place. Some complain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> pain in all their bones; but most violent in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, and especially the joints: the most frequent seat of their pain, however, is some part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>. The pains of this disease seem to arise from the distraction of the sensible fibres by the extravasated blood being forced into the interstices of the periosteum and of the tendinous and ligamentous parts; whose texture being so firm, the fibres are liable to higher degrees of tension, and consequently of pain.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the bowels are various: in some there is an obstinate costiveness; in others a tendency to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a>, with extremely fetid stools: the urine is also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and fetid, generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> coloured; and, when it has stood for some hours, throws up an oily scum on the surface. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> is variable; but most commonly slower and more feeble than in the time of perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. A stiffness in the tendons, and weakness in the joints of the knees, appear early in the disease; but as it grows more inveterate, the patients generally lose the use of their limbs altogether; having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the flexor tendons in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAM\">ham</a>, with a swelling and pain in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> of the knee. Some have their legs monstrously swelled, and covered over with livid spots or ecchymoses; others have had tumours there; some, though without swelling, have the calves of the legs and the flesh of the thighs quite indurated. As persons far gone in the scurvy are apt to faint, and even expire, on being moved and brought out into the fresh air, the utmost care and circumspection are requisite when it is necessary to stir or remove them.\n\nScorbutic patients are at all times, but more especially as the disease advances, extremely subject to profuse bleedings from different parts of the body; as from the nose, gums, intestines, lungs, &c., and likewise from their ulcers, which generally bleed plentifully if the fungus be cut away. It is not easy to conceive a more dismal and diversified scene of misery than what is beheld in the third and last stage of this distemper; it being then that the anomalous and more extraordinary symptoms appear, such as the bursting out of old wounds, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of old fractures that have been long united.\n\nCauses. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> scurvy has been indiscriminately applied, even by physicians, to almost all the different kinds of eutaneous foulness; owing to some writers of the last century, who comprehended such a variety of symptoms under this denomination, that there are few chronic distempers which may not be so called, according to their scheme: but the disease here meant is the true putrid scurvy, so often fatal to seamen, that with many it has got the name of sea-scurvy, though it be a disease frequently occurring on shore, as was experienced by the British garrisons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOSTON\">Boston</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINORCA\">Minorca</a>, and many other places. Indeed no disease is perhaps more frequent or more destructive to people pent up in garrisons without sufficient supplies of sound animal food and fresh vegetables. It is sometimes known to be endemic in certain countries, where the nature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, the general state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, and the common course of diet, all combine in producing that singular species of corruption in the mass of blood which constitutes the scorbutic diathesis; for the appearances, on dissecting scorbutic subjects, sufficiently show that the scurvy may, with great propriety, be termed a disease of the blood.\n\nDr Lind has, in a postscript to the third edition of his treatise on the scurvy, given the result of his observations drawn from the dissection of a considerable number of victims to this fatal malady; from which it appears that the true scorbutic state, in an advanced stage of the distemper, consists in numerous effusions of blood into the cellular interstices of most parts of the body, superficial as well as internal; particularly the gums and the legs; the texture of the former being almost entirely cellular, and the generally dependent state of the latter, rendering these parts of all others in the whole body, the most apt to receive\nand retain the stagnant blood, when its crisis comes to be destroyed; and when it loses that glutinous quality which, during health, hinders it from escaping through the pores in the coats of the blood-vessels or through exhalant extremities.\n\nA dropsical indisposition, especially in the legs and breasts was frequently, but not always, observed in the subjects that were opened, and the pericardium was sometimes found distended with water: the water thus collected was often so sharp as to shrivel the hands of the dissectors; and in some instances, where the skin happened to be broken, it irritated and festered the wound.\n\nThe fleshy fibres were found so extremely lax and tender, and the bellies of the muscles in the legs and thighs so stuffed with the effused stagnating blood, that it was always difficult, and sometimes impossible, to raise or separate one muscle from another. He says that the quantity of this effused blood was amazing; in some bodies it seemed that almost a fourth part of the whole mass had escaped from the vessels; and it often lay in large concretions on the periosteum, and in some few instances under this membrane immediately on the bone. Notwithstanding this dissolved and depraved state of the external fleshy parts, the brain always appeared perfectly sound, and the viscera of the abdomen, as well as those of the thorax, were in general found quite uncorrupted. There were spots indeed, from extravasated blood, observed on the mesentery, intestines, stomach, and omentum; but these spots were firm, and free from any mortified taint; and, more than once, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of blood, as large as a hand's-breadth, has been seen on the surface of the stomach; and what was remarkable, that very subject was not known while living to have made any complaint of sickness, pain, or other disorder, in either stomach or bowels.\n\nThese circumstances and appearances, with many others that are not here enumerated, all prove to a demonstration a putrescent, or at least a highly depraved state of the blood: and yet Dr Lind takes no small pains to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> the idea of the scurvy's proceeding from animal putrefaction; a notion which, according to him, \"may, and hath misled physicians to propose and administer remedies for it altogether ineffectual.\"\n\nHe also, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a> to his third edition, talks of the mischief done by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to delusive theories. He says, \"it is not probable that a remedy for the scurvy will ever be discovered from a preconceived <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> men in the closet, who have never seen the disease, or who have seen at most only a few cases of it;\" and adds, \"that though a few partial facts and observations may, for a little, flatter with hopes of greater success, yet more enlarged experience must ever convince the fallacy of all positive assertions in the healing art.\"\n\nSir John Pringle, however, is of a very different opinion. He \"is persuaded, after long reflection, and the opportunities he has had of conversing with those who to much sagacity had joined no small experience in nautical practice, that upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the several articles which have either been of old approved, or have of late been introduced into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, it will appear, that though these means may vary in form and in mode of operating, yet they all some way contribute towards preventing putrefaction; whether of the air in the closer parts of a ship, of the meats, of the water, of the clothes and bedding, or of the body itself.\"\n\nWhat Dr Lind has above advanced is the more remarkable, as, in the two former editions of his book, he embraced the hypothesis of animal putrefaction being the cause of the scurvy; and if these effusions of blood, from a destruction of its crisis and the dissolved state of the muscular fibres, together with the rotten condition of the mouth and gums, do not betray putrescence, it is hard to say what does, or what other name we shall bestow on this peculiar species of deprivation which constitutes the scurvy.\n\nThe blood, no doubt, derives its healthy properties, and maintains them, from the due supplies of wholesome food; while the insoluble, superfluous, effete, and acrid parts, are carried off by the several discharges of stool, urine, and perspiration.\n\nOur senses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> are sufficient to inform us when our food is in a state of soundness and sweetness, and consequently wholesome; but it is from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> that we must learn the principles on which these qualities chiefly depend.\n\nExperiments of various kinds have proved, that the soundness of animal and vegetable substances depends very much, if not entirely, on the presence of their aerial principle. Rottenness is never observed to take place without an emission of fixed air from the putrefying substance: and even when putrefaction has made a considerable progress, if aerial acid can be transferred, in sufficient quantity, from some other substance in a state of effervescence or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, into the putrid body, the offensive smell of this will be destroyed. If it be a bit of rotten flesh with which the experiment is made, the firmness of its fibres will be found in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> restored.\n\nThe experiments of Dr Hales, as well as many others made since his time, show that an aerial principle is greatly connected with, and particularly abundant in, the gelatinous parts of animal bodies, and in the mucilage or farina of vegetables. But these are the parts of our food which are most particularly nutritive; and Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>, whose opinion on this as on every other medical subject must be allowed of the greatest weight, affirms, in his Lectures on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MATERIA_MEDICA\">Materia Medica</a>, that the substances on which we feed are nutritious only in proportion to the quantities of oil and sugar which they respectively contain. This oil and sugar are blended together in the gelatinous part of our animal food, and in the mucilaginous and farinaceous part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESCULENT\">esculent</a> vegetables; and, while thus intimately combined, are not perceivable by our taste, though very capable of being developed and rendered distinct by the power of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGESTIVE\">digestive</a> organs; for in consequence of the changes produced during digestion, the oily and the saccharine matter become manifest to our senses, as we may see and taste in the milk of animals, which is chiefly chyle a little advanced in its progress toward sanguification; the oil is observed to separate spontaneously, and from which a quantity of actual sugar may be obtained by a very simple process.\n\nThus much being promised, we can now readily comprehend\ncomprehend how the blood may come to lose those qualities of smoothness, mildness, and tenacity which are natural to it. For if, in the first place, the fluids and organs subservient to digestion, should be so far distempered or debilitated that the nutritious parts of the food cannot be properly developed, the blood must be defrauded of its due supplies; which will also be the case if the aliment should not originally contain enough of oily and saccharine matter, or should be so circumstanced, from being dried or salted, as to hinder the ready extrication of the nutritious parts; or, lastly, if the natural discharges should be interrupted or suspended, so that the superfluous, acrid, and effete fluids are retained in the general mass; in all these instances the blood must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> run into proportionate degrees of depravation.\n\nAnd hence we may understand how it may possibly happen, that when persons are greatly weakened by some preceding disorder, and at the same time debarred the use of proper bodily exercise, the scorbutic diathesis should take place, even though they enjoy the advantages of pure air and wholesome diet. But these are solitary cases, and very rarely seen; for whenever the scurvy seizes numbers, and can be considered as an epidemic disease, it will be found to depend on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">major</a> part, or perhaps all, of the following circumstances:\n\n1. A moist atmosphere, and more especially if cold be joined to this moisture.\n2. Too long cessation from bodily exercise, whether it be from constraint, or a lazy slothful disposition.\n3. Dejection of mind.\n4. Neglect of cleanliness, and want of sufficient clothing.\n5. Want of wholesome drink, either of pure water or fermented liquors.\n6. Above all, the being obliged to live continually on salted meats, perhaps not well cured, without a due proportion of the vegetables sufficient to correct the pernicious tendency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, by supplying the bland oil and saccharine matter requisite for the purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUTRITION\">nutrition</a>.\n\nThese general principles respecting the causes and nature of scurvy, seem to afford a better explanation of the phenomena of the disease than any conjectures respecting it that have hitherto been proposed. It must, however, be allowed, that Dr Lind is by no means the only writer who is disposed to consider this disease as not referable to the condition of the circulating fluids. In a late ingenious treatise on this subject by Sir F. Milman, he strenuously contends, that the primary morbid affection in this complaint is a debilitated state of the solids arising principally from want of aliment. But his arguments on this subject, as well as those of Dr Lind, are very ably answered by a still later writer on this subject, Dr Trotter, who has drawn his observations respecting it from very extensive experience, and who considers it as clearly established, by incontrovertible facts, that the proximate cause of scurvy depends on some peculiar state of the blood.\u2014That this disease does not depend on a debilitated state of the solids, is demonstratively proved from numerous cases where every possible degree of debility occurs in the solids without the slightest appearance of scurvy. Dr Trotter, in the second edition of his Observations on the Scurvy, from the result of farther observation and later discoveries in chemistry, has attempted, with much ingenuity, to prove that the morbid condition of the blood, which takes place in scurvy, arises from the abstraction of vital air, or, as it is now generally called, oxygene; and this opinion, though still, perhaps, in some particulars requiring farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a>, is, it must be allowed, supported by many plausible arguments.\n\nPrevention and Cure. The scurvy may be prevented, by obviating and correcting those circumstances in respect of the non-naturals which were mentioned as contributing to the disease; and laid down as causes. It is, therefore, a duty highly incumbent on officers commanding at sea, or in garrisons, to use every possible precaution; and, in the first place, to correct the coldness and moisture of the atmosphere by sufficient fires: in the next, to see that their men be lodged in dry, clean, and well ventilated births or apartments: thirdly, to promote cheerfulness, and enjoin frequent exercise, which alone is of infinite use in preventing the scurvy: fourthly, to take care that the clothing be proper, and cleanliness of person strictly observed: fifthly, to supply them with wholesome drink, either pure water or sound fermented liquors; and if spirits be allowed, to have them properly diluted with water and sweetened with molasses or coarse sugar: and lastly, to order the salted meats to be sparingly used, or sometimes entirely abstained from; and in their place, let the people live on different compositions of the dried vegetables; fresh meat and recent vegetables being introduced as often as they can possibly be procured.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to these matters will, in general, prevent the scurvy from making its appearance at all, and will always hinder it from spreading its influence far. But when these precautions have been neglected, or the circumstances such that they cannot be put in practice, and the disease has actually taken place, our whole endeavour must be to restore the blood to its original state of soundness: and happily, such is the nature of this disease, that if a sufficiency of new matter, of the truly mild nutritious sort, and particularly such as abounds with vital air, such as recent vegetables, or different acid fruits, can be thrown into the circulation while the fleshy fibres retain any tolerable degree of firmness, the patient will recover; and that in a surprisingly short space of time, provided a pure air, comfortable lodgings, sufficient clothing, cleanliness, and exercise, lend their necessary aid.\n\nThis being the case, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of treatment is to be conducted almost entirely in the dietetic way; as the change in the mass of blood, which it is necessary to produce, must be brought about by things that can be received into the stomach by pints or pounds, and not by those which are administered in drops or grains, drams or ounces. For here, as there is no disorder of the nervous system, we have no need of those active drugs which are indispensably necessary in febrile or nervous diseases; the scorbutic diathesis being quite opposite to that which tends to produce a fever or any species of spasmodic disorders; nay Dr Lind says, he has repeatedly found, that even the infection of an hospital fever is long resisted by a scorbutic habit.\n\nIt will now naturally occur to the reader, what those alimentary substances must be which bid the fairest\nfaires to restore the blood to its healthy state; and he needs scarcely to be told, that they are of those kinds which the stomach can bear with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> though taken in large quantities, which abound with jelly or mucilage, and which allow those nutritious parts to be easily developed; for though the viscera in scorbutic patients may be all perfectly sound, yet we cannot expect that either the digestive fluids or organs should possess the same degrees of power, which enable them, during health, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the crude dry farinacea, and the hard salted flesh of animals, into nourishment. We must therefore search for the antiscorbutic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> in the tender sweet flesh of herbivorous animals; in new milk; and in the mucilaginous acid juices of recent vegetables, whether they be fruits, leaves, or roots.\n\nThe sour juices of lemons, oranges, and limes, have been generally held as antiscorbutics in an eminent degree, and their power ascribed to their acid; from an idea that acids of all kinds are the only correctors of putrefaction. But the general current of practical observations shows, and our experiments confirm it, that the virtue of these juices depends on their aerial principle; accordingly, while perfectly recent and in the mucilaginous state, and especially if mixed with wine and sugar, the juices of any one of these fruits will be found a most grateful and powerful antiscorbutic.\n\nDr Lind observing, \"that the lemon juice, when given by itself undiluted, was apt, especially if overdosed, to have too violent an operation, by occasioning pain and sickness at the stomach, and sometimes a vomiting; found it necessary to add to it wine and sugar. A pint of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MADEIRA\">Madeira</a> wine, and two ounces of sugar, were put to four ounces and a half of juice, and this quantity was found sufficient for weak patients to use in 24 hours: such as were very weak sipped a little of this frequently according as their strength would permit; others who were stronger took about two ounces of it every two hours; and when the patients grew still stronger, they were allowed eight ounces of lemon juice in 24 hours.\"\n\nWhile this very pleasant mixture, which is both a cordial and an antiseptic, may be had, it would be needless to think of prescribing any other; but when the fresh juice cannot be procured, we must have recourse to such other things as may be obtained. But the various modes of combining and administering these, so as to render them perfectly agreeable to the stomach, must always be regulated by circumstances, and therefore it will be in vain to lay down particular directions; since all that we have to do is, to fix on such fruits and other fresh vegetables as can be most conveniently had and taken, and contrive to give them in those forms, either alone or boiled up with flesh meat into soups, which will allow the patients to consume the greatest quantities.\n\nThe first promising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> from such a course is usually a gentle diarrhoea; and if, in a few days, the skin becomes soft and moist, it is an infallible sign of recovery; especially if the patient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> strength, and can bear being stirred or carried into the open air without fainting.\n\nBut if the belly should not be loosened by the use of the fresh vegetables, nor the skin become soft and moist, then they must be assisted by stewed prunes, or a decoction of tamarinds with supertartrite of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>, in order to abate the costiveness; and by drinking a little decoction of the woods, and warm bathing, in order to relax the pores of the skin; for nothing contributes more to the recovery of scorbutic patients than moderate sweating.\n\nWith regard to particular symptoms, antiseptic mouth waters, composed of a decoction of cinchona and infusion of roses, with a solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYRRH\">myrrh</a>, must be used occasionally, in order to cleanse the mouth, and give firmness to the spongy gums. Swelled and indurated limbs, and stiffened joints, must be bathed with warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>, and relaxed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> of warm water, repeatedly conveyed to them, and confined to the parts by means of close blankets: ulcers on the legs must never be treated with unctuous applications nor sharp escharotics; but the dressing should consist of lint or soft rags, dipt in a strong decoction of cinchona.\n\nThis disease at no time requires, or indeed bears large evacuations, either by bleeding or purging; and as has been already mentioned, the belly must only be kept open by the fresh vegetables or the mildest laxatives. Be we always to be careful that scorbutic persons, after a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> from greens and fruits, be not permitted to eat voraciously at first, lest they fall into a fatal dysentery.\n\nAll, however, that has now been laid down as necessary towards the cure, supposes the patients to be in situations where they can be plentifully furnished with all the requisites; but unhappily these things are not to be procured at sea, and often deficient in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>: in order therefore, that a remedy for the scurvy might never be wanting, Dr Macbride in the year 1762, first conceived the notion, that the infusion of malt, commonly called wort, might be substituted for the common antiscorbutics; and it was accordingly tried.\n\nMore than three years elapsed before any account arrived of the experiments having been made: at length, ten histories of cases were received, wherein the wort had been tried, with very remarkable success; and this being judged a matter of great importance to the seafaring part of mankind, these were immediately communicated to the public in a pamphlet, under the title of An historical account of a new method of treating the scurvy at sea.\n\nThis was in 1763; but after that time a considerable number of letters and medical journals, sufficient to make up a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, were transmitted to Dr Macbride, particularly by the surgeons of his majesty's ships who had been employed of late years for making discoveries in the southern hemisphere. Certain it is, that in many instances it has succeeded beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>. In others it has fallen short: but whether this was owing to the untoward situation of the patients, or inattention on the part of the persons who were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with the administration of the wort, not preparing it properly, or not giving it in sufficient quantity, or to its own want of power, must be collected from the cases and journals themselves.\n\nDuring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cook's third voyage, the most remarkable, in respect of the healthiness of the crew, that ever was performed, the wort is acknowledged to have been of singular use.\nIn a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> which this very celebrated and successful circumnavigator wrote to Sir John Pringle, he gives an account of the methods pursued for preserving the health of his people; and which were productive of such happy effects, that he performed \"a voyage of three years and 18 days, through all the climates from 52\u00b0 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> to 71\u00b0 south, with the loss of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> only by disease, and who died of a complicated and lingering illness, without any mixture of scurvy. Two others were unfortunately drowned, and one killed by a fall; so that out of the whole number 118 with which he set out from England, he lost only four.\"\n\nHe says, that much was owing to the extraordinary attention of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">admiralty</a>, in causing such articles to be put on board as either by experience or conjecture were judged to tend most to preserve the health of seamen: and with respect to the wort, he expresses himself as follows:\n\n\"We had on board a large quantity of malt, of which was made sweet wort, and given (not only to those men who had manifest symptoms of the scurvy, but to such also as were, from circumstances, judged to be most liable to that disorder) from one or two to three pints in the day to each man, or in such proportion as the surgeon thought necessary, which sometimes amounted to three quarts in the 24 hours: this is without doubt one of the best sea antiscorbutic medicines yet found out; and if given in time, will, with proper attention to other things, I am persuaded, prevent the scurvy from making any great progress for a considerable time: but I am not altogether of opinion that it will cure it, in an advanced state, at sea.\"\n\nOn this last point, however, the captain and his surgeon differ; for this gentleman positively asserts, and his journal (in Dr Macbride's possession) confirms it, that the infusion of malt did effect a cure in a confirmed case, and at sea.\n\nThe malt being thoroughly dried, and packed up in small casks, is carried to sea, where it will keep sound, in every variety of climate, for at least two years: when wanted for use, it is to be ground in a hand mill, and the infusion prepared from day to day, by pouring three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of boiling water on one of the ground malt; the mixture being well mashed, is left to infuse for 10 or 12 hours, and the clear infusion then strained off. The patients are to drink it in such quantities as may be deemed necessary, from one to three quarts in the course of the 24 hours: a panada is also to be made of it, by adding biscuit, and currants or raisins; and this palatable mess is used by way of solid food. This course of diet, like that of the recent vegetables, generally keeps the bowels sufficiently open; but in cases where constiveness nevertheless prevails, gentle laxatives must be interposed from time to time, together with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-DIAPHORETICS\">diaphoretics</a>, and the topical assistants, fomentations and gargles, as in the common way of management.\n\nCaptain Cook was also provided with a large stock of sour kraut; (cabbage leaves cut small, fermented and stopped in the second stage of fermentation, and afterwards preserved by a due quantity of salt). A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of this was served to each man twice a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, while they were at sea. Sour kraut, since the trial made of it on board Captain Cook's ships, has been extensively used by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> in many other situations, where scorbutus has prevailed; and it has been found to be highly serviceable both in preventing and in curing the disease. It was particularly found, during the late American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, to be highly beneficial to the British troops besieged in Boston, who were at that time entirely fed on salt provisions sent from England, and among whom true scorbutus was very fatal till the sour kraut arrived. The scurvy at one period broke out among them with very alarming appearances; but by the seasonable arrival of a quantity of sour kraut, it was effectually overcome. Care, however, must be bestowed, that this article be properly prepared and properly kept. When due attention is paid to these particulars, it may be preserved in good condition for many months; and is considered both by sailors and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> as a very acceptable addition to their salt provisions. But when served out to them in a putrid state, it is not only highly disagreeable to the taste, but probably also pernicious in its effects.","sp":465,"ep":476},{"h":"WHETHER THERE BE ANY OTHER","t":"r there be any other means of radically curving the gout, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> is not able to say. There are histories of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of the gout, in which it is said, that by great emotions of mind, by wounds, and by other accidents, the symptoms have been suddenly relieved, and never again returned; but how far these accidental cures might be imitated by art, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> would succeed in other cases, is at least extremely uncertain.\n\nThe practices proper and necessary in the treatment of the gout, are to be considered under two heads: First, As they are to be employed in the intervals of paroxysms; or, secondly, As during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of these. In the intervals of paroxysms, the indications are, to prevent altogether the return of paroxysms; or at least to render them less frequent and more moderate. During the time of paroxysms, the indications are, to moderate the violence and shorten the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of them as much as can be done with safety.\n\nIt has been already observed, that the gout may be entirely prevented by constant bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, and by a low diet; and Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a> is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that this prevention may take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> even in persons who have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> disposition to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>. Even when the disposition has discovered itself by several paroxysms of inflammatory gout, he is persuaded that labour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> absolutely prevent any returns of it for the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. These, therefore, are the means of answering the first indication to be pursued in the intervals of paroxysms.\n\nExercise in persons exposed to the gout, in Dr Cullen's opinion, operates by answering two purposes: One of these is the strengthening of the tone of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> vessels; and the other, the guarding against a plethoric state. For the former, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> exercise be employed early in life, and before intemperance has weakened the body, a very moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of it will answer the purpose; and, for the latter, if abstinence be at the same time observed, less exercise will be necessary.\n\nWith respect to exercise, this in general is to be observed, that it should never be violent; for if violent, it cannot be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, and must always endanger the bringing on an atony in proportion to the violence of the preceding motions.\n\nIt is also to be observed, that the exercise of gestation, though considerable and constant, will not, if it be entirely without bodily exercise, answer the purpose of preventing the gout. For this end, therefore, the exercise must be in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> that of the body; and must be moderate, but at the same time constant and continued through life.\n\nIn every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> and circumstance of the gout in which the patient retains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, bodily exercise, in the intervals of paroxysms, will be always useful; and in the beginning of the disease, when the disposition to it is not yet strong, exercise may prevent a paroxysm which otherwise would have come on. In more advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the disease, however, when there is some disposition to a paroxysm, much walking will bring it on; either as it weakens the tone of the lower extremities, or as it excites an inflammatory disposition in them; and thus it seems to be that sprains or contusions often bring on a paroxysm of the gout.\n\nAbstinence, the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the regimen for preventing the gout, is of more difficult application. If an abstinence from animal food be entered upon early in life, while the vigour of the system is yet entire, Dr Cullen has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt of its being both safe and effectual; but if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> for this diet shall not have occurred till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> has been broken by intemperance, or by the decline of life, a low diet may then endanger the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> of an atonic state.\n\nFurther, If a low diet be entered upon only in the decline of life, and be at the same time a very great change from the former manner of living, the withdrawing of an accustomed stimulus of the system may readily throw it into an atonic state.\n\nThe safety of an abstemious course will be greater or less according to the management of it. Animal food especially disposes to the plethoric and inflammatory state, and that food is to be therefore especially avoided; but on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, vegetable aliment of the lowest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> is in danger of weakening the system too much by not affording sufficient nourishment, and more particularly of weakening the tone of the stomach by its acescence. It is therefore a diet of a middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> that is to be chosen; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> is precisely of this kind, as containing both animal and vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>.\n\nAs approaching to the nature of milk, and as being a vegetable matter containing the greatest portion of nourishment, the farinaceous seeds are next to be chosen, and are the food most proper to be joined with milk.\n\nWith respect to drink, fermented liquors are useful only when they are joined with animal food, and that by their acescence; and their stimulus is only necessary from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>. When, therefore, animal food is to be avoided, fermented liquors are unnecessary; and by increasing the acescence of vegetables, these liquors may be hurtful. The stimulus of fermented or spirituous liquors is not necessary to the young and vigorous, and when much employed impairs the tone of the system. These liquors, therefore, are to be avoided, excepting as custom and the declining state of the system may have rendered them necessary. For preventing or moderating the regular gout, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> is the only proper drink.\n\nWith respect to an abstemious course, it has been supposed, that an abstinence from animal food and fermented liquors, or the living upon milk and farinacea alone for the space of one year, might be sufficient for a radical cure of the gout: and it is possible that, at a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of life, in certain circumstances of the constitution, such a measure might answer the purpose. But this is very doubtful: and it is more probable, that the abstinence must, in a great measure, be continued, and the milk diet be persisted in, for the remainder of life. It is well known, that several persons who had entered on an abstemious course, and had been thereby delivered from the gout, have, however, upon returning to their former manner of full living, had the disease return upon them with as much violence.\nviolence as before, or in a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and more dangerous form.\n\nIt has been alleged, that, for preventing the return of the gout, blood-letting or scarifications of the feet, frequently repeated, and at stated times, may be practised with advantage; but of this Dr Cullen tells us he has had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>; and the benefit of the practice is not, as far as we know, confirmed by the observation of any other practitioner.","sp":365,"ep":366}]
